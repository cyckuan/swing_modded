GM MALONE CAN PURSUE SOME BIGGER FISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The big names weren't Bobby Bonilla, who the Los
Angeles Dodgers traded to the New York Mets, or Mel Rojas, the
player they got in return.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Dodgers entered the free-agent bidding for Kevin
Brown and Randy Johnson. And they have a good chance to get Mets
switch-hitting catcher Todd Hundley, who also is being pursued by
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   If this all seems a little late in the game, think again.
Despite all the rhetoric surrounding Johnson and Brown since the
World Series, the process has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, said the other day he was
surprised the Dodgers hadn't gotten involved in the negotiations
with his client.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Nero, another Johnson agent, said Wednesday that San Diego
has just entered the bidding. The Padres have made a four-year, $44
million proposal to keep Brown, but that doesn't look like it will
be nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a new voice.
</P>
<P>
   As new Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone was completing the
trade for Bonilla, he made one thing clear to Meister and Brown's
agent, Scott Boras: Don't make any deals before talking to us
first.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, Astros and Texas Rangers also have made offers for
Johnson. Arizona and the New York Yankees are next.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees avoided losing veteran right-hander David Cone to
free agency Wendesday night by extending his contract one year for
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was the guy the Dodgers really wanted. He couldn't command
the long contract or big money that Brown could, which made him
more attractive. His presence and work ethic could have helped get
the young Dodgers starters over the hump without locking up the
club's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's first order of business this winter has been trying to
undo the crush of guaranteed contracts that threaten his ability to
improve the Dodgers. His bosses at Fox want him to build a winner,
but they also want to make money. That means building some
financial flexibility for now and later.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's general managers' meeting in Naples, Fla., Malone
spoke about unloading Gary Sheffield, and there were a couple of
big-market teams willing to take on the five years and $50 million
left on his contract. But believe it or not, Sheffield's contract
won't look so bad in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't get off the hook for Bonilla's $5.9 million
salary in 1999. They inherited Rojas' $4.6 million salary for next
year and threw in cash to complete the deal. But they owe nothing
on Bonilla for 2000. Rojas' contract expires after this season.
</P>
<P>
   During the final weeks of the season, Malone said he did not
want to burden himself with the big contracts Johnson and Brown can
demand. But it became clearer that his pitching staff is starved
for leadership. Chan Ho Park already is very good, but taking the
pressure of being No. 1 is critical. A staff leader would also help
a youngster like Darren Dreifort and a veteran like Dave Mlicki.
Both have not reached their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Malone leaves the GM meetings today and heads across state to
the club's spring-training base in Vero Beach for more
organizational meetings. He returns to Los Angeles on Monday and
will schedule visits for Johnson and Brown. He also will be talking
with the Mets about Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   After signing Piazza, the Mets have to unload him even though he
hit 41 homers _ a record for catchers _ just two years ago. Hundley
is coming off elbow surgery that forced the Mets to get Piazza.
There are questions about his throwing, but there is little doubt
what his left-handed bat could do for the Dodgers lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dodgers already have Gold Glover Charles Johnson.
But Johnson had a poor defensive year and hit only .217 in 102
games with the Dodgers. Johnson also is eligible for salary
arbitration this year and could command $4 million, not much less
than Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot to consider. But that's what winters are for.

MAN SOUGHT AS SLAYING WITNESS HAS NEW JERSEY TIES, EX-BOSS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ James Charles Kopp, the anti-abortion protester
being sought by federal authorities as a material witness in
connection with the sniper killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian in
Buffalo, N.Y., last month, recently lived in New Jersey and worked
for a restaurant delivery service in Hoboken, according to his
former boss.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday night outside the FBI
headquarters in Newark, the special agent in charge, William
Megary, would not confirm any specific sightings of Kopp, saying
only that ``at this point we know there are several links that Kopp
has here in the New Jersey area.'' But Megary also released an
updated physical description of Kopp, apparently based on
interviews with people who had seen Kopp recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new description, Kopp, who appears gaunt and
with a thin beard and mustache in an FBI photograph, may now be 10
to 15 pounds heavier and may be wearing a full beard and glasses,
Megary said. In reference to Kopp's New Jersey connections, Megary
said, ``We are investigating them at this time and are now seeking
the assistance of the public in locating Kopp if he is in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Taddei, the owner of a restaurant delivery service in
Hoboken, has told investigators that Kopp worked for him as a
driver and deliveryman. Taddei contacted news organizations and the
authorities after seeing the television show ``America's Most
Wanted'' and said that he had a job application that listed Kopp's
Social Security number. Taddei said that Kopp had disappeared
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the FBI in Newark, Monica Patton, said earlier
reports that Kopp had been sighted in Essex County and in Red Bank
in Monmouth County were incorrect. Investigators have described
Kopp, whose last known address was in St. Albans, Vt., as an
itinerant anti-abortion protester, who traveled the country to
protest outside abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp has been arrested during protests and charged with offenses
like trespassing and resisting arrest. The authorities have
stressed that he is not a suspect in Slepian's murder but is being
sought on a federal warrant that names him as a material witness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Patton said, ``We have been on the street around the clock
looking for Kopp to question him regarding any information he might
have about the homicide.''

KURT MASUR TAKES 2ND POST, WITH LONDON PHILHARMONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kurt Masur, the music director of the New York
Philharmonic since 1991, will become principal conductor of the
London Philharmonic Orchestra as well, starting in 2000, Masur and
officials of both orchestras said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Masur said the five-year appointment to conduct a limited number
of concerts would not affect his commitment to the New York
Philharmonic, which recently extended his contract to 2002.
``Nothing will be changed in my relationship with the
Philharmonic,'' said Masur, 71, speaking on Wednesday night from
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this orchestra very much,'' he said of the London
ensemble, which has been without a music director since Franz
Welser-Most left in 1995. ``The London orchestras are having their
problems, and I will do everything I can to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the New York Philharmonic said on Wednesday night
that Masur had divulged the news to the orchestra a month ago,
during its tour in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Masur has held down two jobs before, notably when he served as
director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra while at the New York
Philharmonic. But he gave up Leipzig in 1996 after a 26-year
association, and he said on Wednesday that the London position
would not be as demanding.
</P>
<P>
   He is already booked for three concerts with the London
orchestra this season, along with two tours, and five concerts next
season. As principal conductor, he will conduct at least six
concerts in his opening season of 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Philharmonic is in the early stages of a search for
Masur's eventual successor, but Paul Guenther, the board chairman,
said the search was unrelated to the London development. ``It's
good for him and ergo good for us,'' Guenther said. ``There is
nothing behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, friction between Masur and the orchestra's
management broke into the open when members of the executive
committee, instead of routinely extending Masur's contract by
another year, asked him to agree to step down as music director in
2000 and thereafter share the podium with guest conductors until a
successor could take over. Masur, who had been seeking a five-year
contract, summarily rejected the offer. Bruised relations were
patched up with a contract that extended his directorship, at about
$1.3 million a year, until 2002.

MALONE WANTS TO MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Mailman delivered a first-class bombshell
Wednesday: He wants out of Utah. ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, who has played his entire 13-year career for Utah,
proclaimed on his L.A. talk show that he will never wear a Jazz
uniform again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the lockout is over, I will demand a trade. I have played
my last game in Salt Lake City,'' Malone said on XTRA Sports,
AM-1150.
</P>
<P>
   His timing is odd, coming in the midst of the NBA's lockout when
all business is frozen, but Malone's sentiment appears sincere. The
11-time All-Star has feuded with Jazz owner Larry Miller over
salary demands and fumed Wednesday about perceived disrespect from
Miller and the Salt Lake media.
</P>
<P>
   The breaking point apparently came Tuesday, when Salt Lake radio
station KALL dropped the simulcast of Malone's daily talk show.
Malone's agent curiously demanded $1,000 per show _ it had been
simulcast for free _ and the station balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was the last straw,'' Malone said. ``And then I see
all the things that the so-called experts are writing and talking
about me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is the reason I don't want to come back to Utah,''
he said. ``I'm done.... I have played my last basketball game in a
Jazz uniform in Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone also felt snubbed by team owners, who this week tried to
organize a meeting with the players to discuss the lockout but
never called Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't respect me, I don't respect you. The hell with
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which came midway through Malone's show,
sounded spontaneous, catching co-host Vic ``The Brick'' Jacobs off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the season begins, Malone will enter the final year
of a four-year, $20 million contract. Even at $6 million this
season, he'd be underpaid by current standards, and the 35-year-old
Malone wants triple that amount in his next deal.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Malone had been using his two-hour show as a
wide-open forum to promote himself and gain bargaining leverage,
playfully suggesting he'd like to play for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario falls somewhere between laughable and long shot.
The Jazz has indicated it will not trade Malone, preferring to let
him, John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek make one more run at a title
before the latter two retire.
</P>
<P>
   And when Malone becomes a free agent next summer, his agent has
said he'll seek a deal worth $20 million a year. The Lakers can't
afford Malone's demands under current salary-cap rules and
certainly won't be able to under a new labor agreement that's
expected to impose tighter salary restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the frustrated Malone said he might play for less, perhaps
just to prove his point _ ``Everybody say everything Karl Malone do
is for the money. Well, I'll show 'em,'' he said. ``...I'm not in
no drunken stupor, I know what the hell I'm talking about. I'm
gonna go from here and I'm not gonna look back.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the Jazz's all-time leading scorer and rebounder, said
there are three to four teams he would be willing to play for. He
has previously mentioned Seattle, Portland and New York in addition
to the Lakers. In the event of a trade, however, he won't have much
choice _ the NBA does not allow no-trade clauses in player
contracts, contrary to Malone's claim that he has one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's best for Karl Malone to move on,'' Karl Malone
said. ``I think it's best for the Jazz to get something for Karl
Malone (in a trade), if they can, if I'm not too damn old, like
some people say I am.''

TEMPER TANTRUM WOKE UP TROJANS LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive line coach Ed Orgeron said his front
four played its best game of the season against Stanford, and it
just might be due to a badly demolished chair.
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron lost his temper Saturday morning in a pregame meeting,
grabbed a chair and smashed it in front of his players, then kicked
it for good measure. The tirade was unexpected, Orgeron said, but
apparently fired up the line, which recorded four sacks against the
Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't planned at all. It was a spur-of-the-moment
situation,'' Orgeron said. ``There were a couple situations, I
thought we weren't focused enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without injured tackle Marc Matock, USC's defensive line
has played progressively better through the season, and Orgeron
might be the most popular assistant among the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they know everything I'm doing is for them to be
successful,'' Orgeron said. ``We're doing our best (of the year) as
a group.''
</P>
<P>
   So is he planning a repeat performance with the chair?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it got their attention,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Matock, who fractured his ankle against Arizona State, is
expected to return for the Notre Dame game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Video problems: Although USC is off this week, they aren't
able to study UCLA game films as extensively as they would like.
Because the Bruins play Washington on Saturday, USC and UCLA are
prevented from having a full film exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, USC is viewing films of UCLA from common previous
opponents, like Oregon and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   __ A couple of days off: Several players are missing practice
Wednesday and today to concentrate on academics, including wide
receivers R. Jay Soward and Mike Bastianelli, free safety Darnell
Lacy and defensive lineman Jason Steen.
</P>
<P>
   Soward cannot practice, anyway, because of his badly sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, we just want to calm it down and get him ready,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Butkus announcement: This morning, proprietors of the Butkus
Award will announce their three finalists. The award goes to the
nation's top linebacker. USC junior Chris Claiborne is a strong
candidate to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   __ Southpaw support: Freshman Jason Thomas, who is left-handed,
is emulating Cade McNown this week for the Trojans' scout team. ``I
think that gives us an advantage,'' Hackett said. ``Usually in
practice, you're always facing a right-handed quarterback even when
you're playing against a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   __ Big visit: Long Beach Poly wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who
recently committed to the Trojans, stopped by practice Wednesday
with Poly cornerback Darrell Rideaux, who is also high on USC's
wish list.

WOMEN OF TROY ADVANCE TO SECOND ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Courtney Barham scored a pair of goals, the winner
coming 21 minutes into overtime, as USC's women's soccer team
overcame Washington 2-1 Wednesday afternoon in a Division I
first-round match at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Women of Troy (14-6-1) made their NCAA Tournament debut and
have won eight in a row since falling to the Huskies 3-2 on Oct. 11
in Seattle. They next play Sunday at San Diego State in a
second-round matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Barham, who has scored two goals in three of the last four
games, scored the winning goal in the 111th minute, beating
Washington goalkeeper Gretchen Mensinger to the near post after
Megan Orach stripped the ball from Stacy Merlitti about 35 yards
from the net. Orach found Barham alone on the right, just outside
the box, leaving her one on one with Mensinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was really on today,'' said Barham, USC's career
scoring leader with 39 goals. ``I told the bench, `I feel I've got
another one in me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She got her first in the 28th minute when she battled two
defenders for a cross from Isabelle Harvey, then picked herself up
off the ground to poke the ball into the net. The Huskies (10-9-1)
evened things in the 70th, Merlitti volleying home a Caroline Putz
corner kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies got a tremendous game from Merlinger, who faced 24
shots and 18 corner kicks but not many breaks. They thought they
had a second goal, an Anna Biddle header off a Putz corner kick two
minutes after Merlitti's goal. Biddle claimed the ball clearly
crossed into the goal, but USC goalkeeper Karin Puccinelli said she
made the stop and referee Barry Jamison agreed.
</P>
<P>
   USC's speed and depth caused Washington trouble, and its defense
_ led by Meghan Reppe and midfielder Katie Ticehurst _ allowed only
10 shots despite enduring heavy pressure in the second half and at
times in the 30-minute overtime period.

IT'S TIME FOR GOLF'S ANNUAL MONEY GRAB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf's postseason is not about tournament titles, winning or
prestige. It is all about money.
</P>
<P>
   This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially for players
invited to these events and the charities that benefit from them.
The danger is overexposing a sport that is now televised 12 months
a year. But golf is run by the players, and they would be crazy to
put this cash cow out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Getting invited to participate in one of these postseason
shindigs could pay for the kids' college education, fund their
retirement or put another wing on the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Seven events _ including this week's Shark Shootout at Sherwood
Country Club, which ranks as one of the poshest places on the
planet _ make up the unofficial after-the-regular-season schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Total unofficial prize money tops $6 million and change. But it
spends just like the $95.8 million in official money that was up
for grabs this year and is still a royal sum once you crunch the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that 24 golfers are playing for $1.3 million this week
and four of the luckier ones on tour _ Greg Norman, Mark O'Meara,
Fred Couples and Tom Lehman _ will be playing for $1 million in the
Skins Game on Thanksgiving weekend, the father of all postseason
golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Both Norman and Lehman had their seasons cut short by shoulder
problems, so they have a chance to make up some lost financial
ground.
</P>
<P>
   For Lehman, these kind of events can be his own personal
laboratory in which he can test modifications to his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think winning is definitely important, but (these events)
also provide you with the opportunity to try some new things in
competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This could be equipment, swing keys or a rebuilt game. Lehman
hopes to use the Skins Game to refine a putting stroke that
vanished this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the worst putting year of my career by far,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he will pretty much limit his postseason to the Skins Game,
in deference to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to give it plenty of time to rest. I played four
weeks at the end of the year and by the fourth week I felt like a
pitcher who was throwing too many pitches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Casey Martin and his golf cart won't be a fixture on
the PGA Tour next year. He's failed to earn playing privileges for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Martin finished 37th in a qualifying tournament at Bayonet Golf
Course in Seaside and only the top 23 advanced to the tour's final
round next week in Palm Springs. Martin was exempt from the first
round of qualifying school because he won the Nike Tour's Lakeland
Open in January. He was 29th on the Nike Tour money list with
$81,937 in earnings. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reports that a joke this week by Earl Woods
fell as flat as the Republican Party. It happened Monday night at
the Nation's Capital Distinguished Speakers Series, which featured
Woods, his son Tiger and Mark McCormack, head of the International
Management Group agency that represents Woods.
</P>
<P>
   McCormack pitched questions to the former Masters champion and
his father for about 45 minutes. He also read a few written
questions from the audience, one about the elder Woods taste in
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What book, other than your own book . . . has most inspired
you?'' McCormack asked, reading from one card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mein Kampf,'' Earl Woods replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``In what way?'' McCormack asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding,'' Woods said, as many in the audience laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods later said he was just joking and apologized to anyone who
thought it was in bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   It was, Earl.

L.A. LIKELY TO BE NAMED TO DNC SHORT-LIST
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Officials promoting Los Angeles as the site of the
Democratic National Convention in 2000 expressed strong confidence
Wednesday that the city will be one of the finalists on a list to
be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles probably will be one of three cities on the
short-list with Denver and Boston chosen by the Selection Committee
of the Democratic National Committee, officials predicted on the
eve of the panel's key decision-making meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the `finalist' list of cities,'' predicted Lucy
McCoy, a member of a Los Angeles group bidding to host the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of (last week's) election _ the taking
back of the statehouse after 16 years of Republican rule _ and the
pullout by Philadelphia'' after that city was selected recently to
host the Republican Convention in 2000, McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokesman Tony Wyche said the
committee will meet today and probably reduce a list of six
competing cities down to three finalists before a decision on the
host is made later this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely have a strong proposal,'' Wyche said of Los
Angeles, but he said he did not know who the committee will select
as finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was viewed as a strong contender until it was
selected Nov. 5 to host the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wardlaw, co-chairman of the Los Angeles bid group, said he
is ``very confident'' Los Angeles will be named today as a
finalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we keep hearing is: From the beginning of the process Los
Angeles and Philadelphia were in strong positions for the
convention for different reasons,'' Wardlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now that Philadelphia is off the table, I think that
leaves Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said there is a remote chance that Los Angeles will be
named the lone finalist today, but that is unlikely because it
would weaken the DNC's negotiating position for a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, according to those sources, the short-list could also
include Denver and Boston, which are said to be still in the
running: Denver because DNC co-chairman Roy Romer is governor of
Colorado, and Boston because DNC co-chairman Steve Grossman is from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Los Angeles' bid are touting the strong showing of
Democrats in the Nov. 3 state election in California, as well as
the state's political clout stemming from its 54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   The last Democratic convention hosted by the city was in 1960,
when the party nominated John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles civic leaders organized a $27 million private effort
to win the convention, which is expected to bring 30,000 visitors
and $137 million to the host city.
</P>
<P>
   When the site committee visited earlier this year, they were
lavished with attention by the Los Angeles host committee chaired
by businessman Eli Broad, with help from David Geffen of DreamWorks
SKG and others.

MEYERS ALWAYS ON GUARD FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Meyers isn't reading newspapers these days. Or listening to
talk radio shows. Or even turning on TV sports center shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cade McNown's top bodyguard admits he's become upset by all the
negative words circulating about the UCLA Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear it's us against the world I think everybody outside
Westwood is rooting for UCLA to lose,'' says the Bruins' starting
right guard. ``Everybody seems to be putting us down since we've
had close games against Stanford and Oregon State. No one takes
into account that those teams were better than their records
showed, and that they played very well against us. The bottom line
is that we won the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we've made some terrible mistakes we shouldn't have
made. We've put ourselves in some bad situations. But the Pac-10 is
a tough conference. There are no stiff teams like you find in so
many of the other conferences around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always found our non-conference games to be so much
easier than the conference games. We beat Texas all over the field,
and then Texas goes into Nebraska and beats the Cornhuskers.
Everybody says there's something wrong with us. And maybe there is.
But I'll take 8-0 anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers is not only the liveliest quote on the Bruins, but
he also might be the roughest, toughest, meanest, hungriest and
funniest player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy is the guy I'd want with me in a foxhole during war,''
says Cade McNown. ``He's a guy who plays hard all the time no
matter what the circumstances are. He's the most competitive
lineman on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been three certainties about these unbeaten Bruins
this season (1) they will force their fans into various states of
numbing anxiety before emerging victorious; (2) Cade McNown will
rescue his team from certain doom with his stellar Heisman
Trophy-like heroics; and (3) Andy Meyers will be assessed a 15-yard
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The hulking, red-haired, 6-foot-6, 312-pound Meyers has been
leveled with seven such infractions including three in the Cal game
but he insists he's not a budding Conrad Dobler who's a perpetrator
of dirty tricks on a football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a guy who's overly aggressive on occasion,''
maintains Meyers. ``If a guy's standing by a pile, I'll hit him. I
guess sometimes I do it a little late. But there isn't any
malicious intent on my part. I'm not a great athlete. Heck, I run
about a 5.4 40. I'm a guy that just has to work extra hard all the
time. But, remember, I haven't had a holding penalty in three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers is also the leader of what some gridiron scientists
feel is the most formidable offensive line in amateur football.
</P>
<P>
   He, right tackle Brian Polak, center Shawn Stuart, left guard
Oscar Cabrera and left tackle Kris Farris have been responsible for
giving McNown ample time to pass and for opening all of those
gaping holes for DeShaun Foster, Keith Brown and Jermaine Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think Andrew Paul Meyers is your typical
convention-defying, anti-academic, low-brow college jock, forget
it.
</P>
<P>
   He's a religious fellow who doesn't drink anything more potent
than a Diet Coke. He has maintained a 3.4 GPA in political science.
And he likes nothing better than to engage in classroom debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of a conservative on a liberal campus,'' he says. ``I
find debates to be enlightening. I enjoy persuading people to come
over to my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers is an open, engaging person who, as a youngster
growing up in La Mirada, was known as Bones because he was actually
skinny.
</P>
<P>
   He also got into fights with some classmates over the surname he
was then using.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last name of my dad, who's Lebanese, is Abdul-Wahab,''
relates Meyers. ``You could just imagine how much teasing I
received for being named Andy Abdul-Wahab. And when I was, I fought
back with my fists.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing football his freshman year without distinction at
La Mirada High when he started putting on weight from eating as
many as 32 tacos at one sitting, Meyers moved with his stepfather
and mother to Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, he would become one of the most heavily
recruited offensive linemen in the country after starring in Coach
Dick Bruich's program at Fontana High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one of the recruiting trips I took was back to
Notre Dame,'' he says. When I was back there, it snowed and that
really turned me off. So did South Bend. There was nothing to do
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers originally was set to enroll at USC. But when the
offensive line coach who had been recruiting him, Bob Palcic, wound
up at UCLA, so did Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best move I ever made,'' says Meyers. ``I've shown you don't
have to go to Lincoln, Nebraska to play for a team challenging for
the national championship. You can play right here in Westwood, and
enjoy the great sunshine and meet famous people and go to a great
college. I wouldn't trade the experience I've had at UCLA for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Meyers' closest friends on the team is Cade McNown, and
Meyers waxes poetic when discussing the UCLA quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a privilege to block for a player like Cade,'' says
Meyers. ``What you love so much about Cade is his toughness and
courage. The guy always comes through when we need him most. And
he's also a good guy. He hasn't let all this publicity he's
received go to his head. He's basically the same genuine guy he was
when he came to UCLA four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Meyers, 23, says he's changed during his stay at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those days of me going down to In 'N' Out and eating four
double cheese burgers with several orders of French fries and a
milkshake are over with,'' he laughs. ``I still like to eat, but
not quite that much. All I'm thinking about right now is
Washington. If we beat the Huskies, we've cinched a Rose Bowl berth
and we'll still be in the Fiesta Bowl chase. Our goal at UCLA is to
do undefeated. And so far, despite what people are saying, our goal
is within reach.''

DECISION BY LEWIS ADDS KAREEM'S TO USC CROP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Long Beach Poly High's Kareem Kelly would
have loved to keep catching passes from Jackrabbit teammate Chris
Lewis. But only under one condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chris had committed to Cal, I would have followed and did
the same thing,'' said Kelly, a lightning-fast, 6-foot-1,
185-pounder who has 23 catches and nine touchdowns in the balanced
Poly attack this season. ``I like his style of play and I feel that
he could get the ball to me. But with him choosing Stanford, I just
decided on USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, Lewis and Poly teammates Darrell Rideaux, Samie Parker
</P>
<P>
   and Larry Croomvisited Cal together in October. At the time,
they said it would be fun for all of them to attend the same school
and Cal was on each player's list.
</P>
<P>
   But with Lewis headed to Stanford, Kelly will, instead, catch
passes from Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``SC was always No. 1 in my heart,'' said Kelly, whose cousin,
Rashard Cook,is a starting safety for the Trojans. ``When I first
stepped foot on campus, they said I had an opportunity to play as a
freshman. (Cook) broke down the whole scenario to me, the
relationship between the players and coaches. He made it seem like
it was a very good school in that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was a sideline visitor to most of the Trojans' home games
this season. After USC's win over Washington, Trojan offensive
coordinator Hue Jackson
</P>
<P>
   had his arm draped around Kelly as the pair left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Football won't be his only sport. Kelly is one of the nation's
top prep sprinters and defending state champion in the 200 meters.
He looks forward to teaming with freshmen Miguel Fletcherand Sultan
McCullough and possibly current teammate Darrell Rideaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get Darrell, we're in the money,'' said Kelly, who still
has some work left to qualify academically.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux, a 5-9, 175-pound cornerback and defending 100-meter
state champion, is leaning toward joining his buddy at USC. He's
also considering several other schools, most notably Cal, Stanford
and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   __ Croom with several views: Croom already has visited Cal and
probably will take a trip to Texas A&AMP;M, Arizona and Nebrask. Also
in the picture for the shifty 5-9, 185-pound running back are UCLA,
Washington and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Poly's Dennis Link, who may be the team's most-overlooked
standout, has a trip planned to Washington and is also considering
UCLA, Arizona State, Wisconsin, Iowa and UNLV. Link is a speedy
6-2, 200-pound linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lewis seeing red: Lewis plans on spending his first year at
Stanford as a redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can come in there and play right away, I'd do it,'' he
said. ``But I know my parents and I would prefer to redshirt, let
Todd Husak
</P>
<P>
   complete his senior year and compete for the starting position
the following year.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Orinda QB has `A' list: Another one of the state's top
quarterbacks Ken Dorsey of Orinda has trimmed his list to five
schools and USC, despite the presence of freshman starter Carson
Palmer. And redshirt Jason Thomas is still involved.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4, 190-pound Dorsey, who plays at Miramonte High, is
considering Tennessee, USC, Miami, Oregon and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   __ Huskies score again: Washington received its third commitment
when quarterback-safety Adam Seery of Albuquerque, N.M., chose the
Huskies. The 6-2, 195-pound Seery, who could end up at receiver,
also was offered a scholarship by New Mexico and received interest
from Colorado and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State received its fourth commitment when defensive end
Dan Rothwell
</P>
<P>
   of Lake Oswego, Ore. made his decision. Rothwell is a 6-7,
220-pound project, who has only played two years of football.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bruins in hunt: UCLA is in the running for T.J. Duckett, a
6-3, 245-pound linebacker, who may be the country's best prep
defensive player. Duckett, a native of Kalamazoo, Mich., and
younger brother of former Michigan State running back Tico Duckett,
has trips planned to Florida State, Ohio State, Michigan State and
Ohio State and is working on a visit to UCLA. Florida State and the
Michigan schools are favored, but you never know.

NO SONICS, SAME OLD MARINERS HARD TO TAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is finally fighting for a labor union close to
his heart _ and his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the Nike factory workers in Southeast Asia _ the
women and children who don't come close to making a living wage
while churning out those Air Jordans.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, he's not fighting that fight. Instead, the only player in
the history of the world to make $30 million for one season of
basketball has taken a prime role in the war between his union
brethern and the NBA owners.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing $2 billion sure is hard.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is a test beyond endurance to be an NBA fan. At
least that is the word from my Queen Anne dogwalking friend, Adam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going back,'' said Adam, an attorney and new father
who has all but renounced his Sonic tickets in the wake of this NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huskies, Reign, the ballet,'' Adam said, listing his new
allegiances. ``Those Sonic games are ridiculous anyway. All that
music. All that noise. Squatch flying around on rappel ropes. It's
entertainment, not basketball, but I guess that's how they try and
justify the price of tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm, I say. A turned-off fan. An enlightened human reaction to
a professional sports league that can't find a way to split the
pots of gold, the spoils, the booty.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar. Sounds like baseball after the strike of '94.
</P>
<P>
   The fans went on strike. A lot of them, anyway. Sick of the
dollars that don't make sense. Sick of union chief Donald Fehr and
commissioner Bud Selig making a mess of things. So attendance
sagged. TV ratings drooped.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, everyone is saying baseball is back. Baseball
has made amends. Fans feel better, thanks to Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGwire and Cal Ripken and those '98 Yankees who were so good a
case was made for their place in history. It was a great summer,
wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   But now we have to stop and think. For all the health and good
tidings of '98, what is happening now?
</P>
<P>
   The postseason baseball reports are that the rich teams were
winners and the poor ones losers. Only two major league teams with
payrolls of more than $48 million (the Orioles, at a whopping $74
million, and the Mariners, at $53 million) had losing records. Only
one team (Blue Jays) was a winner with a payroll of less than $47
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant,'' Selig said this week. ``I've been spending
a lot of time thinking about it, talking about it. I'll have some
things to say in the coming weeks and months.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I can hardly wait for these words of wisdom, can you?
</P>
<P>
   What's the commissioner going to say that isn't already obvious?
That you can't compete for a World Series unless you increase
payroll by $10 million every season?
</P>
<P>
   This week, the new market for baseball free agency has a
sweepstakes atmosphere. Even Mo Vaughn got sticker shock when the
Angels offered him a king's ransom to come to Anaheim. The Red Sox
slugger can not believe what teams are throwing his way.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Mike Piazza, baseball's $91 million man _ the same guy
who was ridiculed for turning down the Dodgers' offer of $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Randy Johnson, who all but quit on the Mariners in the
first half of '98 but who is now entertaining slobbering suitors at
his new Arizona mansion. The Rangers, Astros, Dodgers, Padres and
Diamondbacks have all come calling on the soon-to-be even Bigger,
Richer Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for Johnson has started at a cool $12 million a year for
four years, so there is no longer need to wonder why the Mariners
could not or would not make a deal with the best pitcher they ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   The M's are holding the line on their $53 million budget. Team
president Chuck Armstrong and vice president of baseball operations
Woody Woodward are adamant: Just because every other owner is
stupid enough to overspend for talent, why should we?
</P>
<P>
   Are they wrong? You can't defend the bad trades or the past
short-sighted dealings with free agents that have left this Mariner
team with more holes and rust than the old ferryboat, Kalakala.
</P>
<P>
   The M's need a backup catcher? What was Jason Varitek?
</P>
<P>
   The M's need a left fielder with speed? What was Jose Cruz Jr.?
</P>
<P>
   The M's need a set-up man? Who was Jeff Nelson?
</P>
<P>
   The M's need a proven closer? What was Mike Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   The M's need another veteran starter? What was Tim Belcher?
</P>
<P>
   All that said, there is no reason to expect the nameless,
faceless Mariner owners to open the Nintendo and Microsoft vaults,
just so Chuck and Woody can go nuts like the rest of these baseball
general managers who are, once again, driving up the cost of
fielding a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you think $13 million for Piazza is a lot of dough,
how will you feel when Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez are ready
to break the Mariner bank, or Mariner fans' hearts?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the M's can find a way to pay them the Jordanesque
salaries they will likely command. Now that will be a great day for
Seattle sports fans.

 ARM IN ARM: HUARD, McNOWN PUTTING BOW ON INTERWINED CAREERS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So you wonder how they recruit? You wonder what it's
like in big-time college football when the coaches swoop in and put
the sweet talk to an 18-year-old kid?
</P>
<P>
   It's late December, 1994. Two well-dressed men arrive at Sea-Tac
International Airport from Los Angeles, intent on wowing Brock
Huard, a high school All-American from Puyallup.
</P>
<P>
   They rent a car. Bob Toledo, UCLA offensive coordinator, is
driving. Terry Donahue, UCLA head coach, rides shotgun. Donahue,
navigating, has the instructions to the Huard home in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the band of freeways moments from the airport, Donahue
suddenly tells Toledo to turn right.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a white, painted area,'' Toledo says. ``I didn't
realize it was a curb.''
</P>
<P>
   The car lurched sideways, almost hitting a retaining wall, and
both left tires were blown. Now it gets goofy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a McDonald's there,'' says Toledo, now the Bruins'
head coach. ``Terry says, `I'm hungry, let's go get a
McDonald's.'''
</P>
<P>
   Great, Toledo thinks. Their ride to fetch them one of the
nation's top quarterbacks is out of commission, and the head coach
wants a Quarterpounder.
</P>
<P>
   They call the Huard family and say they'll will be a few minutes
late. After lunch, they return for another car and show up in
Puyallup, Donahue the syrupy veteran, Toledo the jumpy lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife got him a couple of Advil,'' says Mike Huard, Brock's
father. ``He had a headache. He said, `I'm kind of nervous. I
almost killed the head coach.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be accurate to say the blown tires killed UCLA's
chance of landing Huard. He already had a strong inclination to the
University of Washington, where his brother Damon became the school
career passing leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a little Christmas tree with Husky helmets on it,''
Toledo says. ``So I knew we were in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In trouble, perhaps, but not out in the cold. Some 170 miles to
the south, the quarterback at West Linn, Ore., was telling Toledo
and Donahue that Washington and UCLA were his top two choices as
well. And Cade McNown was content to say that he would be happy
with whichever school Huard didn't choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out great,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Husky Stadium, circumstance will have flown a
complete orbit around Huard and McNown. It will be the last
appearance here for McNown _ who, unlike Huard, never redshirted _
and it very likely will be the last game by a Huard here as well.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Huard is waiting until season's end to declare his
intention regarding a year's early entry into the NFL draft, but
his dad doesn't sound like somebody expecting to see his son play
another year of college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been seven long years (including Damon's UW career), but
it goes by pretty quickly,'' Mike Huard said. ``There have been
good times and tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown arrives as the leader of an unbeaten team pointed toward
a national championship. Huard is a co-captain of a 5-4 club trying
to avoid a losing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in adversity when your true mettle is tested,'' Brock
Huard says. ``That's Biblical. And for me, that's reality right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this: Ecclesiastes 3:1 _ ``For everything there is a
season and a time for every matter under heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first two years at UCLA, McNown was nothing more than
mediocre. He threw for 19 touchdowns. He was intercepted 24 times.
He and Huard _ friends since a weekend Athletes in Action getaway
in Santa Barbara in 1996 _ had occasion to chat once after McNown's
sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, behind the bull rushes of Corey Dillon, had gone
9-2 and Huard threw when Washington wanted, not when he had to.
McNown's team went 5-6, including a 41-21 pounding by the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can vividly remember him complaining about the
play-calling,'' Huard said. ```You have Corey Dillon to run the
ball. All you (have to) do is play-action pass.' Not whining, by
any means, but being competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown's first year at UCLA was Donahue's last. Donahue saddled
Toledo with the same offense run by the departing coordinator,
Homer Smith. Not only did Toledo have to learn it, so did McNown,
as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Then Toledo took over and installed his own system. McNown
relearned. Finally comfortable in '97, McNown took it and ran.
Going 18-2 since then, the 18 wins an ongoing streak, McNown has a
touchdown-to-interception ratio of 41-14 in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Staggered by a succession of upset-intent Pac-10 teams, McNown
has seemingly willed the Bruins to win. He passed for 395 yards in
an overtime victory over Oregon, brought them from 10 points behind
against Stanford, threw for 377 more yards at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, meanwhile, is at the controls of an engine in need of a
valve job. ``This is the fun part of playing the quarterback
position,'' he says stoically. ``This is the time for me to accept
responsibility for what's going on. I know I've got to throw the
perfect pass. I'm not going to put pressure on myself but I know
I've got to continue to do more than I've done the last couple of
years here.''
</P>
<P>
   With 238 yards, Huard can overtake his brother and become the UW
career passing leader in what is probably his last time down the
Husky tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully,'' he says of the record, ``I haven't even looked
at that.''
</P>
<P>
   If McNown and Huard have known the warm side of college
football, the camaraderie and the insularity, they have also seen
the darker aspect _ the side that is quick to judge, to boo Damon
Huard, to wonder whether the Huskies would be better off with
Marques Tuiasosopo at quarterback, to cause the UCLA student
newspaper to run a headline: ``McNone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's outside stuff that isn't fun to deal with,'' McNown
concedes. ``But that hasn't taken away at all. What do I think of
outside talk? Not much. I don't take any of it to heart, whether
it's good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   All this happens as McNown still has at least a shot at the
Heisman Trophy. Asked if he can make a case for himself, he says
flatly, ``I don't have to. I'm not trying to sway voters. It's not
a courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't be the last time McNown and Huard meet. Both will
make money throwing footballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mixed,'' says Mel Kiper Jr., the NFL draft guru, of
opinion on McNown. ``Some people like him because he's a leader.
Others question his arm strength. He probably ends up around the
third or fourth round.''
</P>
<P>
   Responds Toledo, who coached future NFL quarterbacks as an
assistant at Oregon, ``His arm's a lot stronger than Bill
Musgrave's. And it's every bit as strong, if not stronger, than
Chris Miller's.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard? Kiper says his stock has stayed ``about the same'' after
he returned for his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't gotten help from the receivers and the running game
has been non-existent,'' Kiper says. ``It's not his fault. He can
throw all the passes you need to throw. He's probably second round,
but he's got a chance to be in the first.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a perfect Saturday if both McNown and Huard could
walk away happy, but they know it doesn't work that way. Except,
that is, for that day four years ago that Huard mapped the futures
of two programs, and both came up winners.

SEAHAWKS HOPE PRACTICE MAKES OFFENSE PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ In a passing drill early in practice, not one
receiver dropped a pass. In the course of Wednesday's two-hour
workout, not one offensive lineman was guilty of a false start.
</P>
<P>
   It was only one practice. But the Seahawks viewed this
mistake-free session as a large step in the right direction toward
solving their season-long offensive problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with what we saw out there today. I really do
see things coming together,'' offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski
said. ``But I'm still not even close to being pleased with it.''
</P>
<P>
   These are drastic, and trying, times for an offense that ranked
third overall and had the NFL's top-rated passing game last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games into this season, the Seahawks are trying anything to
correct the quandary that has led to more offensive penalties (40)
than big plays (only eight runs and pass plays of 25 yards or
more); more dropped passes (17) than touchdown passes (10); and
more turnovers (18) than offensive touchdowns (16).
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for the first time this season, the entire offense
reviewed video of Sunday's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. On
Wednesday, Warren Moon took the plays in practice from quarterbacks
coach Rich Olson through the communication system in his helmet
that is used during games, and then relayed them to the other
players in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Like Olson, the other assistants kept their distance from the
huddle and did their coaching between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more like a game-type atmosphere,'' Moon said. ``I
think our practice was more fluid and we got done a lot earlier
because our tempo was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said running back Ricky Watters: ``I really liked practice
today. It was really smooth. Everybody was doing what they have to
do to help the play run successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' offense will be tested against a Raiders defense
that ranks No. 2 in the league in fewest yards allowed per game
(254.8) and No. 1 in fewest yards allowed per play (4.0).
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago at the Kingdome, five turnovers by the Seahawks
helped the Raiders claim a 31-18 victory. It was the most points
allowed by the Seahawks this season and their widest margin of
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   That also was the first full game in which the Seahawks reverted
to the three-receiver sets that were so productive last year. In
the past two weeks, the Seahawks have used three and four receivers
at least 70 percent of the time. They have no plans to alter their
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything I'm hearing, everybody likes to play that
way,'' said Watters, in his first season with the Seahawks. ``I'm
fine with it too. Spread them out so they can't get in those
eight-man fronts (to stop the run).''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Seahawks need to take this practice-field focus and
concentration and parlay it into aggressiveness against the
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we have to do this week, come out and be physical
right away,'' Watters said. ``Let's just come out and do our thing.
That way if you lose, you lose doing what you do best and playing
your heart out.''

BRUINS MASTER OF CLOSE CALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Toledo backed against the wall outside UCLA's
locker room in the bowels of Oregon State's Gill Coliseum. A few
feet away, friends and family celebrated Saturday's wild 41-34
victory in which the Bruins scored 24 points in the final 16
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Toledo about being unbeaten and highly ranked _
about the pressure that accompanies an 11-round single-elimination
tournament. One loss and the Bruins are out of the national title
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be psychologically ready every game,'' Toledo
said. ``You can't slip up. I'll tell you, it's hard on 18-year-old
kids. It wears on you. It wears on a 52-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have made thrilling seem routine in recent weeks,
rallying from second-half deficits four times in five games
(Arizona, Oregon, Stanford, Oregon State) in part because of
opponent mistakes: Oregon tailback Reuben Droughns' fumble,
Stanford receiver Jeff Allen's fumble, and the poor kickoff by
Oregon State's Jose Cortez with 31 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all luck, though. Receivers Danny Farmer and Brad
Melsby, cornerback Marques Anderson, kicker Chris Sailer and
quarterback Cade McNown have made game-winning plays.
</P>
<P>
   After each victory, the Bruins talk in vague terms about making
big plays and ``knowing how to win close games.'' What does it
mean? How does ``knowing'' translate into throwing a 61-yard
last-second touchdown pass or causing a fumble at the 1-yard line?
</P>
<P>
   It's like driving in freeway traffic or taking final exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team gets ahead of us, I put everything together in my
mind,'' defensive end Pete Holland said. ``I think, `The offense is
going to score, then we're going to stop them and score again. I
visualize what we need to do, and with that comes the tendency not
to panic. If you can see it, you don't panic. And you can only see
it if you've done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins aren't unique. Late-game heroics were on the resumes
of the last two Pac-10 champs. In 1996, Arizona State was 3-0 in
games decided by 10 points or less (or overtime) before losing to
Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. Last year, Washington State was 5-0 in
close games until meeting Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think it would wear you out, but it didn't wear us out
and it doesn't seem to be wearing UCLA out,'' Cougars coach Mike
Price said. ``You have a feeling that no matter what, you're going
to find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think like that and the ball pops on the ground in a
key situation, it doesn't surprise you. You're expecting it. You're
expecting to step in and capitalize on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't believe in yourself, then when the ball pops
loose, you aren't ready to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning close games is an acquired trait. At least it has been
for UCLA. In Toledo's first season, 1996, the Bruins bungled
fourth-quarter leads against No. 4 Arizona State (two fumbles) and
Stanford (defensive breakdowns).
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, UCLA has become what ASU was _ good, lucky,
undefeated and possessing an incomparable senior quarterback. Just
as Jake Plummer led ASU to 21 points in the fourth quarter, just as
he caught a tailback option pass and sliced through UCLA's defense
for the go-ahead touchdown, so, too, does McNown beat opponents
with his arms and his legs and any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's apprenticeship was swift. Six weeks after ASU, he
orchestrated the victory that changed it all _ the double-overtime
miracle against USC. McNown completed 16 of 25 passes for 259 yards
in the second half and directed the Bruins, who were trailing 38-21
midway through the fourth quarter, to 17 points in the final six
minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Like chicken pox, the experience of that cool November afternoon
has stayed in UCLA's system and seemingly granted immunity to
fourth-quarter collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've drawn off that game for so much,'' Toledo said. ``Since
that point, the kids have believed in the system and the coaching.
A real trust has built up between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Plummer, McNown is in his fourth season as a starter. He
has failed miserably and faced every situation imaginable. He has
complete command of the system and the huddle. And he has total
confidence in his decision making with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being in that situation,'' he said. ``I'd like to score
28 points or more, but I don't mind being in that situation. We
don't get all tight and that makes us play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Can they keep it up? Who knows? There's no evidence saying they
can't, but with each escape the odds of future survival would seem
to diminish. Eventually, they'll face an opponent that doesn't make
crucial mistakes or give them a chance for heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic formula for what we've done,'' guard Andy
Meyers said. ``But if you work hard and have confidence and don't
panic, it pays off in the end. When Oregon State tied that game
(with 31 seconds left), I looked at the person next to me on the
sidelines and said, `I'll be back in a few seconds. We're about to
score a touchdown.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's as simple as that, and far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this good for the heart? No,'' Holland said. ``But the only
way it can be bad is if it puts a doubt in our mind that maybe we
aren't as good as we think we are. But I don't think that's
happened to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet.

WIDOW WINS BATTLE TO STAY IN AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Burying her slain husband on Valentine's Day 1996
was a terrible moment for Jasmin Salehi.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Immigration and Naturalization Service told her she
was being deported to her homeland of South Korea because her 1995
marriage to Cyrus Salehi, an immigrant from Iran, fell short of the
two-year requirement needed for newly married immigrants to qualify
for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the woman's fight to stay in America ended
triumphantly. U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman presented her a private bill
signed into law Tuesday by President Clinton that will allow
Salehi, 34, to become a permanent U.S. resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's Christmas today,'' said a beaming Salehi of
suburban Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman had to prove Salehi's circumstances were so unusual that
they merited a private bill. She is only the second widow for whom
the INS rule has been waived, the congressman said. The other was
the wife of a U.S. Marine killed in Beirut by a terrorist bomb as
he carried his wife's INS application.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also presented Salehi a U.S. flag that flew over the
Capitol on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' she said, throwing her arms around Sherman and
giving him a giant hug.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of her plight, Sherman carried Salehi's cause to
the halls of Congress. He wrote a private bill that bypassed the
INS rule and set aside a slot for Salehi among the limited number
of residence visas granted yearly to Korean immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said that with 435 members of Congress inundated with
personal requests from constituents, it's almost impossible to pass
such a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The odds) are not calculable,'' he said. ``It's something
that has happened to 10 new Americans this entire year. So the
chances of getting a private bill are about the same as winning the
big prize in the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Salehi gasped as she took the bill in her hands. Seconds later,
she handed it to her friend Ralph Myers, who worked tirelessly
writing letters to lawmakers like Sherman and Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, hoping to resolve Salehi's INS dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   For Myers, celebrating Salehi's triumph on Veterans Day couldn't
have been more fitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those millions of people who have fought and given their
lives so Jasmin could have this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Salehi was shot to death almost three years ago during a
holdup at a Denny's restaurant he managed and co-owned in suburban
Resedea. Two robbers were sentenced to life in prison without
parole in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband's murder totally destroyed my life,'' Salehi said.
``Those murderers got a life sentence, but I got a life sentence
too. I face every day what I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragic loss was visible in her eyes as she shyly retold the
story of how she met Cyrus Salehi, who was working at a Denny's in
Koreatown when he spotted his future wife. Jasmin had come to
America in 1993 to visit her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it, but he was staring at me, and so when we
finished the meal, my sister said, You go pay,'' recalled Salehi.
</P>
<P>
   She giggled, remembering how Cyrus Salehi nudged the cashier
aside as she headed his way. He then proceeded to rattle off a few
Korean words he knew and emphasized the word ``pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to trap me using all the Korean he knew,''
Salehi said. ``He said: I want to communicate with my grandmother.
Can you give me lessons? I said, I'm not living in California, so I
can't give you lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cyrus Salehi was persistent, and after begging her sister
for her number, he wrangled a date and took her to Universal
Studios. The courtship continued even after she returned to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives started with Denny's and ended with Denny's,'' said
Salehi, who still speaks with pride about her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his life he had two or three jobs. He had just bought a
brand-new car for the first time in his life. He was newly married.
It was just the happiest time for him, and then he got killed.''
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, Salehi lost her Sherman Oaks home
because she couldn't afford the mortgage on her salary as a
seamstress. She now lives in a nearby apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Salehi said she will always remember Veterans Day as a second
birthday for the gift of residency she has been given.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything in my life to put back together. I have
to rebuild it,'' she said. ``But Congressman Sherman gave me the
opportunity so I can rebuild it all over again.''

EDITORIAL: ISRAEL'S CONDITIONAL YES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th graf to correct Israeli pullback figure) (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 12: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was no small achievement for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to obtain Israeli Cabinet approval of the Maryland peace
agreement with the Palestinians. But yesterday's decision was
hedged with unnecessary and disruptive conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In nine days of hard bargaining at Wye Mills, Md., last month,
Netanyahu won agreement to all the terms he then considered
necessary to insure that the Palestinians lived up to their
obligations to combat terrorism. Israel got an American-monitored
security plan. It won a hard commitment from the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, to eliminate all references to Israel's
destruction from the Palestinian national charter. Since the peace
conference, Israel has seen Arafat's Palestinian Authority crack
down hard on Hamas terrorism after two abortive attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for internal political reasons, Netanyahu delayed cabinet
ratification of the agreement and then attached a series of
complicating conditions. These include spelling out the internal
procedures the Palestinians must use to revise their charter and a
declaration that Israel will annex parts of the West Bank if the
Palestinians declare an independent state next May. The essential
terms for changing the charter were agreed to by both sides in
Maryland. Any early declaration of independence by Arafat would
clearly rupture the Oslo peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli conditions, including a mischief-inviting commitment
to resubmit each phase of the agreed 13 percent Israeli military
pullback for separate cabinet ratification, may be meant to
reassure Netanyahu's restive right-wing cabinet partners. But they
threaten to undermine substantive understandings with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling is Netanyahu's newly reaffirmed intention to
strengthen Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, along with plans to approve new construction on the disputed
Har Homa project in East Jerusalem. Negotiations with the
Palestinians are now set to enter their delicate final stage, with
the future of Jewish settlements and competing claims in Jerusalem
two of the most sensitive issues. The United States has repeatedly
asked Israel to call a temporary time-out on new settlement
activity as these negotiations move forward. Netanyahu must surely
know that any new push on settlements now could endanger the
revived momentum toward peace that Washington has worked so hard to
achieve over the past 19 months. &QL;

STARS DRAW BLANKS, BOOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The crowd at sold-out Reunion Arena booed the Stars
last night after fans watched a 14-game regular-season home
unbeaten streak end (13-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said the fans had every right.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Coyotes goaltender Jimmy Waite stopped 38 shots and
posted his fourth career shutout in a 2-0 victory against the
Stars. But Hitchcock said his team made it easy on Waite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played well until we got to the gritty areas,''
Hitchcock said. ``Those are the areas where you've got to get the
job done, and we just didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't work hard enough to get in front of Waite and
didn't scrap enough to create good scoring opportunities on second
chances, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of that problem was center Mike Modano, who has
gone nine games without a goal. His longest goal drought last
season was seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``His play has changed. It's not there and he has to work hard
to find it,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's going to have to decide how
far he's going to drive to score. You can't score from the
perimeter, it doesn't work. And that's where he's at, he's on the
perimeter all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano isn't alone in his struggles. Pat Verbeek hasn't scored a
goal in five games. Joe Nieuwendyk is pointless in his past four.
Sergei Zubov has one point in the past six games; Darryl Sydor is
pointless in the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock pointed mostly to the forward lines as the problem,
saying they have lacked a consistent intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's missing up front is shift-in, shift-out passion,''
Hitchcock said. ``We had a lot of people who worked hard. But
players have roles on a team and people have to get the job done,
especially people who have an offensive role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an ongoing problem with our team, and it has to
be corrected,'' Hitchcock added.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of intensity in the crease area resulted in the Stars'
second shutout in the past three games and also technically dropped
them out of first place in the Pacific Division. The victory moved
the Coyotes to 7-2-2 and 16 points. The Stars fall to 7-3-2. By
virtue of the win, Phoenix surpasses Dallas for the highest winning
percentage in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it on a consistent basis, month after month, is the
key,'' Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld said of the fastest start in
franchise history. ``We're thrilled about the start, but it's more
important to finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes won for the first time in their past six visits to
Reunion Arena (1-4-1) and have defeated the Stars and Detroit Red
Wings in the past week. They pushed their league-best unbeaten
streak to seven games (5-0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Waite was sometimes spectacular and probably deserved more
credit than Hitchcock gave him. The Coyotes scored one goal apiece
in the first and second periods on hard-working drives to the net,
and then sat back and pushed the Stars to the perimeter with tough
team defense.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has yielded 16 goals in 11 games. Waite, a backup
goalie, has surrendered two goals in three games while subbing for
Nikolai Khabibulin, who is out with a hand injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had plenty of scoring opportunities, including some
strong second shots, but couldn't seem to get free enough to lift
the puck on the sprawling Waite. Guy Carbonneau probably had the
best chance when he came in on a clean breakaway in the third
period and Waite kicked away a wrist shot with his left leg pad.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock shuffled his lines in the third period, including
reuniting Modano with Brett Hull, but even that didn't work. Hull,
who finished with 17:23 of ice time and fired four shots, will
likely move back to a line with Joe Nieuwendyk for tomorrow's 6:30
p.m. showdown with the Red Wings in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But before then, all of the scoring-line players are expected to
get an earful from Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't score from outside in this league, you have to
penetrate,'' Hitchcock said. ``If your sense of urgency is better
than the defense, then good things happen. If theirs is stronger
than yours, then bad things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Coyotes' urgency was like a sixth sense.

TEXAS TECH STAR NEAR THE END OF THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Tech defensive end Taurus Rucker knows how much Saturday's
game with Texas will mean to his best friend, Montae Reagor, who is
playing the last of many memorable games in Jones Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a big day for Montae,'' said Rucker,
Reagor's roommate and his opposite on the Red Raiders' defensive
line. ``His last game at home, playing against a guy like Ricky
Williams. Two All-Americans going against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's Montae's last stand. And I believe he's going to come
to the table and show he's one of the best defensive ends in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue Reagor's reputation is not already firmly
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montae Reagor may be the best defensive player in country,''
UT coach Mack Brown said. ``You've got to be aware of him. He's an
All-American, no question. Anyone who doesn't vote for him didn't
see him play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lombardi Award semifinalist might not have had a season
loaded with the spectacular plays for which he became known. In his
collegiate debut at Penn State, he caused a backfield fumble that
resulted in an early touchdown. But don't blame Reagor's effort
this season. Blame the opposition, which has consistently thrown
double-team blocks at him and relied on three-step drop passes to
negate his thunderous rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have done a great job of not letting me dominate
games,'' said Reagor, in his typically unassuming manner. ``It's
been kind of frustrating. But I've adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite well, as a matter of fact. Reagor leads the Big 12 with 17
tackles behind the line of scrimmage, adding to his Tech-record 44
career tackles for losses _ 15 more than former All-America
linebacker Zach Thomas. Reagor has maneuvered through traffic to
drop quarterbacks six times this season and become Tech's most
prolific pass rusher with 23.5 career sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever heard of anybody having as many
tackles behind the line of scrimmage,'' Tech head coach Spike Dykes
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Rucker surmised, Reagor has drawn a bead on Saturday's 6 p.m.
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very emotional,'' said Reagor, a Waxahachie
native. ``But I think I'll hold up pretty well. I want to go out
with a bang my last time on that field. And it will be great to go
up against Ricky Williams one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders held Williams _ who is 204 yards shy of becoming
college football's all-time leading rusher _ to only 80 yards on 21
carries last year. And Reagor was big in the fourth quarter as Tech
turned back three UT scoring drives _ forcing a fumble at the Tech
12-yard line the Raiders recovered in a 24-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reagor's community impact has rivaled his on-field impact. He
was a member of the 1997 American Football Coaches Association Good
Works team. A local bank named him one of their community
champions. He's scheduled to graduate in December _ a semester less
than four years _ with a grade-point average above 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of great players around here and a lot of
great people, too,'' Tech defensive end coach Doyle Parker said.
``Montae is a great combination of both. He's been such a positive
role model both in the community and for our younger players as
they have come in year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was the biggest influence on me,'' Reagor said. ``She
instilled in me that education comes first and all the other things
were secondary. Working in the community has been very rewarding. I
love to do that _ talking to kids about setting goals and staying
off drugs and helping people however I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't forget that first game at Happy Valley. But my biggest
thrill playing football has just been being a part of the team,
knowing all the great guys we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be missed very much,'' Rucker said.

PROP. 10's VICTORY PRODUCES NICOTINE RUSH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Backers of Proposition 10, declared victory
Wednesday as tobacconists fumed about the 50-cent-per-pack tax it
triggers _ and some smokers began hoarding cartons before the Jan.
1 price hike.
</P>
<P>
   Neelam Sharma, manager at Cigarettes Cheaper! in suburban
Chatsworth, said two customers came in and placed huge orders
Wednesday morning, planning to stockpile hundreds of cartons before
the law goes into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma said cigarettes get stale after about six months, but one
man said he had a way to prolong the shelf life indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he could freeze them,'' Sharma said. ``He told me, I'm
in the military _ that's what they taught me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoarding is starting to show up in the sales of stores that sell
smokes.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at retail wholesaler Costco said Southern California
stores sold 1 million more packs last week than in a normal week _
after the initial election results showed Prop. 10 winning by about
a 13,000-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did experience an increase of about 12 percent,'' said John
Eagan, a general merchandise manager who oversees 30 Costco stores
in Southern California. ``I can't tell if it was because of
Proposition 10 or not. But in the last six weeks (cigarette) sales
have been pretty flat. It's a nice increase.''
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Ray, a Costco vice president, said he expects sales will
jump even more in late December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that in the last two weeks of December the volume
will pick up,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoker Narine Gabaian, 18, said she used to buy cigarettes by
the pack, but will now buy in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first thing I thought when I heard it passed. I'll
get cartons and stock up,'' Gabaian said. ``I'll hide them in the
bottom of my closet in a shoe box.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Proposition 10 were hoping teen-agers and other
smokers would be moved to quit rather than pay the tax, but Gabaian
is one of many folks who say they will keep puffing away regardless
of a price hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it costs more I'm not going to stop buying
them,'' Gabaian said. ``Something is going to kill me. It might as
well be something I enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   While cigarette buyers walking into Sharma's store seemed aware
of the law, most were resigned to the fact that they would have to
endure yet another price increase. Others planned to cut down, or
circumvent the law altogether.
</P>
<P>
   One 66-year-old Chatsworth woman, who asked to remain nameless,
plans to have her fix illegally transported over state lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have my son send them from Washington,'' she said. ``He
can get them for a lot cheaper on the Indian reservations there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several smokers predicted a wave of cigarette-related crimes _
from an increase in shoplifting to the ``disappearances'' of big
rigs hauling a nicotine cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a big black market,'' said Stuart Randolph of
suburban Reseda, who smokes four packs per day. ``There will be a
lot of hijackings going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeri Sheehan said she is used to inflated prices and doesn't
plan to cut down on her 1{-packs-per-day habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been smoking for 50 years,'' she said. ``I think the
first cigarettes I bought cost 15 cents per pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite smokers' pledges to try to subvert the tax, backers of
Proposition 10, led by actor-director Rob Reiner, called the
victory a two-way win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are announcing victory for the children of
California,'' Reiner told a cheering crowd at the University of
California, Los Angeles, Child Care Services facility. ``It was a
very, very tough fight. We had, unfortunately, a very formidable
foe in the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Proposition 98, the 1988 cigarette tax, helped reduce
smoking in California by one-third and that such reductions will
happen again. In addition, an estimated $750 million in revenues
generated by the new tax will be earmarked for state and county
programs focused on education and supportive services for children
3 and under.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday the initiative's margin of victory had widened from
a low of 17,000 the day after the election to 57,070 among 7.6
million votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   California's 37-cent tax, approved by voters in 1988, places the
state 22nd in the nation for cigarette taxes. Under Proposition 10,
the 50-cent boost to an 87-cent tax will vault California to third
on the list, just behind Alaska and Hawaii at $1 per pack.

DAVIS CLEARED FOR SOME DRILLS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA guard Baron Davis has been cleared for
selected contact drills _ the latest step in his rehabilitation
from knee surgery _ but is not expected to play tonight in the
Bruins' exhibition game against the Taiwan National Team at 7:30
p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Lombardo, who repaired the torn anterior cruciate
ligament in Davis' left knee in April, examined Davis on Wednesday.
Lombardo did not rule Davis out of the season opener Nov. 19
against Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA issued a statement saying Davis had been cleared for
selected drills ``for an unspecified period of time for the
purposes of rehabilitation and conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Dan Gadzuric, the biggest jewel in UCLA's freshman class,
is expected to make his debut tonight. Gadzuric did not play in
Tuesday's 95-89 victory over the California West All-Stars because
of tendinitis in both knees.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard/forward Rico Hines will not play because of a
sprained knee.

WARREN TO RETURN KICKS FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey will take running back
Chris Warren up on his offer to return kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Wednesday that Warren and wide receiver Jeff Ogden
will serve as the deep men on the Cowboys' kickoff return team
against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey didn't say which player would actually replace the
injured Kevin Mathis as the Cowboys' primary returner. However,
it's unlikely that Warren would be used to block.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a nine-year veteran who signed with the Cowboys in the
off-season to back up Emmitt Smith, returned kickoffs the first
three years of his eight seasons in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   With Smith having a good season, Warren hasn't played much and
said last week that he would be willing to return kicks.
Cowboys injury update
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman (sprained and cut right index finger)
had no problems throwing the ball in practice yesterday. Gailey
doesn't anticipate Aikman having any problems against the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Center Clay Shiver (sprained left toe) didn't practice and is
listed as doubtful for the Cardinals game. Shiver, however, said
his foot is better and he is not ruling out playing. Mike Kiselak
will start if Shiver can't go.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Erik Williams, who missed Sunday's game against the
New York Giants game with a sprained left foot, participated in
conditioning work yesterday. Gailey said he thinks Williams will be
able to practice today and play Sunday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton ponders a military strategy
against Iraq, and the Pentagon once more picks its targets and
programs its cruise missiles for an attack, the debate at the White
House is whether to simply punish President Saddam Hussein, or to
try to change his political course by force, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States prepared Wednesday to send enough military
firepower to the Persian Gulf to batter Iraq for weeks. No battle
plans have been selected yet, but nothing short of a sustained
assault involving hundreds, perhaps thousands of bombs and missiles
can break the Iraqi leader's will and stop Baghdad's defiance of
the United Nations and the rebuilding of its arsenals, the
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be required is very substantial bombing, lasting
for weeks,'' said Zalmay Khalizad, a former senior Pentagon and
State Department official. ``But you cannot be certain that even
that will do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have to go get Saddam Hussein to force him to change
his mind,'' he said. ``It will either require a lot of bombing or a
lot more than bombing to coerce him. Without that, we may simply
acquiesce to his possession of these weapons and to his presence
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wants to punish Saddam for defying U.N. weapons
inspectors, that is easy: He can bomb Iraq for days, pounding the
leader's palaces and weapons depots into dust.
</P>
<P>
   But this may not end the threat posed by a ruler who knows how
to build biological and chemical weapons, and has hidden away the
wherewithal to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of Iraq is a very difficult one and it will not be
solved magically by an air campaign,'' said John Deutch, the former
director of Central Intelligence. Bombs alone, he said, cannot
``destroy all the stock of biological or chemical agents or
missiles that Saddam Hussein has,'' or alter the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Washington believes that friendly persuasion will
force Iraq to resume cooperating with the United Nations weapons
inspectors, who for nearly seven years have sought to discover and
destroy Iraq's capacity to make war.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen says the United States may try
``degrading his capability of manufacturing the weapons of mass
destruction'' with cruise missiles and smart bombs. But without
intensive inspections, these capabilities can be rebuilt over time.
And the inspections regime has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, U.S. commanders publicly identified likely
targets of a new attack in response to Iraq's rejection of
inspections. They include the Special Republican Guard, a
26,000-strong military unit that protects the Iraqi leader and his
weaponry, and the suspected weapons sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Forewarned, Iraq has taken measures to safeguard those targets.
So it now appears that nothing short of an attack greater than any
the United States has launched since the Persian Gulf war in 1991
could permanently damage the institutions that shore up Saddam and
shield his secret arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says the crisis will end only if the United Nations ends
the harsh economic sanctions imposed after the gulf war. Those
sanctions contribute to the deaths of up to 7,000 children a month
and are embittering the Iraqi people, according to Denis Halliday,
the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq for 13 months until he
resigned in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing will strengthen the hand of Saddam Hussein by obliging
the Iraqi people, despite the deep reservations they have about
him, to rally around him,'' Halliday said. ``By bombing Iraq again,
the U.S. loses its reputation as a benign superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous American attacks have done little to change Saddam's
behavior or alter the government.
</P>
<P>
   Twice since the gulf war, the United States has launched cruise
missiles at Iraq. These were ``flaccid responses,'' said President
Clinton's first director of central intelligence, R. James Woolsey
Jr., which did not strike at the heart or the head of the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Saddam has doubtless concluded that, almost no
matter what he does, he will only have to endure air strikes for a
limited period of time,'' Woolsey told Congress recently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 the United States hit Iraqi intelligence headquarters
with cruise missiles after accusing Baghdad plotting to kill former
President George Bush. Some missiles went astray, killing eight
civilians, including a baby and an internationally known artist.
The damage to the Iraqi intelligence complex had little permanent
effect on repression that keeps Saddam in power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the United States again hit Iraq with cruise missiles,
attacking targets in the south to punish the Iraqi military for
invading opposition strongholds in the north. The missiles achieved
little of lasting military or political consequence. In fact, in
the judgment of U.S. intelligence officials, the Iraqi leader
emerged stronger politically.
</P>
<P>
   But without a likely successor who might lead Iraq, a U.S.
effort to undermine Saddam could could reap a whirlwind. Gen.
Anthony Zinni of the Marines, commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf, warned Congress last month, ``A weakened, fragmented,
chaotic Iraq _ which could happen if this isn't done carefully _ is
more dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam is now.''

`BUG'S BIG BUZZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``f'' financial news file.) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Early indications have emerged that ``A Bug's
Life'' will soar past rivals and hit a financial home run for
co-producers The Walt Disney Co. and Pixar Animation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which will debut next week at the El Capitan in
Hollywood and then go nationwide Nov. 25, could generate more than
$500 million in profit, analysts say, due to the enormous markets
for ancillary products like stuffed toys and home videos.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz over the film, in which an irrepressible ant named Flik
leads a revolt of his colony against marauding grasshoppers, has
been solid for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek gave ``A Bug's Life'' a spot on this week's cover above
a dour Newt Gingrich, declaring, ```A Bug's Life' should thrive at
the box office simply because it's such great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts forecast ``A Bug's Life'' will come
close to the $192 million domestic gross taken in by ``A Toy
Story'' _ the first Disney-Pixar project _ three years ago.
Analysts calculate that Disney films with strong characters can
generate operating profits that are three to four times beyond the
box office revenues in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reasonable to expect `A Bug's Life' will take in
something in that range of $180 million to $190 million,'' said
Linda Bannister, an industry analyst with Edward Jones in St.
Louis. ``Everyone is aware of it and there's a lot of excitement
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney bought 5.5 percent of Pixar last year and
agreed to share production costs of five movies. Profits from
movies and ancillaries _ TV rights, video and merchandise _ will be
split 50-50 once Disney's marketing and distribution costs are
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Styponias of Prudential Securities has forecast that
``A Bug's Life,'' which carries a budget of $70 million to $85
million, will take in $175 million domestically, but could go as
high as $225 million. ``From what we've seen, the story holds a lot
of interest for a broad audience beyond children,'' she said.
``Everyone already knows about it, given the marketing muscle
behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts persist because of Paramount's Nov. 20 opening of
``Rugrats'' and Universal's Nov. 25 launch of ``Babe 2: A Pig in
the City.'' ``Certainly, it's a much more competitive environment
than in 1995, but that's not to say there isn't room for all
three,'' said Styponias.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the profit picture:
</P>
<P>
   _ The movie likely will generate $200 million or more overseas,
so total grosses will hit $400 million. Half that will be profit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Styponias believes Disney and Pixar will sell 30 million

summer or fall, generating $100 million in profits.

in profit, Styponias estimates.
</P>
<P>
   _ An additional $875 million will come in from retail sales,
according to Styponias. Royalties will run from 10 percent to 15
percent, generating an extra $100 million or so.

   Jim Silver, editor of Toy Book, said retailers have high hopes
for ``A Bug's Life'' merchandise. ``The Disney merchandise is
really cute,'' he said. ``I think it's going to skew young. All
three family movies are looking pretty strong right now and the
`Babe' piggy bank is selling really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting movie grosses is an inexact science: Witness this
summer's predictions that ``Godzilla'' would take in $300 million
domestically when it ended up grossing $135 million.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there are some who say $500 million profit
projections are off-base.
</P>
<P>
   They can paint a worst-case scenario for ``A Bug's Life'' in
which ``Rugrats'' and ``Babe 2'' top expectations and the continued
strong performance of DreamWorks SKG's ``Antz'' _ now at $75
million after six weeks _ holds down ``Bug's' '' business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source Inc., has cited those
reasons in forecasting a domestic take of $110 million for ``A
Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be surprised if it does $175 million, because it would
limit the performance by `Rugrats' and `Babe 2,' '' he said.
``Besides, $110 million is still a pretty solid number.''

   Disney reported Wednesday that it had sold more than $1 million
in advance tickets to showings at the El Capitan, which will
feature a live stage show and interactive games at the theater's

   BURBANK, Calif. _ Early indications have emerged that ``A Bug's
Life'' will soar past rivals and hit a financial home run for
co-producers The Walt Disney Co. and Pixar Animation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which will debut next week at the El Capitan in
Hollywood and then go nationwide Nov. 25, could generate more than
$500 million in profit, analysts say, due to the enormous markets
for ancillary products like stuffed toys and home videos.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz over the film, in which an irrepressible ant named Flik
leads a revolt of his colony against marauding grasshoppers, has
been solid for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek gave ``A Bug's Life'' a spot on this week's cover above
a dour Newt Gingrich, declaring, ```A Bug's Life' should thrive at
the box office simply because it's such great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts forecast ``A Bug's Life'' will come
close to the $192 million domestic gross taken in by ``A Toy
Story'' _ the first Disney-Pixar project _ three years ago.
Analysts calculate that Disney films with strong characters can
generate operating profits that are three to four times beyond the
box office revenues in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reasonable to expect `A Bug's Life' will take in
something in that range of $180 million to $190 million,'' said
Linda Bannister, an industry analyst with Edward Jones in St.
Louis. ``Everyone is aware of it and there's a lot of excitement
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney bought 5.5 percent of Pixar last year and
agreed to share production costs of five movies. Profits from
movies and ancillaries _ TV rights, video and merchandise _ will be
split 50-50 once Disney's marketing and distribution costs are
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Styponias of Prudential Securities has forecast that
``A Bug's Life,'' which carries a budget of $70 million to $85
million, will take in $175 million domestically, but could go as
high as $225 million. ``From what we've seen, the story holds a lot
of interest for a broad audience beyond children,'' she said.
``Everyone already knows about it, given the marketing muscle
behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts persist because of Paramount's Nov. 20 opening of
``Rugrats'' and Universal's Nov. 25 launch of ``Babe 2: A Pig in
the City.'' ``Certainly, it's a much more competitive environment
than in 1995, but that's not to say there isn't room for all
three,'' said Styponias.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the profit picture:
</P>
<P>
   _ The movie likely will generate $200 million or more overseas,
so total grosses will hit $400 million. Half that will be profit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Styponias believes Disney and Pixar will sell 30 million
copies of the home video, which probably will be released next
summer or fall, generating $100 million in profits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay TV, broadcast and cable rights will generate $50 million

AND HERE'S THE PITCH  
 WILLIAMS VISITS D BACKS IN SEARCH FOR NEW HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an accomplished guitar player and follower of the jazz and
blues scene, Bernie Williams has a good ear for music.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly liked the Diamondbacks' tune when he made his
long-awaited visit to Bank One Ballpark on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the sides are able to develop the first few notes into a
full-fledged symphonic piece remains to be seen. But it is becoming
clear that the star center fielder has played his last stanza with
the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who led the American League in batting at .339 and won
a Gold Glove as the Yankees swept through the regular season,
playoffs and World Series, has been frustrated through much of his
career in New York by what he perceives as a lack of respect.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the form of George Steinbrenner's unwillingness to
renew his contract in 1994 and 1995 and other monetary differences
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Bank One Ballpark's massive rotunda,
Williams was asked whether it would be difficult for him to leave
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very tough,'' he said. ``But it's a matter of principle. If
they're (Yankees) not going to show me their commitment, I'm going
to play where I'm wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks want him. Managing General Partner Jerry
Colangelo and Manager Buck Showalter made certain to show that as
they took Williams and agent Scott Boras on a tour.
</P>
<P>
   Some media outlets reported over the weekend and again Tuesday
that Arizona already has made an offer of seven years and $100
million to Williams, 30, but sources close to the situation said no
offer has been made.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Diamondbacks said they encouraged Williams and
Boras to test the waters elsewhere, do some comparison shopping and
find that the best scenario is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to look at all their options,'' said Colangelo, who
also is attempting to lure free-agent left-hander Randy Johnson
into the fold. ``Today, it was, `Here's who we are and what we have
to offer in terms of the city and facilities.' But it is more than
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams: ``I've worked very hard to get to this point and
think I owe it to myself to see what is out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with the way things went today. It's a
great start. I have a good relationship, a prior relationship with
the coaching staff and manager (Showalter and three of his coaches
were in the same capacities in New York). Competitiveness, a
commitment and the respect for the players is important, and it
also seems like a great place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Williams has two World Series championship rings, he is
putting more focus on his long-term security and will not waver
from the seven-year stand, according to Boras.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams does decide to come here, his past relationship with
Showalter is certain to be a major factor. It is because of that
relationship, Boras said, that Williams wanted to come here first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie got a lot of information. The visit was pretty
dynamic,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he enjoyed the banter between Showalter and
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Buck since I was a little kid,'' said Williams, a
native of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Said Showalter: ``We were talking about a $10 fine I gave him.
Now he wants the money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being hired by the Diamondbacks in 1995, Showalter
traveled in early 1996 to the Caribbean World Series in the
Dominican Republic capital of Santo Domingo and made it a point to
visit Williams, who was playing for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what Bernie has accomplished,'' Showalter said.
``He's very deserving of the attention. He's a quality player and a
quality young man. We have respect for each other, but sometimes
that can be overblown. He has a lot of respect for a lot of people
in this game and one of those is Joe Torre (Showalter's managerial
successor with the Yankees).
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is an important decision for him, for his family
situation and for the rest of his baseball career.'' &QL;

SELANNE INJURED IN WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks won the game and some
respect back from their demanding coach, but there was a price to
be paid for Anaheim's 5-4 overtime victory over Carolina before
14,668 on Wednesday at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ducks were rallying, Teemu Selanne was watching in the
trainer's room due to a strained right groin he suffered early in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   While Selanne's condition will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis, Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg obviously felt the Ducks were
on life support as they headed into the third period trailing 3-1,
even though he wouldn't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was said between periods, Hartsburg deadpanned ``not
much.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Rucchin, who deflected a shot by Fredrik Olausson from
the right point inside Carolina goalie Trevor Kidd and the post at
1:04 of overtime, certainly got the message along with the rest of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig really let us have it,'' said the Anaheim center. ``It's
a side of him I hope we don't have to see very often, but he had
every right to let us know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He read us the riot act and it lit a fire under us,'' said
Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ducks played a strong 10 minutes to start the game,
they basically slept through the next 30. They were trailing 3-1
and on the verge of going winless on the four-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne got the Ducks started in the right direction when he
knocked down a Carolina breakout pass with his stick, skated in
alone and snapped a wrist shot into the top right corner at 2:32 of
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Two shifts later he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to the net and heard something pop,'' Selanne said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Ducks, who outshot Carolina 18-5 in the third
period and overtime, still had Kariya on their side and they
stormed after the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim tied the game,3-3, at 14:24 when Jim McKenzie outfought
ex-Duck David Karpa and banged home Antti Aalto's centering pass on
the power play.

</P>
<P>
   But Kariya was not to be denied when he blew around Nelson
Emerson to the right side of the net and shoved his version of a
changeup through Kidd's pads at 18:53. It was his seventh goal of
the season and first in four games.

COYOTES STAY HOT, STUN STARS  
 WAITE'S SHUTOUT GIVES TEAM BEST RECORD IN NHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After Wednesday night's 2-0 shutout of the Dallas
Stars, the Phoenix Coyotes find themselves in territory they have
never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are they tied for the Pacific Division lead with the
Stars at 16 points, but at 7-2-2 they own the best winning
percentage in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The reason why? Center Jeremy Roenick put it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no passengers in this locker room,'' Roenick said.
``Everybody contributes. This was a struggle, but we battled hard
as a team. It wasn't pretty, but they don't ask how you did, just
how many (you win).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten a couple of the top teams, but we still have a
lot to prove. Let's see how we are after 82 games. Maybe in
February, after 60 games, if we're still playing well, then maybe
we'll be able to say we have a chance at winning it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The keys in Wednesday's victory, which ended the Stars unbeated
home record at 6-0-1 and ran the Coyotes unbeaten streak to seven
games, were a super-human effort by goalie Jimmy Waite, a
first-period scramble goal by captain Keith Tkachuk and a classic
goal by defenseman Jyrki Lumme just 22 seconds into the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Waite was superb, stopping all 38 shots that were thrown at him,
including making a classic kick-save three minutes into the third
period on Guy Carbonneau's breakaway shorthanded goal attempt while
protecting his 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's usually reliable Teppo Numminen turned the puck over
to Carbonneau just outside his own blue line and fell in an attempt
to rescue it. It basically left Carbonneau in a penalty shot
situation, and Dallas appeared to lose what steam it had after the
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy was tremendous,'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld said.
``He had upward to 15 very good scoring chances thrown at him, but
he maintained good position and was squared up to all the shots all
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat a team like Dallas, your goalie has to play a great
game. That team has a lot of firepower. But our penalty killers
also did a great job. It wasn't just goaltending; a lot of skaters
did a good job, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Coyotes fifth-ranked penalty killers gave the NHL's
No. 2 power play four opportunities and stymied the Stars on six
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, making his second straight start and upping his record to
2-0-1 this year, lowered his season's goal against average to a
microscopic .65 with his fourth career shutout. He downplayed the
barrage of Dallas shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of shots, but there really weren't that many
tough shots,'' he said. ``My guys did a good job of keeping their
shooters are bad angles and they did a good job of clearing out the
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. I was tired after Tuesday's game (Colorado), but I
feel fine tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes all-for-one attitude has also captured the attention
of Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock, who agreed Waite was the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like we were two years ago,'' he said. ``They've taken
some shots (two first-round playoff ousters in consecutive years),
and now they're responding as a team. Once you start paying the
price and start to win, it becomes fun to pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were outshot, 27-11, after two periods but owned the
lead, as Dallas seemed to grow more and more frustrated as the game
went on.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who has nine points in his past seven games, gave the
Coyotes an improbable 1-0 lead by dribbling the puck past goalie
Eddie Belfour during a furious scrum in front of the goal at 14:15
of the first, following a Roenick shot.
</P>
<P>

UCLA'S MARTIN AN UNKNOWN STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As evening descended in Chetumal, Mexico, so did
the mosquitoes. You could literally hear them coming, a droning,
airborne invasion force that sent the American women basketball
players scrambling for the spray can of ``Off'' they kept beneath
their bench.
</P>
<P>
   But not a single spectator in this coastal community near the
Belize border was driven off. The entertainment was simply too
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Near Toulouse, France, the van full of players would roll into a
village that barely seemed big enough to field a three-on-three
game, but somehow, every last seat in the local gym was filled when
the teams took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And in Natal, Brazil, though the Brazilian team had been
eliminated in the previous round, the cavernous arena was filled,
even for a final that featured the hated Australians against the
even-more-hated Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA's Maylana Martin, this is the stuff of dreams for what
women's basketball could be in this country, and certainly in this
city.
</P>
<P>
   You probably haven't heard of her, or the Bruins women. She's
one of the top collegiate forwards in the country. They're ranked
sixth nationally as they prepare to open their season Saturday at
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a junior from Riverside County, would like to lift the
curtain on UCLA women's basketball; literally _ that big blue one
that hides the retractable bleachers so Pauley Pavilion won't look
so empty when the women play.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Brazil, where she played two summers ago as a
member of the U.S. junior national team, ``it was ridiculous,''
Martin said, her eyes lighting up at the memory. ``They had a
soccer game going on at the same time as one of our basketball
games, and the arena was still full. And it was !ital!huge!off!.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't seats, just concrete (benches). And they would pack
in there. It was the greatest thing. They booed us. Imagine 20,000
people booing you. It just gives you that energy.''
</P>
<P>
   For women's basketball in the U.S., lethargy stands in for
energy for the most part. At one point last February, UCLA had won
seven of its previous eight games en route to an NCAA Tournament
appearance. This created such a groundswell of fan excitement that
770 turned out for a game at Pauley against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At UCLA, my goodness, just going outside is a choice, it's so
pretty,'' said Carol Callan, assistant executive director for USA
Basketball in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``They've always had great
basketball at UCLA, but I think it probably even attracts a
different kind of player, where that (fan adulation) isn't as
important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is certainly that type of player. Resilient. Easygoing.
Unfailingly hopeful about the future of women's basketball here.
</P>
<P>
   She sees increased interest with the advent of pro leagues for
women. She sees vigorous crowds at some programs in the Deep South
and in the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a purist's game,'' Martin said. ``John Wooden said it.
I've heard a lot of other people say it, that if you really want to
watch good BASKETBALL, you watch the better women's teams. If you
want to watch dunks and good athletes and be entertained, then
watch the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're getting more athletic and we're getting more
entertaining.... We're a top-10 team in every poll. A lot of people
might start to realize that and say, `Well, maybe we don't want to
go see that movie tonight. Maybe we'll spend $5 and see a women's
basketball game.' Once they come, I think they'll get to know us
and want to come again.''
</P>
<P>
   They might learn that Martin was named a preseason Naismith
Player of the Year candidate by the Atlanta Tipoff Club, and she is
only the third women's player in UCLA history to top 1,000 points
in scoring in her first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Martin, also considered one of the more tenacious
rebounders in the game, is the cornerstone of a well-stocked Bruins
team that also features point guard Erica Gomez and two other
returning starters from last year's 20-9 team.
</P>
<P>
   If the UCLA continues to be a well-kept secret, it probably
won't have an adverse effect on Martin's play. Nor is it likely to
be a source of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   This is the original trouper, according to those who have worked
with her, someone who will shake off searing back pain and continue
jostling in the low post, as she did through much of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing fazes her,'' said Callan, who was head of delegation
for the U.S. junior national team on its world tour in 1997. The
players encountered Spartan living conditions in Slovakia, hostile
crowds in Brazil, debilitating humidity (and the mosquito
onslaughts) on Mexico's Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time internationally, you have to be a different
breed of player to thrive in that setting,'' Callan said. ``The
thing about Maylana, she is very adventurous. As I understand it,
her family is.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you might say that. Maylana was born in Hawaii while her
father, Lowell, worked as a landscape architect for the Navy. Two
years later, it was on to San Diego. Then, when Maylana was in the
third grade, to Winchester, a community tucked between Perris and
Hemet.
</P>
<P>
   But the construction of their house wasn't finished yet. So for
four months the family lived without creature comforts in a 21-foot
mobile home and a tent trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our relatives thought we were absolutely out of our
minds,'' said Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Offered Mary Martin, Maylana's mother: ``We didn't have
electricity. No (running) water _ just a tank that we got gravity
feed from. Our entertainment was two puppies. We did the pioneer
thing. Life was awful. But you kind of roll with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maylana has learned to sample diverse things in life, and, Mary
said with evident pride, ``She does not whine.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Maylana Martin enthuses. She speaks optimistically
about the prospects for greater support of women's basketball here.
She is particularly encouraged when she is approached after games
by young girls seeking autographs or a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was little,'' Martin says, ``I would joke around and
say I wanted to play professional, and people would say, `Yeah,
you're going to be the first woman in the NBA.' I would laugh it
off. I knew I would go to college and then just have a regular job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, with the women's (pro) leagues, it's neat for me as a
college player, and I think it's great for the young girls. Because
when the boys say, `I'm going to be in the NFL or NBA,' they can
say, `Well, I'm going to be in the WNBA.' It gives them something
to work for and look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps in time, something to come out and watch.

HALE IRWIN LOOKING DOMINANT 
</HEADLINE>
 PGA-IRWIN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, golf fans have cried out for someone who could
succeed Jack Nicklaus as a dominant force in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman and Nick Faldo, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods. None
has measured up yet. Few people ever considered the next dominant
player in golf would show up among the 50-and-over gang.
</P>
<P>
   Then along comes Hale Irwin, who has owned the Senior PGA Tour
the past two seasons, winning 16 tournaments while breaking the
bank in 1997 ($2.5 million) and '98 ($2.85 million). Record sums
that are staggering even by regular tour standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. For the longest time, everyone was caught up in
that `dominant player' thing. I think they were actually worried
that there never was going to be a dominant player again,'' said
Irwin, 53.
</P>
<P>
   He now has 20 senior tour wins, the exact same number it took
him 27 years to accrue on the regular tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys kept coming along, and all proved to be
imposters. Everyone thought Tiger (Woods) was going to dominate,
but he hasn't done that so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm doing it, and it's kind of a strange thing. I find it
curious the way some people are reacting to it.''
</P>
<P>
   There he is on the cover of this week's ``Golf World'' magazine
under the headline ``This Is Getting Old'' after his win last
weekend at the megabucks Senior Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not getting old to me,'' he said good-naturedly,
shaking his head at the headline pun. ``If I keep my game at the
consistent level it's at right now, I'm capable of staying (at the
top). You just never know. There's a real fine line between a 65
and a 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin made his comments on Wednesday while in Goodyear to
announce a second course he is building at Palm Valley. The 18-hole
executive layout _ ``it's a true golf course, just downsized'' _ is
expected to open next December and will include a nine-hole pitch
'n' putt.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Irwin were his daughter, Becky; son-in-law, Tim Meyer;
and son, Steve. All play important roles in Hale Irwin Design,
which recently moved its offices from St. Louis to Gainey Ranch in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally got the whole family down here,'' reported
Irwin, who originally planned to move to Florida six years ago
before the Arizona desert came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said that he and his wife, Sally, still are in their
``guest home'' in Paradise Valley. The rest of the Irwin family
lives in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Murphy has been working on the (main) house, because
it's Murphy's Law all over again,'' said Irwin, who has been
plagued by zoning issues, work stoppages ``and about every other
excuse you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   But the intense Irwin, whose fuse was shorter in his earlier
days, takes it all in stride. Possibly it's the state of mind that
is needed to play the senior tour with such success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it like my golf game,'' Irwin said of the two to
three years of labor that have gone into the house. ``I don't think
about the double bogey I just made, I just keep trying to fill up
the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I guess my priorities flip-flopped when I got
to the senior tour. I realized that I have a great life both
playing and designing, and a great family and crew that allow me to
do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin always has been a tough guy with the ability to charm. His
tenacity came from being an All-Big Eight defensive back at
Colorado, and it stayed with him on the regular tour, where he
ground out three U.S. Open championships, perhaps the most
difficult tournament to win in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the king of the senior hill, and life could not be
better. What has pushed him to the highest level?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the consistency throughout my game,'' said Irwin,
who powered the senior tour team that included Gil Morgan and Larry
Nelson to victory on Monday in the made-for-TV Wendy's Three-Tour
Challenge in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to do well in all of those statistical categories,
sand saves, putting, driving. . . . But I don't look at anything
but the money. That's the important one. `Show me the money!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The big bucks are pouring in from all directions, although he
has yet to retain that coveted $1 million architectural fee that
goes to guys like Nicklaus and Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't got there yet,'' noted Irwin, who has already done
22 courses across the country, and currently has another six
layouts under way, including another project in Arizona _ Prescott
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said the new Palm Valley course, which lies on the west
side of Litchfield Road, is an example of building a course for the
needs of his client, which in this case is SunCor Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play with a lot of amateurs, and a lot of them aren't cut
out for a big championship course,'' he said. ``What I like about
this project is that it's designed for juniors and seniors. A lot
of people will be able to play and enjoy this course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I'm not into the monument thing. I think too many
courses are built to fill an ego. I want to build courses that are
fun to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there ever come a time when golf course architecture takes
the place of playing the game? After all, it's already happened,
more or less, to Nicklaus and Tom Weiskopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' he said. ``But not now. I'd be giving up too
much money.'' &QL;

NEUHEISEL SEEKS HAPPY ENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He struck all the right chords his first two years as a head
coach, including a few on stage with Jimmy Buffett. Boulder was one
big campfire back then, with Rick Neuheisel merrily leading the
sing-a-long.
</P>
<P>
   The second verse was the same as the first, with the former UCLA
quarterback and assistant coach giddily guiding his Colorado teams
down raging rivers and ski trails and up the rungs of the national
football rankings. They climbed to No. 5 in 1995 and finished
eighth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's fun-loving approach was fine as long as the
Buffaloes were flirting with the national title as they did during
those heady back-to-back 10-2 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year the music died. The Buffaloes staggered to a 5-6
finish and their fans took to picking on Neuheisel as though he
were a guitar string. It's a wonder they haven't broken him this
year, the way they keep tightening the screws after each sour note.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes (6-3; 3-3 in the Big 12) won their first five
games but have dropped three of their past four to place their
postseason party in peril. If they don't win at least one of their
final two games _ against Iowa State on Saturday and at Nebraska
(whom they've yet to beat during Neuheisel's reign) on Nov. 27 _
they could get aced out of a bowl berth for a second straight
season.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel would have to have a skin thicker than a buffalo's not
to feel the gathering chill. It's the kind of cold that can seep
into one's soul and settle there. It can turn a heart to stone,
even one as buoyant as his.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel, 37, has managed to keep his sense of humor warm and
dry, as he proved the other day during a telephone interview when
he joked about keeping busy beating back the buzzards.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Neuheisel is a different coach than the one UCLA
athletic officials and alums openly pined for in the days after
Terry Donahue's surprise resignation, before everybody grew sweet
on Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   He is the third-youngest head coach in Division I ranks but is
aging rapidly. Prolonged exposure to losing can do that to a
person. So can scenes like the one Neuheisel endured this past
Saturday as he trudged off the field at Missouri after a 38-14
loss, the Buffaloes' first in Columbia in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, rosy cheeks,'' a Missouri fan yelled out to him. ``Time
to get a new sweater vest!''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, welcome to the wonderful world of coaching, where you're a
Golden Boy one day and a whipping boy the next.
</P>
<P>
   The lofty expectations? The low blows? Neuheisel calls them
``occupational hazards'' and said, ``I've tried my best to deal
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't be human if they didn't hurt. He bears the scars
in a budding paranoia he fights to keep under control. Worry, he
said with a laugh, has usurped Gerald as his middle name. He said
he is constantly having to remind himself ``how silly it all is.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Neuheisel admitted, ``was much less fun than the
first two years.'' But as a learning tool, it was invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season had mercifully ended, Neuheisel asked his
assistants for suggestions on how he could improve his performance.
One thing on which they all agreed was he needed to lose his
preoccupation with happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel was inclined to keep a senior in the starting lineup
even if he were struggling because he didn't want a senior to end
his career on the bench. By giving second and third chances to
first-stringers who weren't carrying their weight, Neuheisel
unwittingly dragged the team down.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't let sentiment cloud his decision-making this season.
He has benched erstwhile starters and challenged them to earn back
their starting jobs. He threatened more lineup changes after the
misery in Missouri, bluntly saying, ``There are players' jobs and
coaches' jobs at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his new resolve, Neuheisel said, ``I can't retard the team's
growth for the sake of an individual. I needed to learn that.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this about Neuheisel: He comes by his fairy-tale endings
honestly. At UCLA he went from being a walk-on quarterback to the
1984 Rose Bowl MVP. He started two games for the San Diego
Chargers, earned his law degree at USC and returned to UCLA to
serve a six-year coaching apprenticeship under Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel could be a partner in a lucrative law firm right now.
But strange as it sounds, he prefers being the one on trial week
after week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been one that has been motivated by big-time
challenges,'' he said. ``There were a lot of people who said I
couldn't (cut it as a player at UCLA) and said they needed to get
somebody else. Just as I'm sure there are a lot of (Colorado) alums
who are thinking the same thing right now. That's OK. Just watch
me.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, only too closely.

STORR'S REHABILITATION IN IHL PUT ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Los Angeles Kings goalie Jamie Storr's
rehabilitation assignment with the Ice Dogs was put on hold after
he felt soreness Wednesday during practice with Long Beach's
International Hockey League team.
</P>
<P>
   Never officially assigned to the Ice Dogs by the Kings, Storr
once again is listed as day to day with the groin strain that has
sidelined him since Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, 22, had a full practice with the Ice Dogs on Tuesday and
had been scheduled to play for Long Beach tonight at home against
the Utah Grizzlies. Now, it is uncertain when he will be able to
play again.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Storr and No. 1 goalie Stephane Fiset, also
sidelined with a groin strain, the Kings are expected to continue
to rely heavily on Manny Legace, who is expected to be in goal
tonight at the Forum against the expansion Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset also is listed as day to day. Originally injured in the
same game as Storr, Fiset hasn't played since suffering a second
groin strain on Oct. 28 in New Jersey in his return from the
initial strain. Fiset flew home to Quebec on Wednesday following a
death in the family.
</P>
<P>
   In other injury news, winger Sandy Moger has been cleared to
practice after being sidelined for a week with a strained back.

AUTRY LOOKS OUTSIDE NFL FOR LEAD ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His name means nothing now. Not like it used to. Not like he
wishes it would when some director is plowing through a cattle
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 1 percent of the actors in the entertainment business
make enough on acting alone,'' Darnell Autry said. ``I want to be
one of that 1 percent. And I'm starting at ground zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry is laughing now, liberated not by failure, but by a simple
realization. That talent is a vehicle, and passion is its wheels.
And without both, you're going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   You probably remember Autry. Standout at Tempe High. Drama major
and catalyst for the wonder years at Northwestern. Running back who
flirted with the Heisman Trophy and carried the longest running
joke in college football all the way to the Rose Bowl. A workhorse
destined for a productive career in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's living in California, chasing the big screen,
networking for his big break. And working security at the House of
Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets,'' he said. ``I've seen the dream in the
NFL, and it wasn't for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Autry's story looks so simple in its essence. A kid who went for
the money, left school early and got stuck with a bad decision. And
there may be truth in that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the pre-draft reports were mixed. His head coach warned
him about the dangers. But after agonizing over the decision, Autry
bolted Northwestern after three remarkable seasons and slipped all
the way to the fourth round. All the way to the 105th pick.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the big contract, the one that guarantees you time
and a lot of carries.
</P>
<P>
   While he got a brief shot with the Chicago Bears, rushing for
more than 300 yards last year, he was waived this season. He was
picked up by the Eagles, but when he couldn't crack the lineup for
the worst squad in football, Autry walked away. Four weeks into the
season. Retired at age 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking that I disliked my status more and more,
that football was my life,'' Autry said. ``I never liked it in high
school. I loved the fact that I played, that it was a good time,
that I was going to college for it. But I never loved the fact that
I could go out and inflict damage on people. And when you get to
the league, where it's a job and they demand so much from you, you
have to love the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's not so much that Autry blew his shot. He simply wasn't
built to succeed. Not in the NFL, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I never remembered in high school saying, `I'm going
to the league. I'm going to make millions. I'm going to the Super
Bowl,' '' Autry said. ``I just knew on Saturday or Friday night, if
I scored more touchdowns than anyone else, we would probably win
the game. And somehow, I would be cool in school. Somehow, I would
have the opportunity to talk to more chicks. That's what I
understood.''
</P>
<P>
   You watch football on Sunday and you see the good stuff. What
you don't see is the gruesome side of the sport, the guys who can
barely make it out of bed on Monday, an occupation that doesn't
bode well for the golden years.

   It's not for everybody. And it wasn't for Darnell Autry. Not
when he didn't get that Sunday payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person that loved the game would be more than happy to go
through what I was going through,'' Autry said. ``Happy to be on
the team. Happy to be on the roster. It wasn't enough for me
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment Autry understood, he was sitting alone in a
Philadelphia hotel room. Back from the airport after the Eagles
were drubbed by the Broncos. Staring at the playbook and another
empty week of practice when it all made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe all of this wouldn't have happened if I loved the
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. And in his role as NFL bit player, he never had a
chance. &QL;

 STATE-CORNERBACKS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two players not shy of the spotlight will find themselves in it
Saturday when Arizona State visits Oregon for a key Pac-10 battle.
</P>
<P>
   ASU cornerbacks Courtney Jackson and J'Juan Cherry have the
unenviable task of shutting down one of the league's most potent
passing attacks. The Ducks rank first in the league in pass
efficiency and total defense and possess one of country's top
quarterbacks, Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has thrown 22 touchdown passes and just seven
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's secondary has been criticized this season for giving up
big plays. The Sun Devils' pass defense ranks seventh in the
Pac-10. For the Sun Devils to win Saturday, which would make them
eligible for a bowl game, Jackson and Cherry will need big efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The two addressed the criticism and shared their thoughts
Wednesday with ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Question: Some have suggested that the defense's struggles
this season have'' ``divided players. Has the group remained
united''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jackson: At one point, it almost came to a mutiny. I can't
trust you. You can't trust me. It was almost a thing of everyone
pointing fingers because people were blowing assignments. It got to
a point where we had to sit down and say, `Everybody concentrate on
their jobs.'
</P>
<P>
   Secondary-wise, we've always been united. There are going to be
times when you're losing that people are going to have
conversations with each other. It happens in any job. Winning cures
a lot of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Question: Here's a question a lot of fans ask: Why don't you
guys turn and'' ``look for the ball when it's coming? Is it that
simple''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cherry: It's because we play a lot of bump and run. If you play
off (the man), you can see your quarterback and you can see your
man and you can see when the ball is thrown.
</P>
<P>
   When you play bump and run and you don't see when the ball's
thrown, the only thing you can key off is the man's eyes and his
hands. If you turn to look for the ball this way (he points), it
could be caught that way. That happened to me in the Washington
game. I hardly turned and looked for the ball, but when I did, I
guessed wrong. My percentage is higher when I don't look.
</P>
<P>
   `` Question: So you're looking at his eyes''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cherry: Yeah, I'm real good with that. I know when the ball is
coming right there. That's why I don't have interceptions. I'd
rather not give up the play than give up the big play or make a bad
guess.
</P>
<P>
   `` Question: There's a perception this season that the secondary
hasn't played'' ``as well as it can. Fair assessment, or is it just
the nature of playing'' ``cornerback''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jackson: I had this roommate who'd watch TV, and he'd say,
``How can that (corner) be so far off a guy?'' I'd tell him, ``Just
because a guy got a pass caught on him doesn't mean he's a terrible
corner.'' It doesn't mean it's OK to get a pass caught on you all
the time, but people don't understand how tough it is until you
actually have done it at a high level. You can guard a guy at the
park. It's not going to be the same as guarding a guy in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   `` Question: Have some of the secondary's problems been tied to
how thin ASU'' ``is in the secondary''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cherry: We're real thin at the DB position now and we're
playing against a lot of passing teams, teams throwing 60, 65 times
a game. They're rotating at least seven, eight receivers. And it's
just me, Courtney, Mitchell (Freedman), Christon (Rance) and Kareem
(Clark). There's five of us. If you run 30 yards on a fade and 30
yards back, running across the field . . ., you're running 100
yards a snap.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jackson: I think I only miss like one or two plays a game. He
takes a lot more breaks than I do.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cherry: I only take two or three!
</P>
<P>
   ``Question: There were comments by players after last year's
Arizona game and'' ``this season's opener against Washington that
the opponent surprised you with'' ``things you guys had never seen
before. Is that a reflection of poor'' ``preparation by the
coaching staff''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jackson: Nah. With Washington, it was the first game, you don't
have anything to watch off them from this year. They had a new
offensive coordinator. They did things our coaching staff hadn't
seen them do in 16 years of coaching against them.
</P>
<P>
   Against the U of A, they just ran a lot of trick plays. Some of
them worked. They weren't better than us. But when you're not
better, they've got to trick you or scheme you, put you in
situations you haven't seen before. It worked for them.
</P>
<P>
   `` Question: So is that a reflection on the coaching
staff''?``''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jackson: I think it's more of the system we have. It's hard to
come in as a freshman and play. And that happened.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no excuse for guys who have been here for a few
years. We're having that problem a little bit where you have guys
who have been here two years that are making mental busts that are
costing us big plays in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington game, we went into halftime with eight new
starters. It's hard to just adjust and say to those guys, `When
this happens, do this.'' We had to play our basic coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Pat Tillman and Damien Richardson and those
guys, we could say, ``OK, in this situation go to the underneath
coverage'' or whatever. It got communicated real easy. With eight
new guys who haven't played much, it's not going to happen.

SWINDELL, COLBRUNN SIGN ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to a Texan to talk about football even when he's
talking about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case on Tuesday when left-handed middle reliever
Greg Swindell outlined his role as one of the newest Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell agreed to a three-year, $5.7 million free-agent deal,
and first baseman Greg Colbrunn agreed to a two-year deal for $1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle relief is one of the unsung roles in baseball, kind of
like the fullback in football,'' Swindell said. ``The NFL finally
put in a spot for the fullback in the Pro Bowl, and a spot for the
middle reliever should be made in the major-league All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, Greg, have anyone in mind?
</P>
<P>
   Swindell is not lacking confidence. He is not lacking ability.
He is not lacking durability.
</P>
<P>
   During a split season with the Minnesota Twins and Boston Red
Sox in 1998, Swindell posted a 5-6 record with a 3.59 ERA. Perhaps
even more noteworthy was that he appeared in 81 games _ half a
season's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to pitch in 100 games. That would be no problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fine with Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can pitch, have a day off, then pitch, pitch again, pitch
again with maybe another day off. That's what you want _ someone
who is reliable and that's what we've got with Greg,'' Garagiola
said.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell was the No. 1 draft pick (second overall) out of the
University of Texas by the Cleveland Indians in 1986 and spent most
of his career as a starter. But at 33 (he turns 34 on Jan. 2), he
has gotten used to the relief role.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're pitching every day, every other day, you feel more
a part of the team. I love being on the mound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in Swindell's desire to join the Diamondbacks was
the fact that in September, he and his family moved to the Valley. &QL; 
Versatile addition &QL; 
Colbrunn also split time between two clubs in 1998 (Colorado and
Atlanta), hitting a combined .307 with three homers and 23 RBIs. He
also had 16 pinch hits.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter sees Colbrunn complementing
Andy Fox as a jack-of-all-trades. Colbrunn can play first, third,
the outfield and likely will be the team's third catcher. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wolcott traded &QL; 
 &QL; 
Right-hander Bob Wolcott, who was acquired from Seattle in the
expansion draft and split time between the Diamondbacks and their
Triple-A affiliate in Tucson, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for
a player to be named. Wolcott was 1-3 for the big club and 8-6 for
Tucson. &QL;

COYOTES NET TOP GOALIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes' goalies Nikolai Khabibulin and Jimmy Waite were in a
most unusual place going into Wednesday night's game with the
Pacific-Division leading Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   They were the NHL's No. 1 goalie tandem with a combined goals
against average of 1.57, ahead of Boston's Byron Dafoe and Robbie
Tallas (1.70), and lowered that figure to 1.43 with Waite's 2-0
shutout of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie coach Benoit Allaire was cognizant of those facts as he
sipped coffee during breakfast Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's nice, very nice,'' Allaire beamed. ``I wish I
could take credit, but the two goalies have more to do with it.
They do the work; stop the puck. I sit with my pen in the press box
and take notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin didn't accompany the team to Dallas and rookie Scott
Langkow was recalled from Las Vegas to serve as Waite's backup
Wednesday. Khabibulin suffered a bone bruise on his stick hand in
Monday's skate. Allaire said he should be ready for Tampa Bay
Saturday in Phoenix. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hull-abaloo &QL; 
 &QL; 
Brett Hull couldn't put himself into more trouble here had he said
Troy Aikman was a bum. Hull, oft-credited for bringing the ``I''
formation to hockey, said after Saturday's game in LA, ``There's no
way Brett Hull can do anything in 11 minutes. There's no flow; no
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, the unpardonable hockey sin: Complaining about ice time
after a 4-3 win! He has drawn considerable media scorn, plus a
rebuke from Stars Coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a family. If we squabble, it's behind closed doors. We
don't air laundry in in public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who's averaging a little more than 17 minutes a game and
is third on the Stars in minutes played, overlooked 14 penalties in
the game. It forced extended action for Dallas' ninth-ranked
penalty killing unit, of which he's not a member. Nor will he be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Say what? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock isn't above creating a little breathing room for
himself, witness his public statement about leaving the Central
Division for the Pacific this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different division from the Central; it's a
different style,'' he said. ``They (teams) run after you. They've
got a lot of foot speed and they approach the game from a physical
basis. We have to prepare differently mentally and physically to
compete in this division.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, Dallas is among the NHL top teams. Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld was left puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that after a physical game in LA,'' Schoenfeld said.
''But, what, Chicago isn't physical? Detroit isn't fast and
physical? You prepare for teams, not divisions.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

UA POINT GUARD SIGNEE BRINGS BIBBY TO MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a stretch to compare anyone who has yet to run down the
floor in a college uniform with Mike Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona on Wednesday signed Jason Gardner, one of the most
sought-after high school point guards in the country, who, by all
accounts, has the potential to be the next Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's basketball instincts and the manner in which he runs a
team have been compared with Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be in the same sentence with Mike Bibby,''
said Gardner, a senior at Indianapolis North Central High. ``It
will be a challenge to uphold the level of excellence he
established at UA.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, a Shadow Mountain High product, earned All-America honor
after leading UA to the national championship as a freshman two
years ago. He was the second pick overall in the June NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who also was recruited by Duke, Kansas, Indiana and
Purdue, was the only player the Wildcats landed on the opening day
of early signing. UA is expected to receive a letter of intent
today from Gilbert Arenas, a 6-foot-4 shooting guard from suburban
Los Angeles. Arenas has made an oral commitment to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (5-foot-11, 170 pounds) was the Indiana prep player of
the year as a junior after averaging 21.4 points, four rebounds and
2.4 assists, while shooting 50 percent overall and 40 percent from
three-point range. He was a teammate of UA freshman Michael Wright
on the USA's gold-medal winner in the Junior World Championships
Qualifying tournament in the Domincan Republic last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason is an excellent leader, a team player, very unselfish,
and the only thing that matters to him is how his team does,'' said
UA Coach Lute Olson. ``I know Arizona fans will enjoy seeing him
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rosborough, UA's associate head coach, who did most of the
recruiting of Gardner, describes him as ``a point guard's point
guard; a great leader, whose high school coach really stressed to
him the importance of having a point guard's mentality, and he took
it to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner will join the program at a time when the point guard
position will be vacant. Jason Terry, a senior, will be the floor
leader this season. There are no other true point guards currently
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas (6 foot 4) averaged 30 points last season at Grant High
and is considered the top prep prospect in the San Fernando Valley
area. Arenas also considered Kansas State and DePaul.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner and Arenas are the only two high school seniors the
Wildcats are expected to sign during the early period that runs
through Nov. 17. The Wildcats already are on a youth kick with six
true freshmen in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Richard Jefferson of Moon Valley High, who is
expected to start at small forward, where Michael Dickerson played.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner and Arenas will join UA just as the six freshmen are
coming of age, and when Loren Woods, a 7-foot-1 center who is
sitting out this season after transferring from Wake Forest,
becomes eligible.
</P>
<P>
   That should position the Wildcats to make another run at a
national championship after what is projected to be a rebuilding
season that opens Friday when the Wildcats meet Tennessee in the
Black Coaches Association Classic in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona not only will be young this season, it will be
short-handed after losing four players. Dion Broom, a forward from
Mesa, and Donnell Harris, a valuable bench player, were dismissed
for not meeting team standards.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Walton, a freshman forward and the son of Hall of Famer
Bill Walton, suffered a stress fracture in his foot two weeks ago
and will be sidelined for at least eight weeks. He is expected to
be redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, sophomore shooting guard Quynn Tebbs quit and
returned to Utah to be with his grandfather, who has been diagnosed
with leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Wildcats with nine healthy, eligible players on
scholarship, five of them freshmen. &QL;

ASU CLOSES BOOK ON 5 SIGNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-SIGNING-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two things Arizona State basketball Coach Rob Evans
wants you to know about recruiting. The first is that he believes
his staff _ Tony Benford, Russ Pennell and Dan O'Dowd _ is the very
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep talking about them, but they're fabulous,'' Evans said.
``They work at it extremely hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The second thing is about Evans himself. During his six years as
head coach at Mississippi, he was not known as a top recruiter,
mainly because it was hard to attract so-called blue-chip high
school players. No tradition and poor facilities were the primary
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But many players Evans did get came mainly because of him. He
said he heard from more than one parent, ``I don't like the
University of Mississippi, but I'm gonna send my kid to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Ole Miss, when he was an assistant at Oklahoma State,
Evans said, he helped recruit a top-five class. And he also landed
his share of talent as an assistant at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' he said, ``is that teams I've coached or been
part of coaching have won nine or 10 different championships. And
I've got nine or 10 different rings with diamonds in them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to believing in both his staff and himself, Evans
also knows the value of a little help. Which is why his first real
recruiting class at ASU, which officially resulted in signed
letters of intent from five top recruits on Wednesday and an oral
commitment from one more, is being regarded so highly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this, because we have a lot to offer here,'' he
said. ``The great city, the great facilities. On and on and on. You
oughta get kids. You expect to get two or three of the really
top-notch players.''
</P>
<P>
   And to get five or six, the very first year?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendous,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking local impact into account, the marquee name of the class
is Donnell Knight, a senior at Tempe Corona del Sol High School,
which he also attended his freshman year. In between, Knight went
to St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-8 forward, Knight is a nationally known recruit who was
Evans' first priority when he took over in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here, we said we had to have him, that this is a
kid who could establish our program,'' Evans said. ``He's such a
high-profile kid that other kids will want to play with him. We
told him that. We told him we need for you to commit early because
if you want to be on a good basketball team, we need other guys to
come with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Knight was no secret around the country, especially
after he performed well at the Nike camp in Indianapolis during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 6-8, he can play off-guard, he can play small forward,''
Evans said. ``He's athletic, he can get his own shot, he runs the
floor extremely well. His upside is unbelievable. As he gets bigger
and stronger and more experienced, he's got a chance to be one of
the top players in college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight ``doesn't always understand how hard you have to play on
every play at this level,'' Evans said, ``but that's typical of
high school kids. But all the tools are there. He's a fabulous,
fabulous talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans got signed letters from Knight and four other recruits,
and expects the letter from Compton, Calif., guard Tito Maddox
within a few days. Because of NCAA rules, Evans could not talk
about Maddox, but he was more than happy to discuss the others.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Smith, a 6-8 forward from North High School (currently
sidelined because of a broken right wrist): ``This kid has a
tremendous upside. He's still growing. Agile, athletic, long arms.
Has a chance to be as good as any kid we recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner Shell, a 6-7 swingman from Mesa Mountain View: ``One of
the plums of the recruiting class. He brings so much to the table.
He can play off guard, he can even play the point. He can rebound.
He's tough, he's athletic, he can shoot it. He's a huge piece of
the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Osborne, a 6-9 forward from Lancaster High School in Los
Angeles: ``A kid who loves to rebound the ball, loves to bang. A
tough, tough inside player. Handles the ball well for a guy his
size, passes well for a guy his size.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Redhage, a 6-8 forward from East High School in Lincoln,
Neb., whose family is moving to the Valley: ``A very versatile
player. A good rebounder, especially offensive rebounder. Defends,
a good shooter. Understands the game. And a very, very fine person
on top of it.'' &QL;

HOOKED ON PLUMMER  
 HALL OF FAME QB BRADSHAW SEES GRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give Jake Plummer time, watch the growth of the offensive line
and running game carefully, don't waste a good win, and watch out.
</P>
<P>
   That was the assessment of Terry Bradshaw, Hall of Fame
quarterback and FOX-TV analyst, who was here Wednesday to videotape
an interview with Plummer that runs Sunday before the
Cardinals-Dallas Cowboys telecast. Bradshaw took time after
practice to chat about everything from Plummer to Joe Greene,
Arizona's defensive-line coach and Bradshaw's former Pittsburgh
Steelers teammate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals are becoming the talk of the town, around
the league Bradshaw hears nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to beat Dallas and go 6-4 so the players will start
believing,'' Bradshaw said. ``You can talk it, but you've got to
emotionally feel it. When we started getting good in Pittsburgh, we
had to beat a team that had been great for a number of years. When
we beat Kansas City with Lenny Dawson and all those great players,
our confidence level shot up. That's what has to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you beat the Cowboys, do you go forward when you get to
Washington and go 7-4, or do you enjoy your Dallas victory and go
backward? It's got to be consistent, then the players start
believing it. That's really the process. You can't waste a
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw is especially fond of Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake the Snake has kind of been one of my pet guys,'' Bradshaw
said. ``I just think he's one of these kids that as he grows up and
gets a running game going, and an offensive line, he's going to be
something. He obviously feels the pressure this year because you
can see it in his performance. But he started the seventh game last
year and had 15 touchdowns and 2,000 yards. That's very impressive.
That's exciting. I think he's better when he's freelancing. Last
week was his best game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw has had his eye on another Valley quarterback, Tim
Rattay, formerly of Phoenix Christian High School and starter at
Bradshaw's alma mater, Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got 44 touchdown passes, and he's thrown for over 4,000
yards. That's just amazing,'' Bradshaw said. ``I went to the
Nebraska game to watch him _ and 590 yards. I wanted to see him,
see how big he was and everything. So I went in the locker room,
and he's about as thin as Jake. But man, has he got some poise.''
</P>
<P>
   And what Bradshaw likes about his fellow Hall of Famer Greene is
the way Greene used to stand up for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Joe and I are so close,'' Bradshaw said. ``They
were riding me pretty hard. I was a young, naive kid out of
Louisiana Tech. I was playing by the seat of my pants. We were 0-3
and I get benched. They jerked me around and messed with my head.
Then that `dumb' crap started. Right or wrong, Joe had enough. Joe
felt sorry for me. They were afraid of Joe. I saw him take his
helmet off in Philadelphia, and like Sampson with the jawbone of an
ass, just start wiping out people. I saw him take the football from
the ref's hands and throw it into the bleachers. I saw him chase
guys out of bounds and keep going and drill them. Chuck (Noll,
former Steelers coach) would tell us to run around the goal post
before the team would start calisthentics. Joe walked around it. He
didn't have his shoes on, or his pads. And nobody said a word to
him.'' &QL;  &QL;

   TROPIC, Utah _ OK, so THE canyon is Grand.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to dispute that. The Grand Canyon, a mammoth
chasm cut by the Colorado River, gets enough visitors each year to
populate one of the largest cities in the nation. From the canyon's
rims, they marvel at its size and beauty. They hike into it. They
raft through it. They love it into submission _ hence the need to
shuttle people to its south rim rather than let them drive.
</P>
<P>
   But to isolate that canyon for attention is to miss some of the
best scenery in the world. Go north into Utah and experience
canyons of lesser size but no lesser scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Zion National Park is one of those. It takes a hike to see it at
its best. But the awesome beauty is there.
</P>
<P>
   When Ebenezer and Mary Bryce were sent on a mission to the Paria
Valley by the Mormon church in 1875, they found a wondrous place.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer was chosen because he had skills as a carpenter, skills
that would be useful in settling the area. He built a road to a
nearby plateau to gather firewood and timber. He also built an
canal to irrigate crops and water animals.
</P>
<P>
   His find became known as Bryce's Canyon. The name remained when
the Bryces left for northern Arizona in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is Bryce Canyon National Park. On a smaller scale than
the Grand Canyon, it contains some of the most spectacular scenery
you'll ever see.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Omernik of Topeka, Kan., has stood on the North Rim of the
Grand Canyon at sunset and been impressed by its majesty.
</P>
<P>
   But the red, pink, orange and white spires in Bryce Canyon,
thousands of them, impress him even more.
</P>
<P>
   Omernik first saw the canyon as a small child. He dreamed of
returning and did last week.
</P>
<P>
   He called it ``a candidate for the Eighth Wonder of the World''
as he surveyed its colorful beauty. Other travelers also are
captivated.
</P>
<P>
   The November page in the guest book at the visitor's center
reveals signatures of travelers from Lucerne, Switzerland; Chapel
Hill, N.C.; a small town in The Netherlands; and Moscow. The canyon
is visited by about 1.5 million people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Words such as ``awesome'' and ``mind-boggling'' were used to
describe the canyon's brilliantly colored spires and other scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon, open year round, is about 400 miles north of
Phoenix, just east of U.S. 89. Most visitors see it in the summer
months. But fall, though cool at the canyon, may be more rewarding.
There are fewer visitors, and hiking temperatures are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   The spires are called hoodoos. According to Paiute Indian
legend, before the Indians arrived, the canyon was inhabited with
birds, animals and lizards that looked like humans. These Legend
People were an evil group, causing the god Coyote to turn them into
rocks. Some stand in rows; some are sitting; and some are holding
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the hoodoos are spires formed by erosion. Oxidized
iron provides the pink, red and orange colors. The purples are
provided by manganese. A pure limestone provides the whites.
</P>
<P>
   The canyon covers elevations from about 6,000 to 9,000 feet.
Fifty miles of trails weave through the canyon, offering views from
about any angle. From its rim, you can see Navajo Mountain 86 miles
away. That dome mountain towers over Lake Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Aquarius Plateau, 15 miles away, already bears snow, adding to
the vista from the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Even before you enter the park and pay the $10 fee, you can turn
off to Fairyland Point and marvel at an amphitheater filled with
hoodoos. A 5-mile hike into the canyon from that point offers close
up views at the hoodoos.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise and Sunset points also offer great views into the
canyon. But the most spectacular spot is Bryce Point, where the
view into an amphitheatre offers a look at more hoodoos than you
can count. Breathtaking is not overstating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most popular hike in the canyon starts at Sunset
Point. It starts on Navajo Loop Trail. That trail is about a mile
long. The trip into the canyon is steep. But unlike the Grand
Canyon, the steep climbs are short.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Loop joins a trail that leads to Queen's Garden. Take
that trail, which exits at Sunrise point, a total of about three
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Queen's Garden is popular because the rock formation towering
above it contains a likeness to a queen in ceremonial robes. No
kidding. It's supposed to be Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   This is a canyon that shouldn't be missed. Tour buses arrived
all day, bringing mostly Europeans to the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   And although the lodge and country store in the park have been
closed for the winter, Ruby's Best Western motel with accompanying
restaurants, stores and the like is offering excellent rooms for
one or two for $46 a night.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place to view from on high or to experience up close. &QL;

Arkansas thrives under Nutt's guidance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. _ The head coach _ the fellow everyone from
Gravette to Eudora and all points between seems so enamored of
today _ wasn't necessarily the first choice for the job. Just a few
months ago, his team was picked to finish sixth in a six-team
division, and some considered it a charitable call.
</P>
<P>
   Now, eight games along this journey down college football's
Yellow Brick Road, Anthony Lucas stands in the middle of another
winning locker room and utters a previously unthinkable statement
in a once-unthinkable season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to play for the national championship,'' Arkansas'
junior wide receiver said with the straightest of faces.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, kid. So would Northern Illinois. The difference, in this
case, is that the remarkable Razorbacks have to be taken seriously
as they get ready to roll into Knoxville for Saturday's
Southeastern Conference showdown with top-ranked Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   They're 8-0. They lead the SEC West by two games.
</P>
<P>
   People are beginning to notice, too. This week, Arkansas finally
cracked the Top Ten in the writers' and coaches' polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said free safety Kenoy Kennedy, a junior from
Terrell, Texas. ``A dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellow who has everyone dreaming again is Houston Nutt, a
former Arkansas quarterback who returned to the Hills after brief
head-coaching stops at Murray State and Boise State. Taking over
from Danny Ford, Nutt has revitalized a program gone stale and a
once-rabid fan base grown apathetic from too many years of
mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect fit? That's the company line now, certainly.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Nutt almost didn't get the chance to make all this
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to believe now,'' said Kennedy, the SEC Defensive
Player of the Week after turning in nine tackles, an interception
and a fumble recovery in last week's 34-0 rout of Mississippi.
``He's made all the difference in the world here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Ford was shown the door at the end of last season,
Mississippi coach Tommy Tuberville _ an Arkansas native _ was
widely considered the front-runner. Eventually, Tuberville opted to
stay in Oxford, leaving the door open for the 41-year-old Nutt, who
stepped in and has been in perpetual motion ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good leader gets the team together,'' said senior tailback
Madre Hill. ``He's gotten the whole of Arkansas together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes someone really special to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking over a team that finished 4-7 a year ago, Nutt wondered
what sort of response he might get from players, many of whom
admitted they had lost their enthusiasm for the game. What he found
was a core of seniors who made it clear they weren't interested in
being part of a rebuilding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the minute we got in here, the seniors told us they
wanted to win, and they wanted to win now,'' co-defensive
coordinator Keith Burns, another former Razorback player, said.
``They didn't want to ride off into the sunset.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, all concerned became familiar with the sunrise. The
new staff scheduled pre-dawn workouts to find out just how serious
everyone was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they responded, I knew we had something to build on
here,'' Nutt says.
</P>
<P>
   That something has turned into the nation's fourth-ranked run
defense, one that is giving up just 82.6 yards per game and 2.4
yards per attempt. Five of the first eight opponents have failed to
crack 100 yards on the ground, and South Carolina's 131 _ basically
an off day for Texas' Ricky Williams _ is the season-high yield.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has perked up, too, averaging 398 yards per game, up
from 273 a year ago. After scoring just 181 points all last season,
the Hogs are putting up 34.1 points per game, their best production
since the 1970 team set a school record by averaging 36.5.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a product of depth and balance more than star
power.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and junior Chrys Chukwuma have rushed for 560 and 562
yards, respectively. Quarterback Clint Stoerner, a junior from
Baytown Lee, is completing just over half (50.2 percent) his passes
but has thrown for 18 touchdowns (tying a school record) with just
five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is the big-play receiver with 679 yards and seven
touchdowns on just 26 catches, an average of 26.1 yards per
reception. Michael Williams leads the team with 31 catches, good
for 376 yards and three scores.
</P>
<P>
   Nary a Heisman Trophy candidate in sight, it would seem, but the
results speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody wants to play for each other,'' Stoerner
said. ``It's not a deal where you're going out there to see how
many stats you can put up. You're playing for the guy next to you,
and all of us know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got that kind of attitude, you're going to do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks have done well, certainly, and at the right
times, too. Nutt's team has owned the second half, outscoring
opponents 164-47. That trait has come in handy, since the
Razorbacks have trailed at some point in five of their eight games.
</P>
<P>
   So how good are they?
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is No. 9 this week in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll
and No. 10 in the Associated Press writers' rankings. That leaves
the Hogs trailing five once-beatens _ Florida, Florida State, Texas
A&AMP;M, Ohio State and Arizona _ in the AP poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series rankings are a bit kinder, listing
Arkansas No. 7, with the Seattle Times rating the Razorbacks in a
tie for third with Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good football team,'' Nutt said. ``I don't know why
so many people have a hard time believing that, but it's time to
start paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas has a chance to make everyone sit up and take notice
Saturday in Knoxville. If the Hogs can take down this week's No. 1
(an honor the Vols share with Kansas State in the coaches' poll) in
102,854-seat Neyland Stadium, there won't be much room left for
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Amazement, perhaps, but not doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd said in the summer that we'd be No. 9 playing No. 1
in Knoxville with an undefeated record, I wouldn't have believed
you,'' Nutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months later, Anthony Lucas believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not laying down for anybody,'' he said. ``We know what
we want to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to go over there.''

GOP SENATOR OPPPOSES IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ An influential Republican senator added his voice
Wednesday to a growing chorus of GOP lawmakers uncomfortable with
the inquiry into impeachment of President Clinton, suggesting that
the House drop its investigation and turn the issue over for
criminal prosecution once he leaves office.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., urged Republicans to change their
course after concluding that impeachment proceedings would be
``devastating for the country'' and highly unlikely to result in
Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public interest would be better served by leaving the
president in office than by distracting the nation with impeachment
for much of his remaining term,'' Specter wrote in an opinion piece
for the New York Times. ``I believe Mr. Clinton would face the
distinct possibility of conviction and a jail sentence . . . and
(the prospect) might even induce the president to consider
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was quickly rejected by the chairman of the House
committee conducting the inquiry into whether Clinton engaged in
perjury and obstructed justice, underscoring a deepening division
within the Republican Party over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a constitutional duty to perform under the law
and the Constitution, and we're going to perform it,'' said House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``I don't know how
it's going to come out. I haven't counted noses, I can't predict
the end result. But I will predict we will press forward and do our
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to comment directly on the suggestion
from Specter, who is the latest Republican to voice concern that
the inquiry into Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky matter
is doing more harm than good. A number of lawmakers and strategists
have blamed the GOP's pursuit of Clinton for the party's poor
showing in last week's congressional elections, when Democrats
picked up five seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Specter has shown a willingness to oppose the Republican
leadership in the past on such issues as abortion, gay rights and
the minimum wage. In the House, several other moderate Republicans
have also expressed a desire to settle the matter quickly,
including Brian Bilbray of San Diego, Connie Morella of Maryland
and Christopher Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything in the Starr report that would justify
removing Clinton from office,'' said Shays, although he said that
could change if Starr submits more evidence on other areas of his
investigation, including the Whitewater land deal or the use of FBI
files.
</P>
<P>
   Others Republicans, particularly those on the Judiciary
Committee, insist they cannot shut down the inquiry simply because
of poll numbers or election results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conflict between constitutional responsibility and
political expediency,'' said one GOP strategist. ``Dropping it is
not so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict does not appear to bother congressional Democrats,
who have tried to portray the GOP's appetite for investigation as
evidence of their extremism.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said Republicans
should have listened when Democrats offered a compromise last month
that would have allowed the inquiry to proceed under strict
limitations. Instead, Gephardt said, Republicans are ``hell-bent''
on pursuing a ``very defective'' process that he fears will end up
with articles of impeachment on the House floor for only the second
time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is not terribly prepared to deal with this,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by reporters, Gephardt provided no scenario to end the
inquiry, merely calling on the investigation to be both
``thorough'' and ``completed quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment inquiry, approved by the full House last month,
will move into high gear next Thursday, when independent counsel
Kenneth Starr is scheduled to testify before the Judiciary
Committee. Hyde has expressed hope that the matter will be
concluded by the end of the year, but he has not released a more
detailed timetable or a list of further witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Democrats who first pushed the idea of Starr's
testimony, Gephardt said the independent counsel's appearance may
be a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Ken Starr is going to say that we don't
already know,'' Gephardt said. ``He is not a witness to any of the
facts. . . . What is he going to do, read (his report)?''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the impeachment inquiry is so close to the end of
the year that it could provide lawmakers with a convenient exit
strategy. If the matter is not completed by the time the 106th
Congress is sworn in January 5, it is unclear whether the full
House would have to reauthorize the Judiciary Committee to pursue
the matter. Such an authorization was passed last month with 31
Democratic votes, but after the November 3 election, it is possible
that no Democrats would vote a second time to approve an inquiry,
and they could be joined by several dozen Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Under such a scenario, the committee could lose its authority to
pursue the matter and the impeachment inquiry would be suspended.

GEPHARDT LOOKING AT A RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disputing the notion that Vice President Al Gore
has the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination locked up, House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said Wednesday that he is
``actively looking'' at entering the race and will make a decision
no later than January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believe that any of these presidential races are
locked up,'' said Gephardt, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for
president in 1988. ``There are too many variables, too many `what
ifs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is the overwhelming favorite in polls of Democratic voters,
although his prospects could be threatened if Attorney General
Janet Reno decides to appoint an independent counsel to investigate
his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign. Reno is expected
to make a decision within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some party strategists, including a few of Gephardt's advisers,
have suggested that the Nov. 3 elections _ in which Democrats
inched within six seats of the majority _ might encourage Gephardt
to concentrate on winning the House back for Democrats in 2000 and
becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am also a very big advocate for winning the House back,''
Gephardt said in a lunch with reporters. ``The decision hasn't been
made. . . . I will have time to talk to my family, friends, and the
people I respect to go through this in detail and make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has made no secret of his interest in running, would
enter the race with a huge advantage in fund-raising ability and
name recognition. Other Democrats who have expressed an interest in
the nomination include Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts and Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said his ability to raise money has improved
dramatically since his last presidential campaign, in which he
raised $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would always be better to be Steve Forbes or Al Checchi,''
he said, referring to recent multimillionaire candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the conventional wisdom that Texas Governor
George W. Bush is the prohibitive favorite to win the GOP
nomination, saying, ``I don't know how he is going to deal with the
far right.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative wing of the party is so powerful, he said, and
so out of step with the public, that even the departure of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich will do little to improve the GOP's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Newt is their problem,'' he said. ``Their
problem is that the far right dominates their party.''
</P>
<P>
   As for California, which emerged as one of the most strongly
Democratic states after last week's elections, Gephardt credited
his party's ability to appeal to minority voters at a time when
state Republicans are turning them off with recent measures
cracking down on illegal immigrants and eliminating bilingual
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening in California is that the (Gov.) Pete
Wilson effect on the Hispanic community and other immigrant
communities has just been enormous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gray Davis victory (for governor) is just incredible,''
Gephardt added. ``The size of his victory is just awesome, given
where we were in the past.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 12. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody leads with the deployment of more U.S. forces to the
Persian Gulf, as the Clinton administration _ via remarks not just
by President Clinton, but also by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Hugh Shelton _ once again warned Saddam
Hussein to accept weapons inspections or else.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's military moves: ordering stealth fighters and B-1
and B-52 bombers to the region along with anti-missile missiles and
3,000 Army troops. Another development that has in the past served
as an immediate warning of U.S. use of force: the withdrawal of
nonessential State Department personnel and their dependents from
embassies (in Israel and Kuwait), and of U.N. inspectors and
humanitarian aid workers from Iraq. None of the papers mentions
that such evacuations not only serve the obvious purpose, but also
reduce Hussein's ability to deploy foreign ``human shields.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times points out that, unlike the previous go-round
with Iraq last winter, neither Russia nor France is currently
attempting to find a diplomatic way out for Hussein. But the
Washington Post reports that in a closed-door meeting at the U.N.
Wednesday, Russia continued to argue against using force. And USA
Today says that Russia has been joined in this position by Egypt
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Times says that the targets would be Iraq's weapons plants
and depots. The WP's columnist Jim Hoagland agrees and adds that
the White House has prevailed over the Pentagon in insisting on a
``substantial air campaign.'' The Los Angeles Times passes along
former Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft's suggestion:
take out one target a week, until Hussein grants inspections. But
the paper points out current U.S. officials acknowledge that no
bombing campaign, no matter how extensive, can be expected to
eradicate Hussein's covert weapons development efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT points out that neither the Gulf War nor subsequent
strikes in 1993 and 1996 significantly eroded Hussein's interest in
or capability for weapons development. And, adds the LAT, the U.S.
is bedeviled by Hussein's way of interpreting events _ after all,
he has told his citizens that the Gulf War was a great triumph for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT lead stresses in the first paragraph that the U.S. is
prepared to strike with no further warning. How soon? Well, the
Times notes that Albright is planning to fly to an economic summit
on Friday, not in her regular plane, but in a special airborne
command and control craft known as the Doomsday Plane. The same
plane, the paper reminds, she used while traveling last August just
before U.S. cruise missile strikes into Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The fronts at the LAT and NYT report that the Israeli cabinet
has ratified the Wye pact with the Palestinian Authority. The Times
reports that the U.S. hailed the ratification as an important step,
but both papers stress that the Cabinet salted its approval with
enough conditions requiring specific prior actions by Yasser Arafat
to produce at the very least delay if not an outright breakdown in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   An inside piece at the WP reports that a Communist member of
parliament, Albert Makashov, has called for quotas on the number of
Jews in Russia and denounced a television correspondent as ``worse
than the worst of the yids.'' In a speech, he also told Boris
Berezovsky, one of the nation's tycoons, ``Don't behave as a yid.''
Makashov defended his use of the phrase by citing the writings of
Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Gogol. The Post says anti-Semitism had been
rare in post-Communist Russia before the country's economic swan
dive last August.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that FAO Schwarz now offers
something called ``The Ultimate Sleep-Over Party'' in which groups
of kids can ``camp out'' in its stores for just $17,500. The paper
further press releases that ``some proceeds go to charity.'' It
would be nice if the Journal made sure this item was more than just
free advertising for the chi-chi toy store by following up to see
just how much of those 17K checks actually ends up going to those
in need.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SADDAM'S LATEST HISTORY LESSON
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 15
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight years after World War II, Germany and Japan,
the vanquished powers, had risen anew as prosperous allies of the
United States. Eight years after the Persian Gulf war, Iraq remains
mired in poverty while facing the threat of another U.S. air
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference?
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the allies hanged or jailed the axis leaders
who failed to commit suicide. But in Iraq, loser Saddam Hussein
remains in power, able to summon CNN on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   When Iraq's forces collapsed in 1991 after a 100-hour land
campaign, then-President Bush surmised Saddam couldn't long survive
in power. Essentially, President Clinton is making the same bet by
dispatching fresh forces to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   While there are those who claim the administration lacks a
coherent policy in the region, six key elements can in fact be
deduced.
</P>
<P>
   1. Strive to disarm Iraq until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   2. Isolate Iraq regionally until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   3. Block Iraqi oil exports until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   4. Maintain an embargo on imports until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   5. Use the CIA to destabilize Iraq until Saddam is history.
</P>
<P>
   6. While seeking world support for those goals, be ready to go
it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Top policy makers here fail to take into account the Middle
East's prevailing mind set _ one that allows events of 1,000 years
ago, such as the Crusades, to be viewed as having happened, say,
only 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam sees history in this way. He models his actions on those
of another tyrant, Nebuchadnezzar II, the Babylonian king who lived
from 604 to 562 B.C., and who destroyed Solomon's Temple and
enslaved the Israelites.
</P>
<P>
   For Saddam, the morality of using ``weapons of mass
destruction'' pales before the prospect of similar greatness. He
began his drive to power as a secular socialist, so his passionate
hatred of Israel has nothing to do with militant Islam. For him,
lying and cheating are not moral issues. To bargain with him is, by
definition, an exercise in futility.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's immediate Arab neighbors understand this dynamic quite
well. Interestingly, the further one ranges from Baghdad, the more
ardent followers Saddam seems to draw.
</P>
<P>
   While the Saudi royal family faults Iraq alone for the current
crisis, al-Ahram, Egypt's leading semi-official daily, insists that
Baghdad's demands are ``perfectly legitimate'' and calls on
Washington to stop threatening a new war.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians take the middle ground, believing the crisis serves
the political interests of both sides. As the instigator, Saddam
gains because the bombs that could fall on his nation would enable
him to blame Washington for the Iraqis' desperate plight. And
Clinton gets to change the subject again from the (already
unpopular) House impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equation is clear,'' Khairallah Khairallah (cq) writes in
the Jordanian daily al-Ra'i. ``There is a U.S. administration which
thinks the embargo on Iraq must continue indefinitely until the
current regime is replaced, so it has to find pretexts for
maintaining the embargo irrespective of what it inflicts on
ordinary Iraqi citizens.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Time to catch up on geography
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 15, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got to tell you that although I've always been good at
geography, Kosovo caught me by surprise. As did Bosnia and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the start of Geography Awareness Week and it
couldn't come fast enough for me; I've a lot of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   Geography isn't just for schoolkids. Those of us who endured
those classroom courses decades ago don't realize how far behind
we've fallen until we start reading stories about deadly political
rifts _ in places such as Kosovo _ and begin wondering where on
earth they are and why we've never heard of them before.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for instance, where there were 26 political divisions
(countries) just a decade ago, there are 33 now. In the Balkans,
those divisions also are subdivided by rebellious enclaves that
were not delineated in atlases until just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have new political divisions been created but old ones
have taken on new names to further confound those of us who have
not kept up. The face of the global map changes more quickly than
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know which bewilders me more, the former Soviet
republics, or Africa. There's enough new to learn about both to
keep me busy for quite a while. The last atlas I bought, in 1987,
is woefully outdated.
</P>
<P>
   As best I can tell, there are more than 42 countries in Africa,
most of which many of us are clearly in the dark about. Maybe
that's what the new meaning of ``darkest Africa'' should be _ we're
in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Coming across names of countries such as Benin, Burkina-Faso and
Djibouti exercises my retained classroom knowledge of history. Were
those places always there? Yes, but strapped with colonial names
that no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   Even more confusing to the geography-deprived reader and student
is the likeness of the names of African countries. There's a
Mauritania and a Mauritius, a Republic of Congo and a plain old
Congo, a Guinea and a Guinea-Bissau, a Niger and a Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many of us who have heard of the Comoro Islands.
That's an island nation in the Mozambique Channel in which no less
than 18 coups have been attempted since it obtained independence
from France in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The late Danny Kaye thrived on a comedy routine in which he
talked at Mach-2 speed, supposedly reciting countless Russian
names. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, probably much of what
he babbled is now identifiable in a bunch of new countries ending
in -stan.
</P>
<P>
   To go along with the already established Pakistan and
Afghanistan, we've now got Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and Kyrgyzstan. Say that fast three times.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long been labeled positioned as being unaware of
the world around them. There is some truth to that. As new nations
emerge, as nations are created, renamed and renamed again, the
learning process needs to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows we've got enough special weeks to observe. But
Geography Awareness Week is more than a week to promote products,
as is National Pickle Week and the like.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the world around us, we've got to learn
more about it _ and that should be before we dispatch troops and
aircraft carriers to put out fires in remote places we've never
heard about.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters have the benefit of classroom lessons. Those
of us who left the classroom many years before are the ones who
have fallen behind. Throughout the country this week, there are
opportunities to revive our knowledge of geography. The National
Geographic Society is offering a package of information, as are
organizations such as the Texas Alliance for Geographic Education.
Much of this can be found on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of such offerings. Get out of the dark about
Africa, understand the ethnically based geographic divisions taking
place in the Balkans, learn not only how to pronounce those former
Soviet states but how they relate to us in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone know where I can find what used to be Dahomey? Look it
up.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A way out for Congress
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as though President Clinton will dodge impeachment and
that's just as well, but what are we to do with _ and maybe to _ a
president who, if he didn't commit perjury and obstruct justice, at
least played chicken with both?
</P>
<P>
   Why not, as a few are beginning to suggest, just let justice
take its routine course? The statute of limitations won't have
kicked in by the time Clinton leaves office. He will still be
subject to the ordinary workings of the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, that would mean review of the evidence by the
U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a decision either to
indict or not. If indict, a jury would decide guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   No, the process still wouldn't be freed from a political
context. There's no way to do that. Depending upon the 2000
presidential outcome, the Justice Department and its attorneys will
be Democratic or Republican. But U.S. attorneys often have to make
decisions with partisan implications, and while one involving a
recent president would be unique, it would differ only in degree,
not in kind, from other politically loaded cases.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to partisan trimming or partisan zeal would be
hedged by the need for any decision to be credible to fair-minded
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Clinton vulnerable to post-presidential prosecution
would itself be punishment, but it also would offer him the
potential benefits of prosecutorial discretion _ something the
special prosecutor statute makes little provision for and is absent
altogether from Kenneth Starr's shop.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would be helped away from impeachment if Al Gore and
other Democratic candidates could signal they'd withhold a pardon
that would short-circuit the process. (But reserve the clemency
option. Only our Richard Mellon Scaifes and Bob Barrs would want to
see the former president, should it come to that, doing hard time
at the joint.)
</P>
<P>
   Even absent such assurances, impeachment isn't warranted. The
Watergate committee pointedly exempted personal misbehavior from
its articles of impeachment, giving Richard Nixon a pass on strong
evidence he had backdated documents to pocket $92,000 in unlawful
tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the Constitution's formula of ``treason, bribery or other
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the controlling word is ``other.''
The framers meant for the process to apply to misuses of power and
office on an order of seriousness comparable to treason and
bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Lying about sex in a deposition judged irrelevant to a civil
suit judged insupportable hardly rises to that level. The precedent
would be doubly dangerous given the circumstances of a four-year
political witch hunt ultimately manipulated to set up the
president's misstep. That way lie presidencies only saints or
master criminals could serve out.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, barring major new evidence, would be excessive and
would damage the office. But the idea that Clinton could just walk
is offensive. Censure? The Constitution neither licenses nor bars
it, but in any event it's weak stuff. Let justice roll. Or, as the
case may be, grind.

   PRAGUE _ Czech police have arrested four people, including two
Americans, on charges of physically abusing and imprisoning
American youths at an unlicensed reform school for wayward
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Moravia Academy, reportedly opened earlier this year
in a secluded hotel about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Prague as
a home for troubled American teens sent abroad by their parents.
Reports said the youths were mainly from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that youths who misbehaved or broke the school's
strict rules were subjected to severe punishments that violated
Czech law and the child protection treaty of the United Nations,
and that several children had been sent back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they were forced to lie on their bellies with their
hands tied, they were denied hot food and given limited amounts of
liquids, and they were all refused medical care,'' and sometimes
toilet facilities, said a police investigator, Petr Netik.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the school, Steven Roach, was being held
by the police, but the director, Mr. Roach's wife, Glenn, was
arrested and released on medical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials said they had visited the school on
several occasions and found nothing amiss. But when the police
asked embassy officials to return Saturday, four children asked to
leave with the diplomats, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the school arose in October when a Czech teacher
who had taught there told the newspaper Lidove Noviny about the
alleged abuse. The teacher said that the students were also
forbidden to leave the grounds, which are protected by guard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the youths' days were programmed from 6:30
A.M. to 9:30 P.M. and that they were forced to ``sing positive
songs, read positive books and were subjected to 30 minutes of
psychological pressure from tape recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the school, Connie Johnston, refused to give
details of the school's program.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Internet site (www.teenhelper.com) says Moravia
Academy is part of a chain of six similar for-profit programs; the
others are in Utah, Montana, Jamaica, Costa Rica and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site says that for $80 per day, the institutions will
help troubled teens with ``tasks, academics'' and ``behavior
modification.'' &QL;

   PRAGUE _ Czech police have arrested four people, including two
Americans, on charges of physically abusing and imprisoning
American youths at an unlicensed reform school for wayward
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Moravia Academy, reportedly opened earlier this year
in a secluded hotel about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Prague as
a home for troubled American teens sent abroad by their parents.
Reports said the youths were mainly from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that youths who misbehaved or broke the school's
strict rules were subjected to severe punishments that violated
Czech law and the child protection treaty of the United Nations,
and that several children had been sent back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they were forced to lie on their bellies with their
hands tied, they were denied hot food and given limited amounts of
liquids, and they were all refused medical care,'' and sometimes
toilet facilities, said a police investigator, Petr Netik.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of the school, Steven Roach, was being held
by the police, but the director, Mr. Roach's wife, Glenn, was
arrested and released on medical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials said they had visited the school on
several occasions and found nothing amiss. But when the police
asked embassy officials to return Saturday, four children asked to
leave with the diplomats, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the school arose in October when a Czech teacher
who had taught there told the newspaper Lidove Noviny about the
alleged abuse. The teacher said that the students were also
forbidden to leave the grounds, which are protected by guard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the youths' days were programmed from 6:30
A.M. to 9:30 P.M. and that they were forced to ``sing positive
songs, read positive books and were subjected to 30 minutes of
psychological pressure from tape recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the school, Connie Johnston, refused to give
details of the school's program.
</P>
<P>
   The school's Internet site (www.teenhelper.com) says Moravia
Academy is part of a chain of six similar for-profit programs; the
others are in Utah, Montana, Jamaica, Costa Rica and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site says that for $80 per day, the institutions will
help troubled teens with ``tasks, academics'' and ``behavior
modification.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ Ronaldo, the best and too often the least active soccer
player in the world, is preparing for his future. He is not buying
a pension, as you or I might, but buying the club that pays his
breathtaking salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo's wages are so high that the player might own a
controlling share in Internazionale of Milan before his playing
days are done.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, rich, troubled Ronaldo. Since that last traumatic World
Cup night in Paris in July, when a billion viewers around the globe
stared in disbelief at the parody of his greatness, the Brazilian
has managed four appearances on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He is anything but a cheat. He knows nothing but the game. He
plays it to the limits his body allows, and when his body allows
those limits are beyond the physical and mental capability of any
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday night, in a match against AC Milan, the San Siro was
throbbing with 80,000 fans. Fleetingly they saw the best of
Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   He burst with that unrivaled turn of acceleration between two
opponents, scored with unerring accuracy, and then struggled
through a pained anonymity that lasted until halftime, when he had
to surrender, again, to knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that both his knees are riddled with tendinitis; at
just 22 years of age we might already have seen the sustained best
of this phenomenal match winner.
</P>
<P>
   With Ronaldo sidelined, Inter, even though it has strikers Ivan
Zamorano, Roberto Baggio, Nicola Ventola, Youri Djorkaeff and
Andrea Pirlo to choose from, subsided to tie the derby game, 2-2,
albeit due to a dubious AC Milan penalty equalizer. By then,
Ronaldo could barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar state. The knees, the true cause of Ronaldo's
distress throughout the World Cup and throughout the year before
that, are casualties of the weight of games a player of his worth
is obliged to attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in Serie A and in Europe, he played 47 games for
Inter. He also played 17 times, fit and half-fit, for Brazil as the
Brazilian soccer federation and Nike, which has contracts with both
Ronaldo and Brazil, held him to an obligation that, apart from the
matches, often imposes on him more air miles than the athletic body
should undertake.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts will tell him anything. His thighs are too big,
developing too much power and pace for the knee joints to bear.
</P>
<P>
   His journey through his adolescence, as he catapulted from
Cruzeiro to PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona and to Milan, has made him
and his inevitable agents among the richest in the sport _ feeding
off a reported annual income from wages, bonuses and sponsorships
of $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo in motion is worth a lot of money. Inert, the Brazilian
is a huge drain on resources.
</P>
<P>
   It was in one of his chats with Massimo Moratti, the oil magnate
who has revived Inter, that the idea of Ronaldo's buying into the
club took shape.
</P>
<P>
   In Ronaldo's closeted life, there are not enough Ferraris, not
enough video screens or computer games to absorb all his income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronaldo buying into the club is not a sentimental thing,''
Moratti said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a game. The club balance sheet is $35 million in the
red, a significant but not a frightening amount given the market
value of the overburdened playing staff Moratti has accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all our financial advisers say things will turn round very
quickly, especially with the changes in UEFA club competitions,''
Moratti said. ``I will be selling Ronaldo 69 percent of my family's
stake in the club.'' He would then be no ordinary
worker-shareholder, rather a potential future president of Inter.
</P>
<P>
   There is sport, there is business, and rapidly since the freedom
of contract that came with the Jean-Marc Bosman ruling there is an
inexorable merger of the two. One day, it would come to this, the
team's star player is wealthier than the club.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, more than any place, welcomes back the sons of the
playing field into the corridors of ownership and power. But the
precedents suggest that it happens after the playing career is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo would be unique _ the boss and part owner while still
the star performer. Who would decide what risks to take with his
physical welfare then? Who could drop him, who could call time on
his playing career, who would dare suggest that his performances
are self indulgent, or lazy or at odds with team needs?
</P>
<P>
   There have long been critics who moan that Ronaldo runs too
little, that he spares himself the drudgery of effort and rests on
his laurels between fantastic cameos of his art. Maybe they are
right, or maybe those ``rests'' are periods when he is gathering
himself to crash through the pain barrier.
</P>
<P>
   He is enviable. He has come from poverty to celebrity, so who,
apart from his mother, his fiancee and possibly his president,
wants to hear of his suffering?
</P>
<P>
   Be quiet, Ronaldo, go count your money and your pains elsewhere.
Join the exclusive club of injured star performers. It's the price
they pay for the maladministration of those presidents who want
more even than a pound of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe around the year 2006, President Ronaldo will understand
the difference between break-even and breaking point. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Time to catch up on geography
 &HT;    (Eds: deletes extraneous word in 6th-to-last graf.)
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 15, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got to tell you that although I've always been good at
geography, Kosovo caught me by surprise. As did Bosnia and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Today marks the start of Geography Awareness Week and it
couldn't come fast enough for me; I've a lot of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   Geography isn't just for schoolkids. Those of us who endured
those classroom courses decades ago don't realize how far behind
we've fallen until we start reading stories about deadly political
rifts _ in places such as Kosovo _ and begin wondering where on
earth they are and why we've never heard of them before.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, for instance, where there were 26 political divisions
(countries) just a decade ago, there are 33 now. In the Balkans,
those divisions also are subdivided by rebellious enclaves that
were not delineated in atlases until just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have new political divisions been created but old ones
have taken on new names to further confound those of us who have
not kept up. The face of the global map changes more quickly than
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know which bewilders me more, the former Soviet
republics, or Africa. There's enough new to learn about both to
keep me busy for quite a while. The last atlas I bought, in 1987,
is woefully outdated.
</P>
<P>
   As best I can tell, there are more than 42 countries in Africa,
most of which many of us are clearly in the dark about. Maybe
that's what the new meaning of ``darkest Africa'' should be _ we're
in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Coming across names of countries such as Benin, Burkina-Faso and
Djibouti exercises my retained classroom knowledge of history. Were
those places always there? Yes, but strapped with colonial names
that no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   Even more confusing to the geography-deprived reader and student
is the likeness of the names of African countries. There's a
Mauritania and a Mauritius, a Republic of Congo and a plain old
Congo, a Guinea and a Guinea-Bissau, a Niger and a Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many of us who have heard of the Comoro Islands.
That's an island nation in the Mozambique Channel in which no less
than 18 coups have been attempted since it obtained independence
from France in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The late Danny Kaye thrived on a comedy routine in which he
talked at Mach-2 speed, supposedly reciting countless Russian
names. With the breakup of the Soviet Union, probably much of what
he babbled is now identifiable in a bunch of new countries ending
in -stan.
</P>
<P>
   To go along with the already established Pakistan and
Afghanistan, we've now got Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and Kyrgyzstan. Say that fast three times.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long been labeled as being unaware of the world
around them. There is some truth to that. As new nations emerge, as
nations are created, renamed and renamed again, the learning
process needs to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows we've got enough special weeks to observe. But
Geography Awareness Week is more than a week to promote products,
as is National Pickle Week and the like.
</P>
<P>
   To better understand the world around us, we've got to learn
more about it _ and that should be before we dispatch troops and
aircraft carriers to put out fires in remote places we've never
heard about.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters have the benefit of classroom lessons. Those
of us who left the classroom many years before are the ones who
have fallen behind. Throughout the country this week, there are
opportunities to revive our knowledge of geography. The National
Geographic Society is offering a package of information, as are
organizations such as the Texas Alliance for Geographic Education.
Much of this can be found on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of such offerings. Get out of the dark about
Africa, understand the ethnically based geographic divisions taking
place in the Balkans, learn not only how to pronounce those former
Soviet states but how they relate to us in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone know where I can find what used to be Dahomey? Look it
up.

 &HT;    A TWO-SPORT, TWO-STATE PHENOM

<P>
   NITRO, W. Va. _ College-football recruiters haven't had any
problem finding J.R. House. Neither have major-league baseball
scouts.
</P>
<P>
   They just know not to look in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Two-sport high-school standouts aren't that rare. Two-sport,
two-state phenoms? Now that's a different story.
</P>
<P>
   The most prolific passer in high-school history, House spends
the fall firing footballs in a small West Virginia town named for
the explosives it produced during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, he belts home runs for Seabreeze High School,
located in a Florida vacation destination about as different from
central West Virginia's ``Chemical Valley'' as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach and Nitro are both on the water, but there is
little in common in riding the waves of the Atlantic Ocean and
watching yet another coal barge pass along the Kanawha River. Smoke
stacks and an occasional toxic spill Nitro has; beckoning
white-sand beaches it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I miss Florida,'' House said in a recent interview. ``But
I wouldn't be at the beach this time of the year anyway. I'd be too
busy with football.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking University of Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch's
high-school passing records is definitely time consuming. To say
nothing of being tiring on the arm. Nitro, which posted its first
unbeaten regular-season in 38 years, runs a sophisticated passing
attack that has House throwing more than 40 times a game from the
shotgun formation.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of a recruiting battle that includes Georgia and
West Virginia, House has set three national records and more than
25 state marks during his four-year high-school football career _
all but three games at Nitro.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1, 212-pound House has completed 978 of 1,547 passes
for 12,840 yards _ all national career records. Also in reach are
the records for career total offense and touchdown passes, if Nitro
goes all the way in the West Virginia playoffs. House went into the
postseason with 125 TD passes, including 45 this year. He has
completed 300 of 432 passes for 3,909, with only seven
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But House's success hasn't come without controversy. Eight
transfers in four years, with another to come in January, will do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a darn what anyone else thinks,'' said Rodger
House, the man who has orchestrated both his son's athletic
achievements and the numerous moves. ``I'm just doing what is best
for my son. Isn't that what a father is supposed to do? I'm just
fortunate enough to be able to do some things that other families
couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodger House, a former West Virginia high-school coach who owns
an auto dealership in Nitro and a bar-restaurant in Florida, has
moved his family back and forth since before J.R. was born.
However, it wasn't until J.R. became a hot athletic commodity as a
teenager that the moves started drawing attention.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia and Florida both have a rule against transferring
for athletic reasons. But it is hard to enforce, especially when
two states are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you say these aren't valid moves,'' Rodger House
asked. ``I'd say 800 miles is a pretty darn valid. Wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Carter, director of the West Virginia Secondary Schools
Activities Commission, said, ``Do some people think the rules are
being taken advantage of? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   The move that really touched off a firestorm came early in
J.R.'s junior year. After becoming the first sophomore to win the
Kennedy Award as the best football player in West Virginia, House
remained in Daytona Beach the next fall to play against better
competition. But three games later he was back at Nitro _ if only
for the rest of the football season.
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortable in the Seabreeze offense and off to a 1-2 start,
House checked out of school in Daytona and back into Nitro the same
Monday. After only three practices but already back in his football
comfort zone, House threw five touchdown passes in a 44-10 win. His
assault on the high-school record book had resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football just didn't work out at Seabreeze,'' said J.R., who
threw for 629 yards and five touchdowns in the three games. ``I
knew my numbers wouldn't be quite as good in Florida, but I didn't
realize the coaching situation would be so different. I just didn't
have the close relationship there that I have at Nitro.'' That's
obvious. Still bitter about House's transfer and the resulting 1-9
season, Seabreeze coach Kerry Kramer's first response when the name
of his former quarterback is mentioned is , ``Who?'' Then, after a
long pause, he says, ``Look, he's a good kid with a lot of talent.
But I'm not going to talk about what happened, so don't try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry he is still upset,'' said J.R., who is fiercely
competitive but exhibits few signs of the inflated ego one might
expect in a standout athlete. ``I didn't mean to make anyone mad.''
</P>
<P>
   An honor student with a winning smile, House usually has the
ability to fit into any situation and make those around him feel
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all class,'' Nitro principal Paul McClanahan said about
House, who has all A's on his high-school transcript except for a B
in Algebra II .
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a thousand kids like J.R.,'' Seabreeze principal
Paul Kriton said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nancy House, J.R.'s mom, had concerns about her son
returning to Seabreeze for baseball after leaving the football
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We checked out other schools in Florida,'' Mrs. House said.
``But some of the baseball players started calling J.R. and asking
him to come back. Everything worked out just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it did. House, a catcher, batted .491 with 10 homers and 60
RBIs as the Sandcraps went 27-6 and lost in the state
quarterfinals. He made second team all-state and was named baseball
player of the year in Volusia County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good-looking hitter with promise,'' said Paul Snyder,
the Atlanta Braves director of scouting and player development.
``But you don't know about football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love football and baseball,'' said House, who just turned
19. ``I really don't know which I'm best at, so I hope to keep
playing both.''
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Carter, like House, was a football and baseball star in
high school. After being drafted in the second round by the Chicago
Cubs in 1996, he picked baseball full-time. But now he is back with
football, his decision to play quarterback at Georgia complicating
House's college choice.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Bulldogs really need House? ``I just wish Georgia didn't
have so many quarterbacks,'' Rodger House said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, J.R. regularly wears a Georgia jacket. After all, Nitro's
colors also arered and black. ``But I also have a West Virginia
jacket and a few others,'' House says. ``I'm not even close to
making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers come up to me and tell me to whisper blue and gold
into J.R.'s ears when he's sleeping,'' Nancy House said, referring
to the West Virginia colors. ``Of course, everyone up here wants
him to go to WVU.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountaineer coach Don Nehlen is recruiting House harder than he
has any other instate prospect in his 19-year tenure. Nehlen, not
an assistant, makes the weekly telephone calls to J.R., and he took
in a state high-school game for the first time in 10 years to see
Nitro play in October.
</P>
<P>
   But J.R.'s relationship with Georgia coach Jim Donnan goes back
to when he was in elementary school. Rodger House is a former
Marshall University baseball player and he first sent his son to
Donnan's Thundering Herd summer football camp in Huntington when
J.R. was going into the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Donnan had me play quarterback on a team with mostly
junior-high kids,'' recalled J.R., who started playing organized
sports before he entered school. ``They were all upset about having
a little kid at quarterback. But when we won the championship, they
didn't care. They called me 'Young Gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. kept going back to Donnan's camps and was a regular on the
Marshall sideline during games. But, surprisingly, he didn't start
playing quarterback full-time until the ninth grade. He played
fullback and linebacker in seventh and eighth grade at Hayes Junior
High in St. Albans, accross the river from Nitro.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to Nitro, which required another family move, so
he could play as a freshman at a four-year high school and get to
work with offensive coordinator Scott Tinsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 30 minutes to see that J.R. was something
very special,'' said Tinsley, a former Appalachian State
quarterback and assistant who had resigned recently as coach at
West Virginia State. ``It wasn't just the way he threw the ball,
but how fast he could grasp things. Even when he was a freshman, we
could try things that I didn't even dare do in college. He was that
advanced. He reads the whole field and has the option to throw to
at least four receivers on almost every play.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a freshman, House read an article about Couch in
Sports Illustrated and had his football goal. J.R. tacked the story
his bedroom wall and wrote over it, ``You're mine.'' He had Couch's
records in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, 'Yeah, right. Nice dream,''' Mrs. House said. ``I was
just thankful he didn't get killed in ninth grade. But he wouldn't
lose sight of his goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitro coach Robert ``Little'' Burdette drew flak before this
season when he said he would play House every down _ no matter the
score _ so his quarterback could set the national records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to get in the way of history,'' Burdette said.
``I took J.R. out of game as a sophomore when he was just short of
a state record and felt real bad about it. It wasn't going to
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   With J.R. passing and passing, Burdette kept the scores
relatively close by substituing freely on defense. Nitro finished
the regular season averaging 44 points but allowing 26. House _ who
went 289 passes without an interception this season _ also plays
linebcker, but only against top opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Couch's record for passing yardage fell Oct. 23, as House
completed 40 of 52 passes for 419 yards in a 42-24 win over
previously unbeaten DuPont _ the school that produced Randy Moss. A
record crowd of more than 7,000 overflowed Nitro's Underwood Field
and the game was broadcast by three Charleston-area radio stations.
Play was stopped for a brief ceremony after standout receiver Chris
Martin, who has bettered many of the state receiving marks set by
Moss, caught a pass on an out pattern for the record late in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe there is a better quarterback out there
anywhere,'' DuPont coach Dick Whittman said. ``He may not be a stud
athlete (like Moss), but J.R. dominates a game just like Randy did.
He's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   A radio station gave out 2,500 posters of House after his
record-breaking game, and it seemed that every fan wanted an
autograph. ``Almost an hour after the game, he was still signing,
and I finally had to invite everyone to come into the field house
so they wouldn't freeze to death,'' Burdette said.
</P>
<P>
   Burdette is no relation to former pitcher Lew Burdette, Nitro's
only other claim to athletic fame. The right-hander beat the New
York Yankees three times in the 1957 World Series as the Milwaukee
Braves won their only championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a parade then, and everybody in town was really
excited,'' said McClanahan, the Nitro principal. ``But this is
certainly the biggest thing that's happened to the school.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why McClanahan wants House to go through two graduation
ceremonies in June _ at Nitro and Seabreeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll finish up in Florida, but it just wouldn't be
right to not have him graduate from here, too. I know I want the
honor of handing him a diploma. For all he's accomplished, that's
the only right thing to do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   If her husband had not decided to announce his retirement from
the U.S. Senate last Friday, Elizabeth Moynihan would have been in
the Bronx that very day, indulging one of her greatest passions.
</P>
<P>
   She has been overseeing a major archaeological project near the
Taj Mahal in India, and one of her colleagues, a paleobotanist at
the New York Botanical Garden, had just returned from there with
some new slides of the project site.
</P>
<P>
   But as she has so many times over the decades, she deferred her
own plans for just a bit, making room for the inevitable intrusion
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the story of my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this was a rather special announcement, one that
guaranteed that future intrusions would be minimal. Beginning in
2001, her husband, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, would no
longer reign as the leading intellectual of the Senate, a guiding
light on any discussion of welfare reform, tax policy or
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   And she would no longer have to serve as his campaign manager,
setting aside her monographs on architectural history to preside
over some of the most Spartan and wily campaigns for a Senate seat
in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   But the time had come, she said on Tuesday, sitting in the
couple's grand apartment in Washington, halfway between the Capitol
and the White House. Shaking her head of luminous white hair in
disgust at the malevolence and expense that now define Senate
campaigns, she said she told her husband four years ago that she
was leaving politics, and his decision to do the same followed
inexorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not going to run another campaign,'' she said. ``I'm
running out of time. I'm 69, and there's a limited amount of time I
can go turning over rocks in the desert, you know, especially with
arthritis. And there are things I have to write, and I'm crazy
about my grandchildren. As it is, we're lucky to have survived this
long with our style of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That style, utterly anachronistic in its straightforward,
high-minded, nonviolent way, is as much a reflection of Liz
Moynihan's personality as of her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of broadcasting an attack ad against an opponent, or
hiring a focus group to guide the senator's policy positions, was
simply unthinkable to her. The campaigns never raised much money,
and her ads simply talked about what Moynihan had done.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helped that he almost never had a serious
opponent, Democrat or Republican. But that was part of her
strategy, too _ psyching out potential opponents with early
television ads that convinced them Moynihan was unbeatable. That
left more time for architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan to every campaign was always the same: how not to
have a campaign,'' said Mandy Grunwald, the political consultant
who advised the Moynihans during three campaigns and is an old
friend of the family. ``In 1988, she told me they couldn't have a
campaign because Pat needed to work on welfare reform. And after
Rudy Giuliani backed out, we didn't have one.''
</P>
<P>
   These minimalist, martial-arts campaigns didn't mean she
disliked politics; quite the opposite, in fact. ``Every six years,
she would drop what she was doing, get through this little
business, and do it quite happily and quite well,'' Moynihan said.
``And then she would get back to India.''
</P>
<P>
   In her range of interests, in the steel of her intellect,
Elizabeth Moynihan is just as remarkable and singular a character
as her husband. It's rare enough for a spouse to run four
successful campaigns in a state the size of New York while
disdaining the cocktail parties and superficiality of the
Washington social scene.
</P>
<P>
   It is rarer still for that spouse's abiding interest to be half
a world away, in the Mogul gardens of India, the graceful, ruined
landscapes of the 16th-century Muslim conquerors on which she has
become an acknowledged, self-trained expert.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, following her husband's three-year posting as
ambassador to India, she deduced the location of one of the most
elaborate gardens by studying the memoirs of the Emperor Babur, and
proceeded to dig it up, to the astonishment of Indian
archaeologists. She has since written extensively on the subject,
and is now overseeing another major project.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest began in 1966 after she heard an architectural
historian lecture at Harvard, where her husband was teaching. She
herself had dropped out of Boston University years before after
running out of money, having been raised by her divorced mother in
Cohasset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Her earlier interest had been in politics, particularly in the
work of Adlai Stevenson, and after meeting a not-dissimilar
political intellectual during W. Averell Harriman's 1954 campaign
for governor of New York, she married Pat Moynihan a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who have three grown children, are deeply entwined
but hardly inseparable. She stays away from most legislative
issues, often flying off to India on her own or with colleagues.
(She did, however, play a crucial role in helping to pass President
Clinton's economic plan in 1993, urging the wavering Sen. Bob
Kerrey to support the plan in a 50-50 vote.) But they revel in each
other's successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've helped him, and that makes me feel great,'' she
said. ``But we are not a twofer. The people of New York never
elected the two of us. After an election, I disappear, and spend a
lot of time with Babur.'' Soon, she says, the two men in her life
will each get a great deal more attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Alain DeJaham, with 38 cats is, by any
standard, a cat man.
</P>
<P>
   In denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not actually my cats,'' shrugs the 70-ish native of
the French West Indies. ``I just bought them a house.''
</P>
<P>
   DeJaham bought the West Palm Beach house for $60,000 in 1986.
It's in back of Proctor's, the restaurant he and his wife Trudy
own.
</P>
<P>
   These cats were freeloaders, drawn by the heavenly aromas of the
seafood restaurant's kitchen. All were captured by DeJaham and
neutered at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love animals,'' the restaurateur observes. ``Human beings
can take care of themselves. Animals should not suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurateur unlocks two double gates to the side yard of
the three-bedroom, seven-litter-box house, and walks into an
expanse of yard fenced top and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cats may be shy this morning because when I come in the
morning, it usually means I'm taking somebody to the vet.''
</P>
<P>
   A few cats approach to be petted, but others hurry away with
that quick cat gait that makes them appear to have 10 legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Dumpster,'' DeJaham says to a big fluffy lap cat who
can't wait for somebody to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   The house, decaying but clean, shows the Sign of the Claw on
walls and cabinets and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   By my calculations DeJaham presides over 400 pounds of cat. But
sitting on the back stoop, with cats cascading off his lap, he
makes it all sound, well, sensible.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Minette, a cat that lived at the
house until the people moved. The new people locked her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor cat would lay down in front of the house,'' DeJaham
says.
</P>
<P>
   When the new people moved, DeJaham, who lives in a house in Lake
Worth, bought the property. Minette moved back in. In turn, the
neutered and spayed cats joined her. The cat census once reached
46.
</P>
<P>
   Cat welfarism, he decided, has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are down to 38 since I lost Sabrina last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina?
</P>
<P>
   ``A nice little black cat. She died of feline leukemia,''
DeJaham says softly. ``She was wild. For months I fed her. She
would come and roll on the ground in front of me before she finally
let me pet her. Funny how you get attached.''
</P>
<P>
   DeJaham seems somehow unimpressed by his devotion to his furry
wards. How selfless is a commitment that gives him such pleasure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have hobbies, I don't play golf. Trudy and I, we love
animals. When I come over here in the afternoon to see the cats, it
is very calming somehow. I feel relaxed, at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fine scars on his hands? Love tokens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' he laughs. ``I have been bitten and scratched many
times catching wild cats. But when it happens, I hardly feel it. I
put the cat in a cage and someone brings me a towel for the blood.
I could tell you stories.''
</P>
<P>
   I love a good cat story, I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cat with a head like a dog's that used to come
around. It took me a long time to catch him, and when I did, I had
him neutered.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time the cat with the huge head came around, he was
wearing a collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems,'' said DeJaham, ``that I had neutered somebody's
pet.''

OUR TOWNS: POLICE FORCES THAT BECOME EXPENDABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTLANDT, N.Y. _ New Yorkers accustomed to waiting a half-hour
for a police car to show up after a purse-snatching would be
astonished at the personal service small-town and suburban
residents routinely get.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, neighbors in a Larchmont cul-de-sac were
alarmed to see first a police car, then an ambulance, then a
firetruck, pull up at the home of a young mother. Certain there had
been a tragedy, they rushed over only to find that the woman had
cut her finger in the kitchen and called 911 because she was afraid
she would faint and leave her baby unattended.
</P>
<P>
   In such tranquil communities, where as one mayor put it,
``nobody's shooting at you,'' people will pay handsomely for the
secure feelings that come with a local police force even if the
force is mostly a frill. In exchange they expect their officers to
act like good neighbors and not fall prey to such big-city vices as
salary padding, litigiousness and excessive disability claims.
</P>
<P>
   But in some cases it hasn't worked out that way. In the last few
years, four localities in the New York City region, most recently
this town of 29,000 in the craggy northwestern corner of
Westchester, have voted to abolish their police forces, turning
responsibility for safety over to the state police or the county
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Andy of Mayberry,'' said John Thomes, the mayor of
Pawling, which dumped its department last year. ``It's `Hi Barney,
how're you doing?' `Hi, Mrs. Thomes, can I help you with your
packages?' They expect the police to be part of the community, and
many of the police were not really interested in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Pawling, in Dutchess County, was fed up with officers calling in
sick minutes before the undesirable midnight shift. In Greenport,
on Long Island's North Fork, the villagers sacked the department
after a grand jury discovered kinky on-the-job shenanigans _ one
officer had sex with his girlfriend on the police chief's desk.
</P>
<P>
   In Cortlandt, four officers are out on disability leave for
job-related injuries that would not exactly inspire the
scriptwriters for ``N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' One officer fell off a ladder
in the record room. The police chief fell off a chair in the
dispatcher's room. Town leaders do not dispute the injuries as
legitimate but are upset that, under a widely abused state law,
they have to pay the officers full salaries, tax free, as if they
had been wounded during a holdup.
</P>
<P>
   The police have also been suing the town as if they were
ambulance chasers rather than ambulance escorts, filing 14 lawsuits
or complaints. The police chief once sued the town for free speech
violations after the town supervisor insisted on handling all
public announcements. And several officers went to court in 1996 to
get overtime for off-duty hardships like bringing their uniforms to
the dry cleaners and wearing beepers in case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The town settled the first suit for $260,000, but bad feelings
lingered. So when the town encountered huge expenses, it found that
it could save $850,000 by getting rid of the police on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Tom Diana warns that the town's action ``is kind of putting
up a billboard, `Criminals Come to Cortlandt.''' He boasts of how
his officers helped arrest a produce clerk suspected of selling
heroin alongside the heads of lettuce at the A &AMP; P in the Route 6
mall.
</P>
<P>
   But even Detective Jerry Underwood, whose big case involves
accusations of a caretaker swindling a 90-year-old man, talks of
his department more as a service organization than as a blue wall
against crime. It makes 7,000 calls annually, helping drivers who
have locked their their keys in their cars or homeowners whose
burglar alarms are accidentally tripped. With a wife, two children
and less than the 20 years needed to get a pension, he worries
mostly about supporting his family.
</P>
<P>
   Though the state police will not add officers and cannot be as
responsive as Cortlandt's police, there has been no groundswell of
protest. State troopers already handle the most serious crimes. And
residents have become used to doing without the police for part of
the day because, with officers on disability, the town turned its
midnight shift over to state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Residents seem prepared to wait a little longer for the law to
help them with everyday mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' said Thomas Wood, the town attorney, ``if
you come home and the mailbox is not there, instead of waiting 10
to 15 minutes for a response, you may have to wait 20 to 25
minutes.''

 &HT;    Feeling hot, hot, not!
 &HT;    WITH PBP-HOW-HOT, info box
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On the landscape of hot foods and
sauces, the Southwestern desert and Texas hills have given way to
the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   The hot sauces, salsas, marinades and other spicy offerings at
October's Fiery Foods Show in St. Petersburg, Fla., signified a
tropical heat wave. Mangoes, limes and passion fruit flavors are
helping to put a chill on the mouth-numbing, pure-pepper sauces
popular a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the trend is people looking for flavor in the
sauces today,'' said Dave DeWitt, publisher of Fiery Foods magazine
and the show's organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Caribbean has become a big influence,'' he said. ``Florida
is actually No. 3 in the U.S., after California and New Mexico in
the growing of hot peppers, and the number of sauce producers has
just exploded here.''
</P>
<P>
   Exotic fruits such as papaya, kiwi and guava are being added to
the pepper-vinegar-mustard based sauces for a popular sweet-hot
combination. Vegetables such as carrots and artichokes are showing
up in salsas to help perk up flavors. The heat of the peppers is
coming back down to earth, as hot sauce lovers demand something
more than just a burn from the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-sauce bottlers are expanding their lines to include
marinades, fruit salsas, jams, relishes and barbecue sauces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mixes and prepared-food categories are really the next
growth area,'' DeWitt said. Stew, entree bean dishes, casseroles
and breads are getting the heat treatment. Hot and spicy snack
foods continue to grow, with new hot chips, pretzels, even
pepper-laced espresso beans.
</P>
<P>
   Spicy beef jerky, prepared dips, hot candies and
habanero-studded cookies are being tested in select markets.
Fiesta's artichoke spinach cheese-dip mix was popular at the
Florida show; and Original Juan's jalapeno-stuffed olives had a big
following. ``Great in martinis!'' the pitchman said. The company's
Raspberry Jalapeno Passion marinade won first place in the Texas
foods show.
</P>
<P>
   Casa Noel of Albuquerque puts out a hot cornbread mix and bean
dips. The dry spices in their packet also can double as a meat rub.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat was kept in check in most of the new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about hot sauces or fiery foods, we mean things
that are not bland, but won't kill you. Those super-hot sauces . .
. are insane. People today want a melding of heat and flavor,''
DeWitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the super-hot sauces consist of just extract of
capsaicin, a component of peppers that produces the bite on the
back of your throat. Those sauces, such as Dave's Insanity and Da'
Bomb, are meant as an additive, not a food, DeWitt said. ``You
can't sit and eat those on foods, you have to add them to other
sauces just to get them to an edible level. They're more of a gag
gift, a `dare-you' product.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, bottler of Tahiti Joe's hot sauces in West Palm
Beach, agrees that flavor _ not insane heat _ is what the customers
today want. He said he has several sauces that hit that
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the typical base of vinegar and peppers _ he prefers
habaneros and jalapenos _ his Polynesian Hot Sauce includes garlic,
salsa, vegetable juices, a few drops of clam juice and Parmesan
cheese. The sauces have won national acclaim at the big pepper show
in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable flavors are behind Michael West's Bahama Hot Eggplant
Mango Salsa, which incorporates a sweet-hot flavor popular at this
show. The Key West bottler also has a pepper relish and hot pepper
sauce, Caribe Soul, flavored with habaneros.
</P>
<P>
   Swamp cabbage was likely the most unusual ingredient at the
show. Buddy Taylor of Felda, south of LaBelle, said his granny used
to make swamp cabbage (hearts of palm) pickles. They have a little
heat, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who tastes them loves them, so we decided to use
them in our line,'' he said. He makes Gator Sauce, Swamp Mustard,
Swamp Salsa and the Swamp Cabbage Pickles. But like most other
bottlers, he's a hobbyist. ``I used to be an agriculture inspector
in real life,'' he said, laughing. ``Now I do mostly catering and
making the sauces.''

 &HT;    When it comes to sauces, one man's heat is another man's fire
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just how hot are the hot sauces? And how
can you tell if it's too hot for you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Heat is subjective, no matter what,'' said Marlin Bensinger of
Cromtec, a North Palm Beach, Fla., laboratory. He tests pepper heat
for sauce makers, police departments and drug makers around the
world. An ingredient derived from hot peppers is used in protective
pepper sprays that police officers carry, and in certain drugs such
as sports creams and deep-heating rubs for arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peppers have a component called capsaicin that produces the
bite in the back of the throat when you swallow a pepper or pepper
sauce,'' Bensinger said.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, a doctor working in a drug company
came up with a method of measuring the heat in a pepper. He diluted
the extract of 1 gram of pepper until the bite in the back of the
throat disappeared, then calculated the dilution. The method was
called the Scoville unit rating system, named for the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, Bensinger said, the results varied, depending on
the tolerance of the taste-tester. ``We couldn't get a standard
reading in our own lab, much less from company to company, or
country to country,'' he said. India's testers could tolerate far
more heat than Westerners, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Bensinger took the variations out of the process by using
instruments instead of people to sample the peppers. The results
are still posted in Scoville units, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's hot _ and what's not?
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mouth gets past 10,000 Scoville units, flavor is
insignificant. You can't taste anything. I can't tell the
difference between 10,000 and 100,000 Scoville units. It's just
nasty, nasty, nasty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take Tabasco sauce, it's around 2,000 units. Take five
times Tabasco sauce's heat _ that's 10,000 units. After that point,
it's no longer fun, in my estimation. It's just painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-hot sauces made from the capsaicin extracts rate far above
10,000 units. The latest super-hot is called Da'Bomb, made from
habanero peppers. It registers 119,700 Scoville units. A warning
label on it says, ``Caution: Beyond Insanity.'' That refers to
Dave's Insanity Sauce, one of the original superhot products. It
registers at a mild-by-comparison 51,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog descriptions on these tell all: ``When a sauce gets
this hot, flavor is not really an issue. Pain is the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot sauce mail-order catalog, Mo' Hotta Mo' Betta, has
devised a chart using Scoville units for each sauce, to help diners
decipher the heat of the product. Here are their interpretations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Superhot: 5,000 units and above. (Da'Bomb, at 119,700 and
Endorphin Rush at 33,390 fall here).
</P>
<P>
   _ Hot: 1,000-4,999 units (Tabasco, 2,140, and Pickapeppa Red Hot
Sauce, 4,250 rank here).
</P>
<P>
   _ Medium: 500-999 (Jamaica Hellfire ranks 900)
</P>
<P>
   _ Mild: 1-499 (Dat'l Do It, from St. Augustine, is 120.)
</P>
<P>
   Bensinger said that Scoville units measure only the capsaicin,
and other ingredients in the sauces can make them even hotter than
their ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginger, black pepper, horseradish and mustard all can affect
the heat levels, yet won't show up in the Scoville,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of story: Read the labels, and taste them for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: In case of fire, have milk handy. It puts out the burn.

 &HT;    `Joe Black' a deadly dull 3 hours
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If life is like a box of chocolates in movieland, what is death
like?
</P>
<P>
   It's three hours of Brad Pitt looking like a sweet simpleton.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours of Anthony Hopkins introspecting before uttering
imitation pearls of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours of Claire Forlani looking demure, even though she's
a hotshot doctor and the beloved daughter of a gazillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Hours of gooey farewells that add new meaning to ``the long
goodbye.'' Hours spent at a beautiful Long Island mansion and Park
Avenue penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' is like paging through Architectural Digest,
and it at least serves some purpose by reintroducing a world of
manners and fine dining. Problem is, too much nonsense echoes down
those elegant marble halls.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that director Martin Brest and four screenwriters
fell in love with their own precious work. But can they spell
e-d-i-t-i-n-g?
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' spins the old Fredric March vehicle ``Death
Takes A Holiday.'' But Death takes leave of its senses in this
flick, a romantic-comedy mixing schmaltzy sermons with teasy soft
porn.
</P>
<P>
   As Death personified, Brad Pitt wants to learn why people cling
so to life. Could it be the ladies? To find out, Pitt settles on
Bill Parrish (Hopkins), a fabulously rich media mogul who also
happens to be a swell guy. (How convenient. The story might have
been more interesting if Death had knocked on the door of, say, a
Honduran hovel after a hurricane.)
</P>
<P>
   A deal is struck. Death in the guise of Joe Black will tug at
Bill's elbow as he goes about his life, which centers on his 65th
birthday party and a trite boardroom crisis involving a hostile
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But it's understood the game will be up eventually, and Bill
will have to take that long hike over the hill to the Great Beyond
_ literally long, and literally over a hill, to the accompaniment
of fireworks and swelling strings.
</P>
<P>
   Since Death is a rookie at this life thing, Pitt must act cute
and robotic, even moronic, as he discovers the pleasures of peanut
butter and Hopkins' daughter (Forlani). Both frequently stick to
the roof of his mouth. His pan really is dead most of the time, but
he manages to get some milage out of gentle comic situations. Now
if he would only comb that loopy strand of hair from his forehead.
It's more annoying than death.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is such a fine actor, he makes you believe there is
wisdom hidden in the banalities he's forced to deliver. Naturally
enough, after meeting Death, he spends much of the movie looking
rather distracted. But he brings genuine dignity and warmth to his
role. Too bad they are the only things genuine about his cartoonish
character, who would have been at home in a '30s movie.
</P>
<P>
   The best turns come from the supporting cast, especially Jake
Weber (``Dangerous Beauty'') as a Judas of a right-hand man. He's a
marvelous mixture of droll deviltry, and his blank stares at the
exasperating Joe Black are amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Kelley-Miller plays an elderly Jamaican woman whose illness
makes her welcome Death. She has a marvelous face and gets to
deliver the best speech in the movie, albeit in a
hard-to-understand island accent.
</P>
<P>
   This is a movie of long silences, with much of the acting done
facially. Brest (``Midnight Run'' and ``Scent of a Woman'') is a
proven director who employs a lot of eloquent close-ups, even
during a love-making scene that is more like a love-mugging scene
for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Brest also attends to a wealth of physical detail, lingering
over Bill's elegant lifestyle. No manner of pregnant pauses and
meaningful looks, though, can raise the film above muddled mush.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention it's three hours long? They sunk the Titanic
in that time.

 &HT;    Music professor strikes sad note after bassoon theft
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Somebody swiped John Kitts-Turner's
bassoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the 67-year-old music teacher and he'll tell you they stole
his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the professor emeritus at the University of Florida,
who for 32 years has taught generations of Gators music
appreciation, survey of music history and countless classes in
Renaissance and baroque music, walked into his campus office and
discovered the bassoon he has played nearly every day since 1962
gone.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's just a bassoon. Bassoons aren't exactly the Hope
Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Not to you, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Kitts-Turner's bassoon was named Elizabeth and had been the
object of his desire since he was 12. He started playing the
bassoon after his trumpet was lost during one of his military
family's many moves. The sixth-grader paid a visit to the music
office at his Montclair, N.J., public school to rent another
trumpet and found the only available instrument was a bassoon. Love
was instant.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was love instant, but it was resolute and as the years
unfolded, altered the course of his life.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, bassoon in tow, Kitts-Turner
attended Princeton University where he undertook a regimen of
pre-med classes and prepared to enter Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine. But before he could enroll in medical school, he visited
New York City where he met, totally by accident, one of the world's
foremost bassoonists, Leonard Sharrow. Sharrow agreed to teach him
and Kitts-Turner dropped any notion of being a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   About 1957 he moved to Indianapolis, enrolled in Butler
University to obtain his master's degree in music and joined the
Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. A few years later, he was called
to active duty as an artillery officer for the U.S. Army in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Kitts-Turner, he was stationed not far from the
world's premier maker of bassoons, Heckel.
</P>
<P>
   While the name may sound simple, the instrument is not. For us
commoners to understand what a Heckel bassoon truly is, let's turn
to Peter Klatt, owner of Forrest Music in Berkeley, Calif., and
industry liaison for the International Double Reed Society, the
26-year-old professional organization for bassoonists, oboists and
bag pipers (whose instruments comprise the family of double reeds).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bassoonists who play Heckel instruments will know their
(bassoon's) serial numbers while they forget their wife's
birthday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1831, Heckel builds bassoons to order. Their
measurements, bores and bocals (the curvey pipe that sticks out of
the side) are exact to the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't punch them out on a plastic machine. And yes,
they all sound different because so many different things go into a
Heckel,'' Kitts-Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting list for a Heckel is about three years and the cost
about $50,000. Only 50 to 60 are made each year, Klatt said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, after a two-year wait, Kitts-Turner paid 5,000 marks,
or about $1,250, and christened his prize Elizabeth, in honor of
all the boyhood bassoons he called Bessie. ``Continuity but
dignity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later Kitts-Turner joined the University of Florida
staff where he and Elizabeth helped start the Gainesville Symphony
Orchestra, the University of Florida Woodwind Quintet and Musica
Vera, the university's renaissance ensemble. He has also authored
compositions for cellos and pianos, recorders, flutes and even a
tuba. He also wrote, but hasn't published, an opera.
</P>
<P>
   News of the stolen bassoon has spread quickly across campus, and
indeed, the country.
</P>
<P>
   Students have been handing out fliers and checking pawn shops,
Kitts-Turner said. The campus police assigned a detective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing a concert . . . in the downtown plaza Sunday and
somebody came up and told me and I thought, `Oh my good Lord,'''
said John Monkus, a former student who also played with Musica
Vera.
</P>
<P>
   ``That bassoon would have to surface. It's almost like finding a
missing person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitts-Turner also posted a report on the International Double
Reed Society's bulletin board for stolen instruments, where Klatt
spotted it. He guesses if it turns up at all, it will be in ``Texas
or Oregon or somewhere far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bassoons are hard to fence, especially a Heckel. On the other
hand, there are a lot of people without principle who will buy
something at any price and they go will underground,'' he said.
``Chances are, whoever stole that bassoon didn't have a clue what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   And unless the bassoon is returned, the professor says he will
never play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play an instrument for 36 years, you play it almost
by metaphysics. It's part of me. Any other instrument would feel
grotesque. I'm 67 years old and I guess you have to quit sometime.
But I didn't want to quit like this.''

 &HT;    Students dropping out, tuning into computer industry
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Last year, University of Dayton sophomores David
Marshall and Kevin Guyton decided it was time to commit to their
dreams of success in the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to drop out of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my base classes behind me,'' said Guyton, 21, who with
Marshall founded Cyber Design, an Internet company in Buffalo, N.Y.
``A lot of (the remaining) classes were so obsolete that it was
more worthwhile to jump right into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair joined what some experts say is a growing trend of
tech-savvy college students forsaking the classroom for the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling Internet industry is expanding so quickly that
young entrepreneurs see opportunity everywhere, as long as they
grab it fast. And a nationwide shortage of programmers, network
administrators and other computer professionals is forcing
companies to throw lush salaries and perks at anyone with the right
skills _ regardless of whether they have a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're aggressively going after students,'' said Jeffrey A.
Hoffer, who teaches management information systems at the
University of Dayton. ``Right now, the pressure is even greater
(than ever), and it has probably come about in the past two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a climate that is changing college life for many students.
Some, fearful of losing an edge, try to combine full-time jobs with
heavy classloads. Others figure the brass ring won't wait another
year or two, and drop out.
</P>
<P>
   While this helps to feed the voracious maw of the information
industry, some worry it could backfire in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Those who leave school) tend to be the most aggressive, the
better students. They are the ones who become innovators,'' said
Oscar Garcia, a computer science professor at Wright State
University. ``In the short term, (companies) are satisfying a need.
In the long run, they are eating the seed corn.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students have always dropped out of school to join the
workforce, but the unique properties of the information age have
changed the equation.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, computer jocks are a rare commodity. Dan
Lohmeyer, head of the Miami Valley's Information Technology
Alliance, said 10 percent of tech jobs locally can't be filled,
which roughly matches the national picture.
</P>
<P>
   And by the year 2005, computer jobs in the Miami Valley are
expected to grow by 4.3 percent, compared to 1 percent for all
other occupations, according to the Ohio Bureau of Employment
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, therefore, must offer plenty of money and other
goodies to attract qualified employees.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Koop, an assistant professor of management information
systems at Wright State, said firms are offering her undergraduate
students salaries as high as $48,000, along with scholarships,
signing bonuses, and free computers.
</P>
<P>
   Koop said she doesn't mind passing along the companies' pleas,
which in some cases go beyond urgent. One firm, she said, was
installing a computer system when it lost two workers. The company
asked her to announce in class that it would hire students on the
spot and forget about experience _ it would also train them.
</P>
<P>
   The breakneck pace of change in the computer industry also is
making some students question the value of a college education.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Adelman, a senior research analyst with the U.S.
Department of Education, has studied the schooling of information
workers. His current project looks at help wanted ads in the
high-tech field, and he has discovered that many employers aren't
asking for college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new trend, where industry certification'' _ in
which people demonstrate prowess with specific operating systems,
languages and programs _ ``is becoming more important than a
degree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Arengo, a 24-year-old University of Dayton student, has seen
that at work. He has an internship with Bank One in Columbus, and
even though he works only part-time, the company sent him to a
two-day training session on Lotus Notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for school to keep up with that technology,''
he said. He is staying in college only because he thinks a degree
in management information services will give him more options.
</P>
<P>
   Some students try to balance classes and a high-tech job. Rob
Russell, a 23-year-old Wright State student, last year turned an
internship at the Enon offices of Speedway SuperAmerica into a
full-time programming job. He also took three classes.
</P>
<P>
   That meant getting up at 6:30 a.m., working until 5 p.m., taking
classes until 9:30 p.m., and studying until midnight or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very demanding,'' he said. ``I'm also a husband and a
father. It took time away from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the on-the-job experience was worth it. But the
University of Dayton's Hoffer worries such students are being
stretched too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like, `Oh, gee, I can go to work and take the
pressure off and relax,''' he said. ``They're really doing two
critical-thinking, demanding . . . kinds of activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are responding by cutting into their study time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Greg Wellinghoff, one of Hoffer's students, said those
who want to enter the computer industry had better get used to
heavy workloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be working 50 or 60 hours a week, which I think
is what a lot of students . . . do now,'' said Wellinghoff, who is
taking six classes while holding down two part-time jobs. ``I think
it better prepares us for that life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many colleges have changed to reflect the new reality _
Wright State, for instance, offers every class in management
information systems at night for the benefit of working students _
observers such as Lohmeyer wonder whether a four-year degree is
still relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business changes so quickly that it may be that two years
of education is enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, though, have come to believe in the importance of a
diploma. Amy Zeiser took a job at NCR in 1989 and put her Wright
State classes on the back burner. This year, she decided to quit
work and return to school full-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, I think the four-year degree is a good
thing,'' she said. ``I think (going without it) limits you in what
you can do and where you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Guyton, the Internet entrepreneur, says he plans to finish his
degree at the University of Dayton someday. But in the meantime,
his growing company demands all of his attention _ especially when
it comes to hiring.
</P>
<P>
   And no, he doesn't care about a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big deal at all,'' he said. ``I have never asked
for a college transcript. I don't care if they have a 2.0 (grade
point average) or a 4.0. I'm more concerned about their skills and
how they fit in with our team.''

 &HT;    Philanthropist, vets group work to raise cash for memorial
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Manalapan philanthropist Lois Pope has
given her time and money to help community theater, needy children
and finding a cure for paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Next on her list are the 2.2 million servicemen who were injured
defending their country.
</P>
<P>
   Pope's LIFE Foundation (Leaders in Furthering Education) and the
Disabled American Veterans have teamed up to raise money for a
memorial on the Mall in the nation's capital, officials of both
groups said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the next year, organizers will be working with the National
Park Service to design the memorial and select a location. Until
those decisions are made, it's not certain how much the monument
will cost.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of local veterans' groups said they will do
whatever they can to promote the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea,'' said Herbert Aronin, commander of
DAV Chapter 133 in Boca Raton. ``It's about time they did something
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope, 64, is the widow of the late National Enquirer Publisher
Generoso Pope, who sold the tabloid in 1989 for $412.5 million. She
took up the cause after a visit to the Vietnam Memorial on the
Mall, where the name of her first cousin, Richard Allen Jursak, is
etched in the black granite wall, a foundation spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope's concern for disabled vets actually goes back 40 years,
when she was an actress and singer on Broadway and performed in a
show to benefit veterans, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman said she did not know how much money Pope
intended to contribute to the memorial. Pope was in Washington and
was unavailable for comment Wednesday.

 &HT;    Ban on clothing, jewelry for student safety, Ohio officials say
 &HT;    By Margo Rutledge Kissell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Xenia eighth-grader Larry Bumgardner said he
sports a five-point star earring because he thinks it looks cool
and it's in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to wear it,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Warner Junior High School official told the 14-year-old not to
wear the earring because it is considered a gang-related symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The principal suspended Bumgardner for three days for
insubordination after he continued to wear it. His mother appealed
the principal's decision, which was upheld by a district hearing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Xenia Community School District has a policy banning
students from wearing clothing or jewelry identifying gang symbols
because they create a threatening, intimidating and distracting
school environment.
</P>
<P>
   Xenia Police DARE officer Kathee Bridges, who trains educators
in the district on gang issues and what to look for, said
five-point and six-point stars are known symbols for certain gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Bumgardner returned to school Tuesday without the earring, but
says he was treated unfairly. Though he said he was aware the star
is a gang symbol, he maintains he didn't wear it for that reason
and denies any gang affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   He claims other students wear the same star earrings but they
have not been suspended. School officials said they deal with these
types of issues when they see a violation or it is brought to their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they are not accusing Bumgardner of being
in a gang.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, Susan Keefer, said she told her son to
continue wearing the earring after a first warning Oct. 30. He was
informed of the three-day suspension on Nov. 4.

   Keefer, said she believes the district has violated his right to
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole gang thing has gotten out of control,'' she said.
``When it has gotten to the point of telling what kids can wear,
it's time to quit (the practice).''
</P>
<P>
   Xenia Community Schools Superintendent James Smith said the Ohio
Revised Code grants school districts the authority to set
guidelines on what students can and cannot wear to school. He said
student safety is their chief concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we are doing is trying to control an atmosphere that is
educationally sound and safe,'' Smith said. ``That is what the
public wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Daniels, litigation coordinator for the American Civil
Liberties Union of Ohio, said the organization is often contacted
by people who feel school districts have become too restrictive on
clothing and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools have a wide range of latitude to control how exactly
students present themselves at school,'' he said. Daniels considers
it ``a judgment call. When you start doing that, you can see a gang
symbol or disruption of the school in anything.''

 &HT;    Other Ricky might break records too
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He sports no tattoos, couldn't twist his hair
into dreadlocks even if he wanted to, is short, small and
dreadfully quiet.
</P>
<P>
   They call him ``Little Ricky,'' not because of his diminutive
stature but because it is the way to tell him apart from the guy
with the same name that they used to call ``Little Earl.'' (Long
story.)
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams _ Texas Tech's Ricky Williams _ has played his
college career in the shadow of the University of Texas' Ricky
Williams, who on Saturday will be on Little Ricky's home turf
trying to: A) Sew up the Heisman Trophy; B) Break Tony Dorsett's
all-time NCAA Division I-A rushing record of 6,082 yards (he needs
204 yards); and, C) Win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Though relegated to the shadows this season, Tech's Ricky may
someday find himself with at least one similarity to the other
Ricky: he could _ and it's a leap _ have a shot at the NCAA
all-time career rushing mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought about (the career rushing record),''
Williams said. ``I am trying to take my career one year at a time.
Dorsett's rushing record looks like an attainable goal for any
successful running back that has four good years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Texas') Ricky Williams is a great back and he will have a
great NFL career. I can only hope to have some of the same
successes as him in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   First things first. Up at Wisconsin, there's a back with a great
shot of erasing Dorsett and whatever number Williams posts. Through
31 career games, and with two more left in this season, junior Ron
Dayne has run for 4,415 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely Dayne will return for his senior season, however.
Word out of Madison after last season was that he was ready to turn
pro and would have, if not for the NFL policy that only players
who've been in college three years (including redshirt seasons) are
eligible for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not really thought about my senior season yet,'' Dayne
said. ``I am just concentrating on games right now. I don't really
think about individual records, I think of the team's success. If
staying for my senior year would help me improve as a player, then
I would consider returning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Lewis of Tennessee might have been in that company, too,
had he not torn up his knee in a win against Auburn this year, at
which point he had run for 1,862 yards in 12 games as a freshman
last year and four as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Tech's Williams (a.k.a. Ricky Lite, to some in
Lubbock) a shot, albeit a long shot, to make a record run, too:
</P>
<P>
   -He will likely finish his sophomore season with 2,400 yards,
setting him up for a strong run in his junior and senior seasons.
</P>
<P>
   -Only one starter is lost from Tech's offensive line next year
and fullback Sammy Morris, considered an NFL prospect, returns
after sitting out this season for academic reasons. Both starting
offensive tackles, Jonathan Gray and Steve McFadden, are only
sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   -Unlike Tech's Byron Hanspard, whose freshman school rushing
mark Williams broke, Williams is unlikely to leave school early. At
5 feet 7 inches, 182 pounds and without blazing speed, he'll be a
good college back but only an average pro prospect.
</P>
<P>
   -He's more durable than his size would indicate. In two seasons
he hasn't missed a game, and his only injury of note _ a sprained
ankle that knocked him out of the Missouri game two weeks ago _
will not keep him out of Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams may not be alone. Though teams have been trending
toward fewer and fewer rushing yards, 1998 has been a year when
career records have been assaulted with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Longhorn Ricky Williams' bid to break Dorsett's record has
garnered the most publicity, but career marks in rushing, scoring
and all-purpose yardage have already fallen in two of the other
three NCAA divisions:
</P>
<P>
   -Brian Shay of Emporia (Kan.) State ran for 213 yards against
Central Missouri on Oct. 24 to break the 8-year-old Division II
record of 6,320 set by Johnny Bailey of Texas A&AMP;I (now
A&AMP;M-Kingsville) and become the NCAA's all-time rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   Shay, who also holds NCAA records for scoring and all-purpose
yardage, has one game left _ against Northwest Missouri on Saturday
_ to add to his total of 6,785 yards.
</P>
<P>
   -Jerry Azumah of New Hampshire broke the Division I-AA career
rushing mark on the same day Shay set the all-divisions record.
Azumah, who also has one game left, against Rhode Island on
Saturday, holds division records for rushing (6,006), scoring (424
points) and all-purpose yardage (8,115). -We might be talking about
a Division III record, too, if Ray Neosh of Coe College didn't need
to take a year off to, in the words of the school's sports
information director, ``find himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Neosh finished his junior year with 4,273 yards, within striking
distance of the division record of 6,125 set by Coe's Carey Bender.
Coe is hopeful that Neosh will return next season to make a run at
the national mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since January, no story has seemed more
engrossing to American audiences, or more illustrative of American
immaturity, than the saga of the president and the intern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, even as pictures of Monica Lewinsky eclipsed those of
Princess Diana and Leonardo DiCaprio on the newsstands, I heard
once again the two-century-old cliche that Americans are puerile
and puritanical.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as the principal victims of a media culture that has
spread throughout the world, Americans appeared to be hypnotized by
the tales of presidential sex in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of my European friends regarded the American
fixation on the scandal as a menace to international stability,
since it threatened to remove from office the leader of the world's
only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw it as a symptom of how the American media turns it
audiences at home, and potentially abroad, into passive receptacles
for hype and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Election Day, America's infantile obsessions mysteriously
vanished. Did the American voter turn out to be a European-style
adult after all? Was the electorate willing at last to distinguish
between a president's private life, and his public policies? Or did
European critics and American pundits alike overestimate the power
of the media to influence what people think and how they act?
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that for nearly a year Americans have been
deluged with stories about President Bill Clinton's misbehavior,
and with prophecies of his imminent resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings and sales figures do not lie. The weekly newsmagazines,
as well as CNN and MSNBC, all saw their audiences expand with each
sensational revelation. The presidential ``crisis'' became a staple
for radio talk-show hosts and for the more solemn interviews with
politicians on the Sunday morning television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood contributed to the pandemonium. Although the movie
version of ``Primary Colors'' was more successful at attracting
publicity than at seducing ticket-buyers, ``Wag the Dog'' entered
the lexicon as a scenario for using war to distract attention from
White House improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The election's astonishing results do not necessarily signify
that Americans are indifferent to the sexual transgressions of
their leaders. But the results do suggest that the U.S.
communications industry has far less impact on audiences than is
usually claimed by those who fear the global ascendancy of American
mass culture.
</P>
<P>
   People in America (and in other countries, too) are not
permanently plugged in to their television sets or the Internet.
They spend much of their time doing, and caring about, other
things.
</P>
<P>
   They are swayed not by the media's preoccupations but by their
own concerns _ by how they were raised, by the opinions of their
peers, by the pressures they encounter at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   What the election also indicates is that people are selective in
their reactions to mass culture. Audiences tend to be skeptical,
accepting some information while distrusting most of what they
hear. It is not just that people reinterpret the media's messages
to suit their needs. More often, they simply discard whatever has
no relevance to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   This mistrust of the media may be a sign not only of America's
growing maturity, but also of its loss of faith in heroes of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests showing that Thomas Jefferson had an affair with a
slave have not endangered his place in the pantheon of American
political leaders. But the news does make him appear more human,
and thus more Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   As for the decline in the stature of journalists, recall the
scene that ends the movie ``All the President's Men.'' Robert
Redford and Dustin Hoffman, Hollywood's incarnations of Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, are pounding away at their typewriters
while on a television screen Richard Nixon's presidency is seen to
disintegrate.

<P>
   PARIS _ The year is 2002. President George W. Bush issues a
stern warning to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that unless he
complies with United Nations weapons inspection demands, he will
face possible military action by America.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is highly likely regardless of who occupies the
White House then. Still, it would be ironic if more than a decade
after his father first tangled with Saddam, another President Bush
finds himself in yet one more showdown with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   As another confrontation ripens this week, it's becoming
increasingly evident that the test of wills between the superpower
and the relatively minor Middle East dictator may turn into an
endless standoff.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Saddam has moved from a willingness to risk
defying the United States because he would have nothing to lose to
a belief that every act of defiance would reap positive political
dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Europe and the Middle East are fed up with the crisis
and regard Washington as obsessed by a desire to somehow punish the
brute of Baghdad for surviving the 1991 Persian Gulf war despite
predictions that the military disaster he suffered in the brief
conflict would lead to his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems of weapons inspection aside, Saddam's continued
presence is humiliating to the Americans,'' says French political
analyst Georges Suffert.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the whole world is suffering from a strong case of
Saddam fatigue. Except for the United States and Britain, no
government is ready to provide military support for another
campaign. Hardly anyone agrees that raining more cruise missiles on
Iraq will accomplish much, other than to win sympathy elsewhere in
the world for the Iraqis and thus strengthen their leader's
position. The truth is that a number of governments now primarily
blame Washington, rather than Baghdad, for stirring up trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Saddam Hussein isn't going to be overthrown.
His opposition at home is, if anything, weaker than it was when he
invaded Kuwait in 1990. He is going to be around for some time.
</P>
<P>
   British arms expert James Fitzgerald, writing in the London
Daily Telegraph, said it may ``never be possible'' to prove
conclusively whether Iraq is continuing to produce weapons of mass
destruction. Therefore, he added, the issue ``may have no
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century historian Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote that
certain political questions were so complex that there was no way
of satisfactorily solving them.
</P>
<P>
   He might almost have had the struggle between America and Iraq
in mind.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since January, no story has seemed more
engrossing to American audiences, or more illustrative of American
immaturity, than the saga of the president and the intern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, even as pictures of Monica Lewinsky eclipsed those of
Princess Diana and Leonardo DiCaprio on the newsstands, I heard
once again the two-century-old cliche that Americans are puerile
and puritanical.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as the principal victims of a media culture that has
spread throughout the world, Americans appeared to be hypnotized by
the tales of presidenial sex in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of my European friends regarded the American
fixation on the scandal as a menace to international stability,
since it threatened to remove from office the leader of the world's
only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw it as a symptom of how the American media turns it
audiences at home, and potentially abroad, into passive receptacles
for hype and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Election Day, America's infantile obsessions mysteriously
vanished. Did the American voter turn out to be a European-style
adult after all? Was the electorate willing at last to distinguish
between a president's private life, and his public policies? Or did
European critics and American pundits alike overestimate the power
of the media to influence what people think and how they act?
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that for nearly a year Americans have been
deluged with stories about President Bill Clinton's misbehavior,
and with prophecies of his imminent resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings and sales figures do not lie. The weekly newsmagazines,
as well as CNN and MSNBC, all saw their audiences expand with each
sensational revelation. The presidential ``crisis'' became a staple
for radio talk-show hosts and for the more solemn interviews with
politicians on the Sunday morning television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood contributed to the pandemonium. Although the movie
version of ``Primary Colors'' was more successful at attracting
publicity than at seducing ticket-buyers, ``Wag the Dog'' entered
the lexicon as a scenario for using war to distract attention from
White House improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   The election's astonishing results do not necessarily signify
that Americans are indifferent to the sexual transgressions of
their leaders. But the results do suggest that the U.S.
communications industry has far less impact on audiences than is
usually claimed by those who fear the global ascendancy of American
mass culture.
</P>
<P>
   People in America (and in other countries, too) are not
permanently plugged in to their television sets or the Internet.
They spend much of their time doing, and caring about, other
things.
</P>
<P>
   They are swayed not by the media's preoccupations but by their
own concerns _ by how they were raised, by the opinions of their
peers, by the pressures they encounter at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   What the election also indicates is that people are selective in
their reactions to mass culture. Audiences tend to be skeptical,
accepting some information while distrusting most of what they
hear. It is not just that people reinterpret the media's messages
to suit their needs. More often, they simply discard whatever has
no relevance to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   This mistrust of the media may be a sign not only of America's
growing maturity, but also of its loss of faith in heroes of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests showing that Thomas Jefferson had an affair with a
slave have not endangered his place in the pantheon of American
political leaders. But the news does make him appear more human,
and thus more Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   As for the decline in the stature of journalists, recall the
scene that ends the movie ``All the President's Men.'' Robert
Redford and Dustin Hoffman, Hollywood's incarnations of Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, are pounding away at their typewriters
while on a television screen Richard Nixon's presidency is seen to
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the media's power never seemed more noble. Today, its
ability to shape events has never seemed more negligible. &QL;

   LONDON _ A leading arms control group is calling on all powers
to de-activate _ or ``de-couple'' in the jargon of Doomsday
planning _ their weapons, to avoid possible massive and hugely
perilous systems failures brought on by the so-called ``Millennium
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report published Thursday, the British American Security
Information Council (BASIC) bluntly describes the Pentagon's
efforts to meet the fast-approaching deadline as ``a mess,'' with
what it calls ``severe and recurring problems across the
spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, it says, has for its part barely woken up to the year
2000, or Y2K, risk _ even though the general decay of its military
since the demise of the Soviet Union has made the danger even more
acute.
</P>
<P>
   For all the visible work already done to iron out the date
recognition problem, BASIC argues there is no way of knowing if
``embedded'' systems _ i.e. semi-independent
``systems-within-systems'' in the colossal American defense
apparatus _ are being straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   These could allow the YK2 bug to spread, unknown to America's
defense controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing and testing affected systems could see costs ``in the
multibillion dollar category,'' with no guarantee of success. As
the U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said recently,
``Everything is so interconnected, it's very hard to know with any
precision that we've got it fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to BASIC, the biggest YK2 danger is not the ultimate
nightmare of nuclear weapons either launching or exploding because
of faulty computer information. Since it still requires human
authorization for a missile or warhead to be launched, this sort of
catastrophe is ``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Far more likely, however, is the prospect of a leader, under
pressure from hairtrigger response mechanisms, pressing the nuclear
button on the basis of inaccurate data.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real significance of September's early warning
agreement between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in
Moscow, which BASIC would like to see leading to a joint and
independent nuclear warning center independent of the two national
defense bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Such a U.S.-Russian agreement should form the basis of a broader
pact between all nuclear weapons states, declared and undeclared.
Even so, given both sides' desire to keep a first-strike capacity,
the danger of a rogue launch would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, says BASIC, to separate warheads from their delivery
vehicles, and thus dramatically increase the amount of time needed
to launch an attack. &QL;

<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, difficult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, difficult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

<P>
   Why is there a new crisis in the Gulf?
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 Gulf War the U.N. told Iraq to disclose what
preparations it had made to build weapons of mass destruction, and
dismantle them. But it has fought against this regime for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Iraq severely limited the activities of U.N. weapons
inspectors and, earlier this month, it halted them altogether. It
demanded an end to U.N. sanctions, but the U.S. blocked this. Now
the U.S. and Britain are threatening to attack unless Iraq lets the
weapons inspectors start their work again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the latest of his famous miscalculations, Saddam
Hussein expected Clinton to lose the midterm elections, and thought
that impending impeachment would leave the discredited president no
choice but to let him get away with it. Instead the opposite is
true.
</P>
<P>
   Can the U.S. and Britain strike at any time?
</P>
<P>
   It is arguable whether they need further U.N. approval. The U.S.
tends to argue that it doesn't, because the original U.N.
resolutions contain all the authorization necessary, whereas
Britain leans towards gathering as much diplomatic support as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is major military action?
</P>
<P>
   More so, probably, than at any time since the 1991 Gulf War.
Saddam's latest defiance, at the very moment the U.N. was ready to
set a timetable for lifting sanctions, has exasperated even
countries like France which had previously argued against the
military option.
</P>
<P>
   What are the likely targets of an attack?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. would first have to take out Iraq's air defense system.
It would probably target the remaining sites where Iraq is
suspected to be building weapons of mass destruction, but
Washington admits that it would be impossible to destroy its
capacity to build chemical and biological weapons from the air.
</P>
<P>
   More likely is an assault on command and control sites,
communications, and targets linked to Saddam Hussein's inner
political circle, including the Republican Guard.
</P>
<P>
   What would be the objective of an assault?
</P>
<P>
   That is less clear. A large-scale attack would virtually rule
out putting the weapons inspectors back into Iraq. The U.S. has
recently approved new aid for the Iraqi opposition, and is trying
to build a strategy to replace Saddam in the long term. But there
is little evidence that it has thought through any effort to
overthrow him now. More likely is a punitive attack.
</P>
<P>
   How soon might it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, by the time you open this newspaper. The U.S.
already has the force in place to launch airstrikes at Iraqi
military targets, and insists it has all the authorization it needs
from existing U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, probably not for 10 days or a fortnight. This would
allow time for a formal deadline to be given Baghdad, and for a
further build-up of allied forces, including ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   What could stop it?
</P>
<P>
   A climb-down by Saddam, in which he not only promises but
delivers full compliance with U.N. weapons inspectors. This is
still possible but not very likely. Or a blanket opposition by
Washington' s Arab allies to the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is this ? The $64,000 question. The U.S. maintains it
has broad and strong backing in the region for punitive action
against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is less clear, and has been blurred further by
Israel's footdragging over the Wye accords, raising the old
question of double standards.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big powers, Britain is solid with Washington, as
(apparently) is France. Russia and China

SOCIAL SECURITY FIGHT COULD ROIL DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was the mantra of Democratic candidates and a
key element in their surpise gains in last week's election: ``Save
Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   But as President Clinton tries to figure out just how to save
the federal retirement program, he runs the risk of alienating the
Democratic coalition that gave the party five new House seats and
that Al Gore will need to run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals, minorities, and organized labor _ groups whose
standing in the Democratic Party was streng-thened by their turnout
in the Nov. 3 elections _ vehemently oppose privatizing any part of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is at least considering ways to allow individuals to
divert a portion of their payroll taxes to personal retirement
investment accounts. Such a proposal would test Democratic unity
and open a debate of seismic proportions in the next Congress and
possibly through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It well could be the defining fight for a generation,'' said
Gerry Shea, an AFL-CIO government affairs official. ``That's the
kind of magnitude it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum clearly has been building for action to fix the
program. House Republicans want Social Security, a potent political
issue for Democrats, out of the way before the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who is
poised to replace Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House, says that
repairing the program _ which will be paying out more money in
retirement checks in 20 to 30 years than it will collect in payroll
taxes if nothing is done _ is now the GOP's highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is believed to want a major second-term
accomplishment so historians won't judge his presidency solely on
his affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, seems
in the mood to give up the issue as a political weapon in order to
fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want that fix to include private accounts, and there
are some Democrats who agree, including Senators Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. Last spring they
proposed putting part of Social Security revenues into personal
investment accounts and gradually raising the retirement age to 70.
</P>
<P>
   In one comment that worried labor leaders, Clinton said in July
that he would favor investment accounts over cutting benefits or
raising the payroll tax. Most Democrats, or at least the hard-core
base, favor nips and tucks, such as raising the taxable wage and
cutting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats fear that introducing private accounts would open
the door to replacing the entire Social Security system with
private pensions. These Democrats also argue that privatization
would make the projected shortfall worse by taking away a big chunk
of money used to fund the program and offer a bad deal to
low-income workers who now get more benefits out of Social Security
than they pay in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Though White House officials haven't publicly tipped their hand,
one Senate Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said: ``Some signals we have gotten from the White House
is that privatization is actively under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group at the White House in favor of this,
recognizing it goes outside the box,'' the aide said. The aide
added that it is in line with Clinton's frequent strategy of
compromising on Democratic principles to trump Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, the aide said, is whether the president will hew to
a more traditional line or be willing to break with traditional
Democrats to cut a deal with the Republican majority. ``We are all
waiting to see what's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Munnel, a Boston College economist and former member of
the Clinton administration's Council of Economic Advisers, said:
``This is a very delicate and difficult issue for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the consensus view is that they are mulling over the
notion of introducing individual accounts for parts of the
program,'' Munnel said. ``It's not clear they are going to go with
individual accounts in the end. When you think of it from Gore's
perspective, it's very tricky. If they do something that is
perceived as harming Social Security in some way, that would
certainly be used against the vice president in any campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist took it a step further. ``Gore is part
of this administration, and if the administration walks down this
path that is anathema for a lot of Democrats ... somebody is going
to walk into that breach,'' the strategist said, ticking off the
names of former Senator Bill Bradley, House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, and Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic operative close to Gore said that Clinton ``will
protect Gore with the Democratic constituency'' in finding
consensus on Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the vice president will have to do much lobbying
at all,'' the source said. ``You don't go into these negotiations
saying this is off the table. In the end, it's going to be a
bipartisan deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a legacy issue to fix Social Security, and Gore
would share in that,'' the source added.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, Gephardt's communications director, said the
minority leader was concerned about the implications of privatizing
parts of Social Security and how that would be done. An aide to
Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy said: ``He feels that such
efforts will provide a windfall for Wall Street and a setback for
Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said the White House and Democrats in the House and
Senate had agreed to seek a Democratic consensus before considering
other options.
</P>
<P>
   Max Richtman, executive vice president of the Committee to
Preserve Social Security, said his grass-roots lobbying group
planned to press its case against private accounts at the White
House as soon as Friday, when some of its members attend a planning
session for a presidential forum on Social Security next month. The
committee's political action committee poured about $1 million into
US House campaigns in the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Shea of the AFL-CIO said that though ``we think this president
has generally listened to working families,'' the group is leaving
nothing to chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gearing up a mobilization effort,'' he said, ``primarily
to influence the congressional debate, but with an eye cocked
toward the White House.''

IN KOSOVO, DISTRUST IS THE ONLY PERMANENT RESIDENT

<P>
   KIJEVO, Yugoslavia _ There is an inverse relationship between
fear and security in Kosovo. When the Albanians are scared, the
Serbs feel safe. The reverse is also true.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly three weeks after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pulled most of his troops from Kosovo to avert NATO air
strikes, Albanians continue to return to their homes, and Serbs
continue to leave theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Blagoje Ristic wishes he could be one of the latter. But the
63-year-old Serbian farmer only flirts with the idea of trying to
join relatives in Illinois. He knows his life is here, on the land.
But that doesn't mean he has to like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the summer, we haven't had water or electricity,'' he
said, standing near the well that is his family's source of water.
``The Albanians cut off the water and electricity. We have no
shops. We are imprisoned in this village. The Albanians want to
expel us.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the few predominantly Serb villages in Kosovo, a
Serbian province of 2 million that is at least 90 percent ethnic
Albanian. It is a small place, with one street about a mile long
that knifes through farms held by the same families for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   There are police checkpoints on either end of the village, the
villagers and police say, to guard against murderous attacks by the
Kosovo Liberation Army, a group of Albanian separatists. To the
local Serbs, the KLA are terrorists, bent on ethnically cleansing
Kosovo of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That the Albanians, and many in the international community,
accuse the Serbs of ethnically cleansing them over the past year
rings hollow with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have eyes,'' says a local man. ``Who do you see in Kosovo?
Albanians or Serbs?''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in Kosovo feel isolated and increasingly cut off from the
rest of Serbia. They sense that, with the international community
and media sympathetic to the Albanians, it's only a matter of time
before they get sold down the river.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many Serbs are leaving. Because census data are
unreliable _ Albanians boycott the census, refusing to recognize
the Belgrade regime _ it is hard to say for sure how many Serbs are
left. But US officials in Belgrade believe it is far less than the
10 percent figure normally cited. One diplomat in Belgrade believes
there are only about 100,000 Serbs left in Kosovo, and that that
number is decreasing every day.
</P>
<P>
   If the Serbs continue to leave in great numbers, Milosevic's
argument for holding on to Kosovo would be seriously weakened. Many
Serbian dissidents and western diplomats believe that Milosevic's
interest in Kosovo is more politically expedient than sincere, and
that he used the prospect of Albanians taking over to whip up
nationalist fervor to shore up his support.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Serbs in Kosovo are also beginning to
believe that Milosevic cares little about them in the long run. But
there are also those who believe that Milosevic can't afford to let
Kosovo go, because that would inevitably lead Montenegro, which
with Serbia forms the Yugoslav Federation, to sue for independence.
</P>
<P>
   What seems obvious is that many Serbs in Serbia care little
about Kosovo, despite its purported spiritual and emotional
importance to the national psyche. Kosovo is the site of an
important Orthodox monastery and shrine, and also the place where
the Serbian identity is traced to a 14th century battle that the
Serbs lost to the Ottomans.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with three dozen Serbs in and around the capital
of Belgrade found that while nearly all of them could wax
philosophical about the importance of Kosovo to Serbia, none of
them had ever set foot there.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a US diplomat in
Belgrade found that his experience in Serbia produced similar
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Serbs,'' he said, ``don't care about Kosovo, have never
gone there, and wouldn't want their sons to fight and die there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jovan Djokic agrees with that assessment. As one of the few
Serbs in Belgrade who regularly visits Kosovo, he believes it is
only a matter of time before the province is made an autonomous
republic or given up for good.
</P>
<P>
   Djokic, who works as a professional driver, grew up ``hearing
and singing epic songs, about Kosovo, how we all come from Kosovo.
We were taught that in school.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 45, he thinks it was all nationalistic hype. He
accepts that Serbian police and troops overreacted and killed
scores of Albanian civilians in their zeal to crush the KLA, and
regrets that they did so in his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really bothers me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he also thinks the KLA are criminals who use their own
people as pawns, and that Albanians have a better standard of
living under Serbia than they ever would under a wider Albania, the
poorest country in Europe. He thinks Albanians in Kosovo are
foolish and stubborn, and that they should cut a deal with
Milosevic which would be mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many things in Kosovo,'' he says, ``but common sense
is not among them.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the idea of Kosovo being ethnically cleansed either
by force or by fear is anethma to western, and especially, American
diplomacy, which has always maintained that a multi-ethnic,
power-sharing democracy is necessary to create a stable Balkans,
whether in Kosovo or Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats now believe that Kosovo is so polarized, not just
by ancient history but by the last nine months of hardship and
atrocities, that the more realistic solution is to let the
Albanians have their republic within the Yugoslav Federation, or
maybe even independence. The State Department in Washington, at
least publicly, does not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the farm, Blagoje Ristic says he has two sons, one a
policeman, the other working for the telephone company. While
Albanians see the police as oppressors and murderers, Ristic sees
his son and other policemen as the only thing holding Albanians
back from killing him and the other Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few Albanian homes in Kijevo, all of them
obvious because of the walls that, in Muslim tradition, surround
them, all of them empty and partially destroyed. Ristic doesn't
know what happened to those homes, or why.
</P>
<P>
   His wife piped in, ``The Albanians all went away. We didn't
force them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut up about that,'' her husband said harshly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a softer tone, he said, ``When the police were here, we
were safe. Now they are gone, and we are afraid.''

MURDER CASE SPURS DEATH-PENALTY PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As a jury continued to deliberate the fate of Salvatore
Sicari, death penalty supporters prepared to make him and Charles
Jaynes, the accused killers of Jeffrey Curley, their prime examples
of the need for capital punishment _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly a year ago, outrage over Curley's murder pushed
support for the death penalty to a recent high, falling just one
vote short in the Legislature. Now, with a newly elected Governor
Paul Cellucci making capital punishment a top promise, and the
Legislature reportedly deadlocked on the issue, supporters hope a
fresh dose of outrage over the Curley murder can put them over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely a springboard,'' Kathy A. Callahan, founder
of Massachusetts Majority for the Death Penalty, said of the
verdict. ``I feel that in the most egregious cases of murder and
premeditation, to have the death penalty on the books draws a
powerful and visible distinction, the kind that needs to be drawn
in our seemingly boundary-less society.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the ubiquitous image of the baseball-capped
10-year-old _ who was kidnapped, killed, sodomized and dumped in a
Maine River _ fueled anger, a thirst for vengeance, and, most
importantly, swayed public opinion to look more favorably on
capital punishment in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as camera crews rim the Middlesex courthouse, area
death-penalty supporters _ who mobilized last year in Curley's
honor and generated petitions listing about 60,000 names to nudge
the debate _ want to capitalize on the verdict, whatever it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This verdict is not going to lead to a death penalty in this
case,'' Callahan said. ``Whichever way this sentence goes, one of
the strategies will be to initiate another petition drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, a social worker, formed the grassroots group last year
out of horror over Curley's murder, and, months ago, registered the
group to lobby on the issue. While lobbying has so far largely
involved only conversations with legislators, she plans to use the
trials of Sicari and Jaynes to build momentum, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is of the essence in this debate. Cellucci plans to make
the death penalty measure among his first initiatives of the new
legislative session, which begins in January, said Ilene Hoffer.
Head counts are already being taken to gauge support and _ while it
remains deadlocked, according to a survey by a Globe columnist _
supporters thinks the trend is moving toward passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten closer and closer every year to the point where it
was basically in a tie, a one-vote issue last year,'' Hoffer said.
``This is the year it will finally pass the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a firm vote in the Senate, the House sacked a
conference committee report on the strength of one, unexpected vote
switch by Representative John P. Slattery, a Peabody Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his now famous change of heart and election campaigning
against him by the governor, Slattery was reelected by a wide
margin last week. Now, he says, he stands firm in his opposition _
saying the judicial process is ``fraught with human frailties''
that could lead to errors _ but he questions the governor's
commitment to the death penalty issue. Cellucci, once an opponent
of the death penalty, also switched his stance several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three Republicans who voted against the death
penalty and I don't believe he campaigned against them,'' he said,
alleging the governor's actions were designed more to build party
loyalty than further the cause of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents are also paying attention to head counts in the
Legislature, said Joshua Rubenstein, northeast regional director
for Amnesty International. Regardless of the horror of a particular
crime, Rubenstein said, Amnesty International will not use Curley,
since the death penalty debate transcends the disturbing details of
any one case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, opponents plan to point to the rising number of wrongful
convictions in death-penalty cases around the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Sicari, 22, of Cambridge, befriended
Curley and enticed him from his East Cambridge neighborhood with
the promise of a new bicycle. Sicari told police that Jaynes, 23,
of Brockton, suffocated the boy with a gasoline-soaked rag in the
back seat of Jaynes's Cadillac when he refused to have sex with
him. Police said the two put the boy's body in a container filled
with concrete and dumped it into a Maine river. ``I lived in
Cambridge when it happened, I have a young son _ what happened was
unspeakable,'' Rubenstein said. ``Whoever did it deserves to be
boiled in oil, but I don't want the state of Massachusetts to have
the right to decide.''

SCHOOL AID SUIT CITES A HISTORY OF BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal lawsuit filed in March by parents of Catholic
school students is designed to overturn a little-known 19th century
amendment they say was motivated by sheer anti-Catholic bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment to the state Constitution, made in 1854, bars
public funding of sectarian schools and was written, historians
agree, in an era when the state's political establishment was
worried by the large numbers of Irish, largely Roman Catholic
immigrants arriving in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-1800s were the height of power for the virulently
anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant ``Know-Nothing'' Party in America,
which flourished in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In Chelsea, a mob tore the cross off the top of a Catholic
church. A state-appointed ``nunneries'' committee conducted
surprise inspections of convents, checking out, among other things,
rumors that nuns were holding young girls against their will.
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, legislators, almost all of them ``Know-Nothing''
Party members, were anxious about the proliferation of Catholic
schools. They worried Catholic officials would demand the same
state aid that had been given to private, non-Catholic religious
schools in the past.
</P>
<P>
   So lawmakers amended the Constitution to forbid public aid to
religious schools. ``Legislators were horrified that Catholic
schools were going to be breeding grounds for young Catholics and
they were determined to try and put a stop to it,'' said Thomas H.
O'Connor, professor emeritus at Boston College and a Boston
historian.
</P>
<P>
   During another period of hostility toward Catholics, state
lawmakers tried to put an armor suit around the 1854 amendment by
passing an amendment forbidding the anti-aid measure from being put
before voters by a citizen ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a group of parents filed suit in federal court
alleging that the two amendments violate the US Constitution's
equal protection clause prohibiting laws that inhibit the rights of
a particular group of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the Massachusetts Constitution unfairly
shuts out people with religious interests from the electoral
process by barring a citizen ballot initiative on the aid issue,
while allowing other groups to use ballot initiatives to change
state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the attorney general's office, which is defending
the state against the suit, could not be reached for comment
Wednesday because the office was closed for the Veterans Day
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, the state and the parents agreed to a federal
court injunction allowing parents to collect signatures for a
ballot initiative that would modify the 1854 amendment while the
lawsuit goes forward. The referendum would give lawmakers the power
to give state aid to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Because civil suits take so long to decide, the judge wanted to
give plaintiffs sufficient time to prepare an initiative in the
event they win the case, according to lawyers involved.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes amid a growing campaign both nationally and
locally to promote programs that would allow state funds to flow to
private and religious schools through government vouchers, tuition
tax credits, or tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin is the only state that currently provides government
vouchers to children who attend religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say such efforts violate the separation of church and
state required by the US Constitution and are a financial threat to
public education.
</P>
<P>
   But those involved in the Massachusetts lawsuit believe the
Commonwealth's constitution unfairly and undemocratically shuts the
door on even allowing debate on expanding school choice to
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the suit asserts, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger cited the anti-aid amendment in rejecting a citizen-led
attempt at a ballot initiative to allow state loans and grants for
private and religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Eric Treene, litigation director for the Becket Fund for
Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group in Washington
representing the parents in the federal suit, said, ``The anti-aid
amendment's sole motivation was to assert the hegemony of native
born Protestants and suppress the growth of Catholic schools and
Catholic culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteenth century bigotry should not hinder education reform
as we go into the 21st century,'' Treene added. ``School choice
should stand or fall on its own merits and the people of
Massachusetts should be allowed to debate and decide the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs in the case, Patricia Boyette, who has
declined to speak publicly, is a single mother with two daughters
whose income comes from Social Security disability payments and a
part-time job that pays $121 per week, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   One daughter, Monique, is an eight-grader in an unidentified
Catholic school that subsidizes all but $100 of the yearly tuition.
Boyette's other daughter, Maya, is a fifth-grader in a Boston
public school; Boyette would like to send her to Catholic school,
but cannot afford to.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of government vouchers and other types of funding for
religious schools say that school choice only truly exists for
wealthy parents who can afford to send their children anywhere _
while low-income families have limited options.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate president William M. Bulger tried unsuccessfully
several times in recent years to amend the constitution in order to
put a referendum on aid to religious schools on the ballot. The
1917 amendment bars citizens, but not legislators, from trying to
change the anti-aid amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts voters consider controversial topics in ballot
initiatives all the time,'' Treene said. ``School choice is
certainly a controversial issue. Our lawsuit is not trying to spend
a single cent on school choice. All our plaintiffs are asking is
that this issue be given an equal place at the table.''

BOARD VOTE WORRIES BILINGUAL ED ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Board of Education's vote this week to place limits
on bilingual education was another blow to parents and advocates
already reeling from changes last year that allow school systems to
have larger classes, dismantle parent advisory councils, and hire
uncertified directors.
</P>
<P>
   As some see it, the move places Massachusetts squarely among
those cities and states where language wars are being fought in
classrooms. Critics here and nationally say bilingual education is
a crawling transition to English that leaves too many youngsters
stuck for years in segregated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents argue that students need more time to learn more
than just ``playground English,'' which some researchers say is all
that students would get with just the single year of bilingual
education that the board wants.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the state board voted on a proposal to, among other
things, limit a bilingual education class to one year, and allow a
district to choose how it wants to teach non-English speaking
students. The board's proposal must be approved by the Legislature
before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Massachusetts' 44,000 bilingual education students
can spend three or more years in Transitional Bilingual Education
programs, where they learn subjects in their primary language, with
English gradually introduced. State officials say 80 percent of
students transfer to mainstream classrooms within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Educators nationally tend to view transition education and total
immersion in English as the two primary methods of teaching English
to foreign-language students.
</P>
<P>
   As California voters dismantled transitional bilingual education
last June, critics here lamented the fact that efforts to alter the
state's 28-year-old law have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key change _ to give districts local choice about how to
teach bilingual students _ has never succeeded,'' said Rosalie
Porter, chief executive and research director of the Amherst-based
READ Institute, for Research in English Acquisition and
Development.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes, she said, ``have never gone down well with
the powerful bilingual education political force. These are
parents, community activists, teacher unions, and school
administrators. They have good intentions, they are not evil
people, but they have a stake in preserving things as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Rice, a lawyer with the office of Multicultural Education,
Training and Advocacy , a national pro-bilingual education
organization, scoffed at Porter's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he said, those who want to restrict bilingual education
_ such as board chairman John Silber, who is also a Boston
University chancellor, and Christine Rossell, a BU political
science professor who advocates English immersion _ have yet to
make a convincing argument for changing the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always the same people every year,'' Rice said. ``The
Legislature has yet to be impressed by the Silber-Rossell story.
They have nothing new to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Silber said, ``The teacher unions own
the Legislature in fee simple.'' Only when parents and taxpayers
finally get legislators' attention, he said, ``at that point we
will have serious reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But arguments for change appear to be working elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in California, home to half the nation's 2.3 million
bilingual students, dismantled transitional education programs,
replacing them with a one-year immersion program that took effect
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago and Denver earlier this year, school boards limited
bilingual education classes to three years; in Arizona, the
Legislature voted to limit funding for them to four years.
Meanwhile, Silicon Valley millionaire Ron Unz, who led the
successful anti-bilingual education drive in California known as
Proposition 227, is helping with a similar movement in Arizona _
which, like California, is driven largely by Hispanic parents.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, parents have sued the school system for
segregating their children in bilingual classes. Officials say 10
states, including Massachusetts, mandate bilingual education and
most others permit some form of it.
</P>
<P>
   Silber rejected the notion put forth by some bilingual education
advocates that Massachusetts is headed down the highly politicized,
anti-immigrant, English-only path.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote, he noted, ``approved the state's foreign
language framework, where the first principle is that every child
shall know a second language and that foreign language will be
taught from kindergarten through grade 12.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, a district must provide Transitional Bilingual
Education when it has 20 or more students speaking the same
language, regardless of age or grade level.

THE BULLIES' NEXT TARGET: JUNK FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You didn't object when they forced motorcyclists to wear
helmets. It's for their own good, you figured. And it was no skin
off your nose, since you don't ride motorcycles anyway.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't protest when they passed mandatory seat-belt laws.
You couldn't see what the big deal was _ after all, you've always
buckled up.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say anything when they pushed tobacco ads off the
air, or when they drove up the price of cigarettes with sin taxes,
or when they tried to classify nicotine as a drug. Smoking, you
believed, is nasty and unhealthy; why shouldn't the government
discourage it?
</P>
<P>
   You kept quiet when they made air bags compulsory. When they
passed laws to keep adults from owning guns. When they tried to
censor the Internet. Yes, all of these eroded Americans' freedom to
make decisions for themselves. And yes, they further empowered the
government to regulate the way we live our lives. But none of them
discommoded you personally, so you didn't see any reason to speak
out.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think the lifestyle police will stop goosestepping when
they get to something you do care about?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Kelly Brownell. He directs the Center for Eating and Weight
disorders at Yale, and he doesn't like your diet. ``The
contribution of diet to poor health in America is staggering,'' he
says. ``It's an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownell doesn't stop there. He isn't satisfied with trying to
persuade you to eat less junk food. He wants Big Brother to make
you eat less junk food. In a dispatch from New Haven last week, the
Associated Press reports: ``Brownell believes the government should
subsidize the sale of healthy food, increase the cost of
nonnutritional foods through taxes, and regulate food advertising
to discourage unhealthy practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In the name of ``public health,'' the antitobacco bullies have
gotten away with restricting speech, crushing freedom of choice,
penalizing the consumers of a lawful product, and demonizing the
sellers of that product. Brownell thinks the food bullies should be
able to do no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he has said, ``there is no difference between Ronald
McDonald and Joe Camel.'' Pause to recall the hysterical outrage
that R.J. Reynolds's cartoon figure evoked _ a Washington Post
columnist called Joe Camel ads ``as dangerous as putting rat poison
in a candy wrapper'' _ and you get a sense of just how far Brownell
would like to go.
</P>
<P>
   Societies do not usually lose their freedom at a blow. They give
it up bit by bit, letting themselves be tied down with an infinity
of little knots. As rules and regulations increase, their range of
action is gradually compressed. Their options slowly lessen.
Without noticing the change, they become wards of the state. They
still imagine themselves free, but in a thousand and one ways,
their choices are limited and guided by the authorities. And
always, there are what seem to be sensible reasons for letting
their autonomy be peeled away _ ``safety,'' ``health,'' ``social
justice,'' ``equal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to grow accustomed to docility. That is why eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty. Not because liberty is easy to
shatter. But because it can be softened and dismantled with the
acquiescence of the very men and women from whom it is being
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans no longer understand this, which is why the
government now dictates everything from the words that may appear
on wine labels to the volume of water toilets may flush. But
Brownell and his ilk understand it very well. To those who snicker
at his goal of hitting snack-food makers with heavy taxes and
forbidding the use of Ronald McDonald in advertising, Brownell has
a reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``If 20 years ago somebody had said, `I predict that states will
recover health care costs from the tobacco industry for deaths; I
predict that an icon of smoking advertising, Joe Camel, would be
banned from billboards,' people would have said, `Oh, that's
horrible government intrusion.' What is now taken for granted, 20
years ago would have been thought of as impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Watch as it unfolds. Already other voices have taken up
Brownell's call. The Center for Science in the Public Interest _
the food fanatics who periodically issue reports denouncing movie
popcorn and Chinese food _ declares that ``diet and lack of
exercise kill as many people as tobacco'' and agrees that a tax on
Big Macs and Double Stuf Oreos ``makes eminent sense.'' Hanna Rosin
writes in The New Republic that a tax on fatty foods ``can actually
be a less intrusive policy than regulating tobacco,'' and asks,
``Is it really such a crazy idea?'' US News &AMP; World Report hails
the ``Twinkie tax'' as one of ``16 Silver Bullets: Smart Ideas to
Fix the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon you'll hear about all the children whose lives will be cut
short because they got hooked on junk fook at an early age. You'll
see references to the 300,000 people ``killed'' each year by fatty
diets. In time there will be lawsuits and congressional hearings
and moving testimony by the ``victims'' of chocolate and butterfat.
Politicians, sensing another interest group to pander to, will
demand strict controls over candy ads. Ben and Jerry will be
transformed from kindly Vermont hippies to foul peddlers of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Preposterous, you say! Laughable! Absurd!
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris used to think so, too.

BLAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the way it works. Religious conservatives go out and do
all the work. Out of nothing, they build a Republican Party in what
once was the solidly Democratic South. They're so successful that
the region is now routinely referred to as solidly Republican. In
addition, religious conservatives expand and make dominant the GOP
of the Plains States, the Mountain States and the Southwest.
Nationally, they help elect two Republican presidents (Reagan and
Bush) and a Republican Congress (in 1994). In return they get
virtually nothing of substance, save the blame for GOP setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement cannot and will not last. And yet, as the
aftershocks of the mid-term elections continue to roil the GOP
landscape, the blame game has started up anew. Republican
congressional leaders talk about the need for ``moderation'' and
``pragmatism,'' code words aimed at supposedly overzealous
religious conservatives. The ``Christian Right'' is derided by
Republican strategists and operatives as a ``paper tiger,''
incapable of delivering votes in Alabama, South Carolina, and North
Carolina. Former vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp delivers his
own rebuke, prominently displayed in The Washington Post. Adding
insult to injury, the national press amplifies all this, believing
it to be true.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't true. It is true that the Democratic Party and liberal
elements in the national media have successfully demonized
religious conservatives as intolerant zealots. In this effort they
have been blessed by the presence of such figures as the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, Pat Robertson, Gary Bauer, and various extremists in the
antiabortion movement. But anyone who has spent time in politics
knows that these are the Beltway faces of the religious right,
Hogarthian caricatures of a much more humane and diverse
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, religious conservatives are the soul of the
Republican Party. In the main, they are neither intolerant nor
unforgiving. Reporters who have covered their political activities
know them to be earnest, unfailingly polite, and deeply concerned
about the moral climate of the country. These concerns are widely
shared by the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda of religious conservatives is to reverse what they
perceive to be the moral decline of the nation. They view the
abortion issue as the most important moral issue in America since
slavery, but they are not, in the main, abolitionists. Instead,
they have adopted a strategy that tries to diminish the number of
abortions performed in the United States by passing legislation
that requires parental consent for teenagers and that outlaws the
murderous practice of partial-birth abortion. In churches all
across the country, they work hard to change adoption procedures so
that more babies can be brought to term and allowed the opportunity
to find a family that will care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives have worked long and hard to return the
educational system to basic values, insisting that school be a
place of learning, not self-esteem management, and that discipline,
manners, and good conduct be part of the program. They have also
asked that a few minutes of silent prayer be included in the daily
routine so that students might reflect on the wisdom of the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives have led the fight against the vulgarity
of our media culture, engaging in economic boycotts of companies
that produce mindlessly violent and egregiously exploitative
movies, television shows, musical recordings, and publications. For
their efforts they have been reviled by economic elites who profit
from such ventures and by intellectual elites who imagine that `The
People vs. Larry Flynt'' is art.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives have been at the forefront of the
rebirth of volunteerism in America. Although their generosity and
compassion receives virtually no national press attention, it has
transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. And
religious conservatives have been instrumental in keeping the cause
of human rights alive.
</P>
<P>
   In this election cycle, religious conservatives raised strong
objections to the illegal and unethical conduct of President
Clinton. They did so because they thought his behavior sent exactly
the wrong message. Religious conservatives have been insistent that
the impeachment process go forward, arguing that the law that
applies to the rest of us should also apply to the president. In so
doing they pressed the one issue that allowed the Republican Party
to maintain its congressional majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who blame religious conservatives for the midterm
debacle are shameless. The Republican congressional leadership
concocted the odious 1998 Budget Agreement. They decided to avoid
every issue in the fall campaign. They were the ones with nothing
to say. It was their campaign from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   At least Newt Gingrich had the decency to resign. That was an
honorable act and stood in marked contrast to the bashing in the
Beltway of the GOP's most important and most principled
constituency.

<P>
   GRAY, Maine _ It took just 4 1/2 hours Wednesday to disperse
what it took Dr. Francis Fellers 50 years to collect.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 of Fellers's rare and antique telephones and
mechanical artifacts were on the auction block, and as the
collection went bit by bit out the front door of the Cyr Auction
Company, so did a part of the retired physician.
</P>
<P>
   But Fellers, 75, looks at it this way: He now has space back in
his barn, and he's $155,000 richer than he was on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I've still got my 5,000 telephone postcards ... and
(my) pen collections. And I've seeded a lot of new collections,''
added Fellers, of nearby New Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   He would have one believe that old collections don't die, they
just subdivide and multiply. And 106 collectors believed Wednesday,
as such items as an 1897 Strowger dial phone fetched $5,500 and an
1878 ``coffin-style'' telephone, made in Boston, fetched $9,750.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, in our hearts, an obsessed lot,'' said one collector
who preferred to remain anonymous after plunking down more than
$1,000 for a telegraph transmitter from around the 1870s. ``It's
hard to explain. I'm sure it's genetic.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with Fellers.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, Fellers's father, who was in the logging
business, asked his son's help lugging 28-pound telephones through
the Maine woods to link one logging camp with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became interested in how they worked,'' Fellers said, ``and
one telephone just led to another.'' And another. And another.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of the 604 items auctioned Wednesday, about 500 were
telephones, many of them collected by acquaintances of Fellers who
worked for telephone companies in the Midwest. As new models were
installed in farm homes, the old models were saved, then sold or
donated to Fellers.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 50 telephone collectors nationwide who in 1972
helped start the Antique Telephone Collectors Association, located
in Abilene, Kansas. The association now has an estimated 3,000
members, many of whom are purchasing the collections of some of the
association's founders _ elders now looking to cash in on their
prescience. Collectors estimate that there are a half-dozen
auctions a year where large numbers of telephones trade hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fellers did not attend Wednesday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be too painful,'' he said during a telephone
interview from his home.
</P>
<P>
   Fellers vowed to plow much of the proceeds from sales into
helping his children through graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to spread out my telephones, to see them go into
other collections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That they did _ to people who appeared to know exactly what they
were looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that Strowger,'' said Eugene Cole, who lives in a suburb
of Portland, Ore. ``There are only two or three of them in
existence.'' He was seated in the gallery with his wife, Patti, and
pointing toward one of perhaps 100 wall box models.
</P>
<P>
   The phone would join Cole's 350 other antique telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telephones are a fairly dominant theme in our home,'' Patti
said. ``We're trying to go for quality now, unusual items,'' she
added. The Strowger, which they bought for $5,500, apparently
complied with their design criteria.
</P>
<P>
   History has it that Alexander Graham Bell discovered the
telephone in Boston on March 10, 1876, after spilling acid on his
pants. ``Mr. Watson, come here, I want you,'' he said, seemingly an
understated plea for help under the circumstances..
</P>
<P>
   A device that converted voice vibrations into an electrical
signal allegedly traveled through a wire to a similar device in an
adjoining room, bringing first Bell's assistant, one Thomas Watson,
and later a multibillion-dollar empire.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser-known is that when the Bell patent expired 17 years
later, an estimated 300 telephone manufacturers entered the market,
turning out models into the early 1920s that command the attention
of collectors today.
</P>
<P>
   Even lesser-known are the names of some of those telephones,
such as the Kellogg, the Wilhelm Double Diaphragm Candlestick, the
Stromberg Carlson, the Andrade Wisconsin, and the Whitman &AMP; Couch,
to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Also auctioned off were switchboards, desk-sized command centers
of yesteryear where female operators asked, ``Number please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The operator was the heart of a community,'' said Alderic
``Dick'' Violette, 82, a collector and a resident of Warner, N.H.
``Dial phones have been around for a century. But when you went
with the dial, you lost the operator who connected you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Alice Bartlett, now 81, started as a switchboard
telephone operator in Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew everyone by voice, although not always by name,'' she
said. And the man with the sweetest voice belonged to Violette,
whom she married after one year on the job.

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pies and other foodstuffs have a rich and creamy
history of being used as weapons of humiliation in San Francisco.
Unfortunately, we also have a history of other kinds of weapons
being used on public figures.
</P>
<P>
   It's disturbing to see shadowy figures suddenly jump a mayor,
even if they were armed with baked goods, not guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is as American as cherry pie,'' said Black Panther H.
Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence is a cherry pie, the video of Mayor Willie
Brown being rushed by three people on Saturday tells the story.
Being pied is not as funny as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   I use the word ``pied'' and ``pieing'' because these pie people
don't throw their missiles, like in the old-time movies. They jam
them into people's faces. That has certain implications, like they
might go to jail for assault or get their lights punched out.
</P>
<P>
   The first example of pieing in San Francisco I could find
involved Jack London, and the way the great writer wielded a pie
makes an interesting comparison to recent pie attacks by the
so-called Biotic Baking Brigade on Brown and city Supervisor Gavin
Newsom.
</P>
<P>
   The way Benjamin Upham Jr. tells the story, sometime around the
turn of the century, his father, Benjamin Upham Sr., was sitting
almost alone in the Bohemian Club dining room when he heard a
ruckus coming from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden the door to the dining room opened, and there
was Jack London and another guy having a horrendous argument,''
said the 74-year-old Upham (who was disgusted by the pie attack on
Brown, by the way). ``They started through the dining room past a
row of pies on a shelf near the window. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack London reached over, grabbed a pie and slammed it into
the other guy's face. Naturally, it turned into a fistfight.''
</P>
<P>
   Upham's father and a waiter broke up the fight, but notice that
last sentence: ``Naturally, it turned into a fistfight.''
</P>
<P>
   Freud once said that the underlying goal of combat is not to
kill an enemy, but to humiliate him. That's what a pie is intended
to do. That's what London apparently wanted to do to his adversary,
knowing full well the consequences. It would turn into a fistfight.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown had pies stuffed in his face, he had precisely the
right reaction. He immediately wrestled one pie-wielder to the
ground, shouting ``Get the other ones.''
</P>
<P>
   We may not have a wrestler as governor, but we have a pretty
good one as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After the whipped cream had been wiped off his face, Brown made
jokes about the attack. He finished his news conference to a crowd
chanting his name, and then he went on to 20 more appearances
across town during city cleanup day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you know the pie attack stung, and not just because he
bruised his knee. Somebody doesn't like Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very successful way to humiliate someone,'' said
Newsom, who was pied during his election night celebration by the
same gang that pied the mayor on Saturday. ``I got hit precisely
the same way the mayor did. They tried to wrestle me down, but I
managed to escape the full impact. That moment ended the night for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the humiliation timeless, a member of the pie gang
carried a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know they had film of it, and were watching it laughing,
that really p----d me off,'' Newsom said. ``I'd be lying if I said
my first inclination wasn't to go after the guys. Luckily, they
were too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsom didn't press charges, but after the same gang attacked
the mayor, he was sorry he didn't. ``Watching it happen to the
mayor was much worse than having it happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The innocent days of silent-movie pie fights are long gone.
Nowadays pies have to be politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   The Biotic Baking Brigade topped its cherry pies with
vegan-approved tofu cream. Now that ought to be a felony. Then they
claimed they were jamming pies in the faces of Brown and other
public figures in defense of the homeless, the environment and the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the First Amendment, the one about our right to free
speech and pressing pies in people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   According to Newsom, the Board of Supervisors heard a rumor that
they were going to be the victims of a mass pieing at their weekly
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael Yaki said, ``What are we supposed to do,
check backpacks for Marie Callender's?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what it's come to. This is a city cursed with people who
say they're publicizing causes when they climb the Golden Gate
Bridge, causing massive traffic jams, or give politicians just
desserts in the name of justice.
</P>
<P>
   They'll tell you they're against violence, too. Humiliation is
fine, but not violence, even though it's as American as cherry pie.
</P>
<P>
   But cherry pie with tofu cream? Sorry, use a pie, go to hell.
</P>

BARNEY REMAINS KING OF THE HILL FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He's the purple baron of banalities, dean of duh,
regent of repetition. And he bores us to the point of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Barney is here to stay, and it's about time
adults start appreciating him.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever had a 2-year-old up at 3 a.m. with a stomach
virus, you know what I'm talking about. Forget the Children's
Mylanta: The only cure for a tummy ache is endless loops of Barney
that quiet and soothe. Side effects? Dad has to watch, too.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since Barney first appeared in videos as a
new kind of educational programming. ``Barney and Friends'' is now
in its sixth season on public television. The show gained
popularity with kids ages 2 to 5 who weren't ready for shows like
``Sesame Street'' or ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew children liked Barney,'' said Mary Ann Dudko, director
of educational research and development for Lyrick Studios, the
company that makes and markets the character's products. ``We did
not know how explosive it would be nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind Barney's explosive popularity is as simple as
the show: He catered to a market not being addressed. In years
since, other shows have been developed for the younger preschoolers
_ ``Blues Clues'' is the best of the bunch, while ``Teletubbies''
is geared for younger kids around age 1 _ eating into ``Barney and
Friends'' ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Barney'' remains the top-rated show for children under 6
and critically acclaimed by educators.
</P>
<P>
   Dudko may have the most important role on the program: It's her
job to verify and account for the educational component in each
episode, video, toy, even the 1998 movie. Over the years, Barney _
the character and the show _ has evolved (even his color has
changed twice within the purple family), with the most revealing
differences today being an expanded costumed cast (to go along with
a diverse group of child regulars), more special effects and a
heightened concentration on youngsters' changing emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Barney first went on the air, there were very few shows
for small children,'' said Kelly Lane, a spokeswoman at Lyrick.
``Now we are in a place where there are many, many more shows for
small children ... so ratings are reflecting that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barney has survived the cycle of introduction, buzz, frenzy,
marketing monster, backlash and severe backlash. He has now become
an institution. Think of it this way: Brian Eppes, who played
Michael on the series and in videos for years, is now a freshman in
college. But the bottom line of the Dallas-produced program has
been constant: The half-hour show must not only be informative, but
entertaining _ at least to young children.
</P>
<P>
   For all the lucky adults out there who have never seen ``Barney
and Friends,'' let's be straight: This show is absolutely
mind-numbing for anyone who graduated from first grade.
</P>
<P>
   Heed this warning: There is only one way to survive constant
viewings. Next time you pop in the ``Rock with Barney'' cassette
for the 37th time, watch your kid instead of the screen. Forget
about all the cheap shots you can hurl at this simplistic show, and
listen as your child learns to recite the alphabet, or acts out the
vocals and choreography to ``Me and My Best Teddy Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   After Barney the marketing phenomena exploded in the early
1990s, the benign dinosaur became a pinata for every comedy writer
and exasperated parent in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backlash didn't come from children. The backlash came from
parents,'' Dudko said. ``Barney does not appeal to adults _ very
intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be concerned,'' she said, ``about the (adult) person
who said Barney is their favorite show.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, maybe, an adult up with a sick kid.

<P>
   Ever walked into a room that just felt really good? You couldn't
explain why, but everything felt right. The energy just worked.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ even if the person who arranged the room didn't do
it on purpose _ the place had good feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of arranging a balanced
environment to create a positive flow of energy. Popular for years
among decorators, it's now moving into the office, according to a
new book, ``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten Lagatree, who says it
can have dramatic results in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Put your furniture in the proper place, hang the right things in
the right places on your walls, and seat your employees
strategically _ then watch as the office becomes a more comfortable
place to work, relationships among co-workers improve, and your
business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your desk. It must face the door. Like much
with feng shui, this is rooted in common sense. If your back is to
the door, you'll be caught off guard when people walk in, says
Lagatree, and you won't be able to keep an eye on things. Sit
catercorner from the door with two walls intersecting behind your
desk to stay in visual and physical command of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Having either side of your desk up against a wall blocks energy,
says Steven Post, CEO of the San Francisco-based Geomancy/Feng Shui
Education Organization. The path of movement around your entire
office should be smooth and unencumbered, says Post. Doors should
almost never be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter stops the flow of energy. ``Clutter is a series of
postponed decisions,'' says Lagatree. ``You are surrounded by
things that are calling for your attention, so you're never really
concentrating on the thing in front of you at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for Zen surfaces in your office, says Hope Karan Gerecht,
a feng shui consultant in Baltimore. That means at least half the
vertical and horizontal surfaces should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind needs a place to rest and relax as it is
problem-solving and creating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully about the objects you surround youself with,
says Gerecht: ``Everything around us is creating our lives on a
daily basis.'' Is an item something that pleases you? Or something
you're using because you have it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't keep anything broken in your office; it saps energy.
The office should have a feeling of life energy, whether you create
it with plants, fish, or color.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a desk your own size. A big desk may look impressive, but
if it dwarfs you, you'll feel lost, and you may have trouble
expanding your business.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are the aspirin of feng shui. Hang mirrors to reflect
anything you want doubled, like a view of water. Don't, however,
let them reflect the top of your desk, unless what you're looking
for is a doubling of your workload.
</P>
<P>
   And never situate an employee beneath or directly facing an exit
sign. ``It gives the subconscious command for them to exit,''
explains Gerecht. ``Even if they stay, a part of their psyche may
feel uncommitted.'' &QL;

<P>
   Ever walked into a room that just felt really good? You couldn't
explain why, but everything felt right. The energy just worked.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ even if the person who arranged the room didn't do
it on purpose _ the place had good feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is the ancient Chinese art of arranging a balanced
environment to create a positive flow of energy. Popular for years
among decorators, it's now moving into the office, according to a
new book, ``Feng Shui at Work,'' by Kirsten Lagatree, who says it
can have dramatic results in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Put your furniture in the proper place, hang the right things in
the right places on your walls, and seat your employees
strategically _ then watch as the office becomes a more comfortable
place to work, relationships among co-workers improve, and your
business grows.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with your desk. It must face the door. Like much
with feng shui, this is rooted in common sense. If your back is to
the door, you'll be caught off guard when people walk in, says
Lagatree, and you won't be able to keep an eye on things. Sit
catercorner from the door with two walls intersecting behind your
desk to stay in visual and physical command of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Having either side of your desk up against a wall blocks energy,
says Steven Post, CEO of the San Francisco-based Geomancy/Feng Shui
Education Organization. The path of movement around your entire
office should be smooth and unencumbered, says Post. Doors should
almost never be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Clutter stops the flow of energy. ``Clutter is a series of
postponed decisions,'' says Lagatree. ``You are surrounded by
things that are calling for your attention, so you're never really
concentrating on the thing in front of you at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for Zen surfaces in your office, says Hope Karan Gerecht,
a feng shui consultant in Baltimore. That means at least half the
vertical and horizontal surfaces should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind needs a place to rest and relax as it is
problem-solving and creating,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Think carefully about the objects you surround youself with,
says Gerecht: ``Everything around us is creating our lives on a
daily basis.'' Is an item something that pleases you? Or something
you're using because you have it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't keep anything broken in your office; it saps energy.
The office should have a feeling of life energy, whether you create
it with plants, fish, or color.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a desk your own size. A big desk may look impressive, but
if it dwarfs you, you'll feel lost, and you may have trouble
expanding your business.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors are the aspirin of feng shui. Hang mirrors to reflect
anything you want doubled, like a view of water. Don't, however,
let them reflect the top of your desk, unless what you're looking
for is a doubling of your workload.
</P>
<P>
   And never situate an employee beneath or directly facing an exit
sign. ``It gives the subconscious command for them to exit,''
explains Gerecht. ``Even if they stay, a part of their psyche may
feel uncommitted.'' &QL;

 UNDATED: ... the thinnings.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A one-time forestry student at the University of Maine, Heinrich
is thinking a lot these days about Maine's forestry industry. The
international conglomerates that run it are increasingly following
clear-cutting with aerial herbicide spraying. This kills the native
tree seedlings and stops the normal regeneration of the forest.
Tree companies do this so they can plant a single, fast-growing
tree species, Heinrich said, in the process eliminating the complex
web of thousands of kinds of plants and animals that make up a true
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Some ecological groups are responding by trying to create more
preserves. But Heinrich fears this would cost local forestry jobs
and just transfer the intensive harvesting to other areas.
</P>
<P>
   His newest idea is to raise funds to buy land for a pilot
project patterned after the Dartmouth Forest that would practice
(and study) logging techniques that enhance forest health while
making money for scholarships and providing local jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Problems in paradise
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to show Heinrich ``my'' forest, the MDC's Blue Hills
Reservation near my home just outside of Boston. As we set off on a
woodland walk around Hillside Pond with Tom Palmer, a Milton, Mass.
naturalist, it was soon clear that ``my'' woods are very different
from Heinrich's.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the trees are a lot bigger. The Blue Hills was
last logged more than a century ago, before it became part of the
second strand of the Emerald Necklace in 1896. And its more
southerly location encourages black birch, shag bark hickory, and
many other trees that won't tolerate inland Maine's more frigid
winters, creating a sunlit tapestry of colored leaves in many
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this sanctuary, Heinrich found that forest trees are
battling for life. For the same reason that whole tribes of Native
American peoples were wiped out by seemingly minor foreign diseases
like chickenpox, native trees are vulnerable to diseases and pests
introduced from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Hills we saw ash trees and black birch suffering
from unfamiliar diseases. Heinrich found a young white pine with
its top quarter dead and signs of white pine blister rust, a fungus
accidentally introduced through European nursery stock that has
killed many of his white pines, too.
</P>
<P>
   The American chestnut tree was king of the American forest 70
years ago, larger and more common than oaks. Roasted American
chestnuts were holiday fare as traditional as cranberries. Then
another fungus carried by imported trees wiped them out.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I had never seen an American chestnut tree, but
Heinrich identified half a dozen of them growing along a path,
their yellow leaves resembling those of beeches. These were no
forest giants, however, just low shrubs sprouting from ancient
roots. They were doomed to die young, then sprout again, then die
again because the fungus kills the tree trunk, but not the roots.
``Permanent adolescence,'' said Tom Palmer. ``Too young to
reproduce.''
</P>
<P>
   But then we found the prickly round fruit casings on the
hillside. Looking up we saw the source, an American chestnut tree
that was 40 feet tall. Heinrich said it was one of the oldest he
had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   But were the nuts viable? Heinrich cracked them open and found
withered aborted fruit inside.
</P>
<P>
   Then he clambered to the base of the tree and checked for the
orange rust of chestnut blight fungus in the fissures. He found it.
The tree was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   As a scientist, Heinrich cannot observe without asking
questions. ``Why is there no nut in the fruit? Could it be because
there aren't enough chestnut trees here for cross-fertilization?''
he wondered out loud. ``When I take my winter biology class to my
woods I ask them to come up with a question, collect data, and find
an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The last wildflowers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a cheerier note, we found the last wildflowers of the year in
bloom. The spidery, yellow petals of American witchhazel are easy
to miss and I had been surrounded by half a dozen shrubs, all in
full bloom and yet below my threshold of awareness. But after
Heinrich pointed one out, I saw others everywhere. ``That's the way
it is in the woods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers, which bloom into December here, are pollinated by
an owlett noctuidad moth that flies on winter nights by shivering
to keep warm, said Heinrich. He happens to be the world's expert on
their thermoregulatory physiology and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   We found one of those, too, inchlong, beige, and hanging dead in
a spider's web. The forest is a tough neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   We had been moving slowly when Tom Palmer left us. Suddenly
Heinrich wanted to ask him a question about wood turtles and took
off after him. He ran through the leaf-strewn woods with hardly a
rustle, graceful and sure-footed. And he did leap a fallen tree
like a deer.

BACK AT THE RANCH ... IT'S DAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am planning to renovate the lower floor of my raised ranch,
but I have noticed that the floor sweats a lot during spring,
summer, and autumn. There have never been leaks or flooding. The
floor covering is an area rug and failing linoleum over concrete.
All of the downstairs seems moist, according to our humidity gauge,
which averages 60-75 percent in summer. The house has central air
conditioning. The one-car garage floor is bone dry.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the living area so moist and occasionally odorous? I am
considering wall-to-wall carpeting to warm the room, but I fear
creating a mold and odor problem, trapping the moisture under the
rug and its pad. In winter, when the heat is on, it is dry.
</P>
<P>
   Without going to the poorhouse, what suggestions can you offer
to reduce that moisture between May and October?
</P>
<P>
   D.C., Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's the old bugaboo: moisture, humidity, water vapor, and
just plain water. The problem and its fixing could take up a whole
feature story (it has been done), but here I'll try to keep it down
to a college cheer.
</P>
<P>
   The lower level gets moist and wet because water vapor is
constantly coming up through the concrete floor into the rooms,
where it condenses on a cool surface (the floor). The carpet may be
adding to the problem by trapping water. And trapped water is hard
to get rid of. First, get rid of that carpet; it is the wrong kind.
The pressure of water vapor is also making the linoleum fail. It is
best to take it up because there is probably water under it.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for all this moisture is ventilation: Open windows for
cross-ventilation to release the water vapor. This should be done
from May to October; in winter, when the house is heated, there is
much less moisture, as you have discovered. The garage is bone dry
because, perhaps, it is better ventilated than the house.
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing about your problem is that your house is air
conditioned; I presume the lower level is too. An air conditioner
is also a dehumidifier, so when it is on, the whole house should be
drier. However, there may be so much moisture in the lower level,
and under the rug and linoleum, that the A/C just can't handle it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the A/C may not operate in May, September, and
October, so the moisture continues to build up if there is no
ventilation. Hence, ventilating in those three months may get rid
of enough moisture to allow the A/C to take care of the rest when
it is operating.
</P>
<P>
   As for the proposed carpeting, be sure to get wall-to-wall,
indoor-outdoor carpeting, with a synthetic jute pad. These layers
will allow the water vapor rising through the concrete to pass
through them and into the rooms, where ventilation and/or the A/C
will remove it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My tub drains very slowly _ five to 10 minutes. No other
drains in the house are slow. I've tried baking soda and vinegar,
and hot water, without success. I even took off the stopper lever
at the end of the tub and cleaned it thoroughly. I am stumped.
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN BARRETT, North Attleborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Slow drains are usually caused by a buildup of grease, oil,
hair, and other detritus that reduces the diameter of the drain.
The cure is to use a plumber's snake to break up the gunk and shove
it farther down the drain into the vertical stack, where it will be
gone for good. The snake will also remove any other kind of
obstruction. The baking soda and vinegar might help some, but it is
a long, slow process. Better to use is straight bleach; put a cup
of it down the drain and let it sit in the trap for an hour or so,
then turn on the water to get the bleach farther down the drain. An
enzyme-based drain cleaner may be more effective than bleach.
</P>
<P>
   A plumber's snake, by the way, is a long, flexible rod of
spiraled wire with a crank handle; turn the crank as you thread the
snake down the drain so it will do maximum good in removing the
detritus. You can put the snake in the drain opening (remove the
strainer cover first). Or, it might be easier to remove the stopper
mechanism and put the snake in that opening.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I filled a decayed area in an outside windowsill with an
exterior-grade wood filler and painted it. The filler deteriorated
and broke up. You mentioned a Minwax epoxy filler in one of your
columns. Would that work better?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW NESDALL, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it would; Minwax is only one brand. In fact, Sam
Segal, also of Newton, called to tell us of another kind called
Wood Epox, made by Abatron of Kenosha, Wis. ``I got it at the Tool
Hauz in Needham, (Mass.)'' Segal said. Abatron also makes Liquid
Wood Epoxy, he added. It is called a wood consolidant, and you
don't have to remove the rotted wood; it will consolidate the
decayed wood with the epoxy for a good repair.
</P>
<P>
   For Andrew Nesdall's situation, I suggest he dig out the decayed
wood, exposing fresh, sound wood before putting in the filler.
</P>
<P>
   There could be a number of reasons why the exterior-grade filler
failed: There was still some decayed wood in the opening; it was
applied too thinly; or the paint cover was not enough to keep water
out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

PUZZLING OVER THE ECONOMIC TEA LEAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US economy has entered a puzzling period of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The signals it is sending are so mixed that even economists find
them difficult to interpret. The stock market plummets one month
but juts back up the next. Asian economies and then Russia's
unravel. The United States bounds ahead, posting 3.3 percent annual
growth in the third quarter, but job growth slows.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder corporate America, after seven years of
uninterrupted expansion, is concerned. With international markets
underwater, business confidence in this country is wavering. The
Associated Industries of Massachusetts reported recently that its
business confidence index for October was at its lowest level since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nationwide, companies that had invested boldly in plants,
equipment, and people throughout the 1990s are scaling back
spending and hiring plans. US corporations in the third quarter
reduced capital spending for the first time since 1991, according
to Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, an economic consulting firm in Lexington.
Capital spending in the July-September quarter dipped by 1 percent,
to $958.1 billion, reversing a trend in which quarterly investment
levels in 1998 were 76 percent higher than they were in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that this mood of uncertainty may further weaken
an economy that is already vulnerable to a slowdown. ``It's a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said Allan M. Kline, chief financial
officer of Dynatech Corp., a Burlington, Mass. company that is
reducing spending in preparation for a possible downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Economic forecasts for 1999 have run the gamut from full-blown
recession to slow, steady growth. The maelstrom that slammed world
financial markets and Wall Street last summer has calmed. But
economists swing between hope and pessimism about whether interest
rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in September and again in October
will head off a slowdown. The Labor Department said October
unemployment was unchanged at 4.6 percent, but the pace of job
growth declined from prior months.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for Ralph Verni, president of State Street
Management and Research, a Boston investment firm that manages $51
billion: ``We're not going to have the 40-mile-per-hour wind at our
backs that we've had for more than a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, he said, business ``tends to slow down some
initiatives'' and ``not start new ones.'' State Street Management,
for example, will delay introduction of one of the mutual funds it
had planned to roll out by year-end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some manufacturing companies have already seen a
downturn. Layoffs have been swift and deep for exporters hit
directly by plunging demand for their products in Japan and Asia,
including Polaroid Corp. and Gillette Co., or financial firms
struggling with turmoil in world financial markets, such as Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs are the most public actions taken in a slowdown. But
highly profitable companies in domestic markets are quietly
streamlining operations as they expect revenue and profit growth to
slow from its breakneck pace during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of certainty means they don't want to do anything
dramatic so they're doing the equivalent of trimming the sales,''
said Fred Breimyer, &UR;  &LR; chief economist at State Street Corp. in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Dynatech, a communications equipment maker, is doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Dynatech's big customers, including AT&AMP;T, do business in
Asia, but its biggest markets are North America and Europe where
sales are up smartly this year. Yet Kline, the chief financial
officer, is playing it safe. He trimmed $3 million from capital
spending this year and froze employment at 2,500. After years of
strong growth, Dynatech is ``trying to manage our results until our
markets turn around,'' Kline said.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers have been forced to make layoffs. In
Massachusetts, the manufacturing sector has lost 5,000 jobs since
last spring, falling from 453,300 in May to 448,500 in September.
Manfacturers were hit not only by dropping demand but also by
weakening foreign currencies, which made US products more expensive
in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor-related companies which export to Asia were hit
first. Computer chip giant Intel Corp. was forced to lay off 675
workers from its Hudson, Mass. plant, while Robotic Vision Systems
Inc., which makes inspection equipment for the chip industry,
reduced its national work force, including its Canton, Mass. plant,
by about a third, to 750 employees, said spokeswoman Diane Basili.
Capital spending was also cut.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is seeking to become less reliant on
semiconductors by developing new products. ``Diversity is the key
component in our approach to these challenging times,'' Basili
said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have touted their success in global markets are
pulling in their horns. Gillette's sales grew rapidly on the
strength of global markets, which supply a third of total revenues
for razor blades and other consumer products. Indeed, spending
worldwide for the rollout of the new Mach3 triple-blade razor
continues. But the Boston company in September announced layoffs of
2,700 worldwide and the closing or consolidation of 56 offices,
factories, and warehouses to eliminate duplication.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette denies that the crises overseas have caused the
layoffs. However, said Gillette spokesman Matt Miller, ``When you
get into a situation like this we take a closer look at what we're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Wyman-Gordon Co., after seeing sales rise 25 percent last
year, expects sales for the next fiscal year, ending May 1999, to
rise 13 percent, to $850 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Grafton, Mass. company uses heat to forge metal into landing
gear, engine parts, and frames for the aerospace industry. As
Boeing Co. and other customers become nervous about global
conditions, Wyman-Gordon put cost controls in place to offset
softer sales. And the company is asking departments to
``rejustify'' capital spending and scrutinizing travel and other
expenses. Employment this year was reduced by 150 nationwide, said
spokesman Wallace Whitney. ``Our business remains strong, but we
read the papers too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are walking a fine line between continuing to
expand and expanding too much. Staples Inc. will continue next year
to open office supply stores at a pace of 150 stores. Hiring won't
slow either _ the company said sales have in past recessions proved
resistant to downturns. Indeed, profits are expected to grow 30
percent next year; revenues are expected to grow 25 percent, to
more than $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Staples is cutting corners on unnecessary expenses such as a
proposal to put fork lifts in each store to move inventory and is
shying away from investing in information systems that do not
directly benefit customers, said chief financial officer John
Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `Let's try and make sure we don't make any commitments
to fixed expenses we couldn't manage down if there are significant
hits to our sales,''' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, companies are fearless about a downturn. At TJX
Cos., manager of investor relations, Sherry L. Lang, said the
off-price retail chains operated by the Framingham, Mass. company,
TJ Maxx and Marshall's, are based on a ``tried-and-true concept
that has withstood softer economic times.'' The company is so
optimistic that it opened its first five A.J. Wright stores
targeted at lower-income customers than are TJ Maxx stores.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said TJX hopes the stores will become a 500-store chain:
``We're very optimistic about its growth potential.''

ROCKS OF AGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   It will never be known who thought up the rocking chair. Most
likely, necessity being the mother of invention, it was someone
like Greg Aanes with a pregnant wife to comfort. Aanes was very
happy making fine case furniture, such as tables and dressers and
hutches. But while carrying the baby they would name Brendan, his
wife's lower back began to ache.
</P>
<P>
   Please make me a rocking chair, she said. He said he would, but
the days went by. Orders to fill, and so on. Besides, he was
particular about his chairs: ``I know how I want them to sit.''
Well, if you won't make me a rocker, his wife told him, I'll go
down to the Salvation Army and buy one. You can't do that, he said,
and two weeks later she had her rocker; and Greg Aanes Furniture,
as he calls his company, would get a bestseller out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The rocking chair is called the Brendan. That son, now 16, helps
out in the office and has designed a Web page for his father's
furniture designs. Some people like the Brendan so much they've
ordered it in pairs _ ``his and hers,'' Greg Aanes says _ and in
lots of four or six.
</P>
<P>
   That looks like a modest revival for the rocker. It held sway in
America all during the 19th century and well into the 20th. It was
so powerful a piece of furniture that it caused the first
rearrangement of living rooms since medieval times. Everybody sat
and rocked, from the most humble to the most high. Can you name
three presidents associated with rockers? Hint: All perished by an
assassin's bullet. But what is it about rocking chairs that makes
people want to sing sad songs? Hoagy Carmichael was on to something
when he wrote ``Ol' Rockin' Chair's Got Me'' with Mitchell Parrish
in 1929. Everybody called Mildred Bailey the ``rocking-chairlady''
after she sang it with Louis &UR;  &LR; Armstrong (and Jack Teagarden &UR;  &LR; on
trombone). Sinatra kept the &UR;  &LR; song alive.
</P>
<P>
   The first piece of furniture to rock was of course the cradle.
Then came the rocking horse; as we shall see, it had two of the
rocking chair's bad habits: it tipped over and it chewed the
carpet. The chair we know as the rocker dates from the late 18th
century. It may be an American invention. The British called it the
``American'' chair. The rest of the world seems to agree, though
they have their own words for it, the brisk Schaukelstuhl in
Germany and the swaying sedia a dondolo in Italy. If not wholly
American, the rocker is American by way of England and the Windsor
chair, which came here in the late 18th century. The Windsor was a
chair for all occasions, and so were the chairs made by the
Shakers. All were light and limber. They sat in the kitchen, they
sat out in the yard, they sat on porches. You could sit in such
chairs and tilt back till the front legs came off the floor (and
the back legs eventually cracked). Just a-sittin' and a-tiltin'
became Duke Ellington's ``Just A-Settin' and A-Rockin''' when
someone got the idea of fixing pieces of curved wood, perhaps
suggested by cradle rockers, on a straight chair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Humble beginnings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can almost see how it happened. One of the first known
rockers can be found in the House of Seven Gables in Salem. It's a
common-looking chair, a bit stubby, a bow-back Windsor with dished
seat that comes up to a point in front. It's low to the ground and
once you sit down, you're stuck there for a while. This particular
chair has no arms, which is unusual for a Windsor rocker. (For one
thing, arms help brace the frame.) A slot has been cut in each leg
and the rockers inserted and pegged. What makes the Windsor a
natural as a rocker was that the vertical spindles that make up its
back run into the chair seat. If not quite as ergonomically correct
as the rocker that Greg Aanes (Norwegian and pronounced Ah-Nes)
made for his wife, Heather, the little Salem rocker breathes
comfort. Nursing mothers would have loved it, also cats wanting a
lap and children wanting a story. John Kassay dates it to about
1790 in his magisterial study, ``The Book of American Windsor
Furniture: Styles and Technologies'' (University of Massachusetts
Press, $50), published this year.
</P>
<P>
   So Americans sat and rocked. And rocked, whether the chair was
fanciful wicker, or wood with caned back and seat, or ladder-back
and rush, or Shaker with woven tape, or stuffed to bursting with
upholstery. Chair makers soon began to vary finishes and materials.
A ``Hitchcock'' Windsor had decorations in gilt paint, as did the
high-backed ``Boston.'' A metal tube rocker was shown at the 1851
Crystal Palace Exhibition in London. Michael Thonet, famous for his
curvy bentwood side chairs, added rockers in 1860. But that
arc-upon-arc chair that Mies van der Rohe designed in 1927 bounces
rather than rocks. Norman Rockwell memorialized the old-timey
office chair that rocks and swivels on the cover of the Saturday
Evening Post. Whatever the model, the rocker is a sociable chair:
The act of rocking fills the gaps in conversation. The sound of
creaking rockers is as companionable as a ticking clock. Or as
ominous: Who will forget the long minutes in ``Night of the
Hunter'' (1956) as Charles Laughton sits and rocks, shotgun in lap,
waiting for Robert Mitchum, a psychopathic murderer posing as
clergyman?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rocking presidents
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rockers are American for another reason. Only in America would
you find a chair that keeps us in motion while sitting still. That
worked for William McKinley, who ran for president from a rocker on
his front porch in Canton, Ohio. It was 1896. The issue dividing
America was which metal should back US currency. McKinley was for
retaining gold. William Jennings Bryant, the populist and orator
nominated by the Democrats, was for unlimited, or ``free,'' silver.
``Thou shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold,'' Bryant
preached as he stumped 18,000 miles addressing 5 million people.
McKinley rocked on his porch, making press, and public, and
Republican kingmakers come to him. The two other rocking-chair
presidents? John F. Kennedy, who used one to ease his aching back
in the Oval Office, and Abraham Lincoln, on that fatal evening at
Ford's Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As will happen to a popular form of furniture, the tinkerers get
their hands on it and make it do more than it should. And so the
rocking Windsor was (briefly) crossed with the Windsor chair that
had a writing desk attached to its right arm. Kassay can find only
one example, made circa 1810 in Connecticut. ``Writing and rocking
at the same time must have been quite an achievement for the
occupant; possibly, writing was kept to a minimum,'' he observes.
The perfect chair for the finicky writer who was said to boast he
spent the morning putting a comma in and the afternoon taking it
out.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the rocker as a fixture in the living room is
attributed by one furniture historian to the advent of television.
In her entertaining book on American interiors called ``There's a
Bed in the Piano'' (Bulfinch, 1998, $38.50), Myrna Kaye mentions
the motion factor. Much easier to watch the screen, she says,
sitting still in the deep confines of the couch. There's another
reason. Starting in the 1950s, the televison set would rearrange
the living room furniture, a machine demanding we line up to watch
its every flicker. How different from the early 1800s, when the
rocking chair's very sociability drew us (and our chairs) into a
human circle by rearranging parlor seating. Until the 1830s, says
Kaye, chairs ``stood shoulder to shoulder, backs to wall,'' waiting
to be moved around as needed. But rocking chairs, because of the
rocking back, had to be placed forward of the wall. This led to the
cosy and permanent grouping of chairs and sofas. The rocker, says
Kaye, ``ended the tyranny of walls over furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A balancing act
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, the rocking chair had its hazards. Early on, chair
makers learned how to design the rocker so that it wouldn't tip you
over. Greg Aanes explains that the rocking device is not truly
round; that is, it is not a segment of a circle but a runner that
curves just enough to pitch us forward and send us back.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to designing a rocker is the balance, ``how the
support of back and arms cradles your body,'' he says. Aanes got it
almost right the first time, then spent the next few years refining
things. To get public reaction, he would take his rocker to local
street shows near his studio-workshop in Bellingham, Wa., just
south of Vancouver. It's been eight years since the last change to
the Brendan. In the meantime, the Aaneses' second son, Colin, now
7, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very dogmatic about how chairs sit,'' Aanes says. ``I'm
not concerned with the history of rockers but with what I want them
to do'' to support the sitter. So the two parts of the body he
caters to are the torso and the arms. The length of the sitter's
leg doesn't matter, being outside the confines of the chair. His
rocker backs curve in to meet the sitter's lower back. The height
of the armrest is important for body leverage. ``I've made some
with taller arms, higher off the seat, but I don't do that now. I
base it on what works for me, and lower is better.'' He also
insists his rockers have a seat cushion. ``I personally don't like
wooden seats,'' he says and laughs. ``It reminds me of long dinners
at my grandparents.'' Aanes says a cushion changes how we sit. The
center of gravity shifts; it's different from a wooden seat.
</P>
<P>
   Aanes hasn't solved two rocking-chair problems. One is how to
keep the cat's tail from being pinned under the rockers. (Rockers
are also known to attack the human ankle.) The other &UR;  &LR; concern is
the job rockers can do to the carpet. This was addressed in the
mid-19th century with the invention of something called the
platform rocker. Its frame was stationary, almost thronelike. Only
the seat, a sort of treadle, moved. Yes, it was rocking, but
rocking without inhaling.

<P>
   Just when to start the clock of modern skiing is a subject of
endless dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Suicide Six believe it started there with Bunny
Bertram and his first Model-T-powered rope tow in Woodstock, Vt.
But a century earlier, gold miners were racing down the Sierras at
90 m.p.h. on what looked to be tree sides, for wagers of gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the Alps, where people were skiing
just a few centuries before there was an America.
</P>
<P>
   If the origins of skiing aren't clear, the changes since some
Dartmouth kids started sliding down Gilbert's Hill are both the
style and substance of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Way back when those Dartmouth kids' parents were ``skinning'' up
hills on canvas cloths stretched over a ``kick zone'' under their
feet, skiing was so rare and different it rated as a
thrill-seeker's wild dare.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1930s, the introduction of the rope tow, usually
from the bottom to the top of a 300-foot pasture hill, brought into
the sport thousands of new skiers who had begun to hear about
Alpine skiing when it made its debut in the 1936 Olympics in
Garmisch, Germany, with downhill and slalom events.
</P>
<P>
   By the time World War II ended with publicity about the 10th
Mountain Division ``ski troops,'' Lowell Thomas, the famous
correspondent, was helping popularize the sport with his
out-of-breath prose:
</P>
<P>
   ``The woods seem to fly past in a dizzy blur,'' wrote Thomas of
a ski run he took in the '40s. ``No sport can match the freedom
from earthbound plodding that you feel as you sail down a long
staightaway. Muscles alert as a hair trigger, ready to shift
balance with every change of slope, with each variation in snow.
What a thrill is this mastery of muscles, what a zest in flirting
with disaster at every bend in the trail. What does the skier think
about in his mad career? He is tinglingly alive. Every nerve is
tuned to the highest pitch ... a mountain scaled, and a trail run
with the speed of the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think such thrills do not exist for modern ski writers,
hear the 1998 version of a snowy rush from Skiing Magazine's Chaco
Mohler, who reported from the Alps of Innsbruk, Austria:
</P>
<P>
   ``Downing their beers (my friends) hopped off the sundeck of
their chalet and into their skis. A minute later we were carving
down a long ridge, playing tag with the avalanche fences in the
orange light. No one had the slightest idea where we were going. In
front of us, the ridge dove into a dark forest and narrowed to a
thin trail, then thinned again to an icy one-track trail. ``Point
'em'' yelled Larry, as if we had a choice. I was now very very
awake, rocketing tip to tail at 30 miles per hour into the
blackness, a wall of trees dictating instant turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Then and now for a couple of writers. Here are some more:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  In Thomas's day, skis were long, wooden, stiff, hard to
turn. It took upwards of a decade to learn skiing, according to
Herbert Schneider of Mt. Cranmore ski school fame. In the '60s,
Howard Head invented his metal skis, paving the way for all kinds
of combinations, and using such high-tech plastics as Kevlar and
carbon fiber. The graduated Length Method of instruction put a
premium on long skis for experts. Right through to modern times,
length did matter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  Nothing but shapes, shapes, shapes. From extreme to
conservative, unless you're a true expert who likes to work harder
than you have to to carve a turn, the word is ``shapes.'' And
rather than a premium on length, being able to turn well and carry
speed on shorter skis is the current style. Some schools claim they
can teach never-evers in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  In the '70s boarding was truly experimental, its early
practicioners trying to learn how to ride a Snurfer _ basically a
surf board on the snow. Virtually no ski areas allowed snurfers on
lifts, and anyone seen with one was thought on to be at best
experimental, at worst insane. There was no boarding culture, no
style, no particular boots or clothes for boarders, who numbered
maybe a dozen or so. But one of boarding's earliest proponents _
Vermont's Jake Burton _ parlayed the concept into a
multimillion-dollar business located in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  In the past 10 years snowboarding has been the only area
of growth in all of skiing. Boarding itself has become split
between two factions, two looks, two cultures. There are Alpine
boarders who click into rigid bindings, like skiers, and ride their
boards, well, like skiers. The other camp remains closer to the
founding traditions of the sport _ comfortable Sorrel-style soft
boots, baggy clothes, and in-your-face attitudes concerning vague
concepts of counterculture freedom (though this is subsiding with
age). A leading halfpipe performer, Norway's Terry Haakenson,
odds-on favorite to medal in boarding's first Olympics last season,
boycotted the Games because he objected to the International Ski
Federation's control of boarding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  Even decades before Sonja Henie began to appear in ski
films in the '40s, ski clothes always flirted with tight and
bright, largely because styles were set where Hollywood skied _ at
Sun Valley, Idaho _ where many followed founder Averil Harriman's
cue and skied in sweaters and hatless. But even in the frigid East,
the tradition never got far away from stretch pants and
form-fitting waist-length parkas. From the '70s into the '80s, the
standard was the CB parka in bright primary colors, and slim-cut
nylon pants with their own over-the-boot gaitors in a contrasting
color.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  Well, boomers age, and so do their fashions. Prevailing
now are looser, longer belted parkas and overalls made of high-tech
fabrics _ Gor-tex, Thinsulate, Mylar. Some years earth tones make a
statement; other years bright magentas, neon pinks, and greens with
contrasting black are in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  Bear trap bindings may have been a step up from the
straps that first held skis onto leather boots, but not much of
one. And to keep skis from rocketing dangerously down the slope
after a fall, leather thongs were wrapped tightly around the lower
legs, binding ski to skier. A greater recipe for broken leg was
never devised.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  Multidirectional-release bindings have evolved from
Norwegian skier Hjalmar Hvam's 1938 brainstorm, which came to him
after he broke the same leg twice. Though spring-loaded ski brakes
were once thought gadgety, this '60s invention is now universal
except in deep powder, where a ski not leashed to the foot can
still get lost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  The Riblet aerial tramway with chairs _ a standard for
decades beginning in the '30s _ was modeled after the ore-buckets
built in the Sierras to get gold and silver down, and miners up to
work and back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  Take a ride on Killington's art-emblazoned, heated
``Skyeship,'' a $15 million ride with music piped in through
overhead speakers. This was Preston Leete Smith's parting gift to
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  In the vision of Waterville Valley founder (and Olympic
skier) Tom Corcoran, sking was not meant to be a breathlessly fast
amusement park sort of ride, and the appearance of helmets
emphasizes the wrong things about the sport. With natural ungroomed
snow, twisty trails, and an emphasis on turns, few skiers suffered
fatal collisions with trees and other objects, and no one but
downhill racers thought much about helmets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  With the deaths last year of Michael Kennedy and Sonny
Bono, a trend toward helmet wearing got a tremendous boost. Within
a couple of years, predict manufacturers, ski helmets will be as
ubiquitous as bike helmets _ especially as skiers learn how warm
the new ones are.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  There haven't been many American ski heroes, and
Europeans such as Jean Claude Killy and Franz Klammer were the
best-known names in the sport. Still, there was Stowe's Billy Kidd,
and later the Mahre brothers, Phil and Steve, and maybe Tamara
McKinney. Not to mention 1984 anti-hero Billy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  The irony of America's two best known moderns _ Picabo
Street and Tommy Moe: This year both are out of racing. Moe has
retired, and Street is recovering from her second broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEN: &LR;  Robert Redford's 1969 film ``Downhill Racer'' is still
the best skiing movie ever made.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOW: &LR;  ``Aspen'' is as tacky and woeful as its namesake resort
is becoming.

TOMBA RETIRES _ AND A LOT OF FUN GOES WITH HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was always something a bit pathetic listening to
octogenarian Frank Sinatra trying to croak his way through ``New
York, New York.'' It made us feel as sorry for ourselves as for the
singer, his greatness faded to memory.
</P>
<P>
   I had a similar twinge last February when, with crowd
expectations running amazingly high once again, Alberto Tomba tried
to drive his left edge in the first run of the Olympic giant slalom
and went flying off the course in a pathetic heap.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Tomba hadn't fallen before, of course. All ski
racers fall, and this was just one of many, including that
sensational tumble taken by the sensational new Austrian
superskier, Hermann Meier, on the downhill course.
</P>
<P>
   But when Tomba failed to answer the bell for the second run, it
seemed clear he was a fighter who might have stayed in the ring to
absorb one punch too many.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just the year before that ``La Bomba,'' one of the
best and most colorful ski racers ever, had come on in the last
half of the season for a World Cup slalom victory and a World
Championship medal?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But as Olympic signatures go, Tomba's silver medal in
the Lillehammer Games in 1994 _ giving him a record five medals in
three successive Games _ was as sweet as they get.
</P>
<P>
   In 14th place, trailing by more than a second after the first
run, Tomba had smashed through a ferociously tough, icy course that
would topple most of the top runners. His silver medal in
Lillehammer was so unexpected that his delirious fans tore through
the fences to get at their hero.
</P>
<P>
   The two Olympics before that, Tomba claimed, had been named for
him _ Albertville and Alberta. He changed the names to
``Albertoville'' and ``Alberto.'' And he stamped his imprimatur
upon them. On and off the slopes he was flying high, mouthing off,
and catching everyone around him up in the wonderful fun he was
having.
</P>
<P>
   At Calgary he offered Katarina Witt one of his gold medals if
she would date him, then shed a tear, on camera, rose in hand, when
the German ice goddess spurned him. But a couple of days later, he
appeared in a homemade Western movie and bragged that he was
staying out most of the night with his gaggle of adoring female
friends, drinking wine and eating pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Of his repeated bon mots, most quoted was his one-liner at a
press conference in Albertville.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``After years of success in the last Olympics, you
reportedly skipped your workouts, enjoyed too much wine, and were
very active with the women. Could this happen to you again?''
</P>
<P>
   Tomba: ``Yes. I start tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A related one-liner also came from those Games, when he said he
would have to adjust his personal life as age was catching up with
him:
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a wild time with three women until 5 a.m. In
(this) Olympic village I will live it up with five women until 3
a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans who could differentiate between impishness and arrogance
knew they were witnessing a Muhammad Ali through it all; for half a
dozen years, Tomba's talent was more than equal to the job of
backing up his (to some) outrageous Italian Stallion behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the great Swedish gate racer, Ingemar Stenmark, never
said very much in interviews, so it was a real mouthful when
Stenmark, asked to assess the 22-year-old Tomba at Calgary, said
quietly: ``He is the best ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, as much fun as Tomba had through most of his career,
his legend was largely fiction, one he created about himself by
wildly inflating the facts. And the one fact underlying his 50
World Cup victories _ second only to Stenmark's 86 _ was that he
was a hard-working, hard-training athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Another line about Tomba contains the simplest and most
descriptive truth. Friends and competitors knew Tomba also as a man
of tremendous generosity both at home and on the road. One example
was his habit of opening up free restaurants at various ski sites _
such as Casa Italia at Lillehammer, open to anyone who could find
it.
</P>
<P>
   Said Norwegian slalom rival Ole Christian Furseth, acknowledging
all the hype clouding the essence: ``Tomba is a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ski racing will be different, and a lot less fun,
without La Bomba.

COMPAQ PUTTING DIGITAL TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _  &UR;  &LR; A new marketing strategy by Compaq Computer Corp.
could prove to be the first visible payoff for the company from its
recent buyout of Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq announced the initiative Wednesday, describing plans to
sell personal computers directly to small and midsize companies
over the phone and the Internet. The Houston-based company also
will package the machines with service frills like installation and
on-line file backups _ capabilities developed and to be delivered
by thousands of former Digital service employees in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are implementing a new business model, called `Customer
Choice,''' Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said to
reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move will open sales channels in addition to Compaq's
traditional reliance on computer dealers, and some analysts said
the company risks alienating some of its key distribution partners.
</P>
<P>
   But others said Compaq had to plunge into direct sales to
compete with surging rivals like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway
2000 Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While Compaq is launching a line of ``Prosignia'' machines
priced from $1,200 and up, the focus of Wednesday's conference was
on sales and services.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is betting that its rivals can't match features offered
from its services unit, acquired from Digital. The unit is
headquartered in Stow and dispersed throughout New England. At
Digital, these employees mainly installed networking software for
larger corporate customers, like banks and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   If the latest marketing initiative succeeds, the acquisition of
Digital will have played some role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing why they bought DEC,'' said Eric Schmitt, a
Forrester Research Inc. analyst. ``They're showing an edge that a
lot of others who sell direct don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Compaq is counting on a large customer call-in
center in Littleton, Mass. to handle service calls and coordinate
the response from technicians. Employees at Compaq's management
center in Shrewsbury, Mass. also helped develop features introduced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among these, business customers may purchase from Compaq the
ability to make backup copies of their computer files on line, to
be kept at a remote storage site. Another service allows customers
to access their company networks from remote locations via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such features &UR;  &LR;  should help Compaq set its offerings apart, said
IDC Research analyst Raymond Boggs. At the least, he said, ``it
will be pretty bedazzling to the less-knowledgeable small
business.''
</P>
<P>
   When Compaq purchased DEC for roughly $9.5 billion in January
1998, a major question was whether Compaq could make use of DEC's
large service staff to bolster sales of its own computers as well
as smaller machines, generally meant for businesses with 500 or
fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Compaq had not targeted such customers in its
marketing. Even Compaq vice president Tom Iannotti said in an
interview Wednesday that ``we used to dismiss the computing
requirements'' of the smaller customers.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Fortune 500 almost totally automated, it is small
to midsize companies that drive demand for computer equipment and
services _ a market that is growing 20 percent annually, according
to Michael J. Winkler, a Compaq senior vice president in charge of
the company's PC products group. Compaq has only about 15 percent
of that market, but Winkler says he hopes to boost Compaq's claim
to 25 percent within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's decision to make direct sales created waves in the PC
industry. Some analysts expected the company might anger its
traditional distribution partners by undercutting their prices
on-line. But Wednesday Compaq executives pledged those prices would
be the same as through dealers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And Compaq has offered to give its dealers commissions for
referring customers to its direct sales operations.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also brought to New York a group of computer resellers
who supported its plans, including Joe Kremer, vice president of
CDW Computer Center Inc. in Vernon Hills, Ill. Kremer said he
doubted Compaq's efforts would swamp CDW, because his company still
offers more support than does Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq shares closed Wednesday at 34 1/2, up 1 5/8.

A HUMANE SOCIETY FOR AIDING HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE HATFIELD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The past year has seen massive, even shocking, changes
in the 213-year-old Humane Society of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Some founders might say it's going to hell in a
handbasket, if they knew that the membership has been toying with
the idea of switching some dinners to lunches, sometimes wearing
other than tux and white tie, and, heaven forbid, inviting wives to
a few.
</P>
<P>
   This humane society, you see, has nothing to do with animals, as
the voice on its answering machine patiently explains. The group's
secretary for 23 years, Barbara Driscoll, says that barely a day
goes by that someone doesn't call to try to honor a ``hero dog'' or
to bequeath money from a dead relative's will to animals. Driscoll
patiently directs callers to the Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Before animal shelters and rescue organizations were invented,
humane societies were in the business of helping humans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Humane Society of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, which adapted its name from the Royal Humane Society
in England, is a publicity-shy Brahmin enclave anchored in the
city's seafaring past.
</P>
<P>
   Formed soon after the Revolution, its principal object was ``to
discover methods by which persons apparently dead might be restored
to life,'' or in 1998 terms, be resuscitated. Before the Coast
Guard existed, the society, whose literature says it is the
third-oldest lifesaving society in the world, built ``huts of
refuge'' stocked with food and fuel for the benefit of shipwrecked
sailors, and in 1807 opened the first lifesaving station in
America, at Cohasset. The society established the first free beds
for the poor at Massachusetts General Hospital, and still gives
five-figure sums to several Boston hospitals each year, including
Mass. General.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the society has furnished ventilators for the
helicopters of Med-Flight, which delivers patients to area
hospitals during emergencies. One member likens the group to the
Carnegie Foundation, ``but with not as much money.''
</P>
<P>
   The society still awards medals, certificates, and monetary
gifts to Massachusetts residents who risk their lives to save the
lives of others at sea, in fires, or in road accidents.
Certificates usually come with a $500 award. Silver medals earn
$2,500, and bronze $1,500 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The society has always had 12 members (just as there always were
12 disciples), each one called a trustee. By tradition, the members
are: male, ``dominating persons of the town'' according to M.A.
DeWolfe Howe, in his 1916 history of the society; generally Harvard
graduates and members of one of the private Final Clubs at Harvard,
either the A.D. or Porcellian if possible; and congenial.
</P>
<P>
   The names in the society's centuries-long roster read like a
list of Bay State history. There are Adamses and Gardners,
Coolidges and Saltonstalls, of course a Lowell as well as a Cabot,
Hunnewells, Howes, Endicotts, and Forbses.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, each trustee paid six shillings and eight
pence per year, and the kitty was to be invested to pay for
lifesaving equipment and awards. In true Yankee tradition, the
society's account was invested so prudently that this year, the
group has around $4 million with which to do its good work. Since
the bylaws state that 5 percent of the average assets during each
year must be given away, the group has more decision-making to do
lately.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thrifty givers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they were taught at their fathers' knees, members usually
spend only the interest on that money, but just recently they
actually considered _ hold onto your hats _ spending some of the
principal, because of the taxes involved in a $4 million pot. After
much discussion, they elected to save the principal but to give
more than 5 percent of the income.
</P>
<P>
   The first president of the society was James Bowdoin, founder of
Bowdoin College, and the second vice president was Dr. John Warren,
a founder of Mass. General. Among the original trustees were Judge
Oliver Wendell, grandfather of Oliver Wendell Holmes; Dr. Aaron
Dexter, for whom the professorship of chemistry was founded at
Harvard; and Reverend Samuel Parker, bishop of the diocese of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Lee Higginson, founder and financial angel of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, and Charles Francis Adams of the nation's
presidential family, were members, as was Horatio Hollis Hunnewell,
who donated the land for Wellesley College, and Francis Boardman
Crowninshield and Augustus Thorndike Perkins of the shipping
merchant families.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, four of the 12 trustees are on the board of Mass.
General Hospital, three are former chairmen of the board, and one
is a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They look a little bit alike, and they all seem to know each
other's grandfathers and great-grandfathers, as if Boston were
still a small village. Indeed, Margaret Mann, who served the
society as secretary from 1949 to 1974, said, ``They all seemed to
be cousins. I never knew who was related to whom.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't like their names in the newspaper unless they've just
been born, been married, or died. Reluctantly, the society provided
this year's membership roster, which consists of: John E. Lawrence,
a retired cotton broker; George P. Gardner, retired investment
banker, Paine Webber Inc.; Francis H. Burr, of counsel, Ropes and
Gray; W. Nicholas Thorndike, retired partner, Wellington Management
Co.; William L. Saltonstall, former state senator; Charles Francis
Adams, retired chairman, Raytheon Co.; Curtis Prout, physician;
Ferdinand Colloredo-Mansfeld, chairman and chief executive of Cabot
Industrial Trust; Frederick S. Moseley 3d, a partner of Seaward
Management Co.; Lawrence T. Perera, a partner in Hem-en-way and
Barnes; Ross E. Sherbrooke, a partner in Investor Associates; and
H.D.S. Greenway, editorial page editor of the Globe. (In addition
to the 12, there are two honorary members: Richard M. Cutler,
retired vice chairman of the trustees of The Putnam Fund; and
Charles Devens, retired investment banker.)
</P>
<P>
   Half the members are over 80, and still come into Boston to work
every day. In terms of the members' professional attainment, their
serv-ice to the community, the numbers of American first families
represented, and the strict numerical limitation on membership,
this may well be the most socially exclusive group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Having money and power doesn't guarantee entry either. John F.
Kennedy, for example, had money, came from Massachusetts, graduated
from Harvard, and also had a pretty good job, but he was never
asked to join. On the plus side, once in, no one has ever been
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
No wives allowed
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when you hear the rules of the social side of the
society, you might not want to join:
</P>
<P>
   Up until last year, only one of the members' wives was allowed
at each of the five yearly white-tie-and-tails dinners held by
members. This was because it was her husband's turn to host, it was
at her home, and she was providing the huge dinner for the anointed
12. The meals (complete with a different fine wine for each course)
were so rich that some of the early members begged out of the
society because of gout. The wife was not allowed to stay for the
cigars and brandy. In society tradition, she instead arose with the
last sip of dessert wine _ always a fine Madeira _ and the toast by
members to all humane societies in the world, curtsied, and backed
out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great debate over the white-tie question,'' says
Francis Burr, president of the society and chief marshal of the
350th anniversary of his college: Harvard. ``The wives took a very
dim view of the dinners,'' he noted, ``and some even pushed their
husbands to give the dinners in a club. We decided last year, then,
to have two lunches, two black-tie dinners, and one annual dinner,
which will still be white tie, but wives will be invited. We had
the first white-tie dinner with wives last year, and I had a very
good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr says he can't remember when he became president. ``It's
simply a matter of seniority,'' he says, modestly.
</P>
<P>
   To a Humane Society member, changing the traditional dress from
white to black tie would once have been as scandalous as wearing a
T-shirt to dinner at the Ritz. But they did it, and they also let a
Princeton man in; Sherbrooke was inducted despite never having
attended Harvard. This has happened a few times since the society
was formed in 1785 and incorporated in 1791, but just a few. The
rules appear to be growing lax; the society's newest member,
Greenway, is a Yalie.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes, there are going to be lunches at the Tavern
Club. And the white-tie dinner, to which all dozen wives are
invited this year, will be held at the Somerset Club instead of at
one of the member's homes. ``You understand,'' explains Burr,
``that we are just trying these new ideas out, at the insistence of
our younger members. If it doesn't work out, we'll go back to the
old way.''

A BOY NAMED SUE, REVISITED  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novelist Leslie Epstein was once offered a fellowship at a
prestigious institute in Prague. The invitation was withdrawn, says
Epstein, when program organizers realized they had mistaken their
man for the woman they hoped and assumed he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half my admiring mail, including job requests, come addressed
to Ms. Leslie Epstein,'' says Epstein, a middle-aged man for whom
having an androgynous moniker is neither cute nor trendy (e.g.,
Morgan, Taylor, Casey) but rather what he calls a ``disadvantage
and a pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein's advice? ``Give your child an unambiguous name, like
Caligula.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Howell, who runs a Cambridge, Mass.executive search
firm, seconds that motion _ with both hands. ``I like unusual
names,'' she (you read that pronoun right) says. ``I just wish I
had one that was not quite so inconvenient.''
</P>
<P>
   At summer camp, Howell recalls, she was assigned to a boys'
cabin. In school, it was shop class instead of home ec. These days,
business calls often start off in a tangle of crossed wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually try to be nice about it,'' says Howell. ``It depends
on who has the power in the conversation. If I do, I might snap at
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly news that America has morphed into a largely unisex
society, from college dorms gone coed to the ubiquity of his and
hers tattoos, gender-blended hairdos, and one-style-suits-all
designer jeans. The popularity of certain names, moreover, has
always drifted with the fashion tides. For boys, Michael, Nicholas,
and Matthew currently rule; for girls, Emily, Sarah, and Ashley top
the premillennial hit parade.
</P>
<P>
   Yell ``Dylan'' or ``Jesse'' or ``Jordan'' in a crowded
schoolyard, though, and it is hard to predict whose head will spin
around _ and whether the kid will be wearing a Reggie Miller or
Cheryl Miller basketball jersey. If your 12-year-old daughter
invited ``Parker'' home for a sleepover, would you bake cookies or
pour yourself a stiff one?
</P>
<P>
   Giving children unisex first names like Kim or Lee or Jamie has
been, according to Pamela Satran, author of the popular book
``Beyond Jennifer and Jason'' and an authority on popular names,
``a major trend, particularly for girls.'' But, she adds, ``I've
also noticed parents going to more ambisexual names for boys, which
is something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Gender identification has become a mainstay of her research,
says Satran, as parents expand their naming options beyond John and
Mary _ or Jennifer and Jason _ to names that could easily fit
through either locker room door at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new generation of feminist mothers have dealt with these
issues in the work force,'' Satran notes. ``They're more inclined
to give their daughter a masculine-sounding name, one that
neutralizes stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most onomasticians (that's a fancy name for name experts) seem
to agree that the trend has usually flowed in one direction only,
from boys' names to girls' names, though rarely back the other way.
Shirley is a prime example, having been exclusively a name for boys
until popularized by child star Shirley Temple.
</P>
<P>
   According to Edward Callary, editor of the American Society of
Names journal, ``Androgynous names unfortunately don't stay that
way. Once a boys' name becomes a girls' name, it's usually a
one-way street. Tracy and Shannon I think of as girls' names now,
which was not the case 20 years ago. Morgan and Casey are still
androgynous but on their way to becoming girls' names too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it like blockbusting,'' Callary adds. ``A family
moves into a neighborhood and another family thinks their property
values are going down, so they sell and move out. A third family
sees this going on and gets scared too, and pretty soon the whole
process accelerates. The same thing happens when a boys' name like
Jordan is given to girls. For the most part it stops being a boys'
name.''
</P>
<P>
   A curious phenomenon, given that two of Hollywood's most
bankable stars are men named Kelsey (Grammer) and Leslie (Nielsen),
and that the top two draft picks in last year's National Football
League draft were Peyton (Manning) and Ryan (Leaf) when they came
out of the delivery room. Atlanta Falcons head coach June Jones is
another guy who has made it in the macho world of pro football,
carrying around a first name only his mother could love (or
intercept and return at the exchange window).
</P>
<P>
   University of Pittsburgh psychologist Herbert Barry III, who
helped coin the term ``unisex name'' in 1982, calculates that about
30 names appear on the ``most popular'' lists for both boys and
girls. ``Gender confusion,'' says Barry, ``does occur, but most
people seem more amused than offended by it. One might predict that
a man would be more offended than a woman would.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, boys are more afraid of being characterized as
effeminate than girls are of getting teased for being tomboys,
Barry notes. ``I don't think it's a threat to one's identity to
have a unisex name,'' adds Barry. ``But I am also convinced that a
name does have a substantial effect on a person's concept of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Counters Cambridge writer Anne Bernays, coauthor (with husband
Justin Kaplan) of ``The Language of Names,'' ``I think it is unfair
at this point in our history to give a kid a unisex name. I know
people who are rueful about it, especially grown men who get
letters addressed to Mrs. or Ms. It adds one more tick of
anxiety-producing material to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, anyway, count Taylor Field more in the
amused than anxious camp. Field, a sixth-grader, says her
androgynous (and quite fashionable) first name has seldom presented
any problems. Well, maybe when she was in ski school and her
instructor, unable to see through Norkin's parka hood, read the
name tag ``Taylor'' and called her a nice young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought that was kind of funny,'' says Field. ``In
kindergarten there was a boy named Taylor, but he was in the other
class. I like the name. It's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Very much a child of the 90s, Taylor Field already has a leg up
on Jeffrey Howell, who named her own son, plainly and
unambiguously, James.
</P>
<P>
   Says Howell with a touch of regret, ``My folks were products of
the '40s and wanted me to have an unusual name. They were operating
from noble sentiments. It just didn't work out.''

NEED MORE STORAGE SPACE? ONE CLOSET, COMING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, no, not another closet, said the handyman.
</P>
<P>
   You already have one 6-footer upstairs with lots of bin space as
well as clothes-hanging space. Another 4-footer, and bins and two
three-footers in the bedroom. And one of those 3-footers is double
deep, making it a 6-footer. That totals 19 feet, not counting some
of the bins and a huge armoire in another room.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but, said Mrs. Handyman. Remember, when we redid the back
room downstairs we lost nearly 4 feet of closet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you, the handyman, are taking up six of those feet that
are left, and more. I just need more space.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, I forgot about that, said the handyman. But where?
</P>
<P>
   The new enclosed porch, of course, said Mrs. Handyman.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted a few days when Mrs. Handyman came up with another
great idea: Instead of taking up space in the new enclosed porch,
how about using the spare room upstairs; it is very small and is
hardly used except as a catch-all for our stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, said the handyman, much relieved at such a brilliant idea.
I'll get out the pencil now and have everything ready _ dimensions
and materials _ to do the nitty gritty on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One more little thing, said Mrs. Handyman. Let's get a
Roll-a-Way that we can tuck in the closet so we can use the room
for sleeping in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Another good idea. A lot gained and hardly anything lost.
</P>
<P>
   There was a powerful motive for the handyman to get started and
finished; the sooner done the more stuff can be stored and taken
off floors, sofas, dining room table, other tables and innumerable
chairs. And (heh heh!) it will be too late for any more
mind-changing.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is any mind-changing in the future, this closet can
be dismantled and disposed of with minimum damage to the room
itself. Just a few holes in plaster walls and woodwork, easily
filled and repainted to get rid of all evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The space to fill with the closet is just over 8 feet wide. It
must be 2 feet deep to accommodate hanging clothes from side to
side. Closets in old houses are often less than that, so that
clothes must be hung from back to front, not a convenient way of
storing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few features to this closet that made its building
a little more difficult. The handyman had 6-foot-wide folding doors
left over from the torn-down closet, and he had to fit these
somehow into the new space.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing fancy that was really needed in this new
closet space: some hanging space and a lot of bins. Really
straightforward, except for that roll-a-way bed, which turned out
to be 22 inches wide, needing a 24-inch-wide opening. That is OK,
except such an opening leaves only 6 feet left over, not enough for
the 6-foot folding doors plus frame.
</P>
<P>
   That too is OK, at least surmountable. The handyman made the
frame opening to accommodate three of the four 18-inch-wide folding
doors. Those three doors total 54 inches; the frame brought the
required space to 57 inches, leaving a scant 12 inches for bins at
one end. So those bins will be narrow. Can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the arrangement in the illustration; it will have to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins the construction. Instead of building the frame the
full height of the ceiling (94 inches), it was decided to build the
lower part which is 80 inches high and fit it in place. That makes
it easier to manage, because if you have ever built anything the
full ceiling height and tried to fit it in place, it is impossible,
not to mention the fact that the closet also had to fit beween two
walls.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get around this is to build it one-half inch shorter,
and narrower, but it was felt that installing the 80-inch bottom
part was easier and made more sense. And, with the lower part in
place, the top part could be build in situ, also easier.
</P>
<P>
   One small problem that occurs when building any piece in a room
in a house of any age is how to make sure you find a wall stud to
nail the closet frame into.
</P>
<P>
   Wall studs don't always line up with the frame of the closet or
any other structue, but the handyman was ready for that one. He cut
notches in each vertical closet frame board and connected the two
with a 1(MUL)4 cleat. Now, he can nail through the cleat into the
wall stud, and no one will be the wiser. Plywood will go up as
shelves and covers, and pine boards will make up the bins.
</P>
<P>
   One more glitch, anticipated and solved: The floor is not level,
which would make those folding doors look funny with an expanding
gap under them. So the handyman simply set an oak threshold level
below the folding doors, filling in under the level threshold with
scrap lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Most materials were used 2 &UR;  &LR; x &UR;  &LR; 3 studs and, 1 x 3 trim boards,
1/2-inch plywood left over from the enclosing of the porch project,
and two bedboards left over after a big queen bed was disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   Result? A free closet, using the scrap lumber and those folding
doors, and a horrendous amount of work by the aging handyman.
</P>
<P>
   But far more important: All that stuff is neatly tucked away,
and Mrs. Handyman is content.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get any better than that.

CAUGHT NAPPING, AND PROUD OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall we visited my husband's college roommate and his wife.
We've seen them at least once a year for the past 30 years and have
been through everything together, the stages of our children's
lives, seven hotly disputed presidential elections, and all the
landmarks of aging. We've known Fran and Pat so long that nothing
they do surprises us anymore, or so I thought. After we'd finished
lunch that Saturday, however, Fran made an announcement that
stunned me into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, time for a nap,'' he said, and marched us up to our
bedroom for an afternoon snooze.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes the cake,'' I said to my husband as we lay down on
top of the blankets. ``I feel like a toddler being sent to my room.
Who can sleep during the day? I'm not in my dotage yet. This is the
most ridiculous thing I've ever ...`` Whomp. I was out like a
light.
</P>
<P>
   You have to understand that I have terrible insomnia. It takes
me at least an hour to fall asleep at night, so I couldn't believe
how easy it was to slip away during the day. To tell you the truth,
it scared me a little. I was horrified by the possibility of so
easily losing part of a perfectly useful afternoon every day for
the rest of my life. I never tried it again.
</P>
<P>
   Until Italy.
</P>
<P>
   During our recent vacation, our family hiked in the Cinque Terra
all morning, enjoyed a leisurely lunch, caught a train back to
Vernazza and climbed the 84 stone steps to our room. I had nothing
pressing to do until dinner. While my husband headed out to find a
bench by the harbor, sip a cup of cappuccino, and practice his
Italian, I'd stretch out on the bed and read.
</P>
<P>
   About two paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't mean to fall sleep, but I couldn't seem to keep my eyes
open. I was only planning to rest them for a moment, but the warm
scented air flowing in the open window swept away my defenses. My
limbs felt heavy. My brain grew slow and dreamy. My body relaxed
and sank into the mattress. I sighed and ... suddenly I slept.
</P>
<P>
   I now know I've been a typical ``napaphobic.'' A friend gave me
William Anthony's tongue-in-cheek guide to ``The Art of Napping,''
and he's helped me recognize that I've had a disparaging attitude
toward those who nap, including myself. I kept my napping
experiences to myself, thus falling into Anthony's category of
closet napper, or ``clapper,'' one of the millions who are hiding
their occasional or regular naps. Like others, I was afraid I'd
become a ``naphomaniac'' and overdo a good thing. He's made me
aware I am blessed with ``naptitude,'' an aptitude for napping.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's out to rehabilitate napping, and he starts, quite
correctly, at the very beginning. You know that part of the Bible
where after God has created the world, on the seventh day, He
rested? An obvious mistranslation from the Hebrew. The original, he
swears, went ``and on the seventh day God nappeth.''
</P>
<P>
   What better role model could we have?
</P>
<P>
   Anthony hauls out other napping heroes for us to emulate.
Winston Churchill wrote: ``You must sleep sometime between lunch
and dinner, and no halfway measures. ... Don't think you will be
doing less work because you sleep during the day. That's a foolish
notion held by people who have no imagination. You will be able to
accomplish more. You get two days in one _ well, at least one and
one-half, I'm sure. When the war started, I had to sleep during the
day because that was the only way I could cope with my
responsibilities.'' Anthony's other napping heroes include Edison,
da Vinci, Brahms, and newscaster Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``The Art of Napping,'' I've learned that I'm not
alone in suffering from apres-nap grogginess. (It goes away in 15
minutes.) I also discovered that my first nap with Pat and Fran and
Jack was actually my toughest. Synchronized napping, it turns out,
is rated the most difficult feat in the entire field of competitive
napping.
</P>
<P>
   I am turning into One Proud Napper.
</P>
<P>
   Let me stretch out on my bed for a moment and find the page
where he talks about how most of us suffer from sleep deprivation.
Oh, yes, he says napping is not only the cheapest form of
preventive medicine, but actually increases a person's productivity
while reducing stress. I have to admit lying here is very relaxing,
but I have a lot to do today and as soon as I rest my eyes ... .
</P>
<P>
   Whomp.

 &HT;    `Joe Black' a deadly dull 3 hours
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If life is like a box of chocolates in movieland, what is death
like?
</P>
<P>
   It's three hours of Brad Pitt looking like a sweet simpleton.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours of Anthony Hopkins introspecting before uttering
imitation pearls of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours of Claire Forlani looking demure, even though she's
a hotshot doctor and the beloved daughter of a gazillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Hours of gooey farewells that add new meaning to ``the long
goodbye.'' Hours spent at a beautiful Long Island mansion and Park
Avenue penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' is like paging through Architectural Digest,
and it at least serves some purpose by reintroducing a world of
manners and fine dining. Problem is, too much nonsense echoes down
those elegant marble halls.
</P>
<P>
   One suspects that director Martin Brest and four screenwriters
fell in love with their own precious work. But can they spell
e-d-i-t-i-n-g?
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' spins the old Fredric March vehicle ``Death
Takes A Holiday.'' But Death takes leave of its senses in this
flick, a romantic-comedy mixing schmaltzy sermons with teasy soft
porn.
</P>
<P>
   As Death personified, Brad Pitt wants to learn why people cling
so to life. Could it be the ladies? To find out, Pitt settles on
Bill Parrish (Hopkins), a fabulously rich media mogul who also
happens to be a swell guy. (How convenient. The story might have
been more interesting if Death had knocked on the door of, say, a
Honduran hovel after a hurricane.)
</P>
<P>
   A deal is struck. Death in the guise of Joe Black will tug at
Bill's elbow as he goes about his life, which centers on his 65th
birthday party and a trite boardroom crisis involving a hostile
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But it's understood the game will be up eventually, and Bill
will have to take that long hike over the hill to the Great Beyond
_ literally long, and literally over a hill, to the accompaniment
of fireworks and swelling strings.
</P>
<P>
   Since Death is a rookie at this life thing, Pitt must act cute
and robotic, even moronic, as he discovers the pleasures of peanut
butter and Hopkins' daughter (Forlani). Both frequently stick to
the roof of his mouth. His pan really is dead most of the time, but
he manages to get some milage out of gentle comic situations. Now
if he would only comb that loopy strand of hair from his forehead.
It's more annoying than death.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is such a fine actor, he makes you believe there is
wisdom hidden in the banalities he's forced to deliver. Naturally
enough, after meeting Death, he spends much of the movie looking
rather distracted. But he brings genuine dignity and warmth to his
role. Too bad they are the only things genuine about his cartoonish
character, who would have been at home in a '30s movie.
</P>
<P>
   The best turns come from the supporting cast, especially Jake
Weber (``Dangerous Beauty'') as a Judas of a right-hand man. He's a
marvelous mixture of droll deviltry, and his blank stares at the
exasperating Joe Black are amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Kelley-Miller plays an elderly Jamaican woman whose illness
makes her welcome Death. She has a marvelous face and gets to
deliver the best speech in the movie, albeit in a
hard-to-understand island accent.
</P>
<P>
   This is a movie of long silences, with much of the acting done
facially. Brest (``Midnight Run'' and ``Scent of a Woman'') is a
proven director who employs a lot of eloquent close-ups, even
during a love-making scene that is more like a love-mugging scene
for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Brest also attends to a wealth of physical detail, lingering
over Bill's elegant lifestyle. No manner of pregnant pauses and
meaningful looks, though, can raise the film above muddled mush.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention it's three hours long? They sunk the Titanic
in that time.

FROM CRYING CONCERNS TO TOILET TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, this column answers selected readers'
questions. Please send yours to Barbara F. Meltz, The Boston Globe,
Box 2378, Boston, MA 02107-2378; fax 617-929-2813; or e-mail
meltz(at)globe.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My daughter, 3 years 8 months, cries a lot and easily if she
doesn't get what she wants. I don't give her anything that I don't
think is good or that might be dangerous, and my rule is she will
not get anything if she cries or screams to ask for it. Sometimes
she will listen, but the next time she wants something, she cries
again. How would you handle this?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on your daughter's communication skills. If she
isn't verbal and doesn't have the ability to tell you what she
needs, she probably resorts to crying out of frustration, says
psychologist Janice Ware, who is codirector of the Children's
Hospital Parent-Infant Mental Health Program. For this child, she
recommends an evaluation by a speech and language pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   If your daughter is capable of using words but chooses not to,
it's likely she's getting more reinforcement to cry than to talk,
says Ware. She suggests looking for every possible opportunity to
reinforce her use of words: ``I love it when you use your words to
tell me what you want!'' or ``It's so good when you use words to
tell me what you want instead of crying.'' Perhaps she starts with
words and escalates to crying in order to get your attention.
Anticipating her needs and moods and giving her choices may head
her off: ``I can see you're getting hungry. Would you like some
yogurt or carrots?''
</P>
<P>
   Next, examine what you do when she does cry. Do you get angry,
maybe even yell at her to stop? When she's in the middle of crying,
it's better not to say anything. She's too upset to hear the
content and she'll take your words, no matter what they are, as
reinforcement. Indeed, Ware says that once she's crying, the goal
is not to react at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do,'' she acknowledges. ``You have to steel
yourself to have no affect. Don't show any anger, even if she gets
more and more angry. As long as she's not hurting herself, there's
no need to respond.'' Hopefully, the combination of being
consistently emotion-less, where you don't get angry and you don't
give in, coupled with reinforcing her use of words, will get the
message across that crying has no pay-off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My sixth-grade girl has been upset by teasing and ``kids
being mean'' but doen't want to listen to my ideas for dealing with
it or explanations of why it happens. Any suggestions? Any books to
recommend for her?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Stop trying to talk to your daughter and just listen.
</P>
<P>
   When a daughter (or son) begins to talk about any problem, a
mother's first response is typically, ``What did you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may only be seeking information, but it comes across as
passing judgment,'' says developmental psychologist Elizabeth
Debold. ``It's the quickest way to shut her up.''
</P>
<P>
   You may be able to regain lost ground by telling her, ``I don't
think I did a very good job listening to you when you told me about
... I promise if you want to try again, I'll be a better
listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Because children this age increasingly need and want to cope
with social issues on their own, often what they need from us is
nothing more than our emotional presence, says Debold. That means
not asking probing questions, not offering advice, not coming to
quick conclusions, and not saying something supportive _ ``I know
how hard this must be for you'' _ and then walking away to start
dinner. ``That's dismissive,'' says Debold. ``Always wait for her
signal that she's done with the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening and not talking is hard to do, especially for mothers
of daughters, because the hurt is often so familiar. ``You can say,
`Something like that happened to me when I was your age,' but don't
launch into it unless she asks you to,'' says Debold. She is author
of ``Mother Daughter Revolution'' (Bantam).
</P>
<P>
   She says the best response is simply, ``Tell me what happened,''
followed by ``Then what?'' or ``Wow,'' and only occasionally with,
``Let me know if there's anything I can do besides listen.'' ``Your
sensitivity and sympathy will come through and so will your
respectfulness,'' says Debold. In the end, that's what will get her
to talk to you next time.
</P>
<P>
   One book your daughter may like is, ``Girltalk'' (Third Edition,
HarperPerennial) by Carol Weston. It has a good chapter on
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 4-year-old is very afraid of bugs, particularly anything
that flies, to the extent she does not want to spend any time
outside. I will mention that she witnessed three of her classmates
being stung by a bee after they accidentally disturbed a hive. I
have been trying to have her spend small amounts of time outside
and talk to her about different bugs. What else can I do?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Proceed very slowly. In the time between now and spring, you
can expose her to bugs through conversation, stories, and pictures,
but given her age, it's likely she's phobic even to photographs at
this point, suggests Fred Neuman, director of the Anxiety and
Phobia Clinic at White Plains Hospital in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Don't push the subject more than she can tolerate; if she gets
anxious, back off, and try again another time. Don't dismiss her
fear or try to talk her out of it. Identify bugs that bite and bugs
that fly. Talk about ways in which insects are helpful,
particularly about child-friendly bugs like ladybugs. Help her feel
she has some control by talking about ways to prevent being bitten,
for instance, by not disturbing a nest or wearing repellent. Ask
what ideas she has for staying safe. Talk about bug bites you've
had and the remedies you've used for taking away the sting.
</P>
<P>
   The more information she has, the more she'll begin to feel like
an expert, says Neuman. By midwinter, she may be able to tolerate
an ant farm, the movie ``Antz,'' or to look at some dead bugs in a
jar or through a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   A child who feels afraid almost always feel alone. Knowing that
other people also are frightened can help. A wonderful book that
conveys that message is ``Franklin in the Dark,'' by Paulette
Bourgeois and Brenda Clark (Scholastic, 1987).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a teacher's assistant at a day-care center. We have a
3-year-old in our class who has no interest in the potty. ... He
comes to school in diapers. We have him try to go to the bathroom,
and then put on pullups. He is able to dress himself for the most
part. We send him to the bathroom several times a day and he's had
a few successes, but mostly out of luck. ... His mother says she
wants advice ... but says we are pushing him. ... She dresses him
in overalls or one-piece outfits and clothing with lots of snaps or
buttons. We have a classroom of 14 3-year-olds and this takes up a
lot of time. We have spoken to her about this, but she seems to not
want to listen to our suggestions at all. Any tips on toilet
training would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a classic problem, but not about toilet training.
``This is about poor communication between school and home,'' says
child psychologist Sharry Langdale, assistant professor of child
development at Wheelock College and a former teacher of young
children.
</P>
<P>
   If this were her school, she'd set up a sit-down meeting with
the parents. ``Don't do this standing in the door,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She says both teachers and parents need to define and understand
each other's expectations. ``Teachers need to articulate how
difficult it is for them to have a child who is not trained because
their teacher-child ratio depends on how much help children need,''
she says. ``On the other hand, for parents to send their child in
diapers and have him come home in pullups may feel to them their
values aren't being respected.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, she says, that what you perceive as
stonewalling may only be the parents' reflection of current
thinking about toilet training, which is very laid-back: When kids
are ready, it will happen easily. ``If you see evidence of
physiological maturity to indicate this child knows when he has to
go to the bathroom, your message to parents should be, `How can we
accomplish this together?''' She says a goal to work toward would
be for parents to send him in pullups rather than diapers and in
clothes he can manipulate himself.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not ready, however, switching him from diapers to
pullups may be easier for the teachers but harder on the child.
``When a child gets different messages from home and school, the
inconsistency doesn't help training, it prolongs it, and may create
a control issue in the process,'' says Langdale.
</P>
<P>
   If parents and teachers can't agree on a compromise, it's in the
child's best interest for the family to switch day care, she says.
Schools are typically loath to suggest this and parents typically
hate the prospect of beginning anew. But, says Langdale, ``Kids
need consistency between the two environments for ideal
development. That's the bottom line.''

 &HT;    Edward Norton's strong performance redeems a heavy-handed movie
about a searing subject
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   American History X'' is a dumb, obvious movie that almost
obliterates a smart, complex performance by Edward Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Almost, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, the Robert De Niro of his generation, somehow manages to
keep his head down, maintain focus and do his job, even as the
movie falls to pieces around him, choking on its own one-note
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is a flashy contrivance that cuts back and forth
between two stories. The black-and-white past shows us how Derek
Vinyard (Norton), a regular blue-collar kid from Venice Beach,
Calif., became a neo-Nazi and how he behaved like one, including
the chilling act of racist violence that got him a prison term. The
present, in color, begins the day Derek is released. He has not
only renounced his former ways but desperately wants to dissuade
his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), from following the
same sick path. ``Hate is baggage,'' Derek says. ``Life is too
short to be pissed off all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' wants to tell us the same thing. That
neo-Nazis and skinheads are bad, stupid people. Fair enough.
Certainly true enough. And, at times, it taps into the obscene
thickheadedness and rancid tunnel vision that fuel white-power
rage. Delivered by Norton, Derek's hate-filled rants have a
harrowing impact _ whether he's pointing out that AIDS and welfare
aren't ``white problems'' or emasculating a sad-eyed Jewish man
(Elliott Gould) who has come to court his widowed mother (Beverly
D'Angelo.) In one dinner exchange, Gould tries to argue that the
riots in Los Angeles were manifestations of anger and
powerlessness. ``Opportunism,'' shoots back Derek, echoing what a
lot of people who look like him say out loud and what a lot of
people who don't look like him think but don't say.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is too juiced up on its own vicious themes.
``American History X'' trafficks in racial confrontations,
anti-Semitic slurs, etc., without truly delving any deeper than the
junk spewed out daily on such 1990s inanities as ``Jerry
Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to walk a fine line between the explosive and the
exploitative, director Tony Kaye stumbles all too often. Granted,
he has disowned the movie _ a complicated fight among him, the
studio and Norton _ but it's hard to see how a director's cut could
salvage the ludicrously heavy-handed script or the persistent tone
of public-service-announcement fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' is a hothead movie, as addicted to its
own flamboyant rage as Derek once was. At the same time, it uses
its incendiary subject matter as a dodge _ a way to hide the fact
that, essentially, this is just another
juvenile-delinquent-goes-straight flick. If you closed your eyes
and tried real hard, you could probably hear bits of the ``West
Side Story'' score.
</P>
<P>
   The film would be virtually unwatchable _ a self-parody almost _
if it weren't for Norton. ``American History X'' doesn't make you
nervous or push you to think in new ways about an all too familiar
phenomenon. But Norton's performance does. He looks the role eerily
well _ the sculpted pecs, the tattoed body adornments. More to the
point, he inhabits the role. Derek's transformation from
race-baiting monster to a kind of Alan Alda clone is too abrupt,
which undercuts his portrayal as a whole. But moment to moment,
everything he does is riveting, whether it's a rampage through a
Korean grocery store or the way he grins at the cops who've come to
arrest him after he has bashed in an African-American's head.
</P>
<P>
   Hatred, alas, is as American as Mom and apple pie. Norton's
performance nails that sad truism; the movie doesn't. ``American
History X'' wants to make us sick at heart. And it does. But it
also wants to make us sick to our stomach. It does that, too, but,
ironically, that's its loss. And ours.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Directed by Tony
Kaye. Rated R for language, violence and sex. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An X-cessive mess, but Edward Norton scores in
every scene.

 &HT;    Nice theme doesn't make it `home'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jake (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) isn't a Scrooge. But he's a
champion scam artist. Enrolled at a Los Angeles college, he earns
spare change by selling fake IDs or helping other students cheat on
their exams through a system involving pagers. He can turn any
obstacle into an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   And he has to do that when some angry classmates strand him in
the desert, wearing a Santa Claus suit with Kris Kringle hat and
beard both glued to his head. The problem is, he has to get home to
New York by Christmas Eve to claim the 1957 Porsche his father
(Gary Cole) has promised him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of several days, hitching rides across the
country, Jake (like a junior Scrooge) must find redemption and
learn the true meaning of family. And also win back the trust of
his girlfriend, Allie (Jessica Biel), who's being driven home by a
rival classmate (Adam Lavorgna) who wants to win her affection.
</P>
<P>
   Learning to love your family is a perfectly fine message for the
kids the movie is targeting (much younger than college-age Jake).
But ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' has a clumsy way of selling it.
Jake gets a ride with old Tom Jones fans, a group of ladies who
have to endure a gag about false teeth and pickles; the scene's
punch line is Jake throwing up in their car. Can you feel the warm
seasonal glow yet?
</P>
<P>
   In getting Jake in and out of scrapes, the movie seems
determined to grow ever more ludicrous, whether it involves putting
him into a van of stolen home appliances or an entire town full of
Santas running a 5K. This is a Disney theme-park view of the world.
Every third person Jake meets is in costume of some kind, whether
it's the Bavarian extras in a cheesy Alpine village or a waitress
who has to wear cow ears at her restaurant, the Turf and Turf.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, kids won't mind. Thomas is a pleasant enough young
actor, though at 17 he still looks too young to be in college. He's
also a ringer for Val Kilmer's kid brother. Director Arlene Sanford
(``A Very Brady Sequel'') surrounds him with good character actors,
including Andrew Lauer as a very dim thief who happily masquerades
as Jake's elf and Sean O'Bryan as a policeman who wins back his
estranged wife by singing a gonzo version of ``O Tannenbaum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Directed by Arlene Sanford.
Rated PG for mild language and some rude humor. 1 hour, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A pleasant but far-fetched object lesson on the
importance of family feelings over personal gain.

 &HT;    Death just a drag in `Joe Black'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black,'' but take a pillow. Or a thermos of coffee.
You can either succumb to its stupefying slowness or struggle to
stay awake.
</P>
<P>
   In this update of 1934's ``Death Takes a Holiday,'' the Grim
Reaper comes to media mogul Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) in the
form of Brad Pitt. But Death, who assumes the name Joe Black,
decides to hang out at Bill's Manhattan mansion, kick back and
learn what being human is all about.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of ``Star Trek's'' Mr. Spock and Chauncey Gardner of
``Being There,'' Black falls for Bill's daughter Susan (Clair
Forlani). Like Meg Ryan in ``City of Angels,'' Forlani plays a
doctor. Her attraction to Pitt is as hard to buy as Ryan's for
dopey angel Nicolas Cage: These men are studly but off-kilter
weirdos who act like children and delight in new sensation. (For
the record, Cage loved pears, Pitt digs peanut butter.)
</P>
<P>
   Though the romance is being sold as its focus, the film spends
unholy amounts of time on the skulduggery of Bill's right-hand man,
Drew (played snakily well by Jake Weber). He plots a merger of
Parrish Communications with another media giant, meaning that Bill
will lose control of his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Because we already know that Bill is slated to die at any
moment, your response might understandably be, ``And?'' As an
example of where the movie puts its priorities, its emotional
climax is not Susan's discovery of who Joe really is, but her
father's confrontation with Drew.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1934 original clocked in at 78 minutes, Martin Brest's
version more than doubles the running time. He has taken a soap
bubble and encased it in lead, making a lightweight fantasy
thuddingly literal. It seems to be made for people who couldn't
keep up with the plot of ``The Horse Whisperer.'' Brest's last
movie, ``Scent of a Woman'' in 1992, was also preposterously long.
But it least it had Al Pacino's love-it-or-hate-it performance to
keep you awake.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is a reliable, nuanced pro. Pitt has charming moments,
but the script forces him to act as dumb as a puppy in one scene,
then be dazzlingly articulate in the next. Joe Black isn't a
character; he's just a blank slate for the movie's undercooked
pretensions. It measures its self-importance in pauses and
repetitions. For example, when Death first reveals himself to Bill,
this dialogue follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're Death?'' Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.'' Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death?'' Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   You could knit entire blankets during the pauses between lines.
</P>
<P>
   Lavishly over-art-directed, ``Meet Joe Black'' is one of
Hollywood's supposedly ``spiritual'' movies, but it's mainly
interested in showing us how really, really rich people live. And
how beautiful Pitt and Forlani look together.
</P>
<P>
   Forlani has about two modes: puzzled-happy and puzzled-angry.
She's a lovely presence, but there's a reason a stronger actress
wasn't cast. Pitt is the film's object of desire; he's been
elevated from poster boy to quasi-religious icon. Joe Black doesn't
make love to Susan; she undresses him in an endless scene that's
filmed with the reverent hush you might find in a religious
processional.
</P>
<P>
   There's hardly a moment in ``Joe Black'' that breathes with a
sense of spontaneity _ except for one shocking scene of a man
getting run over. Its approach to spiritual issues has all the
drama and depth of an issue of Metropolitan Home magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, after ``Phenomenon'' and ``City of Angels'' _ which
were sappy but at least had a pulse _ I'm tired of being
``uplifted'' by Hollywood. I'd rather be entertained. Forget all
the movie's ham-handed messages about seizing the day and living to
the fullest. The real way ``Meet Joe Black'' makes you appreciate
life is by boring you to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Clair Forlani. Directed
by Martin Brest. Rated PG-13 for an accident scene, some sexuality
and brief strong language. 2 hours,58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Dead on arrival.

 &HT;    Slasher rehash doesn't make cut
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do you see any killers out there?'' an obviously exasperated
Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) snaps at Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt)
about an hour into this teen slasher flick. ``How 'bout Freddy or
Jason? How about it?!''
</P>
<P>
   How about it, indeed? It may be hard to imagine yourself
suddenly missing those stylin' cutups from the ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' and ``Friday the 13th'' movie franchises. But, well,
something's needed to liven up this bland sequel to last year's
phenomenally successful ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame the crazed killer. Raised from the dead, as can only
happen after a movie earns $100 million-plus in box office
receipts, Ben Willis (Muse Watson) is still clad in head-to-toe
rain gear and still running around like some deranged version of
the Gorton's fisherman. This time, though, he's taken the chip on
his shoulder and the deadly hook on his hand to a fictitious
Bahamian island, where he plans to exact revenge against Hewitt for
(supposedly) killing him off in the first movie.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only after Ben had killed off most of her friends
first. Now she has a whole bunch of new friends, including Karla
(TV and pop star Brandy), the world's hippest and most
understanding college roommate. When she's not working in a cool
dance club or winning the Bahamian trip on radio, Karla throws her
considerable energy into trying to cheer Julie up during the days
preceding the anniversary of her friends' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. One doesn't live with Julie so much as physically and
mentally survive the experience. Julie keeps thinking she sees Ben,
even before he actually resurfaces, and it's a wonder she doesn't
impale Karla on one of the sharp knives she's always flailing
around with. Throw in a moody streak to rival Sylvia Plath's, and
it's hard to understand why anyone would tolerate Julie, let alone
go to the Bahamas with her. (Let alone not take the killer by the
hand once there and confide, ``She's hiding in the pantry!'')
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but then there wouldn't be any plot _ not that there's much
of one, anyway. Other than Miss Mope Hewitt's general blahness, ``I
Still Know's'' major flaw is that it's so relentlessly predictable
that they ought to issue certain characters morgue toe tags instead
of names. Even death is dull here. The closest thing to
``Scream''-like ingenuity _ an apparent case of murder by tanning
bed _ turns out to be just one more sunburned red herring.
</P>
<P>
   At least Brandy shines in her feature film debut. A Top 10
recording artist (``The Boy Is Mine'') and star of the UPN
network's popular ``Moesha,'' the 19-year-old effortlessly makes
the transition to the big screen. She's the anti-Hewitt, by turns
funny, smart and sexy. If Brandy were in charge, one gets the
feeling, Ben Willis would quickly become fish bait.
</P>
<P>
   But then Hewitt probably wouldn't get to be the one to sing
onscreen (she does have an album coming out, you know). And it
might spoil plans for the sequel to the sequel; even if published
reports didn't have one already in the works, the movie's
remarkably cliched ending is the ultimate tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ben Willis had the right idea with that hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Brandy.
Directed by Danny Cannon. Rated R for violence, language and sexual
situations. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This boring and utterly predictable sequel to last
year's teen slasher surprise hit won't necessarily make you root
against the killer. At least Brandy's performance isn't a hack job.

NATURALIST FINDS TROUBLING SIGNS IN THE FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of us have a special forest that we think of as ``ours.''
It may be next door, far away, or only a childhood memory. The
first forest that Bernd Heinrich remembers was the one in Germany
where he and his family lived and foraged for food as World War II
refugees. But it's the forest of his adult years in western Maine
that he wrote about in ``The Trees in My Forest,'' which won this
year's New England Booksellers Award for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Heinrich in the company of such stellar writers as
Doris Kearns Goodwin and Donald Hall. But the 58-year-old field
biologist doesn't even consider himself a writer. His essays, he
says, are just a way of ordering his scientific investigations into
the natural world. Those explorations take him in many directions.
The week we met to talk about forests, he was also lecturing at
Cornell University on his discoveries of how insects maintain their
body temperatures, one of the topics of his now-classic book
``Bumblebee Economics,'' and at a Maine conference about his
experiments measuring the IQ of our most intelligent native bird,
the raven. That book, called ``Mind of the Raven,'' is due out next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   But when I learned that Heinrich has also won the Masters
division of the Boston Marathon and held many ultramarathon records
(including one for running 157 miles in 24 hours), his achievements
began to seem excessive.
</P>
<P>
   How would I ever keep up with him on our scheduled walk in the
woods? I pictured him leaping fallen trees like a deer as I
stuggled far behind with my hiking stick. And with so many
accomplishments, would Heinrich prove to be a superman with a super
ego?
</P>
<P>
   So I was surprised to meet instead a soft-spoken man of average
build who seemed almost unprepossessing. He arrived an hour early,
having spent the previous day in his Maine woods where no one tells
you to set back your watch for Daylight Savings Time. Besides, he
said with a faint German accent, ``I don't know how to reset this
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich spends as much time as he can in Maine, where he lives
in a handbuilt log cabin without electricity or even a road. He's
also a professor at the University of Vermont. One of his favorite
treats, which he shares with his annual winter biology class when
it comes to Maine, is mice, breaded and crispy fried.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A war-torn childhood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich's unusual lifestyle has its roots in an unusual
childhood, which began during World War II on the family estate in
Poland. His half-Jewish father spent the war in the Luftwaffe.
``Nobody could touch him there.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Soviet Army advanced, Heinrich and his mother fled their
home in a horse-drawn sleigh though a snowstorm for his father's
base. Many narrow escapes from both SS troops and the Red Army
followed. ``But that's really my parents' lives. I was only 4,''
said Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of his own life begins after the war with the five
years his reunited family spent in an abandoned cabin in a forest
preserve near Hamburg. From the age of 5, Heinrich became expert at
foraging for food. Birds and their eggs, wild nuts and berries,
and, of course, mice were all on the bill of fare for the penniless
family. He fell in love with the forest. His best childhood friend
was a crow named Jacob, the predecessor of the ravens he now raises
and studies.
</P>
<P>
   When Heinrich was 10, the family moved to a run-down farm in
Maine near where he now lives. His parents were amateur biologists.
They frequently left the country to collect bird specimens for
museums and left him and his sister in a Bible-oriented school and
work farm for indigent children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a system of houses and house parents. I had a bad
one. She was a fundamentalist Baptist. She saw me as a heathen and
was out to get me.'' This is when Heinrich began his long-distance
running, with many long- and short-term escapes back to his beloved
forest.
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing a PhD at the University of California at Los
Angeles, Heinrich escaped to the forest for a third time when,
spying a hawk flying by his laboratory window, he decided to switch
disciplines from cell biology to physiological ecology, which would
allow him to work outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich's best-known contribution to science to date has been
on the many complex ways insects regulate their body temperatures.
It began with questions that occurred to him while watching
bumblebees in the fireweed of his parents' Maine farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that if you're a naturalist, you're intellectually
inferior. So I wanted to make a good name for myself as a
scientist. And now I can go back to what I want to do, being a
naturalist,'' Heinrich said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought his own 300 acres in Maine in 1977 while a faculty
member at the University of California at Berkeley, then joined the
University of Vermont to get closer to his cabin in the Maine
woods.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of Maine's millions of forest acres are clear-cut
every 20 or 30 years by paper companies. Heinrich's forest was
logged just before he bought it for $90 an acre in 1977, and he has
been patiently helping it restore itself ever since. This has
included selective logging, leaving the largest and rarest trees to
prosper while making a modest profit from the thinnings.

MAINSTREAM MUSCLES IN ON TABLOIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, it looked like classic supermarket tabloid
fodder. The Nov. 17 cover of the National Enquirer featured a
disturbing picture of rail-thin ``Ally McBeal'' star Calista
Flockhart with the headline: ``Calista anorexia crisis: `Don't Kill
Yourself' begs Hollywood star who knows the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem. The Flockhart anorexia tale had
already received a thorough going-over everywhere from the
``Today'' show to People magazine. (People's Nov. 9 cover hyped an
``exclusive'' Flockhart interview with the headline, ``Am I
Anorexic? ... No'').
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the tale _ to use some supermarket tabloid
vernacular _ of ``the incredible shrinking circulation!!!''
According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations numbers for the six
months that ended June 30: The Enquirer dropped from almost 2.72
million to 2.2 million in one year; the Star's numbers have fallen
to 1.9 million from almost 2.3 million two years ago; the Globe's
circulation dropped from 1.04 million in 1997 to 845,000; and the
National Examiner's June 1997 circulation of 527,730 fell to
451,973 a year later. (A recent Newsweek article on the subject
noted that the Enquirer's circulation was as high as 5.3 million 20
years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of this phenomenon, says Star editor Phil Bunton, can be
attributed to the ``theory out there that the paparazzi killed
(Princess) Diana. No question that hurt.'' But the main reason can
be found in the Flockhart story. The line between tabloid and
mainstream journalism, observers say, is no longer visible to the
naked eye. Or as Bunton puts it: ``All these guys are muscling in
on our turf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of the same (tabloid) stories anywhere from `Hard
Copy' to `Entertainment Tonight' ... even places like MSNBC and
CNN,'' notes media analyst and tabloid specialist Chris Ryan. ``A
perfect example of the turning tide was the JonBenet Ramsey case.
... I think they are being out-tabloided by the mainstream media.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, tabloid and mainstream journalism have collided
at the intersection of sex and politics. The Gennifer Flowers
affair and presidential adviser Dick Morris's dalliance with a
prostitute were broken in the Star before being picked up by every
media outlet under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the taboo-shattering Lewinsky scandal. As one
tabloid expert who asked for anonymity notes, ``it's very hard to
be a tabloid when you have Congress printing an oral sex story.''
</P>

   When he started Court TV seven years ago, Steve Brill began to
democratize jurisprudence by allowing the public to watch
high-profile trials. Soon viewers began rendering their own
verdicts on call-in shows and around the water cooler. In some
cases _ like the O.J. Simpson and Louise Woodward trials _ the
public practically revolted against a jury verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's moved into media criticism with Brill's Content
magazine, the ever-inventive Brill is tinkering with the idea of
submitting nasty journalistic disputes to the court of public
opinion. The new Complaint Board on his magazine's America Online
site represents an opportunity for those who feel victimized by the
media to take their cases directly to the citizens, who are
encouraged to weigh in on the dispute. Responses from the news
organizations are also invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you or your company/organization been unfairly portrayed
by the news media? Tell us,'' beckons the complaint board in
language not dissimilar from those TV pitches by malpractice
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, four ``plaintiffs'' have taken him up on the offer.
The US Consumer Products Safety Commission sent a letter taking
issue with how it was portrayed in an article in Chicago magazine.
The executive director of New York's Center for Animal Care and
Control wrote to challenge a New York magazine story that she says
was ``riddled with untruths and exaggerations.'' The police chief
of Naperville, Ill., penned a letter about a ``60 Minutes'' story
that he considered unfair. And the Ford Motor Co. launched a
preemptive strike again a future ``Dateline NBC'' story that will
reportedly deal with Ford vehicle malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Stating that Chicago magazine had declined to publish a
retraction, Kathleen Begala, the public affairs director for the
safety commission, says the complaint board ``gives another chance
for the public to see both sides.'' Marilyn Haggerty-Blohm,
executive director of the animal care center, relishes the
opportunity to present her case in a more substantive forum than
just in an edited letter to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   Naperville Police Chief David Dial says ``60 Minutes'' hasn't
yet responded to his letter. But Brill ``has given me a start, so
we'll see what happens,'' he says. ``Now, they'll get a taste of
what I'm going through.'' A Ford spokesman, James R. Cain, says he
chose the Brill outlet because ``I've wanted my views on the
subject unedited and available publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brill has big plans for his invention. ``Sooner or
later, we will evolve from this to where we ask people on line to
vote'' on these journalistic disputes, he says. And the magazine
could offer its services as arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves Cain asking: ``Will Brill eventually become
(journalism's) Judge Judy?''

   Every Sunday Lorrie Lynch's ``Who's News'' Q&AMP;A column in Parade
magazine has provocative questions. Lynch's straightforward answers
are a lot less interesting. So I find myself inventing replies that
are closer to the spirit of the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Rita Trudeau of Woonsocket, R.I., asked: ``It's
surprising that glam couple John Kennedy Jr., and his wife, Carolyn
Bessette-Kennedy, haven't had a baby yet. Do you think they will?
They've been married two years.''
</P>
<P>
   You hit it right on the nose, Rita. Just what's wrong with those
two? Married two years and no baby? The least they could do is give
us the grandchild we've always wanted. How can they be so selfish?
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Cheryl Tiegs just got married again, to a much younger
man. What number husband is this?'' asks David Goldberg of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Trust Cheryl to make a fool of herself over a young stud. She's
assigned this one the number seven. He's only her fifth,
technically, but her personal numerologist says seven is her lucky
number. Maybe it will be.
</P>
<P>
   John Lombardo wants to know, ``Can you tell me why Cindy
Crawford, who has made millions as a model, finds it necessary to
pose in Playboy and do a TV show call `Sex With Cindy Crawford'?''
</P>
<P>
   Because she's a tramp. Is that the answer you were hoping for?
</P>
<P>
   If I didn't know better I'd suspect that these questions, and
many others in the same vein, were crafted by the same person,
because they all contain an implicit reproof, a moral judgement, an
unspoken ``tut, tut.'' We already know we're a nation of voyeurs.
Are we also a nation of busybodies? A whole country of critical
in-laws just itching to put John and Carolyn and Cindy and all the
rest of them in their place?
</P>
<P>
   Television, magazines, newspapers, the Internet make us feel we
know famous people as well or better than we know friends and
relatives. Celebrities are our neighbors in the global village, so
maybe it's not surprising that some of feel we have the right,
maybe even the obligation, to try to meddle in their lives, to peer
over the virtual hedge and ask: Hey, how come you're not pregnant
yet?
</P>
<P>
   We'd probably do better to mind our own business instead of the
business of the famous. But it wouldn't be as much fun. Why would
we want to dwell on our own drab lives when can stick our noses
into Luciano Pavarotti's career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Luciano Pavarotti but I find it painful to hear him
nowadays. Shouldn't he quit while he's ahead?'' S. Goldberg of
Miami asks ``Who's News.''
</P>
<P>
   Quit while he's ahead? Too late for that.
</P>
<P>
   Famous people invite us into their lives, then slam the door in
our faces. They're everywhere, confessing the most intimate details
of their lives, when they have something they want to promote, when
their confessions can land them on the cover of People magazine.
When they don't have anything to sell, they go into hiding and
complain about the media and the public intruding in their personal
lives. It seems hypocritical, but it's just business.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hypocrisy, I confess I was pleased to see Dr. Laura
Schlessinger hoisted by her own petard. It's not nice of me, I
know, but there it is. I am trying to compose a question worthy of
``Who's News'': ``I have seen the nude photographs of Dr. Laura
with my own eyes but I still can't believe that our No.1 moral
arbiter could ever have sunk so low. Are the photos phonies? Did
somebody slip a mickey into her orange juice?''

FONG'S HOPE TO ATTRACT ASIAN-AMERICANS FAILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite his push to attract Asian-American
voters, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Matt Fong lost handily in
every section of San Francisco, even in neighborhoods with large
ethnic-Asian populations.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans voted overwhelmingly for Sen. Barbara Boxer, the
Democratic incumbent, even in areas such as Chinatown and the
Sunset neighborhood, where some political analysts expected Fong to
make strong inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, the California treasurer, fared best in the Sunset section
of the city, but still was supported by only 33 percent of voters,
compared with 59 percent for Boxer. In Chinatown and other areas
rich in Asian-American votes, Fong was supported by less than
one-third of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood-by-neighborhood results, released this week by
the city's Department of Elections, deflate the theory used by
Fong's campaign that the Republican could run a competitive
campaign even in liberal San Francisco because of his strong
support from Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer defeated Fong with 72 percent of the vote in San
Francisco, and with 53 percent of the vote statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the race went on toward the end, and especially right
before the election, I think people got a pretty good sense of Matt
Fong and how conservative he is (and) that he was not the moderate
many people suspected that he might be,'' said Andrea Quong,
coordinator of New California Media, a San Francisco-based network
of ethnic media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Districts in the city that area the heart of the homosexual
community also voted heavily for Boxer, indicating that Fong's
$50,000 donation to an anti-gay organization just before the
election hurt his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Republican gays voted for Boxer, and some independent
gays who might have sided with Fong also voted for Boxer,'' San
Francisco pollster David Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fong did poorly in communities with significant
Asian-American populations, some political analysts suggest he did
well among one group: Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll of 300 Chinese-American voters in Chinatown, the
Sunset and Richmond sections, and Visitacion Valley showed Fong, a
fourth-generation Chinese-American, winning 67 percent to 30
percent for Boxer. The poll was conducted in English, Mandarin and
Cantonese by the Chinese-American Voters Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   David Lee, executive director of the committee, said that
although Chinese-Americans in the city supported Fong, other ethnic
Asians supported Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hsieh Jr., a political consultant, said Fong lost not
because he did not receive the brunt of the Asian-American vote,
but because he did not lure moderates. Although Fong tried to paint
Boxer as too liberal for California, Boxer appeared to be more
successful in portraying Fong as too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong lost the moderate vote he had hoped for from Democrats
and independents across all the voting groups, whatever your
ethnicity,'' Hsieh said. ``The several millions of dollars the
Boxer campaign used effectively to attack Matt Fong worked very
well. They did it very tactfully, and it didn't backfire.''

NETWORKING RIGHT AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kilowatts or kilobits? The electrical wires in the walls of your
home couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   For over a century, we wired our homes to provide electric
lighting and heating, and eventually, Seinfeld reruns. But it turns
out that those same wires can also carry data to your PC, so that
you can link all the computers in your home by plugging them into
wall sockets.
</P>
<P>
   At first it sounds nutty, using the same wire for electricity
and data. Actually, engineers have been doing it for years.
Adaptive Networks Inc. in Newton has sold more than 100,000 such
systems, for refrigerated containers on ships. The same wire
feeding electricity into the container can also fire off reports
about the condition of the cargo.
</P>
<P>
   So we know it can be done. But can you make it work in the
typical home?
</P>
<P>
   Well, my home's not typical _ too many computers, not enough
furniture. But the electrical wiring is pretty much standard issue,
and I've now used that wire to link up two computers and a printer.
All I needed was PassPort, an impressive product from Intelogis
Inc. of Draper, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The PassPort kit comes with three white boxes _ two for your PCs
and one for a printer. Each PassPort box connects to the parallel
port on a computer or printer. Then you plug each PassPort box into
a wall socket. You'll still need separate outlets to provide juice
for the computers and printer, so you'd better have plenty of
electrical outlets. Now just load the PassPort software onto the
computers, add water and stir.
</P>
<P>
   PassPort works only with Windows 95 or 98. A basic kit,
available through CompUSA and OfficeMax stores, sells for about
$200 _ not too bad compared to the cost of running Ethernet
networking cable into Junior's bedroom. Then again, with Ethernet,
your home network can transmit data at up to 100 million bits per
second. PassPort's top speed is a measly 350,000 bits per second.
It took me 15 minutes to copy a 14.6 megabyte file over the
network, a task that would have taken seconds with Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   But 350 kilobits is good enough for sending data to a printer in
the other room. It's also faster than any telephone modem. So with
PassPort, one computer can be linked to the Internet as a ``proxy
server,'' which can relay Internet data to other machines on the
network. The system comes with a simple proxy server program for
just this purpose. This gimmick really comes into its own for
people with high-speed cable modems or ADSL systems. With PassPort,
they can distribute that monster bandwidth among every computer in
the house.
</P>
<P>
   But you could also distribute your computer files to every
hacker in the neighborhood, if you're not careful. Data sent over a
PassPort network can travel over the electric line for up to half a
mile from your house. Other PassPort users on the same electrical
circuit could swipe data from your network.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new problem _ if you have an incorrectly installed
cable modem, every geek in the neighborhood can run wild on your
hard drive. Luckily, Windows has built-in security features to
prevent this. PassPort has safeguards as well, and an instruction
manual that begs you to use them. PassPort is too new a product to
have attracted much attention from ``dark side'' hackers. But it'll
become the next hot target if the product is a hit.
</P>
<P>
   PassPort could do good business over the holidays. The research
firm Dataquest guesstimates that 15 million American homes have two
or more computers. That's a lot of potential customers for
Intelogis and a host of rival companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   In January, modem maker Boca Research Inc. will introduce a $160
networking kit that uses telephone wires to link computers at a
million bits per second, without interfering with phone calls.
Other firms like WebGear Inc. are pushing wireless home networks
that rely on radio waves, while network firms like 3Com &UR;  &LR; Corp.
stress the high reliability and falling cost of Ethernet wiring for
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intelogis is working on a faster version of PassPort
that delivers 1.5 megabits per second over electrical lines that
are proving to be more versatile than Thomas Edison could ever have
imagined.

 Cost of Alzheimer's is estimated at $51b
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation could save more than $1 billion a year in health-care
costs by delaying, for as little as a month, placement of people
with Alzheimer's disease in nursing homes, according to a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   That such a small change could save so much money is an
indicator of the staggering cost of the disease: more than $51
billion a year, according to the study published this week in the
journal Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease usually strikes in the later years, eroding
memory and judgment, altering emotions, and eventually causing
severe disability. The report, authored by researchers at Project
HOPE's Center for Health Affairs and the Harvard School of Public
Health, also said that substituting care in an assisted-living
facility for nursing homes could save between $3.5 billion and $5.1
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers pointed out that the savings from keeping
Alzheimer's patients out of nursing homes for even a short time
would be gained in part by further burdening family members already
exhausted by the demands of taking care of someone with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Surgeon's skill called key in artery clearing
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; The up-and-down enthusiasm for trying to prevent strokes by
removing blockages in neck arteries _ an operation first done in
1954 _ has risen again in the past several years. But new reports
in the New England Journal of Medicine on the operation, called
endarterectomy, suggest that only certain patients will benefit
and, even then, only when the operation is performed by highly
skilled surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   One report, from an ongoing North American study of the
treatment, showed that patients whose carotid arteries were more
than half blocked and who had symptoms like transient, minor
strokes, had a 10 percent reduction in risk of disabling stroke
after five years if they had the operation. But there was no
benefit for patients with lesser obstructions.
</P>
<P>
   A second report from researchers in Ontario, California, and New
York found a rising use of the operation since 1991 but discovered
big variations in both the patients and the degree of blockage that
were referred for endarterectomies. Moreoever, they found that
patients weren't always sent to surgeons who did a lot of them and
had low rates of complications.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark R. Chassin of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York commented in the journal that rates of surgical complications,
like death and strokes during the operation, must be held to 6 or 7
percent for patients overall to get the benefits found in the North
American trial. For that reason, he said, the complications rates
of surgeons should be made public.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Grape juice is as good as wine, it says here
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether this comes as good or bad news depends on your
viewpoint: Drinking purple grape juice may be as beneficial in
reducing your risk of heart attack as sipping red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Research presented this week in Dallas at a meeting of the
American Heart Association suggests that grape juice has a similar
effect to that of alcohol on blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jane E. Freedman of Georgetown University Medical Center
said that alcohol inhibits blood clotting, but only when there is a
lot of alcohol in the blood _ enough to cause intoxication. In the
laboratory, however, nonalcoholic purple grape juice reduced
clotting and also caused platelets, the cells that form clots, to
release nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels, Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not present clinical evidence of grape juice's effect on
heart disease risk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Herbal withdrawal caused his confusion
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case of a man who developed heart distress and mental
confusion after surgery has prompted doctors at Duke University
Medical Center to warn about the effects of discontinuing herbal
products too suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association
this week, the doctors said the 58-year-old man had been taking
valerian, an herbal sedative, for many years for sleep problems and
anxiety. But he didn't reveal this to his doctors before undergoing
a lung biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   After several tests failed to reveal the cause of his symptoms,
the doctors found out from the patient about his herbal history,
and they gave him a form of Valium that alleviated his withdrawal
symptoms.

TECHNOLOGY CONVERGES IN HITACHI M2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hitachi's new M2 media machine is a 3,000-exposure digital
camera, a four-hour sound recorder, and a 27-minute video camera
all rolled into a sleek 6-inch-high package. Weighing 1.2 pounds,
the M2 is a true convergence machine.
</P>
<P>
   As the MIT Media Lab's Nicholas Negroponte is fond of saying,
``Bits are bits.'' With the M2, Hitachi has created a powerful
machine for grabbing bits from the world around us and transporting
them into the computer's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Most consumer digital cameras today will take 50 or 100 images
and store them on a piece of silicon; Hitachi's engineers took a
different route. The M2 is equipped with a Type III PCMCIA
expansion slot that's similar to the slots on most laptop computers
sold today.
</P>
<P>
   Into this slot slides a 260-megabyte hard drive that's used to
store images, sounds, and movies. When you are done filming your
subject, you just remove the hard disk from the M2 and slide it
into a laptop (either Macintosh or PC). The images are stored as
JPEG files, the movies as MPEGs, and the pure audio recording as
MPA (MPEG-1 Audio) files.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, you can connect the MP2 to any device that
accepts video and audio inputs and use it directly as a playback
device.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the $1,400 M2 is still very much a
proof-of-concept machine. I found the controls somewhat awkward to
use. There are problems with the sound quality. And the battery
life leaves much to be desired. That's probably why Hitachi is
aiming the M2 for the professionals who document _ people who need
to record things in the field, like insurance claims adjusters _
rather than trying to sell it to professional photographers or the
consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks I've been taking my borrowed M2
everywhere, throwing it in my pocket and taking it out whenever the
mood strikes me. To use the machine you've got to flip the power
switch from OFF to CAM then wait roughly 15 seconds while the
machine gets ready.
</P>
<P>
   Then you click a button that says REC MODE to select whether you
want to take low-resolution pictures, high-resolution images,
movies, or sound. A button with a slightly red hue triggers the
shutter or starts recording, depending on your mode, and also
functions as a pause button.
</P>
<P>
   Other controls allow you to zoom in or out, adjust for bright
light, turn on the Macro lens, and bring up an on-screen menu. It's
actually quite difficult to click these small controls, especially
when you are filming. The camera turret swings around in case you
want to take a picture of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The M2's viewfinder is a small 1.8-inch color LCD that's nearly
impossible to read in direct sunlight. The viewfinder serves
double-duty showing the camera's status, recording time remaining,
battery charge, and other menus. Unfortunately, these indicators
are close to illegible, as they are printed in white on the scene
that's currently being viewed, rather than being printed on a blue
or black background.
</P>
<P>
   While the M2 is small, it's also fragile. In fact, the machine
feels like it was built to be broken. There is no lens cap to
protect the optics while the device is in your pocket. There is a
pair of rubber stripes on one side that act as an impromptu stand,
but the device is missing rubber elsewhere _ rubber that might
protect the device in the event of a fall.
</P>
<P>
   The M2 will take JPEGs at 704x480 pixels, which is good enough
for displaying on a computer's screen, but not good enough for
high-quality print. Color balance leaves something to be desired,
and images frequently have washed-out hot spots. The
audio-recording is sampled fast enough to be CD quality, but the
built-in microphone isn't very good and, in any event, the M2 only
records in mono, not stereo. Video recording is decent, although
the compression system can't keep up with sudden camera movements
or fast-moving objects.
</P>
<P>
   You can cram 27 minutes of video on a 260-megabyte PC card, or
54 minutes on a 520-megabyte card. But long before you run out of
disk space, you'll run out of battery power: In my testing, the M2
battery only lasted between 30 and 50 minutes of normal use. An
added frustration is the fact that you can't charge the camera
inside the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, I like the M2. It's clearly the camera
of the future. You get an incredible amount of flexibility being
able to switch between stills, audio, and video _ flexibility that
is a bit daunting at first, but easily adapted to. And being able
to pop the hard drive out of your camera and thrust it into a
laptop is a great way of saving your images.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest complaint about the M2 isn't what this camera gets
wrong, but what it doesn't do at all. If the M2 had a keyboard port
it could be used as a machine for taking notes as well. Journalists
and other kinds of professional documentors could then just avoid
carrying the laptop entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once there is a keyboard on the M2, a whole world of
other possibilities open up. Insurance adjusters could fill out
their forms directly on the M2's tiny screen. The system could have
a full address book and calendar, eliminating the need to carry a
Palm Pilot around. Or take 20 megabytes of its hard drive and fill
it with a tour book for Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are so many different things that could be done
with the M2 that it is unrealistic to think that Hitachi will think
of them all. That's why Hitachi should follow Palm Computing's
example and open up the M2 with a developer's kit. With a little
bit of promotion work Hitachi could make the M2 the audio-visual
mobile computing platform of the next decade, much in the way that
Palm has made the PalmOS the personal information manager platform.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hitachi sees the M2 as a $1,400 video camera that
happens to store its images on a hard disk, rather than as a
computer that has a built-in video camera.

EMERGING GROWTH FUND ESPECIALLY RELIES ON BIG STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: How do you utterly blow away your benchmark if you are
a fund manager?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, unlike your fifth-grade class, cheating is pretty
acceptable in this world _ as long as you're winning, anyway. Take
Erin Sullivan, the twenty-something manager of Fidelity's Emerging
Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is putting up big numbers this year. Her $2.3 billion
fund was up 18.85 percent through last &UR;  &LR; Thursday, blowing away the
two indexes that Fidelity measures it against. The Russell 2000, an
index of smaller companies, was down 9.21 percent over the same
period, and the Lipper Mid-Cap Fund average was down 0.19 percent.
Sullivan's Emerging Growth ranks fifth out of 323 Lipper
mid-capitalization funds this year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Sullivan's fund isn't a mid-cap fund at all.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other Fidelity fund managers over the last year,
Sullivan has been moving her fund up the food chain into the land
of the large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark and fund prospectus say mid-cap, meaning stocks
with a market value of $5 billion or less, but the portfolio tells
another story. The fund's top 10 stocks include the likes of
Microsoft (its second-largest holding with a market cap of $282
billion), MCI WorldCom Inc. ($96 billion), America Online ($32
billion), and Medtronic ($25 billion). The median market cap of the
10 largest stocks is $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's a phenomenon known as ``style drift'' in the money
management world, and it's something that Fidelity has said it
wants to avoid. But who is going to complain when you are beating
not only your index but the holy grail of benchmarks, the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Index?
</P>
<P>
   And besides, it is increasingly a Big Cap World everywhere you
look at Fidelity. According to the Carson Group, a New York data
house, an incredible 80 percent of all Fidelity assets are now in
large-cap stocks, up from 69 percent just a year ago. Mid-cap
stocks are down to 15 percent from 20 percent of all assets, and
small-cap stocks with a valuation of less than $2.5 billion have
been cut in half to just 5 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity says each of its fund managers makes his or her own
call and that there is no master plan to move one way or the other.
But there is no denying, either, which way Fidelity has been
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Of 32 general equity funds, 26 now have a current large-cap
investment style, according the newest Fidelity Mutual Fund Guide.
James Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, a newsletter, says so
many funds have moved to large-cap investing in the last few months
that it is hard to find a mid-cap fund any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Collins, manager of Fidelity's Mid-Cap Stock fund, has
taken a decidedly different tact than Sullivan, keeping the fund
true to its mid-cap roots. The median market cap of her top 10
stocks is roughly half that of Sullivan's _ but then Collins's fund
was up just 3.36 percent through last Thursday, or a huge 15.5
percentage points behind Emerging Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity knows Emerging Growth has gone where it was never
intended to go. In fact, in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission last month, Fidelity proposed changing the name
to ``Fidelity Aggressive Growth.'' It also proposes deleting the $5
billion market ceiling and changing the benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan wouldn't comment for this story, but in a recent
shareholder report she explained how Microsoft fit into her
``emerging growth'' stock fund: ``When I think of emerging growth,
I think of companies on the verge of new product cycles or
companies entering entirely new markets. Microsoft's current growth
opportunities are enormous in the large corporate world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan has 43 percent of her fund in technology, triple the
weighting of the Russell 2000. She also has roughly three times the
index's weighting in health and retail stocks and virtually nothing
in financial stocks, which have been pummeled. She has 42 percent
of her assets in her top 10 stocks, the highest concentration of
all of Fidelity's general equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, the newsletter editor, says he has just added Sullivan's
fund to his model portfolios _ but as a large-cap fund, not a
mid-cap fund. John Bonnanzio, group editor of Fidelity Insight and
other newsletters, thinks Sullivan's stocks are just too pricey and
recommends avoiding the fund.
</P>
<P>
   What hardly no one disputes, however, is that Big Cap Creep is
alive and well at Fidelity. Emerging Growth may not be the last
fund getting a new name before it's over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Fidelity, all the time: Small Cap Stock, which opened in
March _ only to close two months and two days later when investors
buried fund manager Paul Antico in money _ will reopen next week to
current investors only. But do you want into the $500 million fund?
It is down 24 percent since it started trading in April.

BLAME IS SHARED IN SHABBY DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this how it comes to an end? You spend 10 years with a major
league baseball organization, hit 230 homers, win an MVP Award,
make a couple of trips to the playoffs, and your career officially
ends during the 11 o'clock news in mid-November?
</P>
<P>
   If we can believe Mo Vaughn (sometimes a risky proposition),
that is how his Red Sox career ended Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Naples, Fla., general manager Dan Duquette told the assembled
media that the Red Sox were out of the Vaughn sweepstakes, that Mo
had rejected the club's latest offer _ sweetened from five years,
$60 million to five years for something less than $65 million, with
a club option for a sixth year _ and that it was time for the team
to look elsewhere. Just before 11:30, Vaughn, standing outside his
Easton home, told Channel 4's Steve Burton, ``It's been a great
time here. I hold no grudges in the situation. I want to thank my
teammates. Best wishes to the Boston Red Sox and their fans. My
family and I decided this is the best thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long process,'' added Mo. ``I've learned a lot. I
was never really sure about this situation. I don't feel any
negativity. I wanted my situation to continue, but it just didn't
work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not moving, I'm just going somewhere else to work. I have
no idea (where) right now. We'll weigh it out and do the right
thing when it comes down. I believe that there's a right and wrong
way to do things. After all this time, who knows if I would have
accepted any contract? It's just a situation where the people
didn't see eye to eye.''
</P>
<P>
   This stinks. Vaughn put together six consecutive monster seasons
for the Red Sox. He was a leader on and off the field _ wildly
respected by players all over baseball. Moreover, he was a black
athlete who said good things about working and living in Boston.
He's done legitimate community service and is an absolute kid
magnet. His is a huge loss _ worse than the departures of Roger
Clemens and Carlton Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bambino just left town, folks. And you get one of
those only once or twice per century.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Bureau Of Instant Opinion, we waste no time slicing
up a blame pie. More details may emerge in the upcoming hours,
days, weeks, months, and years, but based on what is known, it
appears both parties deserve equal blame for this disturbing
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox certainly dropped the ball by waiting so long to get
around to business. They should have wrapped up Mo a year ago,
before trading for Pedro Martinez. They could have had their
slugger for half of what was finally rejected. Instead, they
insulted him and dared him to go out and have a great season with
everything on the line. When he called their bluff and came through
with another stellar year, Mo warned, ``The price goes up every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   It did. And it looks as if Mo never had any intention of signing
with the Red Sox once he acheived his hard-fought free agency.

   Mo said last week that he'd stay in Boston if the club gave him
five years guaranteed at market value. That is a statement the Red
Sox can now throw in Mo's face when they defend themselves against
the avalanche of negativity that comes with losing your best player
for a draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Boston this week offered Mo five years at market value. Mo
Wednesday night rejected the improved offer without telling us
where he intends to play next year. As far as we know, he has only
one other offer (six years, $72 million from the Angels).
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who have spent even a little time around Red Sox
CEO John Harrington and Duquette come away with the feeling that
the club never wanted Vaughn in the first place. There has always
been something about Mo that threatened the organization. Maybe
they've got some J. Edgar Hooveresque dirty secret file on Mo. Or
maybe it's a complete figment of the club's imagination because Mo
never conformed to Duquette's conservative image of the perfect
players. This much is known: Vaughn did nothing on the field or in
the clubhouse to warrant suspect status.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mo never stuck to his own story. He first said all he
wanted to see was a commitment to winning. The club did that. Then
he said he just wanted a long guarantee. The club did that. Then he
said he just wanted five years at market value. The club did that.
Mo rejected the club every time. Apparently, too much damage was
done early on in these weird negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss it,'' he told Burton. ``I've done a lot of things
here with the kids. I've done a lot of things in (Boston). I'll
always remember the good times and the bad times that taught me
some things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And you want to know the strangest thing about all this? I'm
still not sure it's over. Both parties said Wednesday night that
it's over, but neither side is totally credible, and until Mo holds
a press conference to announce he's joining the Angels or some
other team, there's still a chance he could wind up back with the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't look that way now. If we can believe the midnight
confessions, Mo's Red Sox career is over.
</P>
<P>
   And it stinks.

KNOWING IT'S RISKY, PATRIOTS ARE ALL BUSINESS

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Patriots owner Bob Kraft was on hand at
Foxboro Stadium Wednesday to offer support to his coach and players
as they prepared for what special-teams captain Larry Whigham
called a possible ``season-ending'' game Sunday in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraft will not publicly comment on coach Pete Carroll
until the season is over, feeling it's premature until all the
results are in, he did speak to the coach Tuesday night by phone
and Wednesday in person, offering his support and trying to lift
Carroll's spirits in the wake of a 1-3 slump that has left the
Patriots with a 5-4 record and in third place in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenges me daily,'' said Carroll. ``There isn't a day
where he doesn't tell me something good or what can we do now? He's
a great competitor. We're always looking for the competitive edge.
It's a 24-hour approach. I sense his challenge constantly and I
like it like that. We're endeavoring to be champions at all times,
so that's always the conversation. Neither one of us shy away from
our goals and objective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots seemed to be all business as they prepared for
their first practice of the week Wednesdayin the white bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Vincent Brisby, who had five pins removed from his
right index finger late last week, was trying on a padded finger
protector to see if he could return to action after a three-week
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of conditioning work, so I should be fine like
that,'' said Brisby. ``The question is, can I catch the ball with
this thing? I'm going to do everything I can to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Tony Carter, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery
three weeks ago, was running Wednesdayand wanted to practice today
in hopes of playing Sunday. Defensive end Willie McGinest (groin)
and receiver Terry Glenn (hamstring) practiced with the objective
of playing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Henry Thomas was limping, having resprained his
right ankle in last Sunday's 41-10 beating at the hands of Atlanta,
so he'll likely have to wait until the end of the week to practice.
Linebacker Chris Slade (ankle) was limping but wasn't even
considering sitting this one out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no escaping injuries for this team. Linebacker
Todd Collins has a deep groin pull that probably will keep him out
Sunday, forcing Tedy Bruschi into a full-time role.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of rededication all around the locker room. The
Patriots finally seem to realize that they have little, if any,
margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a season-ending football game, and everybody knows
about it,'' said Whigham.``It's a very urgent situation. Everybody
knows what's at stake, but that's the coaches' responsibility to
bring it to our attention, and then it's up to us to step up and
make plays. We need our big-money guys to step up. A lot of them
are injured, and the rookies are playing. And they're just playing
right now. They haven't stepped up to the level we need them to
step up to. It's a calling for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a red alert game. It's all or nothing. It's a situation
where you have to keep playing for the playoffs and a chance to get
back to the Super Bowl. If we lose this one, we're just playing for
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Whigham, suffering from a deep left knee bruise, got an
encouraging report after his MRI Monday and later received even
better news. In the past day or two, the defensive coaches,
realizing that they've lost three of four games while Whigham has
been out of most of the substitute packages, decided to put him
back in some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure who recognized it, but being a leader on this
team, I bring a lot of energy to the field,'' he said. ``I've made
some big plays for this football team. It seems like every time I'm
on the field, I make things happen. If you take me off, you're
gonna lose it. Unfortunately, those guys are out and it's up to
guys like me to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look in the mirror and realize what you're here
for. You're here to win. This is what you get paid for. We're in
this position because the players haven't played like they're
capable of playing. If everbody had done all they could do _ from
the placekicker to the quarterback to the running back to everyone
else _ we'd be a lot better off right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy was expressing similar sentiments on the other
side of the room. He also called on another Patriots faction to
step up its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the fans to be on our side,'' he said. ``We need their
support. We don't want to hear stuff like `J-E-T-S' from the crowd.
We need them and we understand we have to perform well to get them
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be forgotten amid this self-analysis and soul-searching
was the fact that the team also must come up with a way to
neutralize Doug Flutie. The defense made note of the fact that
their former coordinator, Bill Belichick of the Jets, stopped
Flutie last Sunday in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very mobile quarterback but he's a very short guy and
he can't see over the linemen very well,'' said Whigham. ``We have
to make him be a pocket passer. It's easier said than done, but we
saw it done this week. Both teams know that it's a win-lose
situation. If you win, you get to keep playing on for the playoffs,
and if you lose, you just play for pride.''

   In this colorful and informative piece, Rodgers, a popular
cooking teacher known as Mr. Thanksgiving, offers facts and lore
about three staples of the holiday dinner: turkey, cranberries and
pumpkin. A few tidbits: Israelis eat the most turkey of any
nationality. Farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate, so females must be artificially
inseminated. Colonial Americans called cranberries ``bounce
berries'' because bounciness was an indication of a cranberry's
freshness. (slugged:

   Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of
November? Because of the 19th-century crusade by Sarah Josepha
Hale, editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book,'' who persuaded Abraham
Lincoln to proclaim the holiday, history buff Malehorn tells us.
Before that Thanksgiving was a haphazard celebration _ in fact, in
colonial times the word ``celebration'' was not quite apt. It was a
somber, religious occasion, spent in prayer in chilly village
churches. (slugged:

 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nearly all American schoolchildren learn the standard
Thanksgiving story: how the Pilgrims survived their first miserable
winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

   &UR; Mad River Glen (Vermont):  &LR; Vermont turns fifty this year.
There'll be parties, reenactments, a roll-back in ticket prices to
the original $3.50. Even a ceremony to honor one of the most
painful chairlifts in America - the olde single. Miss. Vermont and
Governor Dean will be present for the festivities, but he has been
warned to leave his own board home.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to partake of all this fun, better leave the
board home, too. The owners of Mad River - all 1300 of them - are
no closer to budging than was Betsy Pratt who threw the shredders
off eight years ago after some bitter confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Mad River spokesman Erik Friedman who happens to
be a snowboarder and a shareholder in the mountain, there is some
physical justification for keeping snowboards off the hill. But for
the most part, they just don't fit with the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trails are very narrow,'' says Trina, another boarder who
works at Mad River and teaches boarding at Sugarbush, ``and the
movement of snowboards and skiers are just so different on those
trails they don't work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, okay, but that's not how the dispute got going back in
1991. That's when, for techincal reasons, boarders were restricted
from riding that old single chair that everyone gets so passionate
about.
</P>
<P>
   So flat is the landing at the top that when the boarders pushed
themseves off (they don't carry poles, you know), the cable
sometimes got derailed shutting down the lift. Then there was the
fear that a boarder might get stuck going around the bullwheel and
shutting down the rig.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Pratt declared the single off limits to boarders, though
they could ride on the double chair. Nevertheless, the boarders
became strident and persecuted, and Pratt pushed right back,
banning boards altogether on one of the first ski areas that had
admitted them many years before.
</P>
<P>
   Then three years ago, Pratt sold the mountain to a coop of 3000
shares. Over 1768 have been purchased by 1300 shareholders who vote
steadfastly to hold to the 1991 ban.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are now up to $1750 each (from $1500) but even if a
coalition of riders could buy them all they would fall short of a
majority and would be leaving the boards home.
</P>
<P>

   &UR; Aspen Mountain (Colorado):  &LR; This is the piece of skiland that
would not be subdued by waves of VW bus riding ski bums (winter
hippies) in the 60s, Hunter S. Thompson in the 70s, a bunch of Euro
crybaby racers in the 80s - not to mention the paint-throwing
anti-fur zealots - and it isn't about to succumb to the boarding
industry or its scat-talking practicioners.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen is the mountain that should have Lilly Tomlin doing its TV
spots: ``We don't have to care. We're Aspen.''
</P>
<P>
   For quite a while Aspen has not been the best place in America
to go skiing. Not by a long shot. But more than ever it is the
place to be seen, either on camera or gawking around for a glimpe
of Hollywood glitterati who make it a point to being seen there.
</P>
<P>
   It is so much the culture (Land Rover limos and mink parkas)
from which the counter-culture boarders react, the friction would
seem inevitable. And so it was last season when Aspen three
boarders a bone and sponsered a free event for them one weekend. It
went so badly that hundreds of riders were thrown off the hill by
the ski patrol, and Aspen redoubled its opposition to their
business.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Aspen will tell you that the snow on its delicate
steep, aqualine profile is so fragile trhat even poor skiers making
windshield wiper scraping turns damage it. Snowboards are even
worse on the advanced terrain.
</P>
<P>
   But people who know Aspen and know snowboarding suspect that the
twain just may never meet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Deer Valley (Utah):  &LR; If Mad River is too cantankerous, Aspen
too lofty, then Deer Valley's reason for eschewing boards is
largely that it's too precious. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   The posh area is one beautiful place to ski, both in its terrain
and posh hotel/condo village at the base. In order to capture just
the right tone, they brought in ski legend - and purist - Stein
Eriksen - as figurehead of the ski school.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen, who still maintains his perfection of tight-together
form, explains that while Deer Valley folks are not really against
snowboarding aesthetically (and some do sneak in via the
midmountain access) that customers do not want them.
</P>
<P>
   Reader survey after reader survey come back with the bad news
for boarders: skiers who pay enough to have ski valets following
them around, do not want to see boarders, hear boarders, or put up
with them on Deer Valley's manicured terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The other argument from Deer Valley is that it is unique among
ski areas, and that boarders can find plenty of options in Utah
without desicrating the rarified air of one of the top rated ski
areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alta (Utah): &LR;  If Mad River has a western counterpart, this is
it. Alta, with its wealth and riches of natural terrain, of chutes
and high mountain bowls, has natural snow and little grooming. The
terrain is largely a snowscape of covered stumps and rocks and
skiers find their way through, over and around.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarding, says Alta, would slash all the good snow away from
parts of the terrain that needs the coverage. Hence: leave the
boards home, or aty least take them down to Snowbird, which is only
a mile away.

STARS WHO HELPED US SHINE ARE FADING AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there was a time for younger skiers in this country to
pour on the juice, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kyle Rassmussen joined colleagues Tommy Moe and AJ
Kitt in retiring. They had been central figures on far and away the
greatest team of downhillers ever to ski for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And Picabo Street, undisputedly the greatest woman skier in US
history, suffered a disastrous crash in March that will put her out
of competition for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   All these losses occurred in a season in which the World Alpine
Championships are to return to the United States for the first time
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three male downhillers, Rassmussen was the oldest, at 31,
and had the longest career, with 13 years on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, Rassmussen also had the most World Cup
points _ 690 _ almost double those of Kitt and Moe, though the
latter two skiers attracted most of the publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the quiet Californian, who often spoke of the pain he
felt when having to travel away from wife Linda and two small
children, Anthony and Kayley, won two downhills _ Wengen and
Kvitjell. He says he thought of retiring several times over the
years and was always torn between his love of ski racing and the
pull of home.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of the male trio is Moe, the soft-spoken Alaskan
outdoorsman who became one of those stunning Olympic surprise
stories when he won the downhill gold at Lillehammer in 1994. He
followed that up with a silver in the Super-G and went on in the
next year to win one World Cup race and place in the top 10 17
times.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, despite some spurts of the old form, Moe
never quite rekindled the fire that drove him to be the best in the
world and take the most prestigious prize in skiing.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, fearing that more years on World Cup could
obscure the memory of that 1994 splash, he wants to join Kitt on
the potentially lucrative King of the Mountain professional
circuit, which features a most exclusive group of past downhill
racers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, Kitt, a Rochester, N.Y., native, has had perhaps
the most frustrating career. Skiing with great consistency before
1996, when he blew out his left knee, Kitt posted 21 top-10
finishes and a medal in the World Championships. He is the only US
skier to compete in four Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from injuries, the most frustrating experience of his
career came not in Europe but in the home snows of Aspen, Colo.
With Kitt leading after the first runs in downhill races in
successive years, the races were cancelled ostensibly because of
poor conditions, but charges swirled that the juries of Europeans
had shut the races down to rob Kitt of the wins _ and the prized
FIS downhill points.
</P>
<P>
   At least the three male racers had retirement on their minds.
Not so Street, who acknowledges that resuming her career will be
difficult and that she probably will give up racing the high-speed
events, downhill and Super-G.
</P>
<P>
   Before the March crash that shattered her knee for the second
time, Street had already made one sensational recovery. After
putting together the greatest downhill winning streak in US history
with six consecutive victories in Decebmer 1996 while training at
Vail, the high-flying Street suffered her first serious knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Last January at Lake Placid, Street was cautiously reentering
the high-risk world of downhill racing, leading to Nagano. ``Part
of my fascination with speed,'' she said in an interview after
training, ``is that it's both thrilling and scary. Before Vail I
had never really faced the scary part.''
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks later, at the Olympics, Street stood on the
winner's podium at the base of the Super-G course with a gold medal
around her neck and that famous 1,000-watt grin for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, she skied a cautious downhill _ rare for her _
and acknowledged after a sixth-place finish that she was still
holding back a bit because of her knee.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, at the Crans-Montana race course, Street was
down again after a high-speed crash that did blow out the knee, and
just last month she underwent constructive surgery that will keep
her off skis for the year.
</P>
<P>
   If Street does come back to racing, it will be even more
cautiously. She may begin training on technical courses, which is
where her training started when she was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal,'' she said, ``is to compete in 2002 (Olympics in Salt
Lake City) and be with my team to march in the opening ceremony. I
don't care what event I'm skiing in.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Street will be a commentator for NBC at the Vail World
Championships.

   STRIKELAWS _ WASHINGTON _ Promises of tough two- and
three-strikes laws were a convenient campaign pledges across the
nation, but a researcher has found that only two states _ Georgia
and California _ are implimenting the laws. A report released
Thursday by the Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy said 15 of
the 23 states with the harsher penalties, which include mandatory
minimums without parole or demand life in prison, virtually ignore
the statutes. California, which applies its law to almost every
repeat felon, has more than 40,500 inmates serving under the
stiffer laws. Georgia, which has a narrower law that lists only
seven of the most violent felonies, has 2,000 people incarcerated
for one of those crimes, including more than 50 serving life
without parole and 885 who have been sentenced to more than 20
years without parole for their ``first strike.'' (Cook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.

THE MOVIE IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF TOTAL RUGRATS IMMERSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rest of the world has to wait until Nov. 20, but my kids and
I got to see the new ``Rugrats Movie'' _ at least a rough cut of
the film _ weeks before its national debut. The next morning, I was
eager to share my keen insight into the picture with my friend
Joan.
</P>
<P>
   I was just getting started, telling her how my 5-year-old burst
into tears when Tommy and Dil were lost in the forest, how the
music got on my nerves, when mercifully, Joan cut me off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what you say. It's not like we're NOT going
to go,'' she said. ``My kids can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only ones. More than two years in the making,
the much-anticipated Rugrats feature film will propel the babies,
whose 11-minute animated cartoons have given them the No. 1 kids'
TV show, to new big-screen proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-plus movie, centering on the birth of head-baby Tommy
Pickles' new brother, Dil (get it?), is expected to draw the same
massive audience as the 12-times-a-week TV show, which consistently
ranks among the most-watched cable programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual film is just a first step for Tommy and his gang
of crawlers.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare for T.R.I. _ Total Rugrats Immersion.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In case you've somehow missed the story of the Rugrats,
pre-Total Immersion, it's time to catch up. In 1990, a woman named
Arlene Klasky, co-chairperson of Klasky Csupo animation studio,
took a break from work to stay at home with her two babies. As she
watched her rugrats crawl through the day, Klasky conceived an
idea: What if babies could talk, and what if we could see the world
from their below-the-knee perspective?
</P>
<P>
   With the help of her partner (and then-husband) Gabor Csupo and
creative producer Paul Germain (the team best known till this point
for ``The Simpsons),'' she developed the characters of Tommy (based
on Klasky's older child), Chuckie (Tommy's fraidy-cat best friend),
identical twins Phil and Lil, and Angelica (Tommy's 3-year-old
demon-diva cousin).
</P>
<P>
   Klasky Csupo pitched the concept to Nickelodeon execs, who liked
it _ loved it even _ and ordered the standard 65 episodes. In 1991,
Nick plunked the cartoon into its new Sunday-morning lineup. After
four years, production of ``Rugrats'' stopped, and Nick
``stripped'' the reruns into Monday through Friday time slots, both
in the morning and the evening. And that was to be that, but then a
funny thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   The audience doubled in the evening time slot, boosted at least
in part by parents who found the show, well, smart. Csupo says the
parent-trap was intentional: ``We wanted to have a situation where
parents can sit down and not just suffer through (the show)
uncomfortably because they want to please their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of watching ratings climb, Nick execs placed
their long-term bets on the Rugrats property, and in 1996, they
called back the production team and voice talents for 26 new
episodes. At the same time, they began making plans for the movie.
The Rugrats, they decided, were going to be big.
</P>
<P>
   But just how big can the babies be before they outgrow their
diapers?
</P>
<P>
   Banking on the success of the movie, Rugrats execs are in the
midst of a full-force, multimedia baby boom. In addition to
products ranging from alarm clocks to CD-ROMS, the babies are
featured in a ``Got (Choklit) Milk?'' campaign, a Rugrats magazine,
a syndicated comic strip and a traveling Broadway-style musical. As
if that's not enough, a sequel to the movie is already being
written, and a sequel to the sequel is, according to one 'Rats
executive, in the works.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the show, or the primary ``property,'' as
network execs call it. Since Rugrats began, more than 90 episodes
have aired. Fifty more, including some with new baby Dil that are
expected to air by early 1999, are waiting to be rolled out. ``Once
we have a property like this,'' explains Cyma Zarghami, executive
vice president and general manager of Nickelodeon, ``our job is to
manage it properly without killing it quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV execs call what's happening ``a slow rollout.'' But as a
mother, I can't help but think ``Total Immersion.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Norton Virgien, co-director of ``The Rugrats Movie,'' is
patiently listening to my keen insight on the movie he's spent two
years of his life creating. Unlike my friend Joan, he can't cut me
off, because listening to me is his job.
</P>
<P>
   Virgien has already told me that the movie is supposed to take
the characters places they haven't been before, to explore their
relationships more fully than the TV show allows, to make the
Rugrats adventure more real than imaginary. That's why the babies
go out on their own to take bratty infant Dil back to the
``hop-sickle.'' That's why they get lost in the scary forest all
night. That's how Tommy resolves the problem of letting a new
person into his life.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds good, really good, but I feel I must tell him that
the movie made my baby cry.
</P>
<P>
   Virgien assures me that changes were made to the final version
of the movie to tone down some of the scary parts and ``to come
back quick with the comedy.'' He also tells me, though, that adding
some edge to the Rugrats ``fits in with what people are going to
the movies and seeing these days.'' After all, he says, in movies
like ``The Lion King,'' parents are getting killed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm not happy. I tell him that I have to think, as a mom,
that the CD soundtrack is just another way to take my money.
</P>
<P>
   Virgien gives another reasonable explanation. In this field, he
says, a project ``has to be somewhat commercial because of the
nature of affording to make the projects in the first place.'' The
Rugrats, he continues, ``were never a cartoon that was made to
promote toys. It came from a very honest place.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes on, saying something about Disney, I think, but I forget
to listen. Because I'm thinking about how I think my real problem
with all the endless Rugrats hype is that I think the babies might
be being ... well, exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the babies are real to me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about this when I realize that Virgien is
apologizing. He says to tell my daughter he's really sorry she was
scared.
</P>
<P>
   I tell him not to worry. After all, the final version will be
out in a couple of weeks, and we'll give it another try.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, it's not like we're NOT going to go.

   FILM-JOE (Undated) One thing you can say in favor of Martin
Brest's ``Meet Joe Black'' is that it definitely continues the
great 1998 trend of major filmmakers challenging the conventions of
'90s filmmaking. In its own way, it's as daring as ``Bulworth'' or
``The Truman Show.''

   By William Arnold. (story will move in the ``e'' category)

   FILM-SUMMER (Undated) Sequels are usually inferior to the

movie reality to new lows.

<P>
   FILM-LIKE (Undated) It's been touted as the biggest gay film to
``come out'' in London this year, but ``Like It Is'' actually
follows a staid, tried-and-true formula that has been a mainstay in
both gay and straight love stories.
</P>
<P>

   FILM-YELLOW (Undated) Focusing on a group of young Korean
American high school kids, ``Yellow'' labors to make its point
about crossing over between old and new cultures and worlds.

   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-STRANGE (Undated) In his animated feature ``I Married A
Strange Person,'' Oregon-born animator Bill Plympton deconstructs
the life of a young idealistic couple, just married, who are bred
of the TV age.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)

WINS DON'T MEAN TICKET SALES FOR THE RAIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAMUEL CHI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Richard Rogers is taking small victories these
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders' surprising success hasn't quite meant
burgeoning sales of personal seat licenses, or PSLs, at the Oakland
Coliseum. It has meant, however, that fewer people are canceling
their existing PSLs and that's good news to Rogers, who is director
of the Oakland Football Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not selling thousands, or even hundreds, he is
selling some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually had a mini-surge the last two weeks or so,''
Rogers said Wednesday. ``We sold 25 PSLs the last 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal seat license buys the right to get season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Although other NFL teams have had little trouble selling PSLs,
which cost from $250 to $3,000, the Raiders have never had much
success. Returning to Oakland in 1995, the Raiders began that
season with an 8-2 record and the PSL sales topped out at about
35,000. Then came a collapse and an 8-8 finish; since then, PSLs
have been a losing proposition. As of now, there are only 29,000
holders at the 63,000-seat Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' unexpected recent success should have improved
sales. But with the Raiders and the city of Oakland embroiled in
disputes, there is no money for marketing, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No resources for it at all. It's very frustrating because with
the Raiders winning, we should've had an opportunity to market them
and get the bandwagon going. But because we have no money, we can't
even get the word out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With no money for advertising, the marketing office has resorted
to a mass-mailing campaign trying to re-recruit the wayward holders
of season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   And as an inducement, they won't be asked to pay for the first
four home games they've missed this season. Instead, they can use
the money to purchase additional seats in the remaining four games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the response has been slow. So far, only 200 or so have
taken advantage of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for other ways to reach out at minimal expense, the
marketing office set up a Web site (www.ofma.com), hoping to catch
the attention of prospective and prior PSL holders. But other than
that, there is little Rogers and his associates can do other than
sit around and wait for the phones to ring.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate windfall from the Raiders' 6-3 record is increased
attendance in the upcoming games, but even that increase has fallen
short of expectations. Rogers said he doesn't expect a sellout for
Sunday's game against Seattle, with only 43,000 tickets sold as of
Wednesday and the best-case scenario being about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders might have a chance to sell out their game against
Miami on Dec. 6 and the season finale against Kansas City on Dec.
26. They last sold out the Coliseum for the 1997 season opener
against the Kansas City Chiefs.

`JOE BLACK' CONTINUES TREND, BUT IS TOO LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you can say in favor of Martin Brest's ``Meet Joe
Black'' is that it definitely continues the great 1998 trend of
major filmmakers challenging the conventions of '90s filmmaking. In
its own way, it's as daring as ``Bulworth'' or ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In remaking the 1934 Fredric March comedy, ``Death Takes a
Holiday,'' Brest has filled that 78-minute trifle with so much
character detail and so many long, slow-paced scenes that his film
is close to three hours long _ almost three times the original's
running time!
</P>
<P>
   It's a slap in the face to the MTV ethic, and my guess is that a
large part of the movie-going audience will not stay with it. At
one point in the Tuesday night preview, in fact, a rude audience
member actually let out a loud yawn, and it received much
supportive laughter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you can fall in with its leisurely pace,
you might find it quite an enjoyable three hours. It has major star
power, unusually good chemistry and the kind of old-fashioned
Hollywood glamor and dreamy romanticism that has been very scarce
in movies of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The story has Death, curious about the ways of human beings,
taking the form of a young man (Brad Pitt) and entering the life of
a communications tycoon (Anthony Hopkins) who, on the even of his
65th birthday, is scheduled to have a lethal heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by such earthly delights as peanut butter and sex,
Death gradually becomes part of the tycoon's life, gets humorously
drawn into the complications of his business affairs and gradually
falls in love with his daughter (Claire Forlani).
</P>
<P>
   The film's big problem is easy to spot: its premise is simply
not solid enough to support a three-hour drama. While we might go
along with this kind of whimsical fantasy in a fast-paced romp,
three hours gives us time to think about the idea _ and realize its
basic absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brest (``Scent of a Woman'') almost makes it work. This
is one of the year's most sumptuously composed and photographed
films (the lighting is especially striking). Brest's scenes may be
long and slow, but, for the most part, they're immaculately staged
and performed.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic casting also clicks. Brad Pitt lacks the skill for
drawing-room comedy that might have made the movie soar, but he's
enormously charismatic and likable. As his love interest, newcomer
Claire Forlani (``The Rock'') is even more appealing _ and
exquisitely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' also, of course, has Anthony Hopkins _ which
is invariably a big plus. It's far from the best-written part of
his career _ almost a cliche _ but he turns the character into
something profound and wonderful. As always, every moment this
great actor is on screen is pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Joe Black. Directed by Martin Brest. Screenplay by Ron
Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman. Cast: Brad Pitt,
Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani, Jake Weber. Universal. 174
minutes. Rated PG-13 for one sex scene.

`LAST SUMMER' GIVES A REALLY BAD NAME TO SEQUELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sequels are usually inferior to the originals. But ``I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer'' takes that movie reality to new
lows.
</P>
<P>
   It's totally contrived, uses the same tired formula as
``Scream,'' ``Halloween,'' ``Friday the 13th'' and the recent
``Urban Legend,'' and comes with a heroine with little of the
appeal of Neve Campbell or the tenacity of Jamie Lee Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood is known for beating a genre to death and the film
will likely take the number one slot at the box office on its
opening weekend, beating out more deserving fare.
</P>
<P>
   The two survivors from ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' are
back: Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray Bronson (Freddie
Prinze Jr.) are trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two summers ago we hit Ben Willis with our car. We lied to the
authorities,'' says Julie. But Ben didn't die and he came back with
a vengeance, killing Julie's high school friends in an orgy of
hatred and fury. Though Julie and Ray believe they stopped Ben, his
body was never found. He couldn't still be alive, could he?
</P>
<P>
   Though Julie has moved to Boston to attend college, strange
things start happening. The anniversary of the murders is days away
and, after her best friend Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to a
Bahamas resort, Julie decides it might be best to get out of town
for the eventful date. The women invite Karla's beau, Tyrell (Mekhi
Phifer), and a classmate who is sweet on Julie, Will (Matthew
Settle), to tag along.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the four are cavorting in the sun. But the resort is eerily
empty. A storm is due, but it isn't the only thing that's brewing
on the horizon. Soon the body count is rising and Julie again must
confront her darkest demons.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the story rings false, even though all the
horror-movie components are in place: an anniversary of the
murders; demented family members; young couples trying to sneak off
for illicit trysts; the doomed best friend; and a strong female
heroine who screams inanities at the killer: ``You want me? Come
get me. I'm not dying on this island.''
</P>
<P>
   While TV's ``Party of Five'' star Jennifer Love Hewitt makes a
spunky heroine, none of the stars have anything challenging to
do(there are lots of shots of them scantily clad, however). Prinze
appears only sporadically and co-star Settle seems to be
impersonating Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the murders are fairly grisly, shadows in the mirror abound
and the ending makes sure there's the possibility of another
sequel. But ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' commits the
cardinal sin of the horror
</P>
<P>
   movie genre: It isn't a bit scary.
</P>
<P>
   I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Directed by Danny Cannon.
Written by Trey Callaway. Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy,
Freddie Prinze Jr., Mekhi Phifer, Matthew Settle. Columbia
Pictures. 96 minutes. Rated R for violence, language.

`YELLOW' DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Focusing on a group of young Korean American high school kids,
``Yellow'' labors to make its point about crossing over between old
and new cultures and worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Its Los Angeles teenagers come from different economic
backgrounds, are planning for college and new careers and are
coming to grips with the fact they will be apart from each other
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   So this night, which is teeming with wild graduation parties and
activities, should be special. But when Sin Lee (Michael Daeho
Chung) shows up, he's visibly rattled. It seems a couple of black
kids came into his dad's convenience store as he was closing shop
and robbed him of $1,500. How will he tell his rigid, old world,
disciplined dad (Soon-Tek Oh) that his money is gone?
</P>
<P>
   His best friend, Alex (Burt Bulos), hatches a plan. They'll all
contribute to a pot and try to replace the cash. But despite trips
to the ATM, they haven't nearly enough between them. During the
course of the night, there will be breakups and reconciliations;
friendships will fall by the wayside and a violent act will take
place that changes everything. And Sin will learn that he has a
choice to make and responsibility to take.
</P>
<P>
   Director and writer Chris Chan Lee says he wanted to ``re-cast
the genre of a mainstream youth film with a young Asian ensemble''
to speak to an ``emerging American audience caught between two
different cultures.'' Unfortunately, ``Yellow'' grapples and
wrestles with its goal and it ultimately turns from heavy-handed
overkill into absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are angry, pouty, goofy and sullen and their parents
are either fools or harsh taskmasters. There is no middle ground.
And when the night's activities wind up at a seance and, later,
shows the kids and a couple of adults chowing down on donuts in
scene that feels absurdly out of place with the tone of the film,
it's clear Chan Lee has lost control of his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow'' may have all the good intentions in the world and
might want to show how kids caught between two worlds have an extra
burden to bear, but these youngsters don't seem any different from
teenagers in any community, no matter what ethnicity. Their
struggles are universal and they have the same life decisions to
mull over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow'' doesn't have much to say about anything at all and
meanders just as aimlessly and confusedly as its ensemble of
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow. Directed and written by Chris Chan Lee. Cast: Michael
Daeho Chung, Burt Bulos, Angie Suh, Mia Suh. Phaedra Cinema. 101
minutes. Unrated with language, violence.

`LIKE IT IS' IS STAID AND FORMULAIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been touted as the biggest gay film to ``come out'' in
London this year, but ``Like It Is'' actually follows a staid,
tried-and-true formula that has been a mainstay in both gay and
straight love stories.
</P>
<P>
   This time around the tale focuses on Craig (Steve Bell), a young
bare-knuckle boxer from a lower-class Blackpool family who earns
his keep from illegal fights. Craig isn't sure about his sexuality;
he knows he isn't into girls, but he has yet to make the leap to
boys. He's agonizingly full of homophobic self-loathing, though
it's obvious he's destined for gay life.
</P>
<P>
   One night, he meets the older, wiser Matt (Ian Rose), an
upwardly mobile and openly gay nightclub manager and music video
producer who tells him, ``We're not all tortured souls. I never
look back.'' The chance encounter changes Craig's outlook and he
falls in love with Matt, even moving to London to be near him.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy about the relationship, however. Matt's
roommate, Paula (Dani Behr), is a pop singer who depends on him for
everything from musical advice to recreational drugs. She resents
Craig's intrusion with a vengeance. Finally, Craig is given a break
by Kelvin (Roger Daltrey), an older gay man who is Matt's mentor.
For awhile everything is rosy. But Craig learns the hard way that
not everyone has his best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The rudimentary conflict at the core of ``Like It Is'' is not so
much the gay struggle as the eternal British clash between classes.
As English writers such as D.H. Lawrence and movies such as ``Mrs.
Brown'' have shown, there is a barrier between the upper/middle and
lower class mentalities _ one that's difficult to transcend. The
two can co-mingle, but the lower class must always remember its
place. The lower class is disposable once it outlives its
usefulness or begins to feel entitled and equal.
</P>
<P>
   The film certainly takes full advantage of this theme. It's
gritty and rough-hewn and often, the dialogue is hard to
comprehend. Certainly Craig is often treated with tawdry
dismissiveness by Matt's friends. Still, Craig _ played by newcomer
Bell, in real life the United Kingdom's featherweight boxing champ
_ is so annoying and mercurial that we wonder why Matt would even
bother with his petulant and pouty attitude.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real dramatic let down in ``Like It Is.'' We could
care less about a boy who has such a chip on his shoulder that he
alienates everyone around him, including his own brother.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Roger Daltrey, the lead singer for rock's
legendary band ``The Who,'' has a gay old time playing a minor
villain and Ian Rose, who plays Matt, has charismatic appeal. And
when the film focuses on the business of making stars out of
unknown talent and the difficulty of aging musicians keeping up
with fickle tastes of the audience, it's a lot of fun to watch. In
the end, the love story is the movie's weakest link.

`I MARRIED A STRANGE PERSON' IS HEAVY-HANDED, OBVIOUS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The films of independent, Oregon-born animator Bill Plympton
(``The Tune'') have maintained an irreverent view of middle class
America and the values and expectations that have been heaped upon
it by the powers-that-be.
</P>
<P>
   In his animated feature ``I Married A Strange Person,'' he
deconstructs the life of a young idealistic couple, just married,
who are bred of the TV age.
</P>
<P>
   When a pair of mating birds crash into his satellite dish, Grant
receives psychic powers _ the ability to change Kerry into other
women during sex, make bugs erupt out of his mother-in-law's head
and save his dull neighbor from being run over by his lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   After Grant is deemed an ``Illusionist,'' he garners fame and
appears on a late-night TV talk show. Suddenly he's stalked by the
military and the corrupt head of a network who only want to exploit
this next ``big'' thing. Grant just wants to go home, but Kerry,
believing her husband is ``not the man she married,'' has left him.
</P>
<P>
   Using a single-handed approach to animation (each frame is
hand-drawn, Xroxed and then transferred to a cel), Plympton
explores and explodes middle class myths and values with
originality and cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   However, while skewering American rituals and blaming the
malaise of the late 20th century on propaganda by the military, the
right-wing and the media, Plympton confuses the issue by making his
protagonist as big a jerk as the institutions who want to use him.
</P>
<P>
   And he delivers his message in heavy-handed style, making the
obvious . . . well . . . so obvious. ``I Married A Strange Person''
feels like a 70-minutes political diatribe, yet by the end, we
don't know which side feels most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And then the film wimps out. Grant goes back home to his boring
safe haven despite even though he prefers his Walter Mitty
``other'' life.

`YELLOW' DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Focusing on a group of young Korean American high school kids,
``Yellow'' labors to make its point about crossing over between old
and new cultures and worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Its Los Angeles teenagers come from different economic
backgrounds, are planning for college and new careers and are
coming to grips with the fact they will be apart from each other
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   So this night, which is teeming with wild graduation parties and
activities, should be special. But when Sin Lee (Michael Daeho
Chung) shows up, he's visibly rattled. It seems a couple of black
kids came into his dad's convenience store as he was closing shop
and robbed him of $1,500. How will he tell his rigid, old world,
disciplined dad (Soon-Tek Oh) that his money is gone?
</P>
<P>
   His best friend, Alex (Burt Bulos), hatches a plan. They'll all
contribute to a pot and try to replace the cash. But despite trips
to the ATM, they haven't nearly enough between them. During the
course of the night, there will be breakups and reconciliations;
friendships will fall by the wayside and a violent act will take
place that changes everything. And Sin will learn that he has a
choice to make and responsibility to take.
</P>
<P>
   Director and writer Chris Chan Lee says he wanted to ``re-cast
the genre of a mainstream youth film with a young Asian ensemble''
to speak to an ``emerging American audience caught between two
different cultures.'' Unfortunately, ``Yellow'' grapples and
wrestles with its goal and it ultimately turns from heavy-handed
overkill into absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are angry, pouty, goofy and sullen and their parents
are either fools or harsh taskmasters. There is no middle ground.
And when the night's activities wind up at a seance and, later,
shows the kids and a couple of adults chowing down on donuts in
scene that feels absurdly out of place with the tone of the film,
it's clear Chan Lee has lost control of his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow'' may have all the good intentions in the world and
might want to show how kids caught between two worlds have an extra
burden to bear, but these youngsters don't seem any different from
teenagers in any community, no matter what ethnicity. Their
struggles are universal and they have the same life decisions to
mull over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow'' doesn't have much to say about anything at all and
meanders just as aimlessly and confusedly as its ensemble of
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow. Directed and written by Chris Chan Lee. Cast: Michael
Daeho Chung, Burt Bulos, Angie Suh, Mia Suh. Phaedra Cinema. 101

`LAST SUMMER' GIVES A REALLY BAD NAME TO SEQUELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sequels are usually inferior to the originals. But ``I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer'' takes that movie reality to new
lows.
</P>
<P>
   It's totally contrived, uses the same tired formula as
``Scream,'' ``Halloween,'' ``Friday the 13th'' and the recent
``Urban Legend,'' and comes with a heroine with little of the
appeal of Neve Campbell or the tenacity of Jamie Lee Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood is known for beating a genre to death and the film
will likely take the number one slot at the box office on its
opening weekend, beating out more deserving fare.
</P>
<P>
   The two survivors from ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' are
back: Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ray Bronson (Freddie
Prinze Jr.) are trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two summers ago we hit Ben Willis with our car. We lied to the
authorities,'' says Julie. But Ben didn't die and he came back with
a vengeance, killing Julie's high school friends in an orgy of
hatred and fury. Though Julie and Ray believe they stopped Ben, his
body was never found. He couldn't still be alive, could he?
</P>
<P>
   Though Julie has moved to Boston to attend college, strange
things start happening. The anniversary of the murders is days away
and, after her best friend Karla (Brandy) wins a trip for four to a
Bahamas resort, Julie decides it might be best to get out of town
for the eventful date. The women invite Karla's beau, Tyrell (Mekhi
Phifer), and a classmate who is sweet on Julie, Will (Matthew
Settle), to tag along.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the four are cavorting in the sun. But the resort is eerily
empty. A storm is due, but it isn't the only thing that's brewing
on the horizon. Soon the body count is rising and Julie again must
confront her darkest demons.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the story rings false, even though all the
horror-movie components are in place: an anniversary of the
murders; demented family members; young couples trying to sneak off
for illicit trysts; the doomed best friend; and a strong female
heroine who screams inanities at the killer: ``You want me? Come
get me. I'm not dying on this island.''
</P>
<P>
   While TV's ``Party of Five'' star Jennifer Love Hewitt makes a
spunky heroine, none of the stars have anything challenging to
do(there are lots of shots of them scantily clad, however). Prinze
appears only sporadically and co-star Settle seems to be
impersonating Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the murders are fairly grisly, shadows in the mirror abound
and the ending makes sure there's the possibility of another
sequel. But ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' commits the
cardinal sin of the horror
</P>
<P>
   movie genre: It isn't a bit scary.
</P>
<P>
   I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Directed by Danny Cannon.
Written by Trey Callaway. Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy,
Freddie Prinze Jr., Mekhi Phifer, Matthew Settle. Columbia
Pictures. 96 minutes. Rated R for violence, language.

FORT WORTH DALLAS BALLET GETS DUDED UP FOR THE WESTERN-THEMED
`RODEO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Maybe it was the Great Depression and a
tendency to look homeward. Maybe it was World War II and renewed
patriotism. Maybe it was a national coming of age, a realization
that American folk culture contained the fundamental elements of
high art.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the 1930s and 1940s witnessed a blossoming
of art, music and drama frankly focused on American subjects.
Traditional hymns made their way into symphonies; ancient Greek
myths were recast on the stage in American settings. Uprooted Dust
Bowl refugees became giants of fiction; plain Midwestern farm
scenes were transformed into idealized Elysian landscapes on
artists' canvases.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous representatives of that era of shameless
nationalism, the ballet ``Rodeo,'' takes the stage this weekend at
Bass Performance Hall in a presentation by the Fort Worth Dallas
Ballet. No tutus, pointe shoes or princes here: It's wranglers in
boots and bandannas, and gals in petticoats in this enduring piece
of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Dallas Ballet gets ``Rodeo'' from about as close to
the source as possible. Agnes de Mille's choreography is being
staged in Fort Worth by Terrence Orr, the California-born artistic
director of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. Orr gained special
insight by working closely with de Mille from the 1960s through the
1980s (de Mille died in 1993 at the age of 88).
</P>
<P>
   Orr, who spent several weeks this fall in Fort Worth, watching
classes and casting roles, said that his familiarity with ``Rodeo''
has not detracted from the ballet's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a wonderful pathos to it,'' he says. ``It tells a real
story. Agnes could tell a story better than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mille was the niece of famed movie producer Cecil B. de Mille
and came from a long line of stubborn overachievers. She was born
in New York and was one of many ambitious visionaries in the
crowded, creative world of dance in the 1930s. Inspired by a
hoedown witnessed at a Colorado ranch, she put together a piece
called ``The Rodeo'' for a company she had formed in 1938 in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Back in America in the early 1940s, she developed the idea
further, but saw it rejected by the American-focused Ballet
Theatre. She finally sold it to the New York-based but
Russian-focused Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. She got $500 and the
guarantee that she could dance the principal female role on opening
night. The earlier sketches were filled out with a half-humorous,
half-poignant plot of a cowgirl whom the cowboys respect but aren't
interested in romantically.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine Liberatore, 25, in his seventh season with the
company, relishes his role as the Champion Roper. He will dance the
role Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot of character dancing,'' he says. ``You become
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberatore has specialized to a certain extent in character
roles, such as Drosselmeyer in ``The Nutcracker,'' the Hoofer in
``Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'' and Death in ``La Valse.'' But he
also has another specialty that helps out in ``Rodeo:'' tap
dancing, which he studied for five years before taking on ballet at
15.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Rodeo'' is one of those ballets in which the music, by
Aaron Copland, and the choreography are inextricably linked.
Although many of his most beloved works remained ahead of him, such
as ``Fanfare for the Common Man,'' ``Appalachian Spring'' and the
Third Symphony,Copland was well-established in the early 1940s as a
leading American composer. He had already produced the score for an
earlier ``cowboy'' ballet, Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid'' of
1938.
</P>
<P>
   But the score of ``Rodeo'' is a step beyond ``Billy the Kid'' _
even more confident in its use of existing balladry and in the
invention of material that captures the energy and open spaces of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Amort, 30, who danced with the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet
in 1988-93 and returned this fall, landed the role of the Cowgirl
for two of this weekend's three performances,
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is full,'' she says. ``It's colorful and rich. It
paints a picture for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After the immediate success of ``Rodeo'' in 1942, de Mille
became the most well-known choreographer in America, shortly
thereafter revolutionizing the Broadway musical as well with the
Freudian inferences of her ballet dream sequence for the musical
``Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one close observer of de Mille has seen a
self-portrait in the Cowgirl of ``Rodeo:'' the misfit, determined
to live by her own standards, but always searching for love. Yes,
``Rodeo'' is folksy, comical and nationalist; but, as Amort says,
``It carries the story of a woman's heart.''

`JOE BLACK' CONTINUES TREND, BUT IS TOO LONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing you can say in favor of Martin Brest's ``Meet Joe
Black'' is that it definitely continues the great 1998 trend of
major filmmakers challenging the conventions of '90s filmmaking. In
its own way, it's as daring as ``Bulworth'' or ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In remaking the 1934 Fredric March comedy, ``Death Takes a
Holiday,'' Brest has filled that 78-minute trifle with so much
character detail and so many long, slow-paced scenes that his film
is close to three hours long _ almost three times the original's
running time!
</P>
<P>
   It's a slap in the face to the MTV ethic, and my guess is that a
large part of the movie-going audience will not stay with it. At
one point in the Tuesday night preview, in fact, a rude audience
member actually let out a loud yawn, and it received much
supportive laughter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you can fall in with its leisurely pace,
you might find it quite an enjoyable three hours. It has major star
power, unusually good chemistry and the kind of old-fashioned
Hollywood glamor and dreamy romanticism that has been very scarce
in movies of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The story has Death, curious about the ways of human beings,
taking the form of a young man (Brad Pitt) and entering the life of
a communications tycoon (Anthony Hopkins) who, on the even of his
65th birthday, is scheduled to have a lethal heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by such earthly delights as peanut butter and sex,
Death gradually becomes part of the tycoon's life, gets humorously
drawn into the complications of his business affairs and gradually
falls in love with his daughter (Claire Forlani).
</P>
<P>
   The film's big problem is easy to spot: its premise is simply
not solid enough to support a three-hour drama. While we might go
along with this kind of whimsical fantasy in a fast-paced romp,
three hours gives us time to think about the idea _ and realize its
basic absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brest (``Scent of a Woman'') almost makes it work. This
is one of the year's most sumptuously composed and photographed
films (the lighting is especially striking). Brest's scenes may be
long and slow, but, for the most part, they're immaculately staged
and performed.
</P>
<P>
   The romantic casting also clicks. Brad Pitt lacks the skill for
drawing-room comedy that might have made the movie soar, but he's
enormously charismatic and likable. As his love interest, newcomer
Claire Forlani (``The Rock'') is even more appealing _ and
exquisitely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' also, of course, has Anthony Hopkins _ which
is invariably a big plus. It's far from the best-written part of
his career _ almost a cliche _ but he turns the character into
something profound and wonderful. As always, every moment this
great actor is on screen is pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Joe Black. Directed by Martin Brest. Screenplay by Ron
Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman. Cast: Brad Pitt,
Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani, Jake Weber. Universal. 174
minutes. Rated PG-13 for one sex scene.

DESPITE HEALTH WARNINGS, DINERS PREFER FATTY FOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LILA LAHOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fat is back, and you can see it on Will
Petty's plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching what we eat because of cholesterol,''
Petty said recently at the Ol' South Pancake House in Fort Worth.
That didn't stop him from ordering a biscuit-and-sausage lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one of them a day, and then salad at night,'' said
Petty, 60, a truck driver from the Fort Worth suburb of Haltom
City.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the rationale, Americans are eating more fat these
days: more pizza, enchiladas, steak, nachos dripping with cheese,
and, for dessert, ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   This might sound incongruous, given years of health warnings
about the risks of eating too much fat. However, Americans aren't
completely ignoring those admonitions: the percentage of fat in
U.S. diets has declined in recent years, but the total fat consumed
has risen because people are eating more, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Food Surveys Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that time-strapped consumers continue to eat more
meals away from home, and they are gobbling up the larger
restaurant portions. There's also the obvious fact that fat tastes
better.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay, the Plano snack food maker, found as much with its
low-fat Baked Lay's chips. The original Baked Lay's have 1.5 grams
of fat per serving. When the company launched the same product in
sour cream and onion, and barbecue flavors, Frito-Lay jacked up the
fat content to 3 grams per serving.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, ``consumers told us they wanted the flavor,'' said
Lynn Markley, a Frito-Lay spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel Kelley, 40, a computer programmer who lives in Grand
Prairie, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   For most meals, Kelley says, he eats ``something with
vegetables.'' On a recent day, he was having one of his faves, a
plate-sized, egg-rich German pancake at the Ol' South. Kelley, 40,
dines out often and says he doesn't spend a lot of time worrying
about fat content.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a lot to do with people being tired of being
told what's healthy and what's going to kill you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for waistlines is that, on average, fat as a
percentage of calories consumed has declined in the American diet.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Surveys
Research Group, in 1994-96, fat accounted for about 33 percent of
calories consumed, compared with 40 percent in 1977-78.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans' overall consumption of fat has grown. This fall,
for example, demand sent prices soaring for butterfat, the key
ingredient in cheese and ice cream. U.S. cheese consumption rose to
28 pounds per capita last year, up from more than 20 pounds in the
early 1980s, driven by the surging popularity of Mexican and
Italian foods.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Americans think they're eating healthfully, they are
still taking in more fat. Per capita vegetable fat consumption _
vegetable oils and margarine _ increased to 55 pounds last year
from 45 pounds during the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Putnam, agricultural economist for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Economic Research Service in Washington, said the fat
that people are consuming has shifted within the American diet over
the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Salad and cooking oils are up; shortening is down. Fluid milk is
down; cheese and cream are up. Nonfat salad dressings are down;
reduced-fat dressings are up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a trend where people are saying, `This
low-fat stuff tastes awful,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Take Blue Bell Ice Cream in Brenham. Nonfat and low-fat frozen
yogurt, which accounts for 2 percent to 3 percent of the company's
sales, did well for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, yogurt has dropped almost 30 percent. Blue Bell's
regular ice cream, which accounts for two-thirds of sales, gained 6
percent in unit sales. Light ice cream, which accounts for about 2
percent of sales, gained 11 percent in unit sales.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Bell's experience apparently reflects that of the industry.
Regular-fat ice cream sales, accounting for 82 percent of the U.S.
market, increased 6.4 percent for the first seven months of this
year, according to the International Ice Cream Association in
Washington. Meanwhile, dollar sales for reduced-fat, low-fat and
nonfat ice creams declined 6.3, 8, and 14.7 percent respectively.
Sales of light ice cream, which has about half the fat of regular
ice cream, were up 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like the full-fat ice cream,'' said Melvin
Ziegenbein, Blue Bell's vice president and general sales manager.
``It just tastes good.''
</P>
<P>
   Large restaurant meals also continue to be a culprit in higher
fat intake, and the strong economy has helped lead to a surge in
restaurant sales. Besides Mexican and Italian restaurants,
steakhouses are also enjoying strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   About 57 percent of the U.S. population ate at least one meal
away from home on any given day in 1994-96, an increase of about
one-third since the late 1970s, according to the Agriculture
Department. A restaurant meal typically means a larger meal, which
usually means more fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceive big portions as being of value,'' said Barbara
Gollman, a nutritionist and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association. ``If you don't serve big portions, people won't come
back to your restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants are proud that what they sell doesn't carry the
seal of approval from nutritionists.
</P>
<P>
   Krispy Kreme, the North Carolina-based purveyor of the
hot-out-of-the-fryer doughnut, has launched an aggressive national
expansion and expects to open stores next year in Arlington and
Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People eat Krispy Kreme doughnuts as a special treat. It's a
reward. It's fun,'' said Mike Cecil, minister of culture for Krispy
Kreme. Then, ``You work out and do the other things that are good
for your body.''

WRAPPED UP IN CASHMERE AND PERFUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The biggest thing in the Big Apple is the ubiquitous
cashmere shawl. These fringed, wide miracles have taken the chill
off the 45-degree mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wears them, including Andre Leon Talley, Vogue's sassy
columnist whose shawl was chocolate brown and wrapped around his
neck with both ends hanging down. (Personally, I like mine thrown
over my shoulders the other way.)
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine was so cold, she bought a figured cashmere
muffler and hasn't had it off her body since she left Bergdorf's.
It's too warm for fur here, although several elegant women have
been wearing shoulder warmers out of mink, chinchilla collars on
their Michael Kors and fox collars like scarves. Of course, Vogue's
Anna Wintour schlepps around in her chinchilla, looking very
Gstaad.
</P>
<P>
   YSL launched its new perfume, Vice Versa, last week at an
all-day tea at the Grace Building here. The conference rooms were
decorated in St. Laurent's favorite color combo, fuchsia and vivid
geranium red-orange, to illustrate the combative nature of the new
scent. It juggles love and hate, says YSL's Chrystel Abadie. How
that translates into the ``juice,'' as they say, is in a heavy
contrast between sweet and peppery notes.
</P>
<P>
   This one is probably the fragrance of the year. No kidding. The
top is a combination of fruity notes _ framboise and mandarin
mitigated by the scent of tomato leaves (a bit bitter and
distinctive). The heart is an effusive floral and the lingering
note is amber. Warm, sensual. Vice Versa is one of the new
``effusives'' _ a real perfume that develops on the skin in layers,
a long-lasting scent that isn't afraid to be provocative and sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bottle design carries out the duality in this scent
(sweet/tart, elegant/sensual). The cap is a red heart _ or is it a
spade? Nice play on St. Laurent's signature heart logo. Nice juice.
No, make that great juice.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of rich and sensual, Dana Buchman's new Luxe line is
developing into not only a hot seller (Saks does very well with
it), but it is intrinsically well made and so great for working
women who want a lot of bang for their buck.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Buchman and her partner, Karen Harman, were not showing in
the tent, but were serving tea in their blonde-on-blonde showroom,
where a couple of friendly models put on the clothes we wanted to
see in action. Very civilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We design clothes for women, not the runway,'' laughed Harman.
``My line is fashion and reality,'' says Buchman. ``When I design,
I see a woman in movement.''
</P>
<P>
   And move you will in an ankle-length black, knife-pleated skirt
shown with a crisp white linen top. Or in a gotta-have-it short
swing coat in black with pink carnation Chinoiserie embroidery and
a pink silk lining to wear over slim black pants and a nifty little
black knit camisole. (They won't be in stores until May, so hold
on.)
</P>
<P>
   In the regular Dana Buchman line, look for capris in a leopard
print or twin sets in slippery spun-gold chenille or what Buchman
calls ``molten copper'' _ a burgundy brown _ with a double-V,
tunic-length sweater to match. This is wearable stuff at a good
price.
</P>
<P>
   And now for something completely different _ Richard Tyler. His
precision tailoring is something his more practical fans adore and
whose sex-on-the-hoof, drop-dead Hollywood clothes are worn by
skinny-minnies like Calista Flockhart, Jennifer Anniston and, as we
all learned at the Oscars, Ashley Judd, who wouldn't think of
ruining the line of Tyler's drapery with a pair of underpants.
</P>
<P>
   For some odd reason _ backers getting cold feet, maybe _ Tyler
canceled his show in the Bryant Park tent, choosing to invite
journalists from cities where his line does well for a private
go-round in a town house in Gramercy Park.
</P>
<P>
   In a long, stark room, furnished with white duck-covered couches
and tables with hors d'oeuvres and bowls of fragrant variegated
peonies on one side and a pipe rack holding his 30-odd piece
collection on the other, Tyler walked me through, explaining that
he had gone back to his roots _ stark, modern designs in luxurious
fabrics, with tailoring details that only the skilled eye would
pick up. Like hand-stitching on pants' closures and jacket
closures, magnetic jacket and trouser closures that eliminated
buttons for a sleek line.
</P>
<P>
   While Tyler had some real va-voom pieces that screamed Sunset
Boulevard (he's never far from rock 'n' roll), the most successful
clothes were the simplest. His take on the Little Black Dress is a
perfectly stark, Sabrina-necked cotton twill sleeveless shift
gussied up with a black caviar-beaded sewn-down sash. But turn the
thing around, and this is a dress for making dramatic exits. It is
cut all the way down to the waist in back with the straps curving
around the edge of the shoulder blade and back under the arm to
keep everything snug. He also worked it up (minus the flashy belt)
in triple-layered chrome silk organza.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was what a friend called ``the casting-couch'' dress,
a stone-colored leather job with built-in bandeau-bodice lined with
airtex _ that athletic-cup material. ``You know all the women in
Hollywood with the fake breasts will insist on wearing this
dress,'' Tyler joked. But that wasn't the kicker. The closure was
right up front in Velcro.

ANTI-SMOKING GROUPS CRITICIZE PROPOSED TOBACCO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Details of a reported $200 billion settlement of
lawsuits filed by 36 states against the tobacco industry remain
under wraps, but anti-smoking activists are convinced the
settlement is a bad deal for the public.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the eight attorneys general involved in the
negotiations have been too lenient with the tobacco companies, and
that the settlement does not involve enough money, public input or
restrictions on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're signing off forever on letting these tobacco guys go,
and they're getting off cheap,'' said Paul Minicucci, executive
director of the Next Generation California Tobacco Control Alliance
in Sacramento. ``We're being railroaded.''
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the multistate agreement has been circulated among
the attorneys general and attorneys general-elect of the states
that did not participate in the negotiations. Public disclosure of
the contents is expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're only giving other states seven days to sign on (to the
settlement), and that's a pretty short time,'' said Lisa Goldman,
campaign coordinator for the Americans for Non-Smokers Rights in
Oakland. ``That's like a used-car fire sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Godshall, executive director of Smoke Free Pennsylvania in
Pittsburgh, said of the proposal: ``It wouldn't survive the public
stink test.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would reportedly curb industry advertising,
marketing and promotional practices and require states to dismiss
lawsuits seeking reimbursement of the cost of treating Medicaid
patients for tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general have been negotiating since July, when a
$516 billion anti-tobacco deal fell apart in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking activists insist that most states could have
wrested better deals from the tobacco industry by pursuing
lawsuits. But San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne, whose
office won a $10 million settlement for 14 California counties and
cities from the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in 1997, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that tobacco litigators are tenacious is probably the
understatement of the century,'' Renne said. ``Everyone's going to
have to ask themselves a very hard question: `Is it possible to get
more if we go forward with this litigation than we're going to get
with the settlement?' Maybe not. And there are good things about
the terms of the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Renne noted that the $23 billion California would receive over
25 years under the settlement would provide ``a very significant
sum'' to enable San Francisco and the cities and counties her
office represented in the 1997 settlement to launch effective
anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _ have
reached individual settlements of their lawsuits against the
industry, totaling $41.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Glantz, a University of California at San Francisco
professor and author of ``The Cigarette Papers,'' advocates the
state-by-state litigation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This so-called global settlement is a political deal for
immunity,'' Glantz said. ``The right way to fight these cases is
one state at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Minnesota settlement were taken as a model for the
nation, the tobacco industry should be offering $427 billion, not
$200 billion, Glantz said. ``We could do a lot better.''

FRIDAY THE 13TH: A LUCKY DAY FOR THE `ODD COUPLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ratings don't always equate quality. The Nielsens
are full of bottom-dwellers that are merely surviving if not
bombing in the eyes of the general public, yet still generate
justifiably strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   These shows _ ``Sports Night (ABC),'' ``Buddy Faro (CBS)'' and
``Cupid'' (ABC) to name three _ could still be canceled and
relegated to trivia questions in a few years. But ABC had a show a
quarter of a century ago that also did not top the ratings not even
close yet is not only still remembered, but revered.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the most appropriate of days to recall that show.
Because, on Nov. 13, Felix Unger was asked to remove himself from
his place of residence.
</P>
<P>
   That request came from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Those words began the prologue before most episodes of ``The Odd
Couple,'' starring Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. The show, which
ran for 114 episodes from September 1970 through July 1975, never
finished in the Top 25 for a season, yet still has hard-core fans
through reruns and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Odd Couple'' began as a Neil Simon play, then became a
movie. With due apologies to Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon _ and
no apologies to others who assumed the roles in later productions _
the performances of Klugman and Randall cemented them as Oscar
Madison and Felix Unger for syndicated eternity.
</P>
<P>
   It was the quintessential opposites-attract story. Irrelevant
was the fact both were males _ although the ``Can two divorced men
share an apartment without driving each other crazy?'' intro was
designed by an oversensitive network censor to discredit any belief
the two were gay.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the roommates fought _ entrenched in their different
perspectives _ only to conclude each episode with a ``love scene.''
They'd make up and remind viewers why they were friends in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Klugman netted two Emmys and Golden Globe, and Randall one Emmy.
Between the two of them, they brought a combined 60 years of stage
and screen experience to the program. Still, ``The Odd Couple'' was
not embraced by either the network or the public during the time it
aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were canceled every year,'' Klugman, 76, said in a
telephone interview earlier this week. ``We never got any ratings
and they were canceling us all the time. They (the network) just
didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   In five seasons ``The Odd Couple'' was shuttled between six
different time slots on Thursdays and Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a chance to get an audience,'' Klugman said.
``They (network officials) never cared for it.'' The show was
canceled after 15 episodes, but a media blitz by the actors,
coupled with a write-in campaign by fans, saved the program.
</P>
<P>
   Klugman hated those first 15 episodes, primarily because they
featured only one camera and canned laughter. The show began to
take off after the format was switched to a live studio audience,
which often rocked with laughter that could not be replicated.
</P>
<P>
   Like very few shows from the era, ``The Odd Couple'' (in reruns
on Comedy Central) has held up through the years. Like evergreen
hits such as ``The Honeymooners,'' ``I Love Lucy'' and ``All in the
Family,'' Felix and Oscar were a product of, but not a slave to,
their times. Guaranteed, the show will still be funny 50 years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played classic comedy,'' Klugman said. ``They are timeless.
They don't deal with the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Klugman, his voice gravely from throat-cancer surgery a few
years back (he only has one vocal cord now), is still acting. He
recently completed a run on Broadway with Randall in ``The Sunshine
Boys,'' and Klugman said the two are slated to appear in January on
ABC's ``Brother's Keeper,'' a sitcom about two dissimilar brothers
that closely mirrors the Felix/Oscar conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know how good he was and good he is,'' Klugman
said of his friend Randall.
</P>
<P>
   Klugman, of course, starred in many other roles in addition to
the sloppy sportswriter. He was Juror No. 5, the kid, in the 1957
classic ``12 Angry Men.'' He appeared in two of the better episodes
of ``The Twilight Zone,'' including the unforgettable ``A Game of
Pool,'' where as hotshot Jesse Cardiff he battled Jonathan Winters'
immortal Fats Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a class show,'' Klugman, a former Philly pool shark,
said of Rod Serling's masterpiece. ``I knew this character. I knew
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   After a successful run on ``Quincy, M.E.'' _ which ran one
season longer than ``The Odd Couple'' _ Klugman continued to appear
in various stage and film roles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people on the street still call him Oscar. He learned a
valuable lesson, he says, several years ago from Art Carney. One
day while walking down Broadway with Carney, somebody yelled ``Hey,
Norton, how is it down in the sewer?''
</P>
<P>
   Carney told Klugman he didn't mind such good-natured barbs.
``Whenever they call you by your character's name, they've accepted
you into their home,'' Klugman recalled Carney saying.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they weren't in the early 1970s, but Felix and Oscar are
certainly welcome now.

   WASHINGTON _ Welcome to the wild, wild West of telecom reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s gold rush for the Internet market, a number of
small phone companies _ and some not-so-small companies _ have
managed to seize valuable chunks of the growing business of
connecting people to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As companies such as e.spire, US LEC Corp. and MCI WorldCom have
rushed into local phone markets, they have sought out internet
service providers (ISPs) as customers. When people use modems to
connect to the Internet, the signals travel across the local phone
companies' networks.
</P>
<P>
   And this nets them handsome fees from their competitors, under
agreements setting per-minute fees for every local call received by
a customer. Because ISPs mainly receive calls and rearely make
them, most of the fees for local phone traffic flows from the
regional Bell companies, to the local upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies have really put on their thinking caps,'' said
Jim Crawford, spokesman for the Association for Local
Telecommunications Services. ``They've figured out they need to
sign up customers who receive the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the regional Bell operating companies and GTE Corp., are
screaming that the agreements to pay competitors for local phone
traffic shouldn't apply to Internet calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always assumed Internet traffic was long-distance, not
local,'' said Gordon R. Evans, vice president for federal
regulatory matters for Bell Atlantic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The war between these ranchers and squatters will be taken to
the Federal Communications Commission this month, when the
five-member panel is expected to rule that dial-up Internet calls
are long distance, not local calls.
</P>
<P>
   The order likely won't affect consumers' Internet services or
fees, but it could dramatically alter the way telecom companies pay
each other for connecting customers to the Net in the future.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if the calls are declared long distance, the
federal government _ not states, as is currently the case _ will
assume responsibility for future pricing structures to connect
people to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to change things for consumers,'' said Tom
Power, legal adviser to FCC Chairman William E. Kennard. ``But it
will go to the issue of compensation between the carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, telecom companies pay each other for connecting calls to
the Internet because they are considered local. The companies
typically negotiate two- to three-year ``reciprocal compensation''
agreements dishing out between seven-tenths of a cent and one penny
for every minute that another company connects its customers to the
Internet through a provider such as America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements were initially pushed by the regional Bell
companies because they expected to be carrying more traffic than
their upstart competitors. Now some officials are predicting
``catastrophic'' results if the rules aren't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, analysts project regional Bell companies and GTE
will owe competing phone and cable companies as much as $600
million in reciprocal compensation this year. That figure could
climb to as much as $2 billion by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for money for nothing,'' said Cindy
Schonhaut, executive vice president for government and corporate
affairs at ICG of Englewood, Colo., which provides local phone
service in nine states. ``We're providing a valuable service by
making these connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FCC rules that Internet connections are long
distance calls, it is also are likely to recommend that the current
contracts remain valid. That means the next stop for the Bell
companies will be the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One example of the squabble is the case of BellSouth and US LEC
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, two Rochester, N.Y., entrepreneurs set up shop in
Charlotte to provide competitive local phone service under the US
LEC name. In addition to other customers, they signed up a handful
of ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Now when BellSouth customers call the Internet, the signals are
connected through US LEC's network. BellSouth has to pay US LEC for
each minute that their customers stay on line.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch analysts project that this year, US LEC will be
owed $51 million, or 68 percent of its revenue, in reciprocal
compensation payments. BellSouth has refused to pay, filing for an
appeal with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But state regulatory commissions are siding with the upstarts.
To date, 23 states or state utilities have ruled in favor of
competitive local phone companies _ which include some of the
biggies of the long-distance business such as MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T
_ saying the contracts are valid.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for example, the Public Utility Commission ruled that
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., operated by the regional Bell
company SBC Communications Inc., owed Time Warner Communications
and Waller Creek Communications Inc. roughly $500,000 a month for
connecting its customers to ISPs. Southwestern Bell appealed the
decision, but a U.S. district judge in Midland-Odessa, Texas,
denied the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Cox Communications Inc., a subsidiary of Cox
Enterprises Inc., is duking it out with SBC over payment due for
local phone connections in Orange County. Cox has argued that the
negotiated contracts are valid.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Worrying about Tom Wolfe
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are three kinds of people here who worry about
Tom Wolfe's new novel of Atlanta, ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   1) People who read the book for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   2) People who worry about what Wolfe will say about their city,
whether he will misunderstand, or, worse yet, understand.
</P>
<P>
   3) People who worry that if they carp, Wolfe will retaliate in a
subsequent magazine article. He has ways of getting back few of us
can even conceive.
</P>
<P>
   The Category 2 worriers, who fret over atmospherics, are in a
state of fretful suspension. They await validating reaction from
elsewhere. In other words, how others, like Coloradans who read,
will see us.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans endlessly worry that we will be seen as greedy,
commercial, boosterish, materialistic and overly sensitive about
what is said about us. A lot of us do worry awfully and in large
numbers about the correctness of our cars and of our lawns. Then we
worry that we will be caught at it.
</P>
<P>
   From what I can tell, Atlanta has come off without serious
damage in the 742-page Wolfe book. Wolfe is 67 now and can be
presumed to be on Medicare, a bit more tolerant of the foibles of
people or cities, not the Tom Wolfe of the unforgiving New
Journalism of the 1970s. He notes our foibles more benignly now, as
tolerant of others as he is of himself. That's from Ambrose Bierce.
</P>
<P>
   Is Tom Wolfe to Atlanta literature as William Tecumseh Sherman
was to Scarlett O'Hara's Atlanta? Nah. Something more on the order
of the Union general Meade at Gettysburg.

`MEET JOE BLACK': WHEN DEATH COMES TO CALL, SERVE PEANUT BUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, to die in a sugar-coated Hollywood movie while the spiritual
schmaltz craze is under way! You look your best. You say wise
things. Your loved ones cherish them. Perhaps there'll be a party
with a dance band and fireworks in your honor. And you can spend as
much time on your last farewells as it took to sink the Titanic, a
ship that doubtless bears some responsibility for the rise of the
four-star demise.
</P>
<P>
   You can even insist, as the oppressively lavish and snail-paced
``Meet Joe Black'' does, that the old wisdom about the rich man and
the eye of the needle was dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   William Parrish, the noble tycoon played zestily by Anthony
Hopkins in this otherwise somnolent, emotion-free weepie, is just
such a fortunate paragon. And ``Meet Joe Black'' does its
prettified best to find inspiration in watching him die.
</P>
<P>
   Because William is wise, kind, generous and so well-heeled that
he pays no attention to the great paintings on his remarkably many
walls (Manhattan triplex, sleek offices, Versailles-like seaside
palace), destiny even gives him a gift: a personal afterlife
trainer in the form of Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   As Death with blond highlights, Pitt might have been expected to
give the film a pulse, but his role is conceived in an all too
appropriately lifeless fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' is a latter-day version of ``Death Takes a
Holiday,'' the play that was filmed in 1934 with Fredric March and
had some nicely fanciful notions of what might happen if Death gave
himself a breather.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it would be impossible to commit suicide by
jumping off the Eiffel Tower, and withering plant life would
flourish; perhaps, in the wildly overlong case of ``Meet Joe
Black,'' enough plant life to refoliate deserts.
</P>
<P>
   But as directed by Martin Brest, who last made ``Scent of a
Woman,'' ``Meet Joe Black'' doesn't even have time for such
charming diversions. It's busy showing off the Parrish family's
privileged life style ad nauseam (the lily-gilding is formidable,
thanks to production design by Dante Ferretti and Emmanuel
Lubezki's polished cinematography). And it devotes one whole dopey
subplot to planning William's grandiose birthday fete.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there is much excitement among the Parrishes when
Pitt arrives in their midst. He actually plays two roles, the first
a supposedly gee-whiz young man who meets beautiful, dedicated Dr.
Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani, fresh and exotically alluring) in a
coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   They meet, they flirt and then blam! The young man is dispatched
in a traffic accident, which gives faceless, formless Death a
bright idea. Since Brad Pitt's face and body are available, why not
visit earth as arm candy from what the film refers to as ``the next
place?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, William is having severe heart trouble, which takes
the form of heavy editing, strident musical melodrama and agonized
winces from Hopkins. His number is almost up, but Death would like
to offer him a bonus round.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for showing Death, a k a Joe Black, what it means to
be a happy mogul, William can put his affairs in order without much
of a rush. And Joe Black, while falling for Susan, can express
innocent amazement at human life as if he were a great-looking
version of E.T. There are repeated, ostensibly delightful scenes in
which Joe discovers the wonders of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know how long ``Meet Joe Black'' is? It's long enough
not only for the peanut butter rhapsodies but for William to wax
rhapsodic about his late wife's lamb sandwiches with cilantro.
(``Not as chewy as roast beef. Not as boring as chicken.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's long enough for the lines ``What a lovely name, Joe!'' and
``There's so many words I wanted to say but, uh, I can't, so I'd
better sit down.'' It's long enough for a discussion of a famous
pastry chef and for flower arrangements that upstage the
characters.
</P>
<P>
   With a too-many-cooks screenplay credited to Ron Osborn, Jeff
Reno, Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman, it's so long that every character
regrettably wears out his or her welcome. There's not a scene or
performance here _ especially Pitt's in its blank-faced, laconic
moments _ that couldn't have been helped in the editing room by
picking up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pitt plays it impassive too often, he and Ms. Forlani
have some gently amorous moments, even if he winds up saddled with
the single worst line of his career once they kiss. (``The taste of
your lips and the touch of your tongue _ that was wonderful!'') He
and Hopkins also show signs of an engaging rapport, though it
suffers a spate of needless long pauses.
</P>
<P>
   The small cast also includes Marcia Gay Harden as William's
older, more gratingly fatuous daughter, Jeffrey Tambor as her
husband and Jake Weber as part of a particularly by-the-numbers
subplot about trouble at William's company. This calls for
important-looking meetings beside one more drop-dead canvas and a
group of stiff-looking extras as board members. There's a token
woman, but she doesn't seem to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another sidetrack finds Pitt speaking in Jamaican argot to a
dying old woman who has his number. His Caribbean accent hasn't
much reason to be here (``I doan have nuttin' to do wit' dese
t'ings, y'know?'') but it's lilting enough to make one wish ``Meet
Joe Black'' would lighten up and take a vacation of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It includes mild profanity and a dewy, leisurely sexual interlude.
</P>

STORYTELLERS ARE JUST NATURAL LIARS _ IN A SWEET WAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The subject is crawfish cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   James Ford swears he has a pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, how'd you get all those little crawfish in one piece of
leather to make boots?'' Jay Stailey asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, you have to make a paste. And it don't take much
paste because I just wear a size 7. Then those little crawfish all
stick together, except every now and then when they get hungry,
they start pinching around with their claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caught a fish in one of those boots once.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wear just a size 7, it would probably be just a little
perch that long,'' Stailey counters, holding his hands close
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, when those claws get to pinching, it makes the boots
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Any two men who sit and argue over a pair of crawfish boots have
got to be a couple of liars.
</P>
<P>
   James Ford and Jay Stailey are two of the best.
</P>
<P>
   They've lied together and against each other before, and have
heard nearly all of each other's stories. So they'll have to really
stretch some stretchers to walk away with the esteemed title of
Liar Extraordinaire when they face off Sunday in ``Audacious Lies
or Tall Tales'' in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The event kicks off America's first National Storytelling Week,
which will be celebrated across the nation.

   Storytellers aren't all liars, but most of them are. They have a
gift for holding audiences' interests by relating stories about
family or their upbringing or undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them embellish events that really happened, or could
just as well have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should never let the truth get in the way of a good
story,'' says Stailey, principal of Bales Intermediate School in
Friendswood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the truth doesn't have to have anything to do with a
good story.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know. His best stories are about things that might
have happened, such as the Pied Piper of Hamlin enticing all the
pickup trucks out of Clear Lake Shores south of Houston, after the
city council wouldn't allot enough money for him to charm the
shoe-size cockroaches away.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it didn't happen, but it might have. And besides,
that's where he lives, so he threw in a couple of local characters
to spice it up.
</P>
<P>
   Ford says he started telling stories when he was just a pup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, it was just to get out of a whipping. My mama was part
hawk, and she could see anything that was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did something she specifically told him not to do,
that's when he started whipping up some whoppers. ``I'd keep
linking stuff on until it would get bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a smile would start leaking at the corners of his
mama's mouth, and she'd say, ``Go up to your room, boy. I'll give
you a whipping later.''
</P>
<P>
   Those whippings seldom happened.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a Houston insurance salesman, now ensures that he never
tells the truth _ on stage, that is. He joined the Houston
Storytellers Guild in 1988 after a storyteller friend told him she
thought he had the knack.
</P>
<P>
   He must. The next year he was a co-winner of the guild's first
Liars Contest. He won the title outright in 1990, '91 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and Stailey have told stories, lies and fables at
storytelling events across the country.
</P>
<P>
   For Stailey, telling a story to an audience connects everyone
who is listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a sense of community we lack in this day and age _
that sense of human beingness. We live in houses and we don't know
our neighbors, we drive down the street and don't wave at each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storytelling creates that sense of community. I want my
audience to know that we're in this together. We're all human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ford, it's the unburdening of a family history and friends
he's known. Embellished, of course.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a garage apartment in back of his grandparents'
house in Houston. One day, he says, he was on his grandparents'
front porch, and a couple of dogs started sniffing each other in
the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Ford promptly went to the kitchen to ask his grandmother why
dogs did that. She told him to go ask his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   He did, and his grandfather settled back in his chair, a sure
sign that a long story was coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, a long time ago, dogs used to be like us. They'd run for
office, work at jobs and go to church on Sunday. When those dogs
were sitting on those hard pews, their tails got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they all started hanging their tails up in a closet before
they went into the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Sunday morning, Rev. Shepherd was giving a fine sermon,
and the dogs were shouting `Amen!' and `Hallelujah!' ``The Rev.
Shepherd looked to the back of the church, saw smoke coming out and
said, `Beruff! Ruff! Ruff!' ``Do you know what that means? ``It
means `Grab your tails and get out! The church is on fire!' ``So
those dogs were in a hurry when they grabbed their tails, and ever
since that day, they sniff each other to make sure it's not their
tail the other dog has.''

`DANCING AT LUGHNASA': 5 UNMARRIED SISTERS IN POSTCARD IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career,
but the way she simply peers out a window in ``Dancing at
Lughnasa'' ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know
about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that
prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five unmarried sisters who are the subject of Brian
Friel's play (and who are named for his own mother and aunts), it
is Kate who wears her unmarried status least comfortably. And it is
Kate who radiates the most wistful, turbulent emotions while
watching younger, prettier Christina (Catherine McCormack) dance
with a lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole face alters when she's happy,'' Kate whispers about
Christina in astonishment, speaking almost to herself. It is as if
this furiously upright schoolteacher, the sister who has taken it
upon herself to champion rectitude in the small Irish village where
Friel's play unfolds, had discovered the sweetness of Christina's
flirtatious exuberance and the chill of her own loneliness as if
for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streep, who between this film and her performance as a dying
mother in ``One True Thing'' has had a banner year, conveys all
this with supreme, heartbreaking economy and without a trace of
showiness.
</P>
<P>
   Like much about the film and its characters, she presents a
small, effortless epiphany simply by standing still, immersed in
the spirit of a lost time and place.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Donegal in 1936 and made poignant by the hindsight of
narration, ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' preserves the author's memories
of a world about to change irrevocably, filled with hints of
foreboding that made it so powerful an experience on stage. On
film, as directed handsomely by Pat O'Connor, it makes for a
soaringly scenic film, yet a slightly more diffuse, less haunted
drama.
</P>
<P>
   The play, an actors' heyday, is rich with memories of the
sisters and their camaraderie, especially when their fragile
fellowship is shaken by the arrivals of two men. While the film
begins with a rich evocation of the sisters' rustic chores and
rituals in the beautiful, isolated setting they call home, it's
clear that these men can change everything.
</P>
<P>
   One is Father Jack (Michael Gambon), once the family's
bright-eyed brother and now a broken old man, returning from
missionary work in Africa and filled with visions of a world his
sisters have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   While Gambon's gently eccentric Jack presides over the story
with a mysterious intensity, the other male visitor is more
mundane. Gerry Evans (Rhys Ifans) is Christina's handsome,
conventionally romantic beau (and the father of Michael, the young
man who nostalgically narrates the story).
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Gerry prompts the film into the very sorts of
picturesque rhapsodies that give this opened-up drama its postcard
appeal while removing the seriousness and sting from events that
transpire.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' has the fine cast, visual scale
and resplendent look of a magnum opus, it remains a collection of
sea changes and splendidly realized small moments rather than a
story of overarching action. The sooner the viewer recognizes as
much, the easier it is to discount some falsely inflated sequences
here and appreciate the keenly observed, wonderfully delicate
performances on display.
</P>
<P>
   Brid Brennan beautifully repeats her Tony-winning performance as
Agnes, the reticent, hard-working sister at the center of the
family; Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma) makes herself touchingly
headstrong and vulnerable as Rose, the sister who is nearly as
innocently unpredictable as Jack.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine, hearty turn from Kathy Burke as Maggie, the
house wit and realist, while Ms. McCormack conveys youthful
yearning for a world beyond small-town values and a sweet, lonely,
tiny cottage in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streep's Kate remains the most stubborn and formidable of
the bunch, bringing something especially universal to this story of
how sisterly wills collide. The time, the place and the rousing
Irish music (by Bill Whelan, who did ``Riverdance'') may be most
specific, but there's something timeless in Friel's sense of women
living at cross-purposes in very close company and feeling the tug
of change on even the most closely knit of family ties.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in ``Circle of Friends,'' O'Connor (directing Frank
McGuinness' adaptation of the play, with lovely cinematography by
Kenneth MacMillan) creates a quintessentially Irish experience,
reveling in the romance and beauty of his story's setting.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the material loses in claustrophobic tension and
foreboding, it benefits immeasurably from the glorious, untamed
vistas and the quaint ambiance of the little Irish village seen
here. It's a place that actually happened to be named Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). It includes mild profanity and threats of violence.
</P>
<P>

HOLIDAY-FILM _ (Los Angeles) _ There's an abundance of
entertainment choices coming up during the holidays, from movies to
theaters to parades. Let's face it: After fighting traffic at the
mall and fighting for the last parking space, you're going to need
a diversion. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
WILLIAMSTONE-FILM (Los Angeles) _ ``Williamstowne'' is a most
unusual cinematic production, set to the romantic music of
19th-century composer Ralph Vaughan Williams and with only 65 words
of dialogue. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
HARD-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ This mockumentary, a la ``This is
Spinal Tap,'' shrewdly explores how commercial considerations
eroded punk rock, the most radical of rock's anti-establishment
genres. 3{ stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
SUMMER-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The killer in the fisherman slicker
is back, along with Jennifer Love Hewitt, but ``I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer'' has none of the terror or excitement of Kevin
Williamson's first picture. 1 star. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
JOE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Brad Pitt plays the devil incarnate but
the actor's really overmatched in this all-too demanding role in
``Meet Joe Black.'' 2{ stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
WOOP-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' could well be
the most annoying movie of the year. 1 star. By Bob Strauss. 
.

stars Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a self-absorbed college student who
hits the road, where the laughs are pretty predictable. 2 stars. By
Keith Marder.

rocker Johnny Thunder doesn't try to paint a pretty picture of his
life, which ended in a New Orleans boarding house. By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ The title for Cardigans' fourth album
is borrowed from a video game the musicians played during breaks in
recording sessions. But there's nothing artificial about much of
Gran Tourismo that owes something to the trip-hop musings of Tricky
and Portishead. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
ARMAGEDDON-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ ``Armageddon'' and ``The Horse
Whisperer,'' two films you're not likely to see on a double bill in
a revival house, are out this week on video. They represent the
good and bad of Hollywood films. By Rob Lowman.

Hitchcock's best-known masterpiece. Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche,

Stowe, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe. (Miramax)

<P>
   The Prince of Egypt: For DreamWorks' first foray into
traditional animated-feature territory, the studio sought aid from
a higher power. The Moses story may not be what we're used to in
musical cartoon entertainment, but at least it's not the same old
talking animals. Voices supplied by Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes,
Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin and Michelle Pfeiffer, among many
others. Songs by Stephen Schwartz (``Pocahontas''). (DreamWorks)
</P>
<P>
   You've Got Mail: The ``Sleepless in Seattle'' gang _ Tom Hanks,

<P>
   Day of the Beast: Over-the-top Spanish shocker about a sinful
priest's efforts to confront the Antichrist. (Trimark)
</P>
<P>
   The General: Another movie about Irish mobsters, although this
one differs from previous efforts in that it's actually based on
real Dublin crime legend and plays like it. John Boorman (``Hope
and Glory,'' ``Deliverance'') won the Best Director award at
Cannes. (Sony Pictures Classics)
</P>
<P>
   The Theory of Flight: Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter
star in this romantic drama about a frustrated artist sentenced to
perform community service by caring for a woman with a
neuromuscular condition. (Fine Line Features) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DEC. 25:
</P>
<P>
   A Civil Action: Real-life best seller comes to the screen
starring John Travolta as the lawyer who stalks the corporations he
believes are responsible for giving eight Northeastern families
leukemia. If everyone who bought Jonathan Harr's prize-winning book
shows up, the movie will be off to a good start. (Disney)
</P>
<P>
   Down in the Delta: Poet Maya Angelou makes her directorial debut
with this story of an elderly woman who pawns the family heirlooms
to move her drug-addicted daughter and her two grandchildren back
to their ancestral home. (Miramax)
</P>
<P>
   The Faculty: High school students think their teachers just
don't understand, and it goes beyond the usual generation gap _ the
faculty are worm-infected aliens hell-bent on world domination.
Sounds kind of stupid, but then again it is from ``Scream'' meister
Kevin Williamson and directoror Robert Rodriguez (``From Dusk Till
Dawn''), so maybe stupid is good. (Miramax)
</P>
<P>
   Hilary &AMP; Jackie: Two angry first ladies get some guns and go
after their philandering husbands ... No, actually, this is the
true story of British cellist Jaqueline De Pre's close relationship
with her sister. And her sister's husband, which makes us start
thinking about certain presidents again. ``Breaking the Waves,''
Emily Watson and Australian actress Rachel Griffiths star. (October
Films)
</P>
<P>
   Hurlyburly: David Rabe's scathing play about Hollywood players
behaving badly comes to the screen with the help of bad-behavior
expert Sean Penn, experienced show-biz satirists Kevin Spacey (ever
seen ``Swimming With Sharks''?) and Garry Shandling, and such
relative innocents as Chazz Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn, Anna
Paquin and Meg Ryan. (Fine Line Features)
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Joe Young: Remake of the 1949 movie about a large simian
on a rampage. Fifty years later, themes of ecology and
understanding leaven the mayhem and, more than likely, raise the
hokum. (Disney)
</P>
<P>
   Patch Adams: Robin Williams plays the true-life doctor who uses
zany humor to cure what ails ya. The behind-the-scenes team
includes the director and writer responsible for ``The Nutty
Professor,'' ``Liar Liar'' and ``Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls.''
(Universal)
</P>
<P>
   Stepmom: Tearjerker about the unlikely friendship between a
divorced mother of two (Susan Sarandon) and the woman her
ex-husband dumped her for (Julia Roberts). Initially they clash
over just about everything, but when a terminal illness enters the
picture, well ... just make sure you bring some tissues to the
theater. (Sony)
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line: The year's other World War II picture comes
from the reclusive Terrence Malick, who hasn't made a movie since
1978's ``Days of Heaven.'' When word got out that Malick was making
this film about American soldiers trying to take Guadalcanal from

`WELCOME TO WOOP WOOP': SCHNITZEL-BASED REVOLT IN AN AUSTRALIAN
DOGPATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein, which saturate ``Welcome
to Woop Woop,'' Stephan Elliott's nightmarish satire of Australian
bourgeois provincialism, will certainly survive being dragged
through the dirt of this desperately unfunny farce.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Elliott, who made his reputation directing ``Priscilla,
Queen of the Desert,'' emerges unscathed is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The director has described ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' as ``a
hearty wave goodbye to an old Australia before political
correctness came in.'' That may be. But the movie, adapted from
Douglas Kennedy's novel ``The Dead Heart,'' is an incoherent mess
of thrown-together scenes heaping scorn and ridicule on the
Australian equivalent of Dogpatch, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine an Australian answer to the Vicki Lawrence television
series ``Mama's Family,'' tarted up into a frenzied drag show in
which there isn't any actual cross-dressing, just kitsch costuming
and acting carried beyond the pale.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in New York City where Teddy (Johnathon
Schaech), a con man selling rare Australian birds from the back of
a truck, is forced to flee the United States when the stripper who
is working for him goes crazy and shoots two men dead in the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Flying to Australia, Teddy drives a van into the country's arid
Northern Territory, where he picks up a sex-crazed hitchhiker named
Angie (Susie Porter) who knocks him out, drugs him and takes him
home to her village of Woop Woop. Upon waking up, Teddy discovers
that while drugged he was married to Angie in a public ceremony and
is now a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   A desert shantytown surrounded by hills, Woop Woop is ruled by
Angie's father, Daddy-O (Rod Taylor), a grizzled, chortling despot
who has decreed that no one can leave. When one resident, a
hairdresser married to Angie's sister Krystal (Dee Smart), tries to
climb his way out, he is shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   The only industry in a town whose residents subsist on canned
pineapple is the processing of dog food made from dead kangaroos
and dogs. Counterbalancing the violence in Woop Woop is a grotesque
cheeriness.
</P>
<P>
   Day and night, the music of Rodgers and Hammerstein is piped
over a loudspeaker throughout the town. Each week the villagers _ a
motley assortment of beer-guzzling, gun-toting hicks and half-wits
worthy of ``Li'l Abner'' _ gather for an outdoor screening of
movies like ``The Sound of Music'' or ''South Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot, such as it is, finds Teddy leading an abortive protest
march against the enforced pineapple diet once Daddy-O and his
friends have been spied eating wiener schnitzel. Teddy vows somehow
to escape. And the final chase sequence involves the sudden
appearance of a giant, supernatural kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' operates on the principle that
indiscriminate camp silliness can carry a movie. Maybe it can, for
about a half-hour at most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations
and strong language.

TEEN HORROR SEQUEL DESERVES THE HOOK
</HEADLINE>

OUR RATING: 1 Star 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gus Van Sant's upcoming shot-by-shot remake of
``Psycho'' has produced a lot of hand-wringing and carping from
people who consider the endeavor a pointless sacrilege. Why update
a movie that needs no updating? Haven't we seen it all before?
</P>
<P>
   What does this have to do with ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer''? Well, as I was watching this godawful clunker, I kept
thinking about Van Sant's ``Psycho'' and how I would rather watch a
carbon copy of a great movie made 38 years ago than sit through
another tepid horror knockoff like this dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know ...'' not only proves the law of diminishing
returns that applies to most sequels, it makes a strong case for
the death of the new wave of teen horror films _ or at least the
ones that don't involve Kevin Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, of course, wrote ``Scream,'' ``Scream 2'' and the
original ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' Wisely, he has moved
on to other things (``Dawson's Creek,'' the upcoming ``The
Faculty'') leaving this would-be franchise in the hands of director
Danny Cannon (``Judge Dredd'') and writer Trey Callaway. Safe to
say, based on their ineptitude, there won't be ``I Wish I Could
Forget What You Did Last Summer.'' And for that, I guess, we owe
them our thanks.
</P>
<P>
   What can you say about a horror movie that contains a paucity of
excitement and thrills? Plenty apparently, if you're an audience
member. When I saw the movie, many in the theater took to yelling
at the screen during especially implausible sequences or laughing
hysterically when a serious response was warranted. When the movie
ended, a few simply booed as they bolted from their seats.
</P>
<P>
   In ``I Still Know ...,'' Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as the
young woman haunted by the killer who looks like the Gorton
fisherman. Even when she and her fellow well-scrubbed castmates
(Brandy Norwood, Freddie Prinze Jr., Mekhi Phifer and Matthew
Settle) go on a vacation to the Bahamas, the man with the rain
slicker and bloody hook follows, carving up a few locals before
setting his sights on the teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The first film had a modicum of wit and a fair share of thrills,
but the sequel is completely devoid of both qualities, not to
mention tension and suspense. Cannon's static staging proves
deadly, as does the script's boring and predictable plot points.
You've seen it all before, and you've certainly seen it all done
with more passion and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt gamely gives the stupidity her best shot, but mostly she
just bounces around in low-cut ensembles designed to accentuate the
obvious. She should take a cue from Jamie Lee Curtis' career and
flee from the horror genre or at least show better judgment in
picking scripts. Otherwise, her film career will be as dead as the
teen-agers in this bloody awful movie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten minutes into ``Hard Core Logo,'' you start
wondering when the thing is going to get funny.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, a mockumentary, like ``This Is Spinal Tap''
and ``Fear of a Black Hat'' and a dozen other, duller satiric
comedies that have masqueraded as documentary looks at a fictitious
band/artist/production/political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But just around the time you realize that this movie's irony is
not necessarily there to serve humor, an appreciation of what
director Bruce McDonald is really up to emerges. Shrewdly choosing
a made-up punk outfit for his purposes, McDonald examines, in the
starkest terms possible, how commercial considerations eroded even
the most radical of rock's anti-establishment genres.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is that a Vancouver thrash outfit of the '80s,
Hard Core Logo, reassembles in the '90s to play a benefit concert
for the band's mentor, Bucky Haight (Julian Richings), a musician
whose anti-gun activism reportedly has gotten him shot. Joe Dick
(Hugh Dillon), Logo's confrontational lead singer and apparently a
loser since the band broke up, is the catalyst behind the
successful fund raiser.
</P>
<P>
   With the band back together, Joe proposes a cross-Canada reunion
tour, and with a video crew in tow (led by McDonald himself in a
further blurring of reality lines), they set off in a ratty step
van toward a second, inevitable and rancorous breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The film charts in excruciating detail how personal conflicts
between the overbearing Joe, sellout guitarist Billy Tallent
(Callum Keith Rennie), the schizophrenic, pharmaceuticals-dependent
bassist John Oxenberger (John Pyper-Ferguson) and the generally
misanthropic drummer Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson) fester and ooze
over long nights on the road and disappointing receptions in stale
beer clubs. Eventually, the angry musicians even start turning on
members of the camera crew, who do their best to incite further
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptions and hypocrisies ultimately come to light that call
the whole punk ethic into question. The film's dark genius lies in
the way it exposes everything in rock as just a passing pose, no
matter how virulent or nihilistic the fashion it assumes. With that
unforgiving attitude, the movie is punkier than many of the
movement's bands turned out to be.
</P>
<P>
   While all the actors are thoroughly convincing, Dillon stands
out as Joe, a guy trying rather too hard to remain the last of the
pogo pirates. His fury and passion _ the concert footage evokes a
Black Flag show, while the songs themselves boast a blistering,
X-like intensity _ are apt camouflage for an astounding cynicism,
and Dillon not only keeps the mask in place, he finds true
poignance in the rotting soul behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Core Logo'' is like a quart injection of rye whiskey
straight into the frontal lobe. It's rude, raucous stuff, and far
and away the smartest music scene movie of this disco-dulled and
glitter-clogged year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Death takes an eternity in ``Meet Joe Black.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three hours, the Grim Reaper, in the form of a
half-smirking Brad Pitt with painstakingly mussed hair in his eyes,
stalks Anthony Hopkins' graying media mogul at a glacial pace. You
start to think _ and believe me, the movie supplies endless
opportunities for one's mind to wander _ that if Sir Anthony would
just bust a few Zorro moves, he could live forever.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would mean everyone watching would die of
boredom, a fate few viewers will escape as it is.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, ``Meet Joe Black'' has some worthwhile things to say
about life and love and the meaning of it all sprinkled amid all
the windy speechifying a battery of high-priced screenwriters
(``Working Girl's'' Kevin Wade, ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest's'' Bo Goldman, more) could conjure. And darned if Brad
doesn't look adorable with those blond strands tickling his lashes.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a movie with very little story to tell,
simultaneously puffed up and spread thin to, well, titanic lengths.
Indeed, this romantic fantasy was told at its proper length in the
79-minute ``Death Takes a Holiday,'' a creaky but more persuasive
Fredric March movie made in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   In the new, slower version, Hopkins plays the most wonderful guy
on Earth, William Parrish, who owns an ethical and prosperous, if
otherwise ill-defined, communications empire. Heck, with a setup
this unbelievable, who needs Death to appear in human form?
</P>
<P>
   But show he does, in the body of a freshly killed young lawyer,
insisting that he needs a break and that William, being such a
sterling fellow, is the perfect host for his little vacation. Of
course, the old guy will cooperate; as soon as the visit's over,
Bill's informed, he'll become the official souvenir and be taken
back to the other side of the veil.
</P>
<P>
   Like most unwanted guests, Death, now called Joe Black, arrives
at the worst possible time. A not-so-nice media baron wants to
merge, Bill's favorite daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is dating
the corporate weasel (Jake Weber) who's engineering the takeover,
and the widowed mogul's needier daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) is
planning an over-the-top 65th birthday bash that Bill anticipates
with dread embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this sexy, killer geek is haunting the
well-appointed, too-long halls of Bill's Manhattan townhouse and
upstate mansion (best thing about the movie: modern-art
masterpieces on every wall, and lots of time to look at them!).
Worse, Susan's falling in love with Joe, and vice versa. What's a
concerned Dad _ who once told his daughter, on their private
helicopter, that he wanted her ``to sing with rapture and dance
like a dervish'' because love is all that matters _ to do?
</P>
<P>
   Well, a little reassessing, obviously, while staying an
admirable gent to the end. Even though Bill is an impossible
conceit of a character, Hopkins nonetheless invests him with
controlled dignity and hard-won warmth.
</P>
<P>
   As for the true nature of the deadly Mr. Black, Pitt hasn't got
a clue. Imperious in his private dealings with Parrish, puppy-dog
naive when loving up Susan, amusingly awkward in social situations
yet ingeniously cutthroat when it comes to boardroom dealings,
supposedly unschooled in the particulars of our world yet capable
of speaking in perfect Caribbean patois when met by a dying
Jamaican woman, Joe Black is a bundle of contradictory traits that
requires more than pretty boy posing to put across.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt hardly appears equipped for the job. Maybe that's why he
says ... every ... line ... so ... slowly.
</P>
<P>
   When you boil it all down, though, ``Meet Joe Black'' really
does have more on its mind than recent epic forays into
romanticized, pumped-up profundity such as ``Deep Impact'' and
``Titanic.'' And for a movie so poshly appointed, it manages to
keep the discussion focused on true values most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't make it any more exciting, nor any less
indulgent. The director is Martin Brest, who last time out, in
``Scent of a Woman,'' let Al Pacino eat up everything in sight.
But, at least, that fat ol' slice of sugar-cured gristle had
energy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Meet Joe Black,'' you often wonder why Death made the
effort to drop by in the first place. His work was already done for
him.

OUTBACK FARCE GRATES AS IS GOES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A slice of Australian whimsy that's been left in
the outback sun too long, ``Welcome to Woop Woop'' could well be
the most annoying movie of the year. And remember, this is the same
year they put out ``Night at the Roxbury'' and ``54.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can imagine a Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein ``Road Warrior,''
done very loud and frantically but without, somehow, the least bit
of narrative energy, you have an inkling of how bad ``Woop Woop''
is.
</P>
<P>
   But just an inkling. Mix in unpleasant, hectoring performances,
add purposely (one hopes) ugly sets, costumes and makeup, and then
do the whole thing up as a satiric fable that has something to say
about the divisive issue of kangaroo meat, and just how
relentlessly unpleasant the movie intends to be grows clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least there's some sex. And gratuitousness has never
seemed more necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Johnathon Schaech plays Teddy, an American con man who, for
reasons best left unrepeated, is on the lam Down Under when he
picks up hitchhiker Angie (Susie Porter). There is sex, then lots
more sex (forgive me for harping on this, but it's really the only
good part of the movie). Then the main story kicks in and it's
downhill fast.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy wakes up in Woop Woop, an isolated desert shantytown ruled
with an iron fist by the blusteriest of its congenital eccentrics,
Daddy-O (Rod Taylor). He forces his dirt-encrusted subjects to work
the 'roo-packing plant and listen to endless tape loops of ``South
Pacific.'' Worse, Daddy-O is Terry's new father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Woop Woop'' is brought to us by ``Adventures of Priscilla,
Queen of the Desert'' director Stephan Elliott. It possesses not a
smidgen of that film's wit or charm, nor _ despite the
participation of ``Priscilla's'' Oscar-winning costumer Lizzy
Gardiner _ one appealing outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a good kangaroo suit. What then, I ask you, could
possibly have been the point?

EXPERTS OFFER ANSWERS ABOUT EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LESLIE SOWERS  
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it too late? If unprotected sex or a suspected contraceptive
failure has you worried about unwanted pregnancy, you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no. Emergency contraception can be effective up to
72 hours following unprotected sex. Doctors have long been able to
provide emergency contraception in the form of high dose birth
control pills, but the directions for use were a little
complicated. Now, there is a simple-to-use emergency contraception
kit approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September.
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured by Gynetics, the kit offers step-by-step
instructions, a pregnancy test and four birth control pills
containing high doses of hormones progestin and estrogen. Women can
obtain a kit or a prescription for a kit to keep at home.
</P>
<P>
   While the kit may be simple to use, it hasn't eliminated
considerable confusion surrounding the issue of emergency
contraception, according to family planning providers and experts
who offer answers below.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the pills in the kit induce an abortion? A: No. There is a
difference between emergency contraception and abortion. The pills
will not work if a woman is already pregnant and will not affect a
pregnancy. If used correctly, the pills prevent pregnancy for up to
72 hours after unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Most right-to-life organizations do not oppose the emergency
contraceptive kits because the pills work much like regular birth
control pills, according to Judith DeSarno, president of National
Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association.
</P>
<P>
   If your ethical or religious beliefs oppose contraception in any
form, you would not want to use the kit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do the pills work? A: There is scientific evidence that
they work by preventing or delaying ovulation. There is conjecture
they may also prevent fertilization of an egg, if one has been
released, or cause changes in the lining of the womb that prevent
implantation of an embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't that what the ``abortion pill'' RU-486 does? A: No.
RU-486, taken in combination with a medication that dilates the
cervix, does cause the abortion of an implanted fetus or embryo.
Legal in France and England, RU-486 is awaiting FDA approval in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency contraception kit offers after-sex contraception.
This is possible because of the lag time between sex and pregnancy.
Though many people believe women can become pregnant immediately at
the right time in her cycle, it is actually a matter of days before
pregnancy begins.
</P>
<P>
   This gives the pills time to work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How safe are the pills in the kit? A: The FDA based its
approval of emergency contraception on studies of regular birth
control pills which have been conducted since 1977 with a good
safety record.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about side effects? A: The most commonly reported side
effects are nausea and vomiting that can last for a few hours or a
day or two. Because birth control pills can have potentially
serious side effects, they must be prescribed by a doctor who can
determine if they are safe for you. An emergency contraception pill
combining estrogen and progestin has been in use for more than 13
years in Great Britain. In more than 4 million occasions of use,
only a handful of serious problems have been reported, according to
a New England Journal of Medicine article.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where are the kits available? A: The kits have only been
available for about a month. Consult your doctor or call
888-NOT-2-LATE for a list of five providers close to you.
</P>
<P>
   All Planned Parenthood clinics in the Houston area can supply
the kit for immediate or future use with a regular office visit.
The cost of the kit alone is $40.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the kits cut down on unintended pregnancy and abortion?
A: Family planning advocates believe the kit could reduce the 2.7
million unintended pregnancies that occur each year in the United
States, half of which are due to contraceptive failure. Many women
use condoms, withdrawal, periodic abstinence and diaphragms, all of
which have high failure rates.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the kit, as well as family planning advocates,
have begun open advertising of emergency contraception, possible
for the first time as a result of FDA approval of the new kit. This
should make more women aware that emergency contraception is
available.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, women had to obtain a month's worth of pills from
her doctor and get instructions about which pills to take. This
varies with each manufacturer, and the instructions with the pills
offered no guidance for their use as emergency contraceptives. Only
1 percent of women have used the pills for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get more information about the emergency
contraceptive kit? A: You can call 888-PREVEN2 for answers to your
questions. You can also consult your health care provider.

TACITURN BUT ROMANTIC

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If you haven't heard about ``Williamstowne,''
it's no surprise. It's a small, independent feature that's short on
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five words to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of a deceased young woman who remains bound to her
husband and family by her love for them flows through the music of
British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose romanticized
compositions are a conduit for the emotion that floods this film by
Richard Horian. ``Williamstowne'' took eight years to complete, in
some part because each shot was dictated by the music. Any scene
that ran a mere second long needed to be reshot, as Horian decided
that in no way would the music be slowed down, speeded up or
changed to accommodate the film's running time.
</P>
<P>
   For the actors and crew, it took a variety of techniques to keep
on time. Stopwatches, counting aloud, hand cues and having the
music audible during filming were just a few. On the other side of
the camera, the crew even timed its moves to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williamstowne'' is made in the tradition of highly
romanticized films such as ``Wuthering Heights,'' with long camera
shots that fix on the expressions of the grieving husband, the
heartbroken and aged parents, the New England townspeople who are
touched by what Edgar Allan Poe called the most tragic theme in
literature: the death of a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Only in this, that woman, named Sarah McConaghy, returns each
year on the anniversary of her death. Ten years later, her husband,
Jack, has not moved past the tragedy that claimed his wife and
their unborn child. Her family feels her presence, yet it brings
them little lasting comfort. Flashbacks convey the beauty of
Sarah's life and explain her own reluctance to let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williamstowne'' marries cinematography and soundtrack in a way
that has rarely been experienced by mainstream audiences, and
redefines love as an everlasting bond rather than a physical
experience. This is the kind of date-night movie that will lead
naturally to a latte and conversation afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The film is playing at the General Cinema 7 in Sherman Oaks and
the Laemmle Music Hall Theater in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ALL THINGS ITALIAN: A special presentation of the best Italian
cinema _ new and old _ continues at 6 and 8:15 tonight in Westwood
with ``Radiofreccia,'' which screened at this year's Venice Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Venezia a Hollywood, a new film festival sponsored by the
Roberto Rossellini Foundation, the Italian Cultural Institute and
the Italian Heritage Culture Foundation, concludes at 7:30 p.m.
Saturday with the director's cut of ``Paisan,'' Rossellini's
Academy Award-nominated film from 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Rossellini and Federico Fellini, ``Paisan'' tracks
the nerve-racking experiences of survivors living in Italy during
World War II. In Luciano Ligabue's contemporary ``Radiofreccia,'' a
small-time radio operator falls in love with a drug addict and
plunges into physical and emotional depths as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The screenings are free, but reservations are required; call
(310) 443-3250, Ext. 114. Films will be shown at the Italian
Government Cultural Office, 1023 Hilgard Ave.

FULL THROTTLE WAS THUNDERS' STYLE

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Johnny Thunders made his greatest impact as a
member of proto-punk glam-rockers the New York Dolls in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Later that decade, he played the punk circuit here and abroad as
a member of the Heartbreakers and as a solo act with, shall we say,
a specialized following.
</P>
<P>
   The patron saint of junkies the world over, Thunders was the
poor man's Keith Richards and he lived the cliched rock 'n' roll
lifestyle to the bitter end in a New Orleans boarding house, where
his body was discovered in April 1991. He was 38.
</P>
<P>
   Thunders' incoherent, sloppy and often drunk or drugged
performances were legendary. As they used to say, every Thunders
gig was a farewell show because you never knew when the rodentlike
guitarist-singer was going to keel over for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Thunders is the subject of one of the best-organized
and most heartfelt tributes we've ever seen. The Web's Johnny
Thunders Cyber Lounge
(www.home.echo-on.net/(tilde)ifftay/thunders.htm) offers pictures,
sound files of Thunders' best obscene retorts to hecklers,
articles, details about ex-bandmembers and, best of all, stories
from people who knew the notorious rocker and heroin aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   Thunders wasn't a nice guy and the site doesn't try to paint a
false picture. Always in need of cold, hard cash, Thunders ripped
off, conned and lied to almost everyone he ever met, including
fellow band members, promoters, record companies, pals, girlfriends
and family members.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are all there in the Cyber Lounge and, in the end,
you actually feel a twinge of something for the little rat with the
'50s Les Paul Junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we want to dwell on memories, but in this lounge
that's all we've got,'' says Canada's Chris Ridpath, who put the
Thunders site together and declares it ``sponsor-free and
pleasure-rated.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories, yes, but it's also an unexpectedly sweet place.

IN PRIVATE HOMES, ITINERANT ABORTION PROTESTORS FIND SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life
seems ordinary. She and her family live in a rambling old home on
the shore of Lake Ontario, and every morning, she gives her
husband, John, a peck on the cheek before he goes to work. She runs
errands, like other suburban moms, and spends much of her day
taking care of her children.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing sets Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbors. As a
devoted opponent of abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine
regularly plays host to a series of traveling speakers, priests and
protesters _ many of whom have come to Rochester intent upon
spreading the word against abortion and shutting down clinics that
provide it.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of thousands of people across the country loosely
associated with anti-abortion groups like the Lambs of Christ who
have opened their homes to the Lambs' founder, the Rev. Norman
Weslin, and other itinerant demonstrators. While many _ including
Mrs. Hayes _ disavow violent tactics, supporters of abortion rights
say that people like her bear some responsibility when the
protesters they help blockade clinics or threaten doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people who provide Father Weslin with food and shelter
when he comes into town to close the clinics are not innocent,''
said Ann Glazier, the director of clinic defense for the Planned
Parenthood Federation. ``It's just not credible to say they aren't
part of the extremist activity that is taking place at these
clinics. They are still guilty of interfering with women's
access.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Quinn, a local organizer for the Lambs of Christ who
also offers her home to protesters, sees matters in a differing
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking people in like this is an act of Christian charity,''
Mrs. Quinn said. `People who travel around the country doing this
work are taken in by those of us that who don't want to lose their
stupid houses. We take in these people because they are willing to
make the sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Lambs of Christ have been persistent figures in
protests at the Buffalo women's clinic where Dr. Barnett Slepian
worked before he was shot to death last month. Although no suspect
has been identified in the shooting or in several similar attacks
in New York and Canada over the past several years, officials are
looking to question a Vermont man whose car was seen near Dr.
Slepian's home.
</P>
<P>
   That man, James Charles Kopp, has participated in abortion
protests for more than a decade, and often was a house guest of
other members of the Lambs of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Hayes says she would never so much as obstruct a
clinic's door, some of those to whom she has given refuge have no
qualms about doing so. Weslin, the leader of the Lambs of Christ,
is one of those who has benefited from Mrs. Hayes' hospitality, a
modern version of the generosity that Christ and the Apostles knew
well. He prides himself on being arrested more than 60 times during
protests in front of medical clinics. And throughout the 1980s and
early '90s, he was active in clinic ``rescues,'' in which
protesters tried physically to restrain patients trying to enter
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Weslin stayed at Mrs. Hayes' home only once, beginning in May
1996 when he first came to speak at local churches about the
anti-abortion movement. But during a stay that lasted several
months, he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking access to a
Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed. He was
later convicted and served two and a half months in prison. During
the protest outside the clinic, he and several other protesters
locked themselves in a homemade contraption called ``the oven,''
made of cement and iron. It took police officers several hours to
lug the device to a horse trailer that carted it off. At the same
protest, one man glued his head to a lock on a gate surrounding the
clinic, a move some protesters later said was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of
attending peaceful observances at abortion clinics and offering
prayers for the unborn. They talk about counseling women about
alternatives to abortion at Roman Catholic ``pregnancy centers,''
and their support of anti-abortion candidates. But they also say
they saw nothing wrong with Weslin trying to block access to
clinics. They describe the activity as peaceful resistance meant to
stop what they see as murders.
</P>
<P>
   Weslin and the other house guests of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn
come recommended from friends and members of local Catholic
churches, they said, adding that most are speakers at local
churches or anti-abortion events. And although they say they would
never take into their homes a stranger wanted by the FBI, like
Kopp, they concede that they sometimes know little about their
guests.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn say they know a lot about Weslin.
An Army veteran, he has been a leader of the anti-abortion movement
for more than 25 years, they say, and founded a home for unwed
mothers. Mrs. Hayes said that when she met him, it was obvious he
was a man of peace who ``had a tremendous devotion to the Blessed
Mother and basically recognized that we are helpless lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Fredericks, another local abortion opponent who
developed ties to the Lambs after Weslin came to town, added that
the priest epitomized a man of God. ``I just knew when I looked at
his holy shoes and his simple coat that had been mended 50 times,''
she said. ``He was humble, a man who was doing this for a higher
purpose, trying to save people through sacrifice and prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   opp also has robust defenders among the people who housed him as
he rode about the country from protest to protest. E. Kenny, 20,
said that his parents housed Kopp in their St. Albans, Vt., home
for two years after he spoke at their local church in 1988. During
Kopp's stay, he was a pleasure, Kenny said, always helping around
the house. ``He was a nice guy, kind of like an uncle to us,''
Kenny said. ``He'd sit around and play video games with us and make
us model planes out of wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Weslin, Kopp was consumed by a need to fight abortion and
often talked about its evils, Kenny said, adding that Kopp was a
gentle man who wanted to become a Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always in a good mood,'' Kenny said. ``He never did
anything violent at all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly during
abortion protests. The men have moved in the same circles and at
times found themselves arrested at the same events. Mrs. Quinn said
that Weslin told her in a recent telephone conversation that he
knew Kopp. Weslin could not be reached for comment, but it is clear
that the two men have encountered each other.
</P>
<P>
   Both faced misdemeanor charges after blocking a Burlington, Vt.,
health clinic in 1990 that Kopp called ``the mill.'' And they spent
time in the same jail in Atlanta in 1988 after a clinic protest.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's death has abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs.
Quinn worried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the
media and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs of
Christ. ``For a long time, you felt like the voice in the desert
that wasn't being heard,'' Mrs. Hayes said. ``And then there was
this horrible tragedy of this doctor's death becoming the face of
the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about saving lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has not talked to Mrs. Hayes, but Kenny said that agents
have spoken to him. The Justice Department says that a Federal task
force set up this week to investigate the killing of Slepian is
looking for evidence connecting anti-abortion violence at various
clinics. ``It's fair to say that when investigating these events,
we will look at any connection between individuals engaged in
criminal conduct,'' Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the department,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many local Catholics associated with the Lambs of Christ have
tried to distance themselves from the killing of Slepian. They are
mailing literature saying that the killer does not represent their
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some people associated with the Lambs are offering
other possible explanations for the killing. Some say they believe
that the killer might have been someone overcome by grief after a
personal experience with abortion. Others wondered whether the
shooter had tried to wound the doctor to scare him or prevent him
from performing more abortions. The Lambs also wonder whether
abortionist opponents are being blamed for a shooting committed by
a disgruntled patient.
</P>
<P>
   One idea gaining currency among the Lambs, and prominently
displayed on their Web site, suggests that the killing was the
result of a plot by abortion supporters to discredit abortion
opponents just before last week's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hayes says she doesn't know the truth. ``There are wackos
who travel around and they may be in front of the clinic because we
are drawn to the same place,'' she said. ``But you don't know
everyone who shows up and you don't turn to the person next to you
and tell them they don't belong there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fredericks said that anyone who would shoot a doctor who
provides abortions was someone ``who had snapped, perhaps because
of the importance of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of abortion
in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder
their efforts. When Weslin first arrived two years ago, he brought
new focus to a group that often had done little more than counsel
pregnant women and set up booths on college campuses, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cities, they have a priest for life coordinating and
leading rosary marches'' against abortion, Mrs. Quinn said. ``But
with Father Weslin coming here, we could finally come together and
feel like we were doing something sacrificial as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hayes said that she felt the first pull of the movement in
the early 1980s, when she heard women speak about ``choice'' in
regard to abortion. Then she saw ``Silent Scream,'' a well-known
anti-abortion film that purports to show the footage of an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was the end of life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She began to volunteer at a Catholic pregnancy center where she
encouraged women ``not to kill their child.'' She also began to
house unwed mothers and went to stand vigil outside local clinics
where abortions were performed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hayes looked at her 3-month-old daughter, Bernadette, then
pointed to the prenatal image of the infant, a sonogram taken at 13
weeks that she keeps on her refrigerator door. She described what
could have been her baby's fate, had she been someone else's child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two pounds and two inches ago, she could have been a
partial-birth abortion,'' Mrs. Hayes said, referring to a
controversial late-term abortion procedure. ``They have the hardest
time getting the shoulders out, so they can get to the head and
puncture it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brutal, but what do you expect when the purpose is a dead
baby? There's no question that these doctors are trying to murder a
child.''

CARDIGANS/``Gran Turismo'' (Mercury)
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of this melancholy Swedish quintet's fourth album is
borrowed from a video game the musicians played during breaks in
recording sessions. But there's nothing artificial about much of
this heartfelt music that owes something to the trip-hop musings of
Tricky and Portishead. Folks who only know the Cardigans and its
pop diva Nina Persson from last year's smash ``Lovefool'' will
especially appreciate tuneful standouts such as ``My Favorite
Game,'' ``Marvel Hill'' and the glimmering ``Higher.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
B.B. KING/``Blues on the Bayou'' (MCA)
</P>
<P>
   One of B.B.'s better recent efforts _ thank goodness there are
no duets here _ the new disc finds the blues king writing many of
these choice cuts and playing with a fire we haven't witnessed in
many a moon. The swampy feel, down-home production and top-notch
instrumentation places ``Blues on the Bayou'' among B.B.'s best of
the decade. 3 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GANG OF FOUR/``100 Flowers Bloom'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   It's been said the late, great Gang of Four finished the job the
Sex Pistols started. Formed in 1977 in Leeds, England, the
university-educated Gang melded the abrasive urgency of punk rock
with the raw emotion of dub reggae along with post-Marxist lyrical
concerns such as ``the problem of leisure.'' The influential
quartet's rhythms were stripped-down and jagged, while song titles
sounded like political manifestos: ``At Home He's a Tourist,''
``Damaged Goods,'' ``It's Her Factory,'' ``To Hell With Poverty''
and ``Love Like Anthrax.'' Meanwhile, catchy choruses such as
``please send me evenings and weekends'' channeled the desires and
fears of the faceless laborer. This recommended two-CD package
collects some of Go4's best work along with 12-inch mixes and
alternate takes. Two decades on and this stuff still has the power
to change lives. 4 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FAMOUS MONSTERS/``In the Night!!!'' (Bong Load)
</P>
<P>
   Sean Yseult, former bassist with the now-defunct White Zombie,
fronts this fully costumed female surf band as lead guitarist. The
trio, which appears Dec. 2 at the Viper Room, proves Halloween can
stick around all year if you have the right attitude. Yseult and
her garish pals definitely do. Noisy trash-rock at its most
pungent. 2 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PORTISHEAD/``Go Beat'' (London)
</P>
<P>
   With just two albums under their belt, you might argue it's too
soon for a live album, but this pioneering trip-hop outfit is
obviously hitting while the iron's hot. Taped over the summer
mostly in New York, the welcome ``Roseland NYC Live'' finds sultry
songstress Beth Gibbons and predictably gloomy company stretching
out on such familiar mood pieces as ``Sour Times'' and ``Glory
Box'' from the debut album and ``Half Day Closing'' and ``Only
You'' from the second. Great, atmospheric stuff. 3 { Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPHERE/``Sphere'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1979 to honor the memory of Thelonious Monk, Sphere
has grown to include self-penned tunes in its set. On this
eponymous new album, the quartet _ saxophonist Gary Bartz, pianist
Kenny Barron, bassist Buster Williams and ex-Monk group drummer
drummer Ben Riley _ covers Strayhorn and Rodgers &AMP; Hammerstein
while serving up a nice portion of original post-bop material. A
top-notch straight-ahead blowing session. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HERBIE HANCOCK/``Gershwin's World'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Another week, another nod to George Gershwin on the centenary of
his birth. Hancock's album, though, is a worthwhile addition and
one of the more ambitious tributes offered to the legendary
composer. The celebrated pianist enlists a varied supporting cast _
contributors include Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and Kathleen
Battle as well as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and jazz greats
Wayne Shorter, Kenny Garrett and Eddie Henderson _ who give
inspired readings to the music of Gershwin and the artists who
inspired him. Thus, along with lovely readings of standards like
``Summertime'' and ``The Man I Love,'' you can hear songs by W.C.
Handy, Duke Ellington and Ravel's G Major Concerto. While the
unifying themes don't always hold together during the album's 14
cuts, the playing is always adventuresome and creative. 3 Stars. &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
STAN GETZ/``What the World Needs Now _ Stan Getz Plays Bacharach
and David'' (Verve) 2 Stars. &QL; 
ASTRUD GILBERTO AND WALTER WANDERLY/``A Certain Smile, A Certain
Sadness'' (Verve) 3 Stars.
</P>
<P>
   These two low-priced albums are part of Verve's ``By Request''
series, which resuscitates titles that have been long out of print.
Both albums bear the distinct imprint of the '60s heydey when bossa
nova and Burt Bacharach were wafting out of hi-fi stereos across
the nation. The pairing of wispy vocalist Gilberto with Wanderley's
rich, harmonic keyboards hits all the right notes in a program that
combines Brazilian favorites with pop tunes. Saxophonist Getz, of
course, made several famous Brazilian albums with Gilberto, works
that are counted among the greatest in jazz history. He doesn't
have the same luck with the Bacharach sound, mostly because of the
tepid orchestral arrangements that overwhelm his playing. Still,
there are moments like during the sultry ``The Look of Love'' when
Getz's skill prevails and you're inspired to hook up the lava lamp
and sway across the room with a loved one. &QL;

`I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER': AN EMPTY, FARCICAL
BLOODBATH
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some things to expect in a horror movie sequel: a higher body
count, cruder shock effects, louder screams, vanishing credibility
and loss of narrative coherence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' conforms depressingly
to type. The follow-up to the phenomenally successful ``I Know What
You Did Last Summer'' is an empty, farcical blood bath that's
virtually shock-free except for one preposterous plot twist. What
is that ominous thudding sound inside the giant clothes dryer? You
know what it is without even having to open the door. Maybe one of
the kicks of a movie this bad is feeling you're ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original film was no horror classic, its portrait of
four North Carolina teen-agers hunted by the victim of a supposedly
fatal hit-and-run accident for which they were responsible produced
a tingle of recognition. Which of us hasn't at one time or another
been so haunted by a guilty secret that we entertain paranoid
fantasies of imminent cosmic payback? And Jennifer Love Hewitt, as
Julie James, the most conscience-stricken of the four, made
quivering, teary-eyed guilt seem almost attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know'' finds Julie (Ms. Hewitt once again) still so
obsessed with the past that she is having a fresh hallucination
every two or three minutes. When her college roommate Karla (pop
singer Brandy) wins a weekend trip to the Bahamas for herself and
three friends, Julie jumps at the opportunity to go, even though it
means leaving behind her boyfriend, Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who
has to work. Besides, Brandy, who takes along her sassy boyfriend,
Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), is pushing a romance between Julie and Will
(Matthew Settle), a clean-cut classmate also on the trip, who has a
big crush on Julie. Who knows what could blossom between the two
while lounging side by side in a tropical paradise?
</P>
<P>
   But almost as soon as they arrive on Fourth of July weekend at a
deserted hotel on a remote island where a hurricane is brewing,
Julie's nightmares start coming true. It isn't long before her
phantom avenger trudges into view wearing his trademark black rain
slicker and wielding his trademark fishhook, ready to slash to
ribbons anyone standing in his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' isn't the end of the
line for the series (a third movie is already in the works), but it
deserves to be.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one more thing: If you should win a contest by answering
that the capital of Brazil is Rio de Janeiro (which it isn't),
think twice before deciding to collect your reward. Someone could
be playing a very dirty trick.

CALL IT `I'LL BE CLINCHED FOR CHRISTMAS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; 'Tis the season for sappy movies.
</P>
<P>
   And, this year's entry in the
finding-the-true-meaning-of-Christmas flick merges with another
overused genre _ the road comedy _ and produces expected results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' which stars Jonathan Taylor
Thomas as a self-absorbed college student who has no use for his
stepmother, is so cliche-ridden that it's tough to tell where one
ends and the next one begins.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts at a western university, where Jake (Thomas)
establishes his scheming ways. His first move is to trade in the
first-class plane ticket his father sent him for two tickets to
Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Jake, it seems, thought that his girlfriend Allie (Jessica Biel)
would love the trip to the tropic port. But he finds out that she
wants to go home for the holiday, and when his father (Gary Cole)
is willing to bribe him with a vintage Porsche to come home to
upscale Westchester, N.Y., he quickly morphs into the Christmas
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated (at the time) event, Jake's plans to help the
football team cheat on an exam go awry, and team members seek
revenge. It comes in the form of gluing a Santa suit on Jake and
leaving him stranded in the middle of the desert.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that these football players, and all of the
college students in the film, look way too young. That is because
the movie was intended to be set at a prep school, but test
audiences did not grasp the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Jake arrives late to pick up Allie, and she ends up driving
cross country with Jake's nemesis, Eddie (Adam Lavorgna), who is
trying to steal her away.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film is spent with Jake trying to catch up to
Eddie and Allie and get home in time for Christmas dinner.
</P>
<P>
   When he hits the road, he encounters a series of the standard
wackos including the over-the-top convict guy who picks him up
hitchhiking, the unusual policeman and the cantankerous bus driver.
All the while he has more failed travel plans than the gang on
``Gilligan's Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Jake lies, connives and uses his charm to try to
get home.
</P>
<P>
   His epiphany comes in a small town where he happens upon a race
for guys in Santa suits. Jake enters, and narrowly outruns the
town's mayor (Ian Robison), winning enough money to get home in
time to get the pink slip of the red sports car.
</P>
<P>
   However, when he finds out that the mayor usually wins the race
and forwards the proceeds to needy people, Jake's conscience
emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Not to ruin the ending, but Jake learns some valuable lessons on
the road, and is a better person for it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of funny moments in the movie, such as when
Jake hands out stolen household appliances to sick children in a
hospital. Fans of Thomas will enjoy watching him in this role, but
as a whole there is nothing in ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' that
you never have seen before. &UR;

POLAR OPPOSITES STILL ATTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``Armageddon'' and ``The Horse Whisperer,'' two
films you're not likely to see on a double bill in a revival house,
are out this week on video. They represent the good and bad of
Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   One is a palatable action film with humor and smart special
effects but is cartoonish, punctuated with silly dialogue, and
substitutes slam-bam editing and cranked-up sound for substance.
The other is a sensitive drama with some fine acting, but is too
long and too often relies on intense looks and shots of pretty
landscapes to bring home its story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Horse Whisperer,'' which was directed by and stars Robert
Redford, is the better film and an improvement on Nicholas Evans'
best-selling novel of the same name. Redford plays a cowboy who
talks to horses as a method of training and healing them. This as
opposed to the normal method of ``breaking'' them.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Scott Thomas is a top magazine editor who feels
estranged from her husband, Sam Neill. Her life is turned
upside-down when her daughter, Scarlett Johansson, is injured in a
horseback riding accident that kills her friend and maims her
horse. Johansson is traumatized, and Thomas decides to take her and
the horse to see Redford, hoping the trip will help restore her
daughter's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant Redford, who is living with the family of his
sister (Dianne Wiest), takes them in. Soon, an attraction develops
between Thomas and Redford. In lesser hands, all of this could
become terribly maudlin or soap opera-ish, but Redford (``A River
Runs Through It,'' ``Ordinary People'') deftly avoids most
pitfalls. Some scenes are overly long, though, among them panoramas
with lonely figures against the wide-open spaces that add little to
the emotional and intellectual content of the film.
</P>
<P>
   But other scenes are lyrical or poignant, and there is nothing
wrong with taking your time. Redford does so in creating a rhythm
that adds resonance to such moments as when he takes Thomas
horseback riding, or at a country-western dance or when he's
working with the horses.
</P>
<P>
   And while these scenes are powerful and moving, it's easy for
filmgoers and critics to dismiss the whole film as being too long
or pretentious because the scenes often are bracketed by lesser
moments.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because many big-name directors usually get carte
blanche power and sometimes lack perspective on their material. (A
hit or two in Tinseltown can lead to a swelled head, and some
talented filmmakers are legendary for their overindulgences.)
Redford, though, is one of the lesser offenders, and ``The Horse
Whisperer'' is well worth renting.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is that Hollywood has been spoon-feeding
audiences far too long, and now it doesn't trust them to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing is the fact that even intelligent
filmmakers, when involved with big commercial works, seem to make
such concessions. This is not unexpected, of course, but it becomes
a self-fulfilling premise: Dumb down the plot and after a while
you're only making dumbed-down films.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Armageddon,'' a film that you can take at
face value because it's that deep. Now don't get me wrong. It's
fine for the roller coaster ride it is _ not the best one you've
ever been on, but it still goes up and down and has some twists.
The question is whether that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it was for a lot of people. The
asteroid-hitting-the-Earth film was the biggest hit of the summer,
taking in some $192 million domestically. There's not much new in
``Armageddon.'' The plot revolves around a group of offshore
oil-well drillers led by Bruce Willis who are recruited by NASA to
save the world. It's a time-tested premise to have a bunch of
social outcasts as heroes _ ``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The Wild
Bunch,'' ``The Dirty Dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to instill humor in stories like these by playing off
the characters' weird personalities, especially when you have the
king of the offbeat character actors, Steve Buscemi, in the cast.
He alone is almost worth the price of admission to any movie he's
in, including this one.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is injecting any real emotion into the story.
Willis spends most of the movie disapproving of his rebellious
daughter's (Liv Tyler) love affair with his young protege (Ben
Affleck) because he doesn't want her marrying a roughneck like him.
Never mind that the world is going to end. What comes out of this
relationship is sappier than anything in ``The Horse Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   But director Michael Bay (``Bad Boys,'' ``The Rock'') is good at
keeping the action rolling, and the special effects are snazzy. So,
if you don't mind a preposterous plot and a lack of real
characters, ``Armageddon'' will do fine _ and it has Steve Buscemi.

`TEN BENNY': A HEEL OF A SHOE SALESMAN CAN'T EXPECT A LAST LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unfortunate title of Eric Bross' first feature film, ``Ten
Benny,'' is a slang term for the alleged shoe size of Paul Newman.
Oh, don't ask why. It's not worth getting into, other than to note
that the movie's leading character, Ray (Adrien Brody), is
miserable in his dead-end job working in a shoe store in
Bloomfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The only son of a petty mobster who a decade earlier spent a
year in jail after being caught operating an illegal casino out of
his suburban basement, Ray lives at home with his father, Ray Sr.
(Frank Vincent), who now ekes out a living running a home-repair
business.
</P>
<P>
   Hotheaded and foulmouthed, Ray is forever squabbling with Joanne
(Sybil Temchen), his girlfriend of three years, who works as a
waitress while waiting for Ray to propose marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Benny,'' which is narrated by Ray's best friend, Mike
(Michael Gallagher), is the story of Ray's last-minute attempt to
score enough money gambling at the racetrack to set himself up in
business.
</P>
<P>
   The moment he borrows $10,000 from a menacing mobster, Donny
(James E. Moriarty), Ray begins a humiliating and utterly
predictable downward spiral that finds him taking increasingly
desperate measures to pay back the money, which he loses in a
colossally misplaced bet.
</P>
<P>
   Before he hits bottom, Ray has been beaten up more than once and
betrayed by his best friend. He mopes through much of the last
third of the movie sporting a black eye.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a shred of dialogue in ``Ten Benny'' that doesn't
sound exactly like that found in a dozen other films about
working-class Italian-American life, nor is there a character who
doesn't seem entirely stereotypical.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie succeeds in feeling real, the reality it portrays
seems stale and rehashed. None of the issues it explores _
father-son conflict, the testing of friendship, working-class
machismo _ is examined more than superficially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Benny,'' which opens Friday at the Angelika Film Center,
has one notable asset in Brody, a gifted performer who bears an
astonishing physical resemblance to the equally talented French
actor Gregoire Colin.
</P>
<P>
   Brody doesn't stint on nastiness. His wiry, gimlet-eyed Ray is a
thoroughly disagreeable package of puffed-up self-delusion
programmed for puncture. At the slightest hint of frustration, the
character goes ballistic, becoming so disgustingly abusive to his
girlfriend that you can hardly wait for him to get his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Benny'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It includes violence, abundant profanity and
one sex scene.
</P>

`I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS': ALL I WANT IS A PORSCHE AND A
PURPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the good part about ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'': It's
short.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the dangerous part: If you've never had the urge to kick
Santa Claus, this might be just the irksome misadventure into
comedy that will drive you over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Santa comes in the form of a smug, smarmy
collegian named Jake. As written by Harris Goldberg and Tom Nursall
and directed by Arlene Sanford, ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' asks
of its audience something even more difficult than believing in Old
Saint Nick or the Easter Bunny: It asks the audience to believe
that Jake, an obnoxious twit played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas of
``Home Improvement,'' undergoes some sort of metamorphosis as he
makes his way cross-country from California to his home in
Larchmont, N.Y., at Christmas break while glued inside a Santa
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Those who saute their brains for five minutes in the butter
machine before entering the theater may achieve sufficient
softening to accomplish this feat, but others may find it more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Why has Jake been glued inside a Santa suit and left in the
California desert? One of Jake's sidelines is arranging for jocks
to cheat on their exams by providing them with pagers that can
receive the answers, but his nemesis, Eddie (Adam LaVorgna), foils
the scheme, and Jake is punished.
</P>
<P>
   Although less serious than disruption of the Middle East oil
supply, this setback has repercussions: (1) Jake may not make it
home to Westchester by 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, the deadline for
his father's bribe, a classic red Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet-like, Jake has been avoiding home because he thinks Dad
married in unseemly haste after Mom's death. (2) Jake's girlfriend,
Allie (Jessica Biel), a young woman tolerant of Jake to the point
of idiocy, has to accept a ride from college to Larchmont with
Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   The egocentric Jake lies, cheats, steals, and gives and accepts
bribes. Eddie, who frequently refers to himself in the third
person, as in Ed Man, is like Jake, only dumber.
</P>
<P>
   Superficial and defined mainly by their hair, teeth and smiles,
Jake, Eddie and Allie are not exactly the most engaging companions
for a cross-country journey.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, while their paths cross occasionally, Jake hitches a
ride with some old ladies bound for a Tom Jones performance in Las
Vegas; rides in a van loaded with stolen goods, which he eventually
distributes in a children's ward; encounters a lovelorn state
trooper, and reconciles him with his wife at a steak restaurant
called Turf &AMP; Turf; runs a five-kilometer race with other Santa
Clauses, and returns the $1,000 prize so it can be used to feed the
needy, and bursts in on Eddie and Allie in the honeymoon suite of a
Bavarian-theme hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the spirits behind ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' treat
the audience to vomit in the back of the old ladies' car and a
flatulent dog, they make nothing of the comic possibilities of the
lederhosen crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Brooks, where are you when we need you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' is rated PG (Parental guidance
suggested). It contains some mildly vulgar language.

OTHER BALLETS DRAWN FROM AMERICAN LIFE, TRADITIONS

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The era that inspired Steinbeck, Faulkner, Copland, Thomas Hart
Benton and Grant Wood to examine American life and traditions in
prose, music and painting also inspired numerous ballets with
boldly American subject matter:
</P>
<P>
   ``Alma Mater'' (1935), with music of Morton Gould and Kay Swift,
was an early attempt by Russian-born choreographer George
Balanchine to capture American subject matter, with the setting of
a college football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pocahontas'' (1936), with music by Elliott Carter and
choreography by Lew Christensen, both still in their 20s, drew on
American folk legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filling Station'' (1938), choreographed by Christensen to
music of Virgil Thomson, featured truck drivers, a gangster, and a
gas-station attendant, Mac, as the hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy the Kid'' (1938), choreographed by Eugene Loring, was
the first of composer Aaron Copland's immortal triptych of
Americana-inspired ballet scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodeo'' (1942), although not the first of the genre, was set
to Copland's score and defined the trend through Agnes de Mille's
use of folk and popular dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalachian Spring'' (1944), the greatest ballet in the
Americana genre, found Copland composing his third great ballet
score, this time for Martha Graham, resulting in a powerful,
evocative paean to American frontier life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fancy Free'' (1944) described the adventures of three sailors
on shore leave, with music by the young Leonard Bernstein and
choreography by Jerome Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fall River Legend'' (1948), choreographed by de Mille to the
music of Gould, turned to the lurid true story of ax-murder suspect
Lizzie Borden for its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western Symphony'' (1954), Balanchine's cowboy ballet,
answered the success of ``Rodeo'' with traditional western ballads
cast in symphonic form by composer Hershy Kay.

`EIGHT': A MONARCH WHO MARRIED FREQUENTLY, BUT NOT WELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Very few actors could pull off a one-man show about
Henry VIII, much less a one-man musical. Richard Burton, probably,
with his ``Camelot'' voice, but not many others. Steeve Arlen,
however, comes very close in ``Eight! Henry VIII, That Is!,'' and
he does it on the tiny, bare stage of the Tribeca Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Arlen (who reportedly spells his given name with the double e on
the advice of a numerologist) is a large man with a powerful,
kingly stance and a kingly Welsh voice. Dressed in a purple robe,
he proceeds in 90 minutes or so to review Henry's life, which means
primarily his six marriages, with 15 musical numbers in a motley
assortment of styles.
</P>
<P>
   In the love songs to the wives, Arlen sounds something like
Robert Goulet. In ``Cromwell's Report,'' when he sings, ``There was
something rotten blowing in from Rome,'' he seems to be
impersonating Louis Armstrong. The accompaniment to ``No Entrado,''
a lament about the king's first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon,
sounds as if it were being played by a traditional guitarist in a
Mexican restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Arlen, who starred in ``La Cage aux Folles'' on Broadway in the
mid-1980s, has a grand voice, and the songs of ``Eight!,'' which he
wrote with Donald Eugster, are pleasant if unmemorable. But you
could cut every song (please) and have a powerful one-man drama.
Arlen is touching, witty and thoroughly convincing in the role of
Henry, a chronically unhappy monarch who nonetheless never suffered
from a shortage of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   When he mourns the death of Thomas More, his regret seems
genuine. (``I lost a dear friend. But I was a king. It had to be
done.'') Too bad he had to behead someone he liked. The notorious
Henry seems truly alive onstage; very possibly insane, but
believably so.
</P>
<P>
   Arlen wrote the play as well, with a winning combination of the
lyrical (``I was drunk with the promise of Anne,'' referring to his
second wife, Anne Boleyn); the knowingly humorous (``For those of
us keeping score, that is two down and four to go,'' after he
describes Anne's beheading), and the deliberately contemporary (``I
thought my dad was going to have a fit'').
</P>
<P>
   In the scene in which Henry arrives at Parliament, drunk, Arlen
goes into the aisles and interacts with the audience. Where lesser
men would falter, he holds character with royal sureness.
</P>
<P>
   But why he chooses to make his entrance as Henry VIII shouting
about his chamber pot, and then turns his back to the audience and
simulates urination, is a mystery. Maybe the idea is to humanize
Henry from the beginning, but the device is offputting and

`HARD CORE LOGO': ROCKERS BULLYING AND SQUABBLING DOWN MEMORY
LANE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review)

<P>
   ``Hard Core Logo,'' a more straight-faced punk-rock descendant
of ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' follows a fictional band from Vancouver
on its chaotic, self-destructive farewell tour across western
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike ``Spinal Tap,'' which cast a comically jaundiced eye
on every nuance of the heavy-metal life style, this clever mock
documentary, which opens Friday at the Screening Room, blends
satire and sentiment in a way that keeps you emotionally off
balance.
</P>
<P>
   For every suggestion that it is poking fun at the punk-rock
esthetic (onstage, the bullying, alcoholic lead singer Joe Dick
spits in the faces of his fellow band members), there are stronger
hints that the movie, handsomely photographed by Danny Nowak,
aspires to be a kind of romantic elegy to the punk-rock movement.
</P>
<P>
   As Hard Core Logo makes its way across the prairie, shots of its
battered tour bus rolling through the farmland convey a mood of
grand desolation. What does punk rock and its esthetic of defiance
have to do with this landscape, you wonder? And what's to become of
its four contentious rock rebels who are already well into their
30s?
</P>
<P>
   This melancholy atmosphere seeps into the scenes of the band's
backstage squabbles, most of which revolve around the embattled
relationship of the band's leader and prime mover, Joe (Hugh
Dillon), and his lead guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith
Rennie).
</P>
<P>
   Billy, who is waiting to hear whether he will be officially
invited to join a big-time Los Angeles band, has temporarily
rejoined Hard Core Logo. But once he's on board, Joe pressures him
into promising not to leave. The movie toys with the possibility of
a sexual relationship between the two but nervously backs off from
investigating further.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the fractious foursome are its bassist John (John
Pyper-Ferguson), a stammering manic-depressive on lithium who keeps
a journal of the tour, and Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson), its loutish
fun-loving drummer.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, a movie like ``Hard Core Logo'' demands a certain
credibility. And until the scene in which the group visits an
English punk legend, Bucky Haight (Julian Richings), the movie
feels real enough. But the idea that this gaunt, angry living
legend would retire to an isolated farmhouse in the Canadian
heartland is ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   When Bucky and the members of Hard Core Logo take a collective
LSD trip that feels like a flashback to ``Easy Rider,'' the film
becomes derailed. By the time the movie comes back on track for a
nasty final scene, the game of ``is it or isn't it real''
hide-and-seek has long been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard Core Logo'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and one scene of
violence.

`MONDAY AFTER THE MIRACLE': A ONE-LAYERED LOOK AT HELEN KELLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Helen Keller were alive today, she would probably have her
own daytime talk show. That is one of the messages of ``Monday
After the Miracle,'' a CBS movie to be seen on Sunday night. The
other message is that sometimes a relationship between two people
is too close to let anyone else share it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems significant that the first words spoken aloud by Keller
(Moira Kelly) in this movie are ``How much?'' The question is
directed to a man from The Ladies' Home Journal who has read her
essays and has turned up at her home to persuade her to write a
series of articles for the magazine. Annie Sullivan (Roma Downey),
her tireless teacher, has just told the man that Keller, who is a
full-time student at Radcliffe College, simply doesn't have the
time to take on the project. But when he answers the question with
``$3,000,'' a nice little bundle at the turn of the last century,
Keller quickly speaks her next line: ``I'll find the time.'' (This
is a grossly sentimental movie posing as irreverent.)
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that later in the film, when a
vaudeville agent approaches the women, stressing that even the
distinguished poet Carl Sandburg is doing vaudeville now, and that
they can earn enough money in one year to last them five, they are
soon packing their prettiest dresses and going on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teacher's hands touched the darkness of my mind,'' Keller
testifies to an enraptured theater audience, ``and I awoke to the
gladness of life. I am not dumb now.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people use the word dumb these days to refer to an inability
to speak, but most viewers know Keller's story well. It has been
told in William Gibson's 1960 play, ``The Miracle Worker,'' and in
the 1962 film of that play, which starred Anne Bancroft as Sullivan
and Patty Duke, then 16, as Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Keller was born in Tuscumbia, Ala., in 1880 and lost both her
sight and her hearing during an illness 19 months later. When she
was 7, uncommunicative and often violent, Sullivan was brought from
a school for the blind in Boston to try to teach her some means of
connection to the world. The method: sign language, with the
speaker's hand in the palm of the listener. Sullivan succeeded
beyond all expectations, and Keller became a beloved public figure
and an inspiring advocate for the blind and the deaf until her
death in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday After the Miracle'' looks at the period of Keller's
life that transformed her again, from private citizen to star, and
that settled the question of her personal life once and for all.
The film focuses on Sullivan's marriage to John Macy (Bill
Campbell), a relationship strained to the breaking point by her
emotional bond with Keller, and on Keller's own romance, which was
discouraged strongly by her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``That love will turn to duty,'' Keller's mother warns the young
man, ``and duty will turn to resentment.'' And soon Helen is
waiting, like Catherine Sloper in ``Washington Square,'' for her
lover to whisk her away in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The real miracle in Keller's life, apparently, was that love
never turned to duty for Annie Sullivan. This one-layered film
never gets beyond the surface of that phenomenon, but at least it
makes the point.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shared Experience has long been in the business of
compressing novels for the stage, and as with the product of any
boutique operation of distinction, the craftsmanship shows. Paying
its first visit to New York, the 23-year-old, London theater
company has brought a worthy, finely honed adaptation of Tolstoy's
``Anna Karenina'' that thoroughly engages the imagination, even if
it doesn't do quite as much for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour production, performed with only a few well-chosen
props on the bare stage of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic
Theater, is guided with such intelligence by Nancy Meckler and
performed with such discipline by the eight-member cast that the
pitfalls in reducing a voluminous 19th-century Russian novel to two
cogent acts ultimately seem secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Working from Helen Edmundson's psychologically sophisticated
script, the director and her actors seize on the darker elements in
the characters' natures _ Anna's self-destructive longings,
Karenin's coldness, Vronsky's vanity, Levin's fatalism _ to infuse
this ``Anna Karenina,'' and the marital infidelity at its core,
with an omnipresent sense of Anna's doom.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe's hallmark is its Spartan performance style; as
adapters of Russian epics go, Shared Experience is the anti-David
Lean. The actors, uniformly excellent, divide 18 roles, as the
action shifts from St. Petersburg to Moscow to Italy and back again
to Russia. Props are limited to wooden chairs, used most originally
to simulate the bustles of ball gowns, and to suitcases, carried on
constantly by cast members, that are as likely to contain fog, snow
or grain as scarves or trousers.
</P>
<P>
   The style is not as revolutionary as it may have once seemed,
but it's hard to imagine a company executing it with more aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive than the sparing use of scenery, though, is the
generous application of movement to express a mood, a plot twist, a
theme. Ms. Meckler, for instance, whips up a steamy encounter
between Anna, played by Teresa Banham, and her lover, Vronsky
(Derek Riddell) in the midst of a day at the races. The seduction
is both riveting and erotic, their lovemaking undulating to the
rhythm of the horse race: their passion runs with the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The physically revealing moments can be as fleeting and precise
as the one in which plain, burned-out Dolly (Karen Ascoe) slips out
of a bulky housedress to become the lithe and beguiling maiden of
20 years earlier, or as pivotal and harrowing as the concluding
tableau in which Anna throws herself under the train, her twisting
body spun by the actors portraying the engine. The second-act
opening, when Vronsky and Karenin circle the distraught Anna in a
kind of competitive pas de trois, is perhaps the most thrilling
evocation of this technique.
</P>
<P>
   Unifying these compelling moments in ways that transform a novel
into stageworthy spectacle is no easy task. Ms. Edmundson gives the
play over equally to the stories of Anna, the restless wife, and
Levin (Richard Hope), the rich landowner in agony over his love for
Kitty (Pooky Quesnel). This parallel structure allows for an
ingenious device; Anna and Levin, who meet only once, take stock of
one another across time and space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you now?'' they ask each other, in scene after
scene. The question is above all else an existential one. Anna and
Levin are absolutists whose quests for happiness are waylaid by
spiritual and moral ambiguity. In the interior worlds that this
``Anna Karenina'' seeks to lay bare, we're meant to witness each
step and misstep they take, as if gathering evidence for our own
post-mortem on their tragic progress.
</P>
<P>
   As Anna, Ms. Banham has a porcelain beauty that can at times
seem fragile and at others unbreakable. She lends an appealing
sense of mystery to the portrayal of a woman whose motives and
desires are otherwise never much in doubt. Physically, she's well
matched with the balletic Vronsky of Riddell, although he remains a
curiously cursory figure here.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, who may spark a flicker of recognition among ``Brideshead
Revisited'' fans as the doltish enlisted man, Hooper, under Jeremy
Irons' charge, delivers a deft portrait of the conflicted Levin.
Among the other players, Ian Gelder's proper Karenin and Ms.
Ascoe's hapless Dolly are vivid bystanders to the unfolding
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The technical accomplishments of this ``Anna Karenina'' are
nearly faultless. The production's power to draw one in, however,
is limited. So much care and thought has gone into the stagecraft
that it's disconcerting to discover that the piece doesn't have
much of a soul, Russian or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   This may simply be a shortcoming of the difficult conversion of
literary epic to the stage. But even so, Shared Experience does
what it does so well, you're left eager to discover what else the
company keeps in its library.

`RIVER RED': FRATERNAL LOYALTY, BUT IN VAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A combination of strong acting and missing substructure turn
``River Red'' into a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   A grim portrait of brotherhood, brutality and the psychological
consequences of guilt, this film is written and directed by Eric
Drilling, who adapted it from his one-act play about two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   On the screen as in the theater, where he was the director, Tom
Everett Scott inhabits the pivotal role of Dave Holden, the elder
of two brothers living with their alcoholic, sadistic father in a
bleak New Hampshire town.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons never clarified and barely hinted at, the father
(Denis O'Hare) beats the younger brother, Tom (David Moscow), from
childhood on.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as the violence continues, Dave takes matters into
his own hands. One night, as Father lies sleeping beside his liquor
bottles, Dave stabs him to death.
</P>
<P>
   Tom, a sharper mind, decides to confess to the killing to save
Dave from an adult prison term. So while Tom goes to a juvenile
home for a few years until he reaches 21, Dave drifts into
tormented dysfunction. Jobless, disassociated from Tom, befriended
only by a sympathetic young woman (Cara Buono), he begins to
resemble his father.
</P>
<P>
   He drinks heavily, grows more physically violent and eventually
turns to armed robbery of convenience stores to support himself.
</P>
<P>
   And when Tom is released from his punishment for a crime he
never committed, the stage is set for a release of volatile
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pace slows at times, the leading and supporting
roles are well performed. Steven Schlueter, a co-producer who is
also the director of photography, ably evokes the isolation of the
area where the brothers live, and a score by Johnny Hickman of the
group Cracker enhances the action.
</P>
<P>
   But given the strong psychological elements of the story visible
on screen, ``River Red'' incites a yearning to know more of
father's motivations and more of Tom's life while incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``River Red'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent
or adult guardian). It contains scenes of bloody murder and some
foul language.

ART REVIEW: FROM A RIGID CULTURE TO A FLOATING WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of the 20th century, the art world is
paying close attention to the 19th century, as if probing to see
what reflections and cautionary predictions it might reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian painting is enjoying a vogue. Retrospectives of worthy
footnote-ish figures like Gustave Moreau and John Singer Sargent
will be arriving in New York. Among young contemporary artists,
academic figuration is being stylishly retooled.
</P>
<P>
   The interest extends to non-Western cultures as well. Late
Persian art, which practically no one has seriously looked at for
years, is making a splash at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. And this
Sunday, an ambitious exhibition devoted to the art of the Edo
period in Japan (1615-1868) will open at the National Gallery in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Edo era (Edo is the original name for Tokyo) and the 20th
century weren't chronologically contiguous. But modern Japan _ the
nation of megacities and entrepreneurial acumen, of a brash popular
culture and tenaciously held traditions _ was basically an Edo
creation.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington show, organized by Robert Singer, curator of
Japanese art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is drawn
almost exclusively from Japanese collections. It is a big show,
though it doesn't feel that way. The 300 objects, ranging from
painted screens to samurai swords, ceramics to theater costumes,
Buddhist sculptures to woodblock prints, are inventive, virtuosic
and often just plain beautiful enough to keep the eye enthralled
from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   That said, anyone hoping for sheer razzle-dazzle _ a major hit
of gilded surfaces, say, or the kind of tumultuous ornamentation
found at the funerary complex of Nikko, an over-the-top Japanese
chinoiserie _ may be disappointed. Ostentation has been played
down. Only a few flamboyant rimpa screens are included. And because
the show has been organized by theme rather than by types of
objects, the sort of impact that a roomful of painted silk Noh
robes can deliver has been forfeited.
</P>
<P>
   But the compensations are considerable. Singer's quieter,
textured approach gives a sense of the variety and ingenuity of an
art. And it tells the story of a culture that changed shape
dramatically over two centuries as it kept one foot in the feudal
past, the other edging toward the modern future.
</P>
<P>
   The period began when the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu took control
of Japan, established his shogunate capital and started shaping the
country to his will. He left absolutely nothing to chance. He shut
the door to the outside world and kept his daimyo underlords on a
tight leash, requiring them to reside in Edo every other year,
where he held their wives and children as hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The rigid structure of Edo society was based on imported
neo-Confucian values, with the military elite and salt-of-the-earth
farmers at the top and middleman merchants below. A code of
nit-picking sumptuary laws dictated who could own and wear what.
Among the upper classes, competitive extravagance was as much a
social responsibility as a privilege, and it produced an
extraordinary art, as the first section of the show, ``Edo style,''
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   It is instantly apparent how eclectic that style was. And two
early 19th-century works seen side by side tell the tale: an ink
scroll by Uragami Gyokudo, ``Frozen Clouds, Sifted Snow,'' and a
splendid set of screens by Sakai Hoitsu, ``Flowers and Grasses of
Summer and Autumn.'' (Because of its fragility, the scroll will be
on view only for the first two weeks of the show's run; other
light-sensitive pieces will be rotated in January.)
</P>
<P>
   The paintings couldn't be more different. One is an
impressionistic vertical landscape in a classical Chinese
tradition, an omniscient vision of an atomized world in a state of
perpetual flux. The other is a close-up of natural shapes picked
out against a depthless silver-leaf ground. Mutability is the theme
here, too _ summer lilies give way to autumn leaves _ but expressed
as pinpoint-fine decorative forms frozen in time.
</P>
<P>
   This ornamental naturalism, with its optically stimulating
patterns and hyper-real colors, was an Edo hallmark, and it is
everywhere here: in the eyelash-thin birds painted on a man's
lacquer purse, in the stenciled flowers exploding across a silk
robe, in a porcelain dish the size of a saucer covered with
magnified snowflakes.
</P>
<P>
   Seen together these objects confirm that, in Japan, art and
craft were never separate categories. Motifs migrated effortlessly
from one form to another. (Gyokudo's great snowstorm scroll and the
little snowflake bowl, stylistically so different, are spiritually
related). And artists moved with awesome ease between mediums, as
in the case of the outstanding polymath, Ogata Korin, who painted
with equal skill on folding screens, ceramic pots and ladies
outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   The military class for whom much of the finest early work was
produced saw little active duty during the peaceful Edo era. But as
their professional function turned largely ceremonial, their armor
grew increasingly fantastic. And one of the show's most startling
sights comes with a display of such gear on the museum's second
floor.
</P>
<P>
   One full-length suit of armor, with a muscular breastplate and a
Darth Vader mask sprouting a boar's-hair mustache is truly
outlandish. (The intention may have been to simulate the appearance
of a barbarous foreigner.) But in other martial paraphernalia, one
finds a fanciful delicacy. One helmet is topped by a giant
butterfly; another by a stylized hollyhock, while a man's saddle is
covered with a pattern of cosmetic brushes painted in gold lacquer
dust.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why cosmetic brushes? No one seems to know for sure. But there's
no question that the symbols of masculine prowess and feminine
esthetic sensitivity compressed into this equestrian artifact
distill the peculiar, macho-poetic essence of a samurai mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Warriors may have commanded top status in the Edo period, but
farmers and laborers insured economic stability, and they were
routinely depicted in art. An early example of such images is
included here: Kusumi Morikage's 17th-century painting ``Enjoying
the Evening Cool Under an Arbor,'' a sympathetic portrait of a
lower-echelon farming couple at ease outside their hut on a humid,
moonlit summer night.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful piece, and such pastoral images continued to
appear throughout the period. But the social complexion of the
country was beginning to change. Middle-class merchants were
gaining economic clout, and it is the art they sponsored that
dominates the second half of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The giddy, cornucopian atmosphere of a dawning commodity culture
comes vividly to life in a mid-18th-century hand scroll,
``Occupations and Activities of Each Month.'' Here a town market is
shown as a kind of bustling mini-mall of speciality stores _ bonsai
shops, boutiques, art galleries _ with hawkers, prostitutes and
religious processions dashing to and fro as if on a suddenly
accelerated time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Religious art reflects this jumpy, manic energy. Ancient icons
are given freshly expressive forms in Buddhist figures hacked and
gouged from wood by the monk-sculpture Enku. Humor and parody come
into play. A hanging scroll by Ito Jakuchu turns the iconic scene
of the death of the Buddha into a fruit-and-vegetable still life,
with the Buddha himself as a giant white radish reclining at the
center. The Daoist immortals in a screen painted by Soga Shohaku
have a hypnotically detailed, Zap Comix-style weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   Such images, animated by a self-conscious, secularized
irreverence, made sense for an era that was, on the whole, far more
concerned with the clamorous here-and-now than with the hereafter.
The late Edo period was an urban moment; Tokyo in the 18th century
was the largest city in the world. Class barriers were fluid; money
was new, loose, plentiful. Downtime became a preoccupation, leisure
an industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the results was a theater boom. Kabuki, with its raucous,
topical humor and weepy melodrama was all the rage. Its
larger-than-life, grandstanding character comes across full blast
in Toshusai Sharaku's prints of preening and grimacing in-character
superstars, and in spectacularly witty costumes like the
grass-green silk coat in the show's last room that has a huge
please-hit-me bull's-eye emblazoned in black and gold on its back.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist trade also flourished, with sightseeing trips to
this scenic spot or that, and a mass production of souvenirs. They
ranged from kimonos covered with scenes of Kyoto hot spots (many of
which are still hot spots today), to snapshotlike prints of Mount
Fuji, to pictures that caught the erotic buzz of urban pleasure
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   These ``floating world'' images found an enthusiastic audience
in the West. In part this was because of their subject matter;
Miyagawa Chosun's swoony scroll painting of a young courtesan,
fresh from the bath, letting incense smoke waft up through her
robes makes most European soft-porn of the day look cloddishly
overstated.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the formal daring of Japanese art that fascinated
vanguard European painters of the late 19th century, and its
influence is spelled out in the meeting of two works at the
National Gallery just now. The museum's crowd-pulling ``Van Gogh's
Van Goghs'' show includes a Japanese-inspired painting by the Dutch
artist titled ``The Courtesan'' (1887), and a rare copy of the
1820s woodblock print by Keisai Eisen on which it is based is on
view in the Edo show.
</P>
<P>
   The final picture of the Edo period is itself complex: it
embraces a secular bourgeois society with immense wealth and a
widening gap between rich and poor; a dynamic popular culture
shaping art from the bottom up, a growing internationalism (the
pushy Admiral Perry landed in Tokyo Bay in 1853) accompanied by
worries about national identity.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? The Edo era in Japan, particularly in its final
phase, has many points of comparison with our own end-of-century
world. The National Gallery exhibition, in a nuanced exploration of
its subject, throws these similarities into relief. In the process,
it also reveals an art of subtle and inimitable splendors, perched
on the cusp of a very particular ``then'' and ``now,'' and gazing
avidly and uneasily in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   ``Edo: Art in Japan 1615-1868'' opens on Sunday and will remain
at the National Gallery of Art, Fourth Street at Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Washington, through Feb. 15. The exhibition is
organized by the National Gallery of Art in collaboration with the
Agency for Cultural Affairs, the government of Japan and the Japan
Foundation. It is supported by NTT (Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone
Corp.) and will not travel.

ART REVIEW: TRYING TO SEPARATE BEN SHAHN'S ART FROM HIS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How popular will the show of Ben Shahn's paintings at
the Jewish Museum be?
</P>
<P>
   Shahn is a special case in American art. If other artists tend
to be described in terms of the art of their time _ we say Pollock
emerged out of Thomas Hart Benton and Picasso and Surrealism to put
Abstract Expressionism on the map _ we think of Shahn's life as
encompassing an era more or less from Joe Hill through the
Rosenbergs to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the signposts of
his career constituting a virtual American martyrology in the
middle decades of the century.
</P>
<P>
   He made his mark recalling Sacco and Vanzetti in the 1930s, and
he ended up in the 1960s memorializing King and painting tributes
to a Japanese fisherman poisoned by fallout from a U.S. H-bomb test
on Bikini atoll.
</P>
<P>
   The present show, perhaps recognizing that times have changed
and his relevance needs some retuning, steers clear of many of the
details of old political battles. It stresses what is described in
the catalog as a quality of introspection in Shahn's later work, a
general mythologizing and spiritual symbolism that, we are told,
contrary to the standard view of American art, links him to the
Abstract Expressionists and other postwar American artists.
</P>
<P>
   Shahn is Shahn, nonetheless, and nearly 30 years after his
death, on the centenary of his birth, it's inevitable that the
Jewish Museum's exhibition will indicate how much people today
continue to care about or even remember the events and causes with
which he is inextricably identified.
</P>
<P>
   At the start I emphasize his popularity because we easily forget
how popular Shahn was. With the Pollock and Rothko retrospectives
now at the Modern and the Whitney, the Shahn exhibition is a useful
reminder that it was he, more than they, who dominated the
country's public consciousness at midcentury.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Greenfeld, in a new Shahn biography, cites a 1947 Look
magazine survey of critics, curators and museum directors who were
asked to name the 10 best painters in the United States. This was
before any of the Abstract Expressionists had made much of a mark.
Shahn placed fifth. He was ranked the same when Look simultaneously
polled artists. (John Marin placed first in both polls.) Shahn's
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art had just closed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the year Pollock reached his peak, Art News magazine
said Shahn had one of the best shows of the season. In 1954,
Abstract Expressionism having come to prominence, Shahn and de
Kooning jointly represented the United States at the Venice
Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   And by the late-1950s he was a celebrity. He was on television.
Harvard and Princeton gave him honorary degrees. He illustrated
magazines and advertisements, the way movie stars today endorse
products, claiming that commercial art was not less dignified than
painting, nor was it an ethical compromise (which didn't mean he
wasn't peeved when detractors implied that he was merely an
illustrator).
</P>
<P>
   He became, in a sense, the country's official leftist artist, or
at least the official artist for millions of Americans leaning to
the left, and if American communists grumbled that he was not far
enough to the left, and conservatives said he was much too far to
the left, their attacks seemed only to enhance Shahn's position and
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that he is the last American artist to have bridged
the gap between public taste and the taste of art critics so
successfully. Grandma Moses and Andrew Wyeth might have had wider
popular appeal during the 1950s, but critics condescended to them.
During the 1960s, the cognoscenti embraced Warhol, but Warhol was
infamous as opposed to famous with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful critics like Clement Greenberg occasionally attacked
Shahn, but it was only in Shahn's last years, if at all, that his
stature seemed to dim: John Canaday lamented after Shahn's death in
1969 that ``his technical facility and his strong feeling for
decorative pattern gave to his work a quality of elegance, almost
of chic, that offended former admirers who expected him to maintain
into old age the fervor of youth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus he suffered, ironically, from comparison with himself,''
Canaday added. But then he used Shahn as a cudgel with which to
beat younger artists at the time who, he said, failed to recognize
``the difference between propaganda for a cause believed in, and
rabble-rousing.''
</P>
<P>
   And today? From a distance of several decades, we see Shahn with
some curiosity. He was a talented draftsman and photographer who
left behind a few indelible images, but ultimately he seems a minor
painter, narrow in scope, tethered to a moment that has passed.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck at the Jewish Museum by how little, formally
speaking, his art changed over the years. Consistency can be a
virtue but repetitiousness is not. There is a formal distance
between the early Social Realist mural he did for the Jersey
Homesteads, a Jewish community, in the mid-1930s and
``Maimonides,'' which he painted in 1954, but the distance isn't
great. The ambiguity of his later works, involving sometimes
obscure symbolism (his ``Age of Anxiety'' is one example), didn't
change the basic way the pictures were organized.
</P>
<P>
   Using tempera, Shahn stuck to a few canny devices: meaty hands,
patchy colors, a mix of deep, telescoped space and flat,
collagelike elements (a Surrealistic device derived from Giorgio de
Chirico, even though Shahn always insisted he had little patience
for Surrealism) and, famously, a catchy shorthand means of drawing
faces and heads.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively they defined a brand, like Rothko's rectangles or
Pollock's drips. For Rothko and Pollock, being pigeonholed by a
signature style became a problem. Shahn evidently felt it was OK.
Greenberg once described ``a poverty of culture and resources'' on
Shahn's part. That seems right.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was said, to underscore Shahn's integrity, that he was
fiercely independent of trends in modern art, but he learned from
many modern artists (Cezanne, Roualt, Grosz, Picasso, Calder,
Leger), and he also passed ideas on to people whom you might not
expect: Warhol and Pollock are two examples (see Pollock's
``Portrait and a Dream''). Stylistically, if not politically, Shahn
positioned himself in the middle, which accounts for his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, still deeply impolitic to criticize him, his
admirers interpreting criticism as an attack on what he claimed to
stand for, as if, to reverse the equation, revering Velazquez meant
advocating monarchism or praising Picasso meant condoning misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   We forget how much taste in art became a grave moral matter in
Shahn's day and no doubt remains so among many of his followers. At
the time, Shahn represented an alternative to abstraction, whose
meaning, being difficult to grasp, seemed morally suspect. He made
people feel ennobled because through him they could associate
themselves with causes that they considered just. Or put
differently, he confirmed what they already believed.
</P>
<P>
   I find this a little peculiar considering the tone of much of
his work. He might have hated the comparison, but it occurred to me
that Shahn isn't unlike Andrew Wyeth because of the precise,
obsessive way they both paint some details and the lonely,
pessimistic mood they commonly evoke.
</P>
<P>
   They share a strangely silent, anti-heroic view of America. We
are inclined to imagine Shahn as a witty or at least a satirical
painter, but aside from early works like ``Myself Among the
Churchgoers'' and a few other pictures, he isn't. Partly it's
because he painted subjects like the Holocaust and nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly it has to do with his righteous attitude: once upon a
time, meaning during the 1950s, endearingly humorless painters
earnestly cited scripture and philosophy to explain the symbolism
and value of their work, the way young artists today describe the
influence of television and comics.
</P>
<P>
   The prescriptive aphorism in Shahn's ``Maimonides'' (``Teach thy
tongue to say I do not know and thou shalt progress'') is a good
example _ and interesting because for his part Shahn rarely seemed
to express any doubts about what he believed or why, which may be
said to have cost him in terms of his work's development. For
better and worse, Shahn remained quintessentially a painter of his
time.

   DUKE GETS GIFT FOR ART MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Nasher, a 76-year-old developer, collector and
philanthropist from Dallas, is giving $7.5 million to Duke
University, in Durham, N.C., to support the construction of a new
art museum on campus. To be called the Nasher Museum of Art, it
will replace the current museum, which opened in 1969 and is housed
in a renovated science building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Duke and was on the board,'' said Nasher, who is
creating a sculpture garden on a two-acre site adjacent to the
Dallas Museum of Art that is to open next year. ``I always thought
the one thing lacking at Duke was a cultural center.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasher and a small committee of the current museum's officials
and his family members are selecting an architect to design a $15
million building. The firms being considered include Herzog &AMP; De
Meuron, based in Basel, Switzerland; Cesar Pelli, from New Haven,
and Pei Cobb Freed and Partners and Rafel Vinoly, both of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new museum is planned for the summer of
2000. The university has begun a three-year capital campaign to
raise the additional $7.5 million needed.
</P>
<P>
   So far plans for the new building include permanent collection
galleries, a sculpture garden, galleries for special exhibitions,
and storage. It will also have an auditorium, classrooms, offices,
a cafe and a gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found an incredible site that is finally available,''
Nasher said. ``Nine acres that used to be used by the botany
department and that is right between the university's two
campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mezzatesta, director of the Duke University Museum of
Art, will be the director of the new museum. Once the project is
under way, Nasher said, Mezzatesta will cull through the
institution's roughly 12,000 works, which range from ancient to
contemporary art, in an effort to improve the holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, over time we will be able to build an important
collection,'' Nasher said. ``But the museum will start out almost
like a Kunsthalle,'' a museum without its own collection.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nasher said, he expects the sculpture garden in
Dallas to lend works to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a large collection,'' Nasher said. ``So it makes
sense to lend works to the museum from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   2 MISSING CONSTABLES
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has turned to the
public for help in finding two oil sketches by John Constable that
mysteriously disappeared from the institution earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dedham Lock and Mill,'' circa 1820, and ``Sketch for Valley
Farm,'' circa 1835, together valued at nearly $1.3 million, were
discovered missing when an expert went to find another work in the
storage vaults, a museum spokeswoman said. While the police have
been notified, the museum hopes that making the suspected thefts
public will help lead to recovery of the works.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first major incident of suspected theft at the
museum since 1992, when a Medici casket was discovered missing. It
was ultimately found.
</P>
<P>
   ART FOR WINE'S SAKE
</P>
<P>
   Exhibiting at some of the world's leading art and antique shows
can have unexpected results. For one of the painters exhibiting at
the booth of Michael Goedhuis, the London-based dealer who
specializes in Oriental art and has been at the International Art
and Antique Dealers Show every October in New York, the result is
an appearance on the label for Chateau Mouton-Rothschild's 1996
vintage.

   Goedhuis' booth at the fair last year had an abstract painting
by Gu Gan, a 56-year-old Beijing-based artist who is one of the new
generation of calligraphy painters. The work caught the eye of
Baroness Philippine de Rothschild, owner of Mouton-Rothschild, in
Bordeaux, when she visited the booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baroness did a lot of research,'' Goedhuis said. ``She
went to China to visit him and then brought Gu Gan to Bordeaux.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of decorating the labels of Mouton-Rothschild bottles
with art is hardly new. The practice was began in the 1920s by the
baroness' father, the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Other
artists whose work adorns the wine include Picasso, Dali, Braque,
Chagall, Kandinsky, Klee, Balthus, Hockney and Warhol.

<P>
   BUSY IN BILBAO
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao has a lot to celebrate as it turns
one year old this month.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.4 million people came to visit the Frank Gehry building,
almost three times as many as the Guggenheim had projected. And the
museum has brought in $219 million of revenue to Bilbao, Spain, and
$35 million in new tax revenue, an economic impact that also
exceeds expectations, by three times.
</P>
<P>
   What induced so many people come, the architecture or the
collection?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the building played a big role,'' said Thomas Krens,
the Guggenheim's director. ``But over the long run, it will be the
programs and the collection that will keep people coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN'S CATALOG
</P>
<P>
   Martin Segal, the former chairman of Lincoln Center, wants New
York City public schoolteachers to have easy access to cultural
programs around the city.
</P>
<P>
   So Segal, who now runs the New York International Festival of
the Arts, a nonprofit institution to promote the city's strengths
as a center for the arts, has given the schools 1,100 copies _ one
for each public school in the city _ of the ``Kids Culture
Catalog,'' a comprehensive guide to cultural sites and activities,
including arts groups, museums and gardens in and around New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education has matched the gift, so that now each
school will have two copies for its libraries. The book was
published by Harry N. Abrams in association with the Alliance for
the Arts, an advocacy organization in Manhattan. It book costs
$12.95 and is available in bookstores and museum gift shops.

 &HT;    HOMEWORK GETS NO RESPECT IN SOME SCHOOLS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After more than a decade in which two U.S.
presidents have talked up education reform, the news from the front
was far from heartening this week.
</P>
<P>
   Boston high school students, leaving for home at 1:40 p.m.,
rarely bother to carry books for homework and tote bookbags chiefly
to carry their gym clothes, the Boston Globe said Tuesday in a
report that has stirred controversy in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and principals acknowledged that homework is left
undone or often not even assigned in the city's high schools.
Students unabashedly admitted they rarely study after school hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't do the homework if I'm not in the mood,'' a
ninth-grader told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In the finger-pointing following the report, blame has been
spread to parents who fail to check on their children's
assignments, school administrators who fail to set standards and
teachers who have given up on making assignments that are ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Although no nationwide study exists, education reform advocates
say they believe such anti-homework sentiment is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hear over and over again that, particularly at high
school levels, students are not required to do homework,'' said
Christopher Cross, president of the Council for Basic Education, a
non-profit organization that favors higher standards. ``And often
when it's done, it's not graded. I wouldn't say that's true
everywhere. It's unfortunate that that's often the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross and other experts say that doing homework is often an
indicator of academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Students apparently agree. In a survey conducted two years ago
by the Public Agenda Foundation, a public opinion research center,
nearly 80 percent of the teenage respondents said they would learn
more if schools required them to complete homework and hand it in
on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just glide through,'' a Seattle public high school
student told the survey. ``You can copy somebody's homework at the
beginning of the period. I mean you can do whatever you want. ...
They practically hand you a diploma.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since that survey, the public campaign for
educational standards by the Clinton administration has made no
clear inroads, Cross said. ``States are putting in tests that will
require that students buckle down,'' he said. ``What's lacking is
any consequence for students.''
</P>
<P>
   He said test scores have yet to demonstrate that the tests and
standards translate into gains in test scores. Texas and North
Carolina, which have registered the greatest improvements in test
scores, are the exceptions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn, president of the Fordham Foundation, said,
``Homework's just a symptom. When homework's not being done, it's a
symptom of a sicker school.''
</P>
<P>
   Finn, who served as assistant education secretary in the Reagan
administration, said that he finds pockets of success among
alternative and experimental schools serving about 1 percent of the
45 million school population, but he said that education reform in
general ``has not grabbed hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 15 years after 'Nation at Risk' (a landmark report on
failing schools), and most of reforms have not yielded any
dividends,'' Finn said. ``We've got tests and standards and reason
for hope, but we haven't gained enough traction to gain significant
results.''

ON STAGE AND OFF: THEATER NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A CHANGE OF SCENERY
</P>
<P>
   In a major overhaul of Disney's highly anticipated new musical,
``Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida,'' company executives have
dismissed the show's director, choreographer and design team.
</P>
<P>
   They were let go this week, after the $10 million show closed a
tryout run Sunday at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta. Chris Boneau,
a spokesman for the show, confirmed the action but would not
comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaborate Lives,'' with a score by Elton John and lyrics by
Tim Rice, received generally positive reviews in Atlanta, though
some critics snickered at the show's central set piece, a giant
pyramid. But talk of a Broadway transfer next spring has subsided
considerably since the show had its debut in Atlanta in early
October.
</P>
<P>
   Boneau said the composer and lyricist would remain; there was no
word on replacements for those dismissed or on the musical's next
step.
</P>
<P>
   A CROWDED STAGE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hottest and most publicized wagering on Broadway
this week has been about who would get the Helen Hayes Theater
after ``Getting and Spending,'' folded. Would it be ``Wit,''
Margaret Edson's drama, or ``This Is Our Youth,'' Kenneth
Lonergan's slacker opus?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is neither, at least not yet. Martin Markinson, the
theater's owner and a producer of ``Getting and Spending,'' said
this week that he would stick with the money-losing show until
after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that two intimate shows like ``Wit,'' now at the
99-seat MCC Theater in Chelsea, and ``This Is Our Youth,'' at the
108-seat Second Stage on the Upper West Side, are considering a
risky leap to Broadway, without major stars, underscores the dire
lack of available off-Broadway theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel this is a serious Broadway drama,'' said Bernard
Telsey, a producer of ``Wit,'' who added that Broadway would be his
first choice for the play. ``But we would consider a large
off-Broadway house, if one was available.''
</P>
<P>
   One isn't. Only two of the several dozen off-Broadway theaters
are dark: the Cherry Lane Theater, which has a show coming in
February, and the Lamb's Theater, where ``Retribution'' closed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There are several culprits. First, there is a whole family of
veterans like ``Stomp,'' age 4; ``Blue Man Group,'' age 7, and
``The Fantasticks,'' which at 38 is old enough to be your mother.
Then there are seemingly critic-proof shows like ``Communicating
Doors'' at the Variety Arts, chugging along despite lukewarm
reviews. Adding to the mix are off-off-Broadway interlopers like
the Adobe Theater Company's ``Duet!'' at the Actors Playhouse and
``Shakespeare's R &AMP; J,'' extended through Jan. 2 at the John
Houseman.
</P>
<P>
   Space has gotten so tight that even older, less spiffy
off-Broadway theaters are doing business, like the Players Theater
(where ``Trainspotting'' opens Sunday) and the SoHo Playhouse (home
of ``Killer Joe'').
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, of course, is the bottom line. ``The expenses
off-Broadway are significantly less,'' said Steven Levy, a producer
and partner in the new Gramercy Theater on East 23rd Street near
Lexington Avenue. ``And the ticket prices on Broadway are not
significantly more to make it worthwhile sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least a few casualties are expected from the ranks of
long-running shows like ``Visiting Mr. Green,'' which closes Nov.
22. And this fall's flock of newcomers in previews has yet to face
the critics.
</P>
<P>
   And as bad as the crunch is off-Broadway, Broadway's theaters
are also promising to fill up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Helen Hayes' future tenant, Markinson saw ``This Is
Our Youth'' on Wednesday (he said he liked it), was scheduled to
see ``Wit'' last night and said he would soon decide if either show
would be offered the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Bets, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   WILLY LOMAN AT 50
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I feel a revival ought to say something new. And
this seems to.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice is Arthur Miller's, and the production is the recent
revival, at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, of ``Death of a
Salesman,'' directed by Robert Falls and starring Brian Dennehy as
Willy Loman. It opens in New York at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on
Feb. 10, the 50th anniversary of the show's debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years is amazing,'' Miller said deadpan, ``because I'm
only 52.''
</P>
<P>
   David Richenthal, the lead producer, said he sealed the deal
with Miller on Thursday for the Broadway run, and he said Dennehy
had committed to at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a sure thing: the playwright denied the rights to a
Broadway run of a production in 1996 that would have starred Hal
Holbrook and Elizabeth Franz. (Ms. Franz appears in the Goodman
version and will move to Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that the acting wasn't good,'' said Miller, 83. ``It
just wasn't new.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's memories of the 1949 staging remain his fondest.
``It's a bit like arriving at the North Pole for the first time,''
he said. ``In my memory, with that electricity of first discovery,
that's always going to be the perfect production.''
</P>
<P>
   A NICE PLACE TO VISIT
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Hutt is the subject of two biographies, has
received bags of fan mail and, by one writer's estimate, has played
more performances in Shakespearean roles than Laurence Olivier and
John Gielgud combined.
</P>
<P>
   So who is he?
</P>
<P>
   At 78, Hutt is perhaps the best-known stage actor in Canada. And
on Sunday he will open in his first turn on a New York stage in
nearly 30 years, starring as the parsimonious Harpagon in Moliere's
``Miser.''
</P>
<P>
   The production, along with ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' is part
of the inaugural season at City Center for the Stratford Festival
in Ontario, considered North America's finest Shakespearean
company. Hutt joined the troupe in 1953. ``The pay was about $5 a
day and all we could steal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hutt's longevity and elegant good looks may be less well
known here than in his home country, he says he likes it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as New York is concerned, I don't think it's
particularly picturesque to live in a cramped garret for my art,''
said Hutt, who lives in Stratford. ``And as electric as Broadway is
when you're playing, I think the times in between might be awfully
interminable.''

  (af) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRESSED UP AS THE LAW
</P>
<P>
   Home video often leads the way to a small, noteworthy film that
provokes more than the usual amount of thought about the concept
and how it works or doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with ``Bang,'' an intriguing and well-reviewed
movie about a nameless young Asian woman (Darling Narita) and her
experience impersonating a Los Angeles motorcycle policewoman.
</P>
<P>
   The director is a British-born filmmaker known as Ash. ``In L.A.
people walk around terrified of the police, that robocop image,''
he said. His movie puts the power represented by the uniform on a
minority woman. How would that influence people's impression of
her? How would it change her own behavior? ``Asian women are
regarded as being submissive,'' he said. ``How would this affect
that stereotype?''
</P>
<P>
   The film, to be released on video by Monarch on Nov. 24, was
Ash's first feature, cost $20,000 to make and was shot on Los
Angeles streets. Ms. Narita plays a struggling actress who gets
evicted from her apartment, flees a lascivious producer in Beverly
Hills and then runs from a motorcycle policeman who wants to charge
her with vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   He catches her in a wooded park and demands oral sex in return
for letting her go. Pretending to acquiesce, she snatches his
sidearm and, after some reflection during a tense standoff, orders
him to strip and handcuffs him to a tree. She then puts on his
uniform _ dark shades, bristling gun belt, high black boots _
climbs on his motorcycle and wobbles off on a series of encounters.
</P>
<P>
   This is truly an unusual officer. Nervously feeling out her new
duties, she is always gasping for breath. Felons abound, but she
wouldn't arrest anybody for the world. ``Wait,'' she calls
plaintively to a drug dealer as he races for a rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone she meets is incredulous and snidely amused, especially
several young men who help her out from under the motorcycle after
it has fallen over on her. A hooker and her pimp stomp her.
</P>
<P>
   No one shows her respect, but most people warily give her a wide
berth. Nobody, including two fellow officers who join her for
breakfast, ever questions her identity.
</P>
<P>
   In terror she deserts a drive-by shooting victim and later kills
a suspect in self-defense. Finally, deciding she doesn't need the
uniform, she retrieves her own clothing and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bang'' was praised for its thoughtfulness and intensity when
it opened in theaters in 1997. The Los Angeles Times named it one
of the 10 best movies of the year. But while the idea is engaging,
the story loses some effectiveness by portraying all it comes
across as unrelievedly grim and virtually everyone it meets as
crude, violent swine.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, the film
``leaves you feeling as gratuitously roughed up as its anonymous
heroine.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that life didn't imitate art. Operating without a permit,
the filmmakers constantly dodged the police, who were especially
startled at the sight of Ms. Narita in full police regalia on her
motorcycle. Most of the time they thought she was an officer
assigned to the set. ``She'd just wave them on by,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   THE LAND GIRLS
</P>
<P>
   To help out on the home front in England during World War II,
three young women (Anna Friel, Catherine McCormack and Rachel
Weisz) volunteer to work on a farm, joining the ranks of the ``land
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of David Leland's film, which aims to mix the
virtues of public service with the bittersweet experiences of
lovers in wartime, the women bend to their tasks, milking cows,
pitching hay and the like.
</P>
<P>
   For romance, there's the farmer's son (no daughter, for a
change), a volatile lad named Joe (Steven Mackintosh) who serves as
a lover to all three women at different points. But Leland is more
interested in the era than in romantic themes, which he treats,
Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, with ``just enough
restraint to keep from teetering overboard into bilgy
sentimentality.''

   HURRICANE STREETS
</P>
<P>
   Marcus (Brendan Sexton III) is something of a rarity on screen
these days: a real teen-ager. With his mother in prison, Marcus,
the troubled 14-year-old, lives with his grandmother and wanders
city streets, engaging in petty crime and hanging out with all the
wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   Then he meets Melena (Isidra Vega), also 14 and a kindred
spirit. The two plan to run away together, but much of the plotting
remains unformed. The film ``comes most alive when it's not trying
to tell a story and concentrates on Marcus' inner
turmoil''(Holden).

   FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from the uproarious tableaux in Hunter S. Thompson's
book, Terry Gilliam's film brims with splendiferous terror as Raoul
Duke (Johnny Depp) and Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), downing drugs
by the handful, hit town to cover a motorcycle race and get
phantasmagorically sidetracked by the garish side of the American
dream. On screen, though, the story loses energy, with vignettes
rigidly compressed into a cinematic hodgepodge ``that rarely gives
the book's appallingly funny anecdotes room to breathe'' (Holden).

   PASSION IN THE DESERT
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to accompany an artist (Michel Piccoli) into the desert
during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt, a young French officer named
Augustin (Ben Daniels) gets lost and encounters a leopard in a
cave. Man and animal begin a surreal relationship of love, jealousy
and betrayal that brings out the human in the beast and the beast
in the human.
</P>
<P>
   As far-fetched as that may seem, Lavinia Currier's film, based
on the novella by Honore de Balzac, is an ``engrossing, visually
mesmerizing tale that resonates with reverence for nature, beauty
and animal life'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).

   THE SUITORS. In Ghasem Ebrahimian's darkly wry satire, four
Iranian men visit a farm in upstate New York and return with a
sheep (perfect for kebabs). Meanwhile their friend Haji is
returning to New York with Mariyam, his young bride-by-arrangement,
who runs off at John F. Kennedy International Airport but is
caught.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Haji and the men face Mecca and butcher the sheep
in his bathtub, but the blood drips through the floor into the
superintendent's apartment. Thinking he is under siege by Iranian
terrorists, the superintendent calls in a SWAT team.

<P>
   Nothing happens without a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon your spiritual outlook, this statement is either
a profound truth or sentimental pap.
</P>
<P>
   But when the German bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff says it, you
believe it. If he can feel this way, given his life story, who can
say otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   Though Quasthoff is 39 (his birthday was this week), he has been
singing prominently for only 10 years, essentially since 1988, when
he captured first prize in the ARD International Music Competition
in Munich, the same competition that inaugurated the career of
Jessye Norman. He is now one of the most critically hailed and
sought-after singers in Europe. He has won some illustrious
champions, including the conductors Claudio Abbado, Simon Rattle,
Daniel Barenboim and Helmuth Rilling.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Quasthoff's career in the United States has been less
extensive. His U.S. debut came in 1995 at the Oregon Bach Festival
with Rilling conducting. But vocal enthusiasts here already know of
him from his recordings of Schumann lieder and Mozart arias on the
RCA Red Seal label. Last week he made his debut with the Boston
Symphony, performing in Mahler's ``Lied von der Erde,'' conducted
by another Quasthoff admirer, Seiji Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night he made his New York debut, performing in another
Mahler work, ``Das Knaben Wunderhorn'' with the New York
Philharmonic under Sir Colin Davis, a performance that will be
repeated Friday and Saturday nights at Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And in January he will make his New York recital debut singing
Schubert's ``Winterreise,'' with the pianist Charles Spencer, on
the Great Performers at Lincoln Center series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that Quasthoff has had a career at all is a tribute to
indisputable talent, almost inexplicable optimism, and sheer
tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Quasthoff was born in 1959, a period when doctors in Germany as
well as Britain were espousing the use of a new drug for women
experiencing discomfort during pregnancy. Generically called
thalidomide, the drug resulted in some 5,000 babies' being born
with physical deformities. Quasthoff was one. He stands at just
four feet, and has vestigial arms, with malformed hands and wrists
that appear to come almost directly from his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   But, he was also born with a voice, and early on acquired the
determination to develop it. ``Singing comes form the head, the
vocal cords and the diaphragm,'' Quasthoff said, ``and mine are
completely normal.'' Indeed, his broad face, thick neck, and
ruggedly handsome features suggest the kind of body nature had
intended his to be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Quasthoff seems to have embraced life without regret, or so
it seemed recently, when he presided jovially over breakfast in an
Upper West Side Manhattan hotel. At the table were his older
brother, Michael, a freelance journalist in Germany; Michael's
girlfriend, Renata Baumgart, and a friend, Anthony Shalit, an
American-born, European-based lawyer. Everyone was looking forward
to a trip to Ellis Island later that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Though in performance Quasthoff keeps his arms discreetly at his
sides, in conversation he underscores his talk with effusive hand
gestures. He loves the outdoors and is an enthusiastic swimmer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Quasthoff was born in Hildesheim, a town of some 100,000,
the West German government, overwhelmed with the demands of the
thalidomide tragedy, did a poor job of placing the children
afflicted in appropriate schools. Quasthoff was sent to a special
boarding school where many of the children were suffering from
cerebral palsy, which had to have had an effect on a child with the
quick wit and intelligence of Quasthoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the only possibility my parents had at the time,'' he
said. And, actually, he added, there were advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home, my mother was all around me, constantly saying, `Let
me do that for you,''' he said. ``At school, I was forced to live
independently, an ability I still have.'' Today, Quasthoff lives
alone, self-sufficient, in an apartment in Hannover, other than for
``a nice woman who comes every other week to clean my dirty
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years at the special school, the authorities
realized that Quasthoff should be enrolled in a regular school.
Once transferred, he made big advances in his education, until he
encountered one demoralizing obstacle. He applied for admission to
a prestigious music school in Hannover and impressed the voice
faculty greatly. But because of a mandatory requirement that all
voice students study the piano, he was refused admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the legal point of view, they were right,'' Quasthoff
said. ``From the moral point of view, well, that is another
question.'' Today, of course, at least in the United States, such
an action would violate laws to protect the disabled. Paradoxically
that same conservatory hired Quasthoff years later as a voice
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was nothing to be done. Yet, even this
setback, Quasthoff believes, had a positive consequence. Instead,
he studied with a private voice teacher, Charlotte Lehman, with
whom he worked, starting at 13, for 17 years, sometimes every day.
He also studied music theory with his teacher's husband, Dr. Ernst
Huber-Contwig. In a conservatory his training would not have been
so personal and extensive, and Quasthoff attributes his solid
technique to this thorough grounding.
</P>
<P>
   He also credits his parents with unflinching support, despite
the distress, and, no doubt, guilt, they suffered, his mother,
Brigitte, in particular. ``Who can know what a mother feels?'' he
said. ``You want to have a second baby, the baby is disabled, and
afterwards you know it is because you took this medication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a second in my life when I asked, `Mommy, why
did you take this tablet?''' he said. ``Never. People wonder how I
can feel this way; but, excuse me, I love my mother. My parents
gave me the best support imaginable. My father, who had a full-time
job with the government, drove me every week 30 kilometers to my
voice lesson and 30 kilometers back. But this is simply what he
felt he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Quasthoff made progress as a singer. But, believing that he
could have no future as a performing artist, he went to law school,
and hated it. So he became a popular radio announcer in Hannover,
and in his spare time sang with a jazz combo. But he kept studying
voice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s he started entering competitions, and never
failed to win a prize. Then, in 1988, came the much-publicized
Munich victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next year, I could have had 250 concerts,'' he said. ``One
day, there were over 80 calls. My parents went crazy; they wanted
to cancel the phone.'' But Quasthoff sensibly learned to say no. He
has never performed more than 100 concerts in one season, and,
today, prefers to keep his schedule closer to 60 or 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be dead without music, I am absolutely sure,'' he
said. ``But I am not a slave to music, or to my profession. I don't
want to be on the stage, still singing at 70, one of those singers
with a vibrato so wide you can throw a medicine ball through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, for almost six years after the Munich
competition, Quasthoff kept his radio job out of concern that the
music world's interest in him would be short-lived. He need not
have worried. Today, Quasthoff derives economic security and
personal fulfillment from teaching. He holds a professorship for
life at the music conservatory in Detmold, a 90-minute train ride
from his home in Hannover.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quasthoff has an elegant, earthen voice with an extensive range
and especially solid low notes. His diction, both in German and
Italian, is impeccable, and, judging by his latest BMG recording,
Schubert's ``Winterreise,'' he has strong interpretive ideas: there
are some spacious tempos in this performance that enable him to
spin out lyrical lines with bold expressivity.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on Quasthoff's performance last week in Mahler's
``Lied von der Erde,'' Richard Dyer, the critic of The Boston
Globe, wrote: ``There is no room in his experience of life and his
insight into art for self-pity, dramatization or exaggeration of
interpretation; this is characterful storytelling, precise picture
painting, and pure feeling, distilled.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been milestones along the way, chances to perform in
places and with musicians that had been fantasies when he was
miserable in law school. Last season alone, he sang in Haydn's
``Creation'' with the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Rattle,
gave a recital at the Salzburg Festival, performed in Bach's ``St.
Matthew Passion'' with Ozawa at the Saito-Kinen Festival in Japan,
and was a soloist in Britten's ``War Requiem,'' also in Japan,
conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was young it was impossible for my mother to imagine
that she would ever see me onstage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she still cannot believe it. ``I've sat next to
Thomas' mother at his important debuts in Cologne, Berlin and other
cities,'' Shalit said. ``And she would say: `Pinch me. Am I alive?
Is this happening?'''
</P>
<P>
   Quasthoff exudes a quiet confidence about the effect of his art
on listeners. ``Perhaps it has something to do with my
disability,'' he said, ``something in the voice which comes through
that is special. But I do get wonderful reactions from audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   When he sang ``Winterreise'' in Rome last year, his Italian
agent cautioned him before the concert not to expect the kind of
responses he had gotten in Germany. But when the last chord
sounded, at the end of the haunting organ grinder's song, Shalit
recalled, there was an eerie silence for a full minute. Then, the
audience erupted with a seven-minute standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   While touched by such reactions, Quasthoff is quick to poke fun
at himself. Shalit, after hearing Quasthoff sing ``Das Lied'' in
Boston, with the tenor Ben Heppner as the other soloist, said he
felt that the singers would make a vocally ideal team as Iago and
Otello. ``Oh sure,'' Quasthoff responded, amused at the idea that
his Iago could intimidate the husky American tenor's Otello. ``I
would be the smallest Iago ever!''
</P>
<P>
   When his career started in earnest, Quasthoff assumed that
performing opera onstage was out of the question. Two years ago,
Barenboim offered him Rigoletto for a production in Hamburg, which
Quasthoff turned down. Offering someone with such a disability the
role of the hunchbacked jester might strike some as insensitive.
Quasthoff did not take it that way at all. But for him to perform
onstage in opera would require the right role, a sympathetic
director and a sensitive production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want my disability too much in the foreground,'' he
said. ``My voice and my interpretation must be in front. The
production would have to be carefully done. But I would not say it
is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is easy to imagine, say, a stately production of
Mozart's ``Zauberfloete'' in which Quasthoff might be a moving
Sarastro. He sings Sarastro's arias beautifully on his BMG
recording.
</P>
<P>
   But if it comes, it comes; he is in no hurry. The delay he
contended with before his career took off may have actually
benefited him, Quasthoff feels: he kept working with his teacher,
did not prematurely force himself, like too many young singers,
into inappropriate roles, and allowed his voice time to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happens without a reason,'' he said again.
</P>

 &HT;    SOUTHERN CONFERENCE TO EXPLORE PROGRESS IN RACE RELATIONS
 &HT;    960 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Perhaps, just perhaps, Southerners can go
home again, a second chance to find the elusive ``Good South'' of
their dreams. If so, they will surely have to pass this way again,
this place where those dreams wilted in the searing heat of
terrifying social upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   They have all been here before, of course _ figuratively, if not
literally. They have spent nearly a third of this century trying to
make some sense of this city, this powerful symbol of the worst and
best in them.
</P>
<P>
   This ``unfinished business'' has drawn hundreds of Southerners
of all hues to Birmingham this weekend. They are here to make peace
with the South's troubled past, to celebrate its upbeat present and
to begin the daunting task of shaping a future free of the racism
that is the dark heart of its politics, economics and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way around Birmingham,'' Southern historian John
Egerton writes in a 32-page report to the delegates to the
three-day ``Unfinished Business'' summit, which begins Saturday.
``We have to go into it, become a part of it, make our peace with
it, in order to find the way to the Good South of our dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit is the work of the Center for the Study of the
American South, which is based in North Carolina, and the
Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, with funding from 19
foundations. It is the culmination of two years of local forums
across the South, all striving for solutions to the racism, poverty
and inequality of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates represent a cross-section of cultural, social and
economic backgrounds and not just politicians and recognized civil
rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda is nothing less than ``to lift the level of life'' in
the South and ``to define anew, in egalitarian terms, what it means
to be a Southerner and (ultimately) an American,'' according to
Egerton.
</P>
<P>
   The model for this summit is the 1938 Southern Conference for
Human Welfare, an assembly of 1,500 Southerners, black and white,
trying to make the region richer, healthier, better educated, less
violent and more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 1938 gathering ended in disarray amid police
threats to arrest the racially mixed group for violating
segregation ordinances, the 1998 gathering will be welcomed by
Richard Arrington, the black man who has been Birmingham's mayor
for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The thuggish police who attacked children with dogs and fire
hoses and made Birmingham the Johannesburg of America are gone. But
the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where four children died in a
bomb blast one Sunday morning in the fall of 1963, still stands, a
monument to resistance, valor and abiding hope. Racial hatred, once
the public policy of this city, is mostly private, muted, behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a distance, but we still have a distance to go,''
said Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis, the legendary civil rights
pioneer and one of the nearly 400 delegates expected at this
conference. ``All across the South, small towns and rural
communities are in the process of laying down the burden of race.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People said the conference proves how far the South has
come since its Jim Crow days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very title of the conference _ 'Unfinished' Business' _
reflects an acknowledgement that change has occurred, that progress
has been made,'' said Julian Bond, a veteran of Southern voter
registration drives.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond's view, one that is generally backed by the Census
Bureau, is that the story of race relations in the South is ``the
standard half-full, half-empty glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, no better example can illustrate black gains than
Mississippi, a grisly killing field in the South's resistance to
racial equality in the 1960s. The Magnolia State now has more black
elected officials _ 803 _ than any other state in the nation. On
the other hand, it has elected only two blacks to Congress since
the Civil War Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty, once the South's most recognized calling card, has
steadily declined. In 1969, 20.3 percent of all Southerners lived
in poverty. Today, the poverty rate is 14.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, in both instances, the Southern rates exceed the
national averages. And when the focus is on blacks and other
minorities, the extremes of poverty in the region are even more
obvious: Half of all the poor children in the South are non-whites.
</P>
<P>
   Similar disparities are found in measurements of health,
education, employment, housing and justice, all testaments to the
``separate-but-unequal'' legacy that has shackled the South for a
century:
</P>
<P>
   _ Poor Southerners are about eight times more likely to be
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 14 flagship state universities of the South and the
half-dozen most renowned private institutions enroll, collectively,
almost as many foreign students (7 percent) as African-Americans (8
percent) and other minorities (another 7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _ The South has added 14 million new jobs since 1970, but most
are concentrated in the lower-paying clerical, sales and service
fields. And it has been losing jobs in agriculture, coal, oil, gas,
skilled crafts, equipment operating and low-tech manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventy-two percent of whites are homeowners, while 46 percent
of minorities own their homes. Seventy percent of the homeless are
minorities, while 30 percent are white.
</P>
<P>
   _ The South's male prison population is 56 percent black, 29
percent white and 14 percent other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the South today _ indeed, in the entire nation _ skin color,
hair characteristics and nose shapes too often determine how people
vote, where they live, where their children go to school and what
dreams they dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet arrived at the beloved community,'' Lewis
said.

MODERNISM A BIT EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WENDY MOONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first designer who used his name as a marketing
tool, a la Ralph Lauren, was probably Christopher Dresser, an
English designer of household goods in the 1800s who stamped his
name on most of his products. Sadly, a name that had wide currency
in his time has had practically none in ours.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, David McFadden, chief curator of the
American Craft Museum, delivered a lecture on modern design. He
showed a sleek, streamlined soup tureen and asked if anyone could
identify its year and designer. The audience of design aficionados
was stumped. Some guessed it was from the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was from 1880, designed by Dresser. A similar tureen
is on display through Dec. 18 in ``Truth Beauty Power: Dr.
Christopher Dresser, 1834-1904,'' at Historical Design, a gallery
at 306 East 61st Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition is part of a renewed interest in Dresser: the
Metropolitan Museum of Art is organizing a major Dresser exhibition
for 2002, said Stewart Johnson, the museum's 20th-century-art
curator who is organizing the show.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a botanist, Dresser became one of the first
industrial designers specializing in domestic objects. He worked
for some 50 firms, creating carpets, ceramics, glass, furniture,
wallpaper and metalwork.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his design reflects a 19th-century enthusiasm for
exoticism and historicism. Dresser adapted medieval styles,
pre-Columbian shapes and ancient Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese
forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, he was typical of his age,'' said Barry
Harwood, a decorative arts curator at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
``Today, however, we focus more on his proto-modern period.'' The
architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, he added, called Dresser
``a pioneer of modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dresser's metalwork, in particular, looks as sleek as anything
in the Art Deco or Vienna Secessionist style, though it is much
earlier. Historical Design is selling 67 Dresser metalwork
creations, from sweetmeat baskets to andirons, toast racks to tea
sets, and they range from $3,750 for a silver letter rack to
$125,000 for a 16-inch-tall claret jug in sterling silver, glass
and ebony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 15 years to assemble this show,'' said Denis Gallion,
the gallery's owner. ``We discovered the pieces one by one, in
Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Europe and all over America.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years before Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus, when
everyone in Victorian England was piling on the ornament, Dresser
was equating functionality with beauty and producing reductive
design.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Voorsanger, a curator in American decorative arts at
the Metropolitan, suggested that Dresser might have been influenced
by the carafes, test tubes and utensils that he saw in laboratories
where he worked as a youth.
</P>
<P>
   Gallion said, ``He was the first to understand the potential of
the machine and how it could be used to make things affordable for
the people.'' In ``Christopher Dresser'' (Academy Editions, 1993),
the British art historian Stuart Durant calls him ``the first
modern product designer'' and says he ``reveled in the triumph of
the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, he was in disagreement with his richer British
contemporaries, like William Morris, who criticized the advances of
the industrial age and bemoaned the lack of handwork in the
production of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David A. Taylor, a scholar of material culture at the
Library of Congress, writes in the exhibition catalog, ``In his
acceptance of machines as highly useful vehicles for improving
people's lives through exposure to artful domestic objects, Dresser
was at odds with the social reformer John Ruskin and the designer
and socialist William Morris.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, at the Met, wondered why everyone remembers Morris and
no one recalls Dresser. ``Our show will try to answer that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dresser was prolific in every way. He would take a basic
geometric shape and adapt it for different uses. He particularly
favored the cone. He used it upside down as a candlestick and
right-side up for the bodies of tankards, silver teapots, creamers,
sugar bowls and cruet sets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his cones sit on trifooted metal stands. ``Many ancient
cultures had huge vessels for oil that rested on such stands,''
Gallion said. ``Dresser's had legs in the form of crow's feet,
which comes from ancient Egyptian culture. What's memorable is
their whimsical nature.''
</P>
<P>
   One teapot looks like a silver ostrich egg with stubby legs.
Another resembles a silver sugar cube sitting on a square platform.
A toast rack sports what resembles a line of silver Popsicle sticks
marching in tight formation. Another boasts a thatch of coiled
silver fiddlehead ferns. A silver spoon warmer could be mistaken
for a model of a lunar landing module. Perhaps these were meant to
amuse his 13 children.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresser exhibition is a good primer for those attending the
``Modernism and Photography'' fair this weekend at the Seventh
Regiment Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 66th Street (Friday through
Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   The 70 dealers (including Historical Design) are showing
Esthetic Movement, Art Nouveau, Vienna Secessionist, Art Deco,
French 40s, Italian modern and American 50s furniture and
decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   A Baltimore gallery, the Fourth Quarter, has a sterling Dresser
bonbon dish ($3,200) and a Dresser picnic tea kettle, caddy and
burner ($1,200). Now that the Met exhibition has been announced,
carpe diem.
</P>
<P>
   ____
</P>
<P>
   One common problem collectors face is how to display their
treasures. To address that, Alistair McAlpine, who was deputy
chairman of the Conservative Party in Britain when Margaret
Thatcher was Prime Minister, has written ``Collecting and
Display,'' with Cathy Giangrande, a museum conservationist (Conran
Octopus, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   McAlpine knows his subject. He has assembled, then dispersed
several collections, including historic buildings, rare breeds of
animals (chickens, pigs and cows), garden ornaments, modern
paintings and vintage photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get what I want out of the collections,'' he said, ``then I
sell them or give them away.'' McAlpine is not preachy. ``You can
collect whatever you like,'' he said. ``The fact you collect it is
what makes it important, not its value. The problem is where to put
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The 240 color photos in the book include one of a room full of
Hermes signature orange boxes, in precariously balanced stacks; a
stair hall with swords arranged in complex geometric patterns, and
a wall with a column of sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   There are lists of restorers, framers, sources for display
units, lighting specialists and conservation organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McAlpine is particularly inspired by Sir John Soane, the
18th-century neo-classical British architect who covered every inch
of his walls with architectural fragments, paintings, archeological
treasures, plaster busts, you name it. Soane's London house is now
a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays McAlpine makes a splash wearing his newest collecting
passion: 1960s vintage plaid suits and Pucci silk ties.

 &HT;    Takin' care of the blues
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_It's near midnight at the Northside Tavern, and South
Carolina bluesman Cootie Stark, dressed in a sharp, double-breasted
jacket, sits at the bar, puffing a stogie and sipping Johnny Walker
Red. Tonight Stark, 72, is a spectator. Onstage, Danny ``Mudcat''
Dudeck, an Atlanta bluesman from the next generation, runs a
bottleneck slide over his Kay six-string and sings about an
alligator-wrestling Louisiana woman with coal-black hair.
</P>
<P>
   What song is that? ``I don't know,'' says Stark appreciatively.
``I don't know if he's making it up or not. But you could do that.
That's the way it is in the blues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that's the way it is in life, too. Working as a street
musician for most of this century, Stark (born James Miller) has
invented his life as he's gone along, surviving and flying by the
seat of his pants.
</P>
<P>
   Though undiscovered (and unrecorded) by the folklorists and
blues labels, the blind bluesman traveled frequently from his
Greenville, S.C., home, and played throughout the Southeast, with
such artists as cultured vocalist Josh White, the Rev. Gary Davis
(a finger-style master from nearby Laurens, S.C.), medicine show
performer and Spartanburg native Pink Anderson and fellow
Greenvillian Baby Tate. Stark became a repository of blues history,
an untapped library of musical culture.
</P>
<P>
   It was no feather bed. Until recently, Stark, living alone in a
ghetto apartment on rice and chicken backs, could afford a cigar
only one week out of four. His disability check boosted his income
to about $4,000 a year, says record producer Tim Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, who'd already produced an album for the late Guitar
Gabriel, met Stark last year at a gig in Charleston, S.C. ``I knew
he had great talent, but he couldn't get a gig playing for $25 at a
pizza shop,'' says Duffy, 35, a blues enthusiast with a degree in
folklore from the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the fat cats came in. Duffy had made contacts in
the music industry through audio engineer Mark Levinson, and with
help from artists such as B.B. King, Eric Clapton and the Rolling
Stones, Duffy and Levinson created a fund for elderly musicians, to
help them pay light bills and buy dentures and hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   In this, its fifth year, the Music Maker Relief Foundation will
distribute about $150,000 to 70 different traditional musicians,
most, like Stark, from the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The shoestring non-profit, operating out of Duffy's home in
rural Pinnacle, N.C., received a giant bump upwards this year after
a friend in the advertising business brought Duffy together with
Winston cigarettes. The tobacco company R.J. Reynolds agreed to
fund a national tour of Music Maker artists, backed by a
multi-million-dollar promotional campaign with stylish
black-and-white ads in dozens of national publications.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-city Winston Blues Revival tour comes to Atlanta Thursday
when Stark performs at the Cotton Club with Atlanta artists Beverly
``Guitar'' Watkins and Dudeck, Athens harmonica powerhouse Neal
``Big Daddy'' Pattman and headliner Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   The national exposure from the Winston ad campaign and the
concert tour are a big step in the right direction for Duffy.
``It's huge man, this is the big time!'' he enthuses, just before
boarding a plane to the first gig in Chicago. ``We're being treated
like rock stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Multi-instrumentalist Taj Mahal, an elder statesman who has done
much to bring country and traditional blues to a popular audience,
is contributing his time and talent to Music Maker, helping with
performances and recording projects. ``Many of them are unsung
heroes,'' he says. ``The microphone just didn't travel to their
town.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fulfilling daily needs, Music Maker helps buy
high quality musical instruments for its artists, prowls the
country looking for undiscovered artists, and lines up work at
festivals and concerts. ``Just recently Cootie opened for
(17-year-old blues phenomenon) Jonny Lang in Berlin,'' notes Taj
Mahal,``and it was `Wow! Bang! So that's where it comes from!'''
</P>
<P>
   Music Maker bought a new Fender Mustang for Watkins and helped
set up a record date for her this fall, with veteran British blues
producer Mike Vernon (Fleetwood Mac, Otis Spann).
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 59, calls this flurry of activity ``the second time
around for me.'' In the 1960s, she played guitar around the South
with Piano Red during his Dr. Feelgood and the Interns phase.
Watkins was the Nurse. (``I didn't mind wearing the hat and the
skirt and the jacket, but I didn't want to wear those shoes.'')
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Duffy contacted Dudeck, looking for an
introduction to Georgia blueswoman Cora Mae Bryant, with whom
Dudeck had performed. He found out that Dudeck had been involved in
his own effort to support the blues since 1995, through his Giving
It Back Blues Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year, Dudeck gathers his musician friends at the
Northside Tavern to salute and raise money for selected Georgia
blues veterans. Honorees have included Stoney Brooks, Eddie Tigner
and Grady ``Fats'' Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a party for the whole blues family to get together,''
says Dudeck. The next festival will occur over the Thanksgiving
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Dudeck and Duffy realized they had much in common -- two young
guitar-playing college-educated white guys in love with an
African-American art form -- and they joined forces for this tour.
``He's got the gift,'' says Dudeck of Duffy, noting the North
Carolinian's ability to hob-knob with royalty on both sides of the
Atlantic. ``He knows how to talk to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy has high hopes. ``The music business is constantly saying
this isn't commercial enough,'' by which they mean blues won't sell
the million-unit threshold that makes it worth their while. But the
Robert Johnson box set sold a million, and with the right push, he
says, Cootie Stark could too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Cootie Stark could become a household name,'' says
Duffy. ``I want to believe that. Maybe through the powers that be,
something will slip through.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark is sanguine about the turn of events in his life. ``Ever
since Timmy came along, things have been good,`` he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the older you get, the more fun you gonna have, and I
believe them now,'' Stark told a writer for the Music Maker
newsletter. ``I just wish I had some of this a long time ago.''

   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Zegers, Cynthia Steveson and Gregory Harrison .
</P>
<P>
   Showing at area discount theaters, this sequel to ``Air Bud,''
Buddy, the hoop-shooting golden retriever, and his boy, Josh (Kevin
Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise, it's little more
than a glorified ``Afterschool Special,'' but it handles its
messages well. And in his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy looks
more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis.1 hour, 31 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' R (profanity, violence, sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   An ``X''-cessive mess. Edward Norton plays a reformed skinhead
trying to keep his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following
the same sick, dead-end path. Though it trafficks in racial
confrontations and ethnic slurs, it never delves any deeper than
the junk spewed out on ``Jerry Springer.'' But Norton is
phenomenal. He disturbs us; his movie doesn't.1 hour, 58 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' PG
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester
Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) whose love of Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world outside
the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable as the
spectacular visuals are not. 1 hour, 23 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a Stephen King novella, Bryan Singer's flawed but
chilling lesson in the infectious nature of evil stars Brad Renfro
as a teenager obssessed with the Holocaust who discovers an
infamous Nazi war criminal (Ian McKellen) living in his
neighborhood. In exchange for not turning him in, the boy makes him
recount in detail the atrocities he committed. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' PG-13 (profanity, sex and sci-fi action)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   The world interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon,'' showing at area discount theaters, never lets the
threat of global annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a
space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the
world for Liv Tyler. It's more enjoyable than ``Godzilla.'' But is
it good for you? Probably not. 2 hours, 24 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' R (violent images, sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Kimberly
Elise.
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently proves that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable. Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, who takes in the
mysterious stranger Beloved (Thandie Newton). Too faithful to
Morrison's magic-realist prose, the movie substitutes mood for
emotional power and narrative clarity. 2 hours, 52 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill'' R (profanity, sexual inuendo, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, William Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after its original release, Lawrence Kasdan's film
about some college pals from the '60s, reunited for a long weekend
by the suicide of one of their group, is more than a requiem for
that era. The picture is about friendship, change, coping, lost
ideals, found strengths and, perhaps most of all, about the many
ways we give life to those we care about. 1 hour, 43 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever After'' PG-13 (violence and emotional situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott and Anjelica Huston.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After,'' showing at area discount theaters,
proves you can teach an old doll new tricks. Reinventing the
Cinderella story in a way that targets ``Titanic''-loving teens,
the movie stars Drew Barrymore as the spirited heroine, Anjelica
Huston as her scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince
who's more than just another trophy husband. 2 hours. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween: H20'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett and Adam Arkin.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween,'' opening
at area discount theaters today. Also back is Michael Myers, the
maniac who stalked Curtis all those years ago. You can easily guess
who'll survive and who'll get cut out of the picture. But when
Curtis stalks Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie finally
gets some juice.1 hour, 22 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' Unrated (plot contains pedophilia)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic movie title of the '90s.
This controversial film is a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly
comic look at several citizens of New Jersey whose lives are
defined by sexuality. Director Todd Solondz says he prefers the
expression ``sad comedy'' to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is
about as dark as they come. 2 hours, 14 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' PG (profanity, rude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college kid who has to hitch his
way home to New York in time for Christmas Eve. If he's late, he'll
lose the Porsche his dad has promised. This Disney comedy has some
clever moments as Thomas, a scam artist, has to learn the meaning
of family. But it aims too often for the farfetched. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' R (profanity, nudity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The vampires aren't the only things that suck. James Woods stars
as an expert vampire slayer employed by the Vatican. He meets his
match in a 600-year-old vampire with a vendetta against the church.
The movie starts out great, with Carpenter and his cast juggling
jokes and gore. But it loses focus and direction as it goes along
and ends up a jumbled disappointment. 1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrong-headed. Subtitles. 2 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' R (profanity, drug use, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah.
</P>
<P>
   A suddenly single fortysomething (Holly Hunter) leaves her tony
Upper East Side co-op and ventures into new territory, a crosstown
jazz bar, where she becomes friends with the resident torch singer
(Queen Latifah), and a ``kinda'' relationship with her building's
elevator operator (Danny DeVito). The tone is bittersweet, the
story unresolved, but the performances are fresh and funny.1 hour,
33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas and Catherine
Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right, showing at area discount theaters. Our
men in black are Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, who double
our swashbuckling pleasure and double our fun as dual Zorros,
saving California and Hopkins' beautiful, spirited daughter
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil schemes of one Don Rafael
(Stuart Wilson).
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 16 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' PG-13 (profanity, some sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Clair Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest's ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday'' wastes a good cast, led by Anthony Hopkins. It's more
interested in corporate politics than the romance between Clair
Forlani and Brad Pitt, playing a puppyish Grim Reaper. 2 hours, 54
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller showing at area discount
theaters, Samuel L. Jackson plays a Chicago hostage negotiator
framed for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he
takes four hostages, then asks another negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to
act as a mediator between himself and the police. The film's main
kick is the duel of bluffs and counter-bluffs between Spacey and
Jackson. 2 hours, 15 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Night at the Roxbury'' PG-13 (profanity and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Dan Hedaya, Molly Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Those head-bopping, nightclubbing brothers from ``Saturday Night
Live'' are out in a full-fledged story. The central characters are
a couple of clueless, would-be coolsters whose dream is getting
into and owning the hottest club in town. Lots of groaningly funny
lines and a surprisingly coherent storyline make this a fun,
thankfully concise viewing experience.1 hour, 23 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``One Tough Cop'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Baldwin , Chris Penn and Mike McGlone .
</P>
<P>
   Opening at area discount theaters today, Stephen Baldwin stars
as an NYPD detective torn between duty to his badge or to a
childhood pal (Mike McGlone) who is now a member of a crime family.
This solid cop procedural is fact-based, but plays like a dozen
fictional flicks you've seen before.1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' PG-13 (sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom, and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n roll to
the black-and-white world. The movie gets preachy in its second
half. But the performances (in a cast including Joan Allen and
William H. Macy) and the lustrous mix of monochrome and color keep
you hooked.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Practical Magic'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play unalike sisters with one
strong bond: They're witches. In the lively film version of the
Alice Hoffman novel, the two deal with backfired spells and that
most unpredictable magic, love. Co-starring Aidan Quinn, Dianne
Wieste and Stockard Channing, it's lightweight but works like a
charm. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 45 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronin'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro and Jean Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Ronin are shamed samurai who, having lost their master, are for
hire. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno lead some modern-day ``ronin'' _
Cold Warriors without a war _ hired to snatch a mysterious
suitcase. John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian Candidate'') and an
unbilled David Mamet (``The Spanish Prisoner'') bring a cool
professional touch to this action-suspense-thriller. 1 hour, 58
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Rush Hour'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Kung Fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. Chan and Tucker learn to work together, in part by
imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one works.1 hour, 37
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' R (violence, profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be worse: a series of terrorist bombings of New
York, or the martial-law takeover by the Army as a response? Denzel
Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis star in a fast-moving,
well-made paranoid thriller that ultimately reduces a hot-button
topic to a standard Hollywood action cliche.1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch'' PG (sexual innuendo and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Michael Smith and Joseph Mazzello.
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems, showing at area discount
theaters. In the early '60s, a pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon
Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is convinced he will one day be a hero
while his best pal (Joseph Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of
his real father (Ashley Judd is Mazzello's close-mouthed mom). The
movie is clearly a labor of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit
through. 1 hour, 50 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' R (profanity and comic sexual
content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high
school senior who suffers a bathroom mishap that keeps him from
attending his prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz).
Thirteen years later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down. The movie is liberating in its
scatological, slapstick way. But the easy-to-offend should find
something more polite to watch. 1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Legend'' R (gore, profanity and animal abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alicia Witt and Jared Leto.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt and Jared Leto star in the latest knockoff of
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The
college-campus, teen-kill thriller is slickly made, well played,
instantly forgettable.1 hour, 39 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' R (sex, profanity, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Rhys Myers, Ewan McGregor, Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   There is more style than substance in this glitter-and-be-gay
recreation of the glam-rock scene in early '70s London. Jonathan
Rhys Meyers has the central role of a rock star whose abrupt
disappearance becomes the object of a search conducted by a
former-fan-turned-journalist. The second half is hopelessly
scattered, but the soundtrack is terrific, as is Ewan McGregor as a
Dionysian rocker. 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' re-write about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be okay if there were more laughs. But
Kathy Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' PG-13 (emotional and visual intensity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In this tearjerker Robin Williams stars as a doctor exploring
aspects of the afterlife after he's killed in a car crash.
Annabella Sciorra is his widow; Cuba Gooding Jr., his spiritual
guide. The movie is emotionally and visually stunning, a little
simplistic story-wise. Sometimes simplistic can be startlingly
close to primal. Check your cynicism at the door and bring a box of
Kleenex. 1 hour, 46 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger, Margaret Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   An all-time favorite. Based on L. Frank Baum's classic
children's story, the movie opened in 1939, with Judy Garland
playing Dorothy, who, with her dog Toto, is blown out of Kansas by
a twister and into the Land of Oz. On the yellow brick road they
meet up with the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow as
they sing and dance their way toward the Emerald City.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 41 minutes. A

RANDY NEWMAN'S SONGS MIX HUMOR AND BARBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Randy Newman made short work of his ostensible reason
for performing at Town Hall on Tuesday night. He was opening a
five-night festival of film music presented by the Knitting
Factory, and since the 1980s, Newman has spent most of his career
writing soundtracks for movies, including ``Ragtime,''
``Parenthood,'' ``Toy Story,'' ``The Natural'' and, lately,
``Pleasantville'' and ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing film music, he said, is ``a well-paying job, but it
hints of serfdom.'' But performing alone at the piano, he stuck to
songs _ a few new ones and many from the 1970s _ rather than
soundtracks. Nobody minded.
</P>
<P>
   Both Newman's songs and film scores invoke his broad musical
erudition: gospel and Tin Pan Alley, blues and country, Fats
Domino, Stephen Foster, Chopin, Hoagy Carmichael, Gershwin, Weill,
Copland. He can turn a moment bittersweet by letting major chords
crumple into minor ones; he can write music-box waltzes and ardent
choruses. And his pristine solo piano arrangements move from
barrelhouse vamps to etched-glass classical harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   A new four-CD retrospective of Newman's work, ``Guilty: 30
Years'' (Reprise), includes some of the pretty melodies Hollywood
has gotten out of him. His blend of pop, romanticism and Americana
skillfully tugs heartstrings. But his songs carry more twists than
his film scores, as if they've added Brecht to Weill. While
Newman's stolidly unglamorous voice pushes against his ingratiating
tunes, his lyrics implicate both singer and listener in unsavory
human impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Newman described ``Toy Story'' from the composer's point of
view. ``It starts with a song,'' he said, and explained that it
continued with instrumental music. ``But you can hardly hear it
because they're talking over it,'' he said as he played some
tinkles and rumbles. ``Then it's Christmastime, and there's another
song, and that's the end of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   That purely self-centered perspective runs through some of
Newman's most durable songs, among them ``Marie,'' in which a man
professes love for a woman he mistreats, and ``Old Man,'' in which
a son tells his ailing father, ``Everybody dies.'' The misanthropic
humor of older material, like ``God's Song'' and ``Political
Science,'' still has bite, even with familiar punch lines. And
Newman's American travelogues, like ``Burn On,'' ``Baltimore'' and
``Louisiana 1927,'' are ambivalent to the core, blending unsparing
observation with choruses that sound consoling despite themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At Town Hall, Newman toyed with levels of irony, adding
voice-overs as he played; he pitched his pop-gospel ballad ``I Want
You To Hurt Like I Do'' as a potential celebrity anthem, like ``We
Are the World.'' But he doesn't let anyone off the hook. He noted
that his songs often use ``bad narrators,'' but continued, ``Then
you later find that they're you.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's 1990s movie songs, like ``You've Got a Friend in Me,''
might startle longtime fans precisely because they don't have a
dark side. But when writing for himself, he hasn't given up his
barbs.
</P>
<P>
   One new song is a mock-pompous march about colonialist genocide;
Canary Islands natives, he sang, faced ``bullets, disease, the
Portuguese/they weren't there anymore.'' Another new song was a
tender-sounding ballad in which the singer confesses ``I miss you''
to someone he broke up with 20 years ago; then he observes, ``You
must be laughing yourself sick.''
</P>
<P>
   If Newman's songs were movies, they wouldn't be the Hollywood
heartwarmers that he scores. They'd be flinty little independent
films, finely detailed and too smart for comfort.

   JONESTOWN-MASSACRE-HNS (San Francisco) _ A lone palm tree stands
where Jim Jones exhorted his followers to die for him, but the
jungle encroaches even as time shrouds memories of Jones, his
Peoples Temple and his followers' quest for a better world. Now 20
years after the murder-suicide of hundreds of people, questions _

   ABORTION-UNDERGROUND-NYT (Rochester, N.Y.) _ By outward
appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary. But one thing sets
Mrs. Hayes apart from her neighbors. As a devoted opponent of
abortion, the 43-year-old mother of nine regularly plays host to a
series of traveling speakers, priests and protesters _ many of whom
have come to Rochester intent upon spreading the word against
abortion and shutting down clinics that provide it. She is one of

`GOD OF THE RODEO': SHOW TIME FOR COWBOYS AT THE EDGE OF THE
EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rodeo in Daniel Bergner's ``God of the Rodeo'' is the annual
competition held among the inmates of Angola, Louisiana's notorious
maximum-security prison. It is a bloody competition, known as ``The
Wildest Show in the South,'' that pits untrained convicts against
wild bulls, a gladiatorial spectacle that routinely results in
broken shoulders, wrists and ribs, and sometimes death and
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   The event's draw, Bergner writes, comes from ``the thrill of
watching men in terror made forgivable because the men were
murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergner, a reporter and novelist, however, was in search of
something more elusive at the 1996 rodeo. He was in search, he
writes, of redemption, of ``possibilities of exaltation, hints of
triumphant skill, of tremendous self-control in men who'd wound up
here because they'd had little self-control at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Bergner would stay on at Angola after the
rodeo, and while his year's visit would not give him the ``soothing
affirmation'' he sought, he says he would come to understand ``what
life, what striving, what humanity'' was possible in Angola, ``what
people pushed to the absolute limit, pushed by their own deeds
beyond the edge of human society, to a place that felt like the
edge of the earth, were capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a harrowing yet humane book that gives the reader
a compelling inside look at what inmates call the ``Louisiana State
Penitentiary. LSP. Last Slave Plantation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 5,000 men incarcerated at Angola, Bergner tells us, 85
percent have killed, raped or robbed with violence: ``About 8 in 10
were sentenced either to life without parole or to so many years
they might as well have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Angola's population, we're told, live in cavernous dorms
where the cots stand two feet apart and where each inmate lives out
of two state-issued lockers (about 18 by 18 by 24 inches).
</P>
<P>
   A single television set blares over the sound of industrial fans
(used to reduce the risk of tuberculosis); the steel toilets are
partitionless and exposed to the dorm. The inmates are paid 4 to 20
cents an hour for their work as farmhands, clerks and orderlies;
the few who win release are set free with $10 and the price of a
bus ticket home.
</P>
<P>
   While Bergner comes to Angola with admiration for its warden,
Burl Cain _ who is reputed to have instituted reform and a belief
in the possibility of redemption _ he soon becomes disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   He says that midway through his visit, the warden made ``it
plain that my continued presence at Angola depended on my paying
him,'' and adds that he was eventually compelled to take legal
action to insure that he could complete his reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Bergner not only suggests that Cain tried to profit from private
business deals set up at the prison under his tenure, but also
argues that many of the more vaunted reforms at Angola (like a
literacy program, a Toastmasters club and other activities for the
inmates) were less Cain's doing than that of his predecessors or
underlings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bergner's assessment of Cain is not terribly rigorous
or systematic, he is not really interested in writing an
investigative report on the prison. What he is interested in doing
is creating an impressionistic picture of life within its walls,
and in this he most eloquently succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tactile, novelistic quality to Bergner's portraits of
the inmates he interviews, an attempt to understand both how they
came to be incarcerated at Angola and how they cope with life there
_ with little or no prospect of release.
</P>
<P>
   Among the inmates Bergner profiles, there is Terry Hawkins,
serving a life sentence for murdering his boss with a meat ax, a
crime he relives virtually every night, and will try to expiate by
attending a Bible study class.
</P>
<P>
   There's Buckkey Lasseigne, sentenced for shooting a gas station
attendant while high on PCP, a resigned man who dreams only of
winning the all-around rodeo prize so he can give the prize-winning
belt to his distant 16-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Danny Fabre, a violent inmate who killed a woman and
drove a stick through her skull, and who now wants to improve
himself by going to school and learning to give speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Most moving among Bergner's portraits, however, are Johnny
Brooks, a would-be cowboy whose submissive demeanor has won him
some tiny perks from the prison administration (like getting to
wear a baseball hat and T-shirt of his own choosing); and Littell
Harris, a former inmate trying to adapt to life outside Angola
after serving a 15-year sentence for armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, we learn, takes great pride in his annual chance to
demonstrate his riding skills at the annual October rodeo. Like
many inmates, he regards it as his one chance to win recognition
from the outside world, and it is through the rodeo that he meets
his future wife, Belva, who writes him a letter after seeing him
perform.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she is making a two-and-a-half-hour trip to visit him at
Angola, and within a year, the two are married. Brooks starts
dreaming of getting rid of his ``alphabets'' (L-I-F-E), and getting
some numbers (a finite number of years) instead. He dreams of
starting a new family with Belva and her children, and beginning
over.
</P>
<P>
   As for Terry Hawkins, he does begin to make a new life for
himself: after his release, he moves to a drug treatment center,
and from there to a halfway house. When Bergner last checks in with
him, he is working for a small trucking company, driving a route
between Oregon and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his need to `establish' himself,'' Bergner writes, ``he
drives at least the legal limit of 10 hours per day. He earns 23
cents per mile. He pays his expenses on the road. It is not much of
a living, but it is a living.''
</P>

REPORT FAULTS FEDERAL AGENCIES IN DEATH OF YOUNG TEXAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Marines and Border Patrol officials were
negligent in the death of a young Texan who was tending his
family's goats when he was shot by an anti-drug surveillance patrol
on the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a congressional report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Marines involved in the incident failed to give
emergency aid to Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, who died about a half
hour after the May 20, 1997, shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The 249-page report ``tells the story of how two powerful
federal agencies ... were negligent in the shooting and killing''
of Hernandez, said Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both agencies made serious mistakes that contributed to this
terrible tragedy,'' said Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the Justice and Defense departments of not
disclosing information about the deadly encounter near the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``They withheld necessary information that had the effect of
seriously crippling any possibility of finding the truth in a
criminal investigation,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman did not return calls seeking
comment. The Marines released a statement saying that while the
death ``was tragic,'' there was no criminal wrongdoing and the
patrol ``complied with the rules of engagement and acted to protect
a fellow Marine.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Hernandez family agreed to a $1.9 million
out-of-court settlement with the federal government over the death.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusions in the congressional report mirror those reached
earlier this year in an inquiry conducted for the Marines by
retired Maj. Gen. J.T. Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne found the four-man Marine patrol was inadequately trained
for the mission, lacked thorough knowledge of the area, and had
poor communications with their superiors, who were 70 miles away.
The report also questioned the use of troops for law-enforcement
purposes on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also investigated whether there were
civil rights violations involved in the shooting, but the probe was
closed without public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Documents obtained by congressional investigators show that
Justice Department attorneys believed Hernandez's wounds and
statements by Lance Cpl. Ronald Wieler Jr., who was part of the
patrol, contradict the claim that the shooting was an act of self
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Clemente Banuelos told investigators that Hernandez raised
a .22-caliber rifle to fire at one member of the patrol. Banuelos
said he fired to protect the Marine.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy and information gathered by Texas Rangers and FBI
agents, however, question whether the goat herder was raising a
rifle to fire at the Marines, who were camouflaged in shredded
burlap and facial paints, ``or raising his hands to surrender,''
the congressional report said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place on the outskirts Hernandez's hometown of
Redford, an agricultural town in the sparsely populated Big Bend
region of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional documents show that the Justice Department
sought immunity for the Marines to protect them from state
prosecutors who wanted to take the shooting before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting subsequently went before state and federal grand
juries, but neither issued an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, a year and a half later, it is impossible to tell
exactly how Hernandez died,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the congressional investigation did not look into
whether the four Marines were criminally responsible for the death.
Banuelos has since received an honorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has reprimanded supervisory personnel over the
incident and criticized the lack of training and preparations that
the four men were given.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department should do its job right and hold
accountable those responsible for this needless death,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting raised questions about whether soldiers should be
used to bolster civilian agencies in patrolling the borders for
drug smugglers and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol, which is part of the Justice Department, has
issued operational changes that would place law enforcement agents
in surveillance positions where contact with civilians is likely,
and relegating military personnel to administrative-type roles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, military patrols along the U.S.DMexico
border have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, said that suspension should be
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers are trained to kill, not police. That's the problem.
It's unfortunate that this young man's life was taken. It's
unfortunate they tried to cover it up,'' Rodriguez said.

GET A LIFE TO GO WITH YOUR JOB

  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I am a 57-year-old bachelor, and have a demanding job
that I enjoy although it leaves me too exhausted to do anything at
night. My company is offering an early retirement package. I'm
thinking of accepting it, but I worry about not having enough to do
with my time and becoming bored and morose. _ Detroit
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Look, if you've been in that job all those years, you
know how to do it. Your exhaustion at the end of the day is most
likely psychological, not physiological.
</P>
<P>
   What I want you to do before making a decision is get yourself a
life. Join a club, work on a political campaign, take dancing
lessons. Get out of the house and see if you can make a life WITH
your job.
</P>
<P>
   My concern is that you have been completely defined by your
work. Take the work away and you may have nothing left. But if you
can define a life for yourself, you'll have the best of all worlds.
You'll likely find your work isn't as time-consuming as you
thought. And if your life outside of work feels just too fabulous,
you can opt for early retirement. Just don't retire from life by
hiding behind work.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My mother died when I was 16, and my father moved out
shortly later. Now 10 years later he lives in South America with a
new wife and three stepdaughters. He never calls, writes or tries
to help me or my sister here in the States. Should I write him out
of my life or call and tell him off? I'm too angry to forgive and
forget, but holding onto this anger is not good. My sister wants
nothing to do with him. What should I do? _ Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I would have never guessed that what you're talking
about happened 10 years ago. Clearly you are keeping this anger
alive. Admittedly it is hard to lose your mom. I'm sure you feel
you lost your dad at the same time, but you didn't. Your father
went on with his life, which is a perfectly legitimate thing to do.
My guess is that your behavior was not above reproach, so there may
need to be a little forgiving on both sides. I'd absolutely get in
touch with him. Not for his sake, but for yours.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, however: If you're getting in touch to say, ``Please
send money,'' he's not going to have much to do with you. But say,
``Gee, Dad, I'm now a little older, a little more grown-up. I'd
love to meet your children and your wife and have you as part of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin slowly building a bridge to him. You and your sister don't
have to act in concert. You can act on your own on this.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My closest friend has been involved with a married man
for almost two years. I firmly believe he will never leave his
wife. In fact, he still lives with her! I'm uncomfortable hanging
out with my friend and this man. I disapprove of her affair, but at
the same time I won't turn my back on her. Should I stay out of it
or tell her exactly how I feel? _ Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You are right when it comes to disapproving of your
friend's adultery, but take care not to lecture her about it.
Sermons and friendships are an unpalatable combination.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news. The good news is that you don't have to
listen to her talk about the dude. Tell your friend: ``I will
listen to you talk about anything in your life except George. And I
will hang out with you, but not with George. I'm not against him,
just the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, some months or years from now when it all hits the
fan and she ends up in tears, do her and yourself a favor by NOT
saying ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My ex-husband and his new wife, our former baby
sitter, just had a baby and now he's miffed at ME.
</P>
<P>
   She answered the phone when I called to discuss important
questions about our children's college expenses. I was polite but
businesslike, identifying myself and why I was calling, and
immediately asked to be passed on to her husband. He thinks I
should have chatted, asked about the baby, offered congratulations
_ and sent a baby gift.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's throwing up roadblocks whenever there's a decision
about our children. I've moved ahead with my life and don't want
him and his new family in it. Acting as though we are one big happy
extended family turns my stomach. Is this a question of my bad
manners? _ Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Good manners are always a worthwhile investment,
especially since this woman is going to be part of your life. You
can minimize wear and tear by contacting your ex at work or through
e-mail. And if your kids are in college they are old enough to make
money-calls to dad on their own.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's tough to be on your best behavior but if you can
behave it will make everyone's life much easier. And your families
are interwoven whether you like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to send a baby gift? Nah!

   A GOOFBALL GUY'S GUY
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Move over, Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest comedian in Hollywood is Adam Sandler, whose newest
film, ``The Waterboy,'' opened last weekend to an extraordinary $39
million box office and has held up through the week.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of Sandler's films _ like ``The Wedding Singer,''
``Happy Gilmore'' and ``Billy Madison'' _ have been hits, with that
figure, the 31-year-old comedian ascended into the top tier of
sought-after, big-money movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler is hardly a favorite among critics; his films often
receive a drubbing, and reviews are relegated to the back pages
(though Janet Maslin of The New York Times said ``The Waterboy''
was ``cheerfully outlandish'' and ``genuinely endearing''). But his
goofball and vulnerable persona have struck a chord among boys, his
largest audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's not understood by intellectuals, some critics put
his appeal down, which is a silly thing to do,'' said Phil Barlow,
who runs distribution for Walt Disney Studios, which made the
movie. ``He has a link to the psyche of an awful lot of people. It
has something to do with his vulnerability. People identify with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Waterboy,'' Sandler plays a socially inept youth from
the Louisiana swamps who, as a water boy for the college football
team, is turned into a devastating tackler. Disney executives said
the movie's largest audience was males from 8 to 35, with
teen-agers as the biggest group. The film has also brought in a
heavy contingent of teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Simonds, Sandler's longtime producer, said the comedian
knows exactly what he wants to accomplish in each movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain purity there,'' Simonds said. ``He's got a
very clear point of view on how he wants to be presented and what
he wants to say. Somehow that strikes into the heart of a very
loyal and growing following.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler has a reputation as a grown-up fraternity boy, spending
most of his free time with friends from his student days at New
York University, watching basketball and football games on a huge
television set.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, director and one of the producers of ``The
Waterboy'' were his roommates at NYU. ``I like working with people
I've seen in just a towel,'' Sandler once said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike De Luca, president of production at New Line Cinema, which
made Sandler's last film, ``The Wedding Singer,'' said the key to
the actor's success was his talent but also an almost innocent
persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a sentimental guy, and he makes sure that's part
of his comedy,'' De Luca said. ``He takes pains to make sure his
stories have a degree of heart. He doesn't alienate people and
covers every demographic, not just kids but older men and women,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, no one seems fully sure about why Sandler,
or anyone else, is such a big star.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew why, I'd bottle it,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Will Smith is a bit tired of what he calls bells and whistles,
although the movie star has little to complain about. Very little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had `Independence Day' and `Men in Black' back to back,''
Smith said. ``There were all the explosions and aliens and all the
bells and whistles you could possibly squeeze into a big summer
holiday movie. The simplicity of `Enemy of the State' was its
initial attraction. It was just a movie about a guy. No superhero
stunts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State,'' set to open next Friday, has had strong
advance word and seems likely to enhance the film career of Smith,
a rap star turned television comedian on ``The Fresh Prince of Bel
Air.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which was directed by Tony Scott and also stars Gene
Hackman and Jon Voight, is about a successful Washington lawyer
(Smith) who gets caught in a web of intrigue in which his every
move is tracked and recorded by rogue government agents.
</P>
<P>
   The film has overtones of Francis Ford Coppola's
``Conversation'' (1974) and Sydney Pollack's ``Three Days of the
Condor'' (1975).
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Smith said, he hoped making the film would be a
shrewd career move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've been out in front of a movie, and
essentially I'm telling my audience, `Come and see me act,' '' he
said. ``It's a mature film. It closes out my 20s and takes me into
my 30s. It's a well-written, intelligent political drama.''
</P>
<P>
   On another level, though, he said, he was simply interested in
the subject. The film's eerie depiction of government surveillance
and the lack of any semblance of privacy appealed to him; it also
appealed to the producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, usually noted for
unrestrained action movies like ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be followed, watched, listened to wherever you go;
there's nothing the government can't do,'' Bruckheimer said. ``And
the technology we use in the movie is actually 10 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith said: ``I am the ultimate conspiracy theorist. I spend 8
to 10 hours a week online finding new conspiracy theories. For this
film, we went to the CIA. We saw a recorder that you can implant in
one of your tooth fillings. We saw satellite surveillance of poppy
fields. All the technology that we show in the film exists for
real. The concept of privacy is obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he might take on another serious subject in his next
film, playing Muhammed Ali. (``I'm tailor-made for that role.'')
Meanwhile, he's working on ``The Wild, Wild West,'' based on the
1960s television show.
</P>
<P>
   Smith plays a special agent, James West, who with his buddy,
played by Kevin Kline, saves the world in 1869 from a madman,
played by Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Smith laughed. ``Lots of bells and whistles in that one,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I am the world's last person to be directing `Elizabeth,'''
said the film's director, Shekhar Kapur. ``When I was asked to
direct it, I thought, `This is an outrageous offer.' I was
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Bombay-born Kapur spoke with a laugh. After all,
though he is a top director in India, he had never directed a movie
outside that country, and all his films have been in Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was, directing a $24 million historical
extravaganza in Britain about the iron-willed 16th-century monarch
who overcame betrayal and conspiracy to transform herself into the
Virgin Queen, untouchable and married to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened last week in New York and Los Angeles to
strong reviews, expands nationwide next week. Its stars include
Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I; Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis
Walsingham, the queen's enigmatic spy master, and Joseph Fiennes
(brother of Ralph) as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the queen's
childhood sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Kapur is best known abroad for his 1994 drama, ``Bandit Queen,''
about the notorious female outlaw Phoolan Devi, who became a Robin
Hood figure in India.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the producers of ``Elizabeth'' seek him out?
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted something irreverent; they wanted someone to make
it alive and human and contemporary,'' he said. ``They wanted
someone who would question the very basis of all the assumptions
that people make about Elizabeth. So I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with too many historical films, Kapur said, was that
``they look at history and consign those people to the formality of
history.'' He added, ``But these historical figures were human
beings, contemporary to their times as much as we are to ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabeth in Kapur's film is not merely an all-powerful
woman who dominates England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it as a tragedy of a woman who had to drop life and love
and joyousness in favor of being a queen,'' Kapur said. ``I was at
a cinema in London where the film was playing, and I saw young
girls come out with tears in their eyes. One of them said this was
Princess Diana. After all, Diana's greatest fear was if she
continued to live in the Palace, she'd become a shell of a human
being. And this is what happened to Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapur is married to Suchitra Krishnamurti, who is one of the
biggest pop music stars in India. He studied economics in New Delhi
in the 1970s, then moved to Britain to find work as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Asian kids have to be doctors or lawyers or accountants,''
he said. ``When I came back and told my family I wanted to be in
the movie business, there was an uproar. I was 23. They thought it
was a passing phase.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for ``Elizabeth,'' Kapur said he spent weeks reading
biographies and histories, and found himself especially attracted
to the young, spirited and relatively unknown Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the film with a lot of admiration for her,'' he
said. ``I especially fell in love with the young girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapur said he found Elizabeth remarkably modern, not only as a
woman but as a politician. He said that with Walsingham's help, she
held a tight grip on public opinion. At one point, the two
destroyed all the paintings of Elizabeth except those she wanted to
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see her only in the image that she created,'' Kapur said.
``It was a classic case of spin-doctoring.''

STACKABLE, PLIABLE FUN IN TUTTI-FRUTTI COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRACE GLUECK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plastics were pretty dull stuff to have around the house until
the early 1960s, when new technologies for mass production
attracted the attention of home-furnishings designers. Inspired by
space-age innovations and pop art, the designers _ mostly European
postmodernists not unfriendly to kitsch _ seized on the potential
of plastics for bright, tutti-frutti colors, appealing surfaces and
sexy, rounded shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new plastic objects made their first appearance in
futuristic movies, like ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``Soylent
Green,'' warming up consumers to the bliss that awaited them before
the products themselves were actually on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Utilitarian and sometimes playful _ like a 1971 coat rack of
polyurethane foam in the shape of a cartoony cactus _ the
designers' creations made light of traditional furniture, with its
historical baggage and dust-collecting details. In fact, the
material itself affected the aesthetics of plastic objects, which
could be stacked, easily moved and arranged in modular groupings by
their purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   But the plastics carnival that began in the early 1960s was
short-lived. By the mid-1970s, when the cost of petroleum (crucial
to plastics) went through the roof, designers turned back to more
conventional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Now this razzle-dazzle era has been reprised in ``Pop Goes the
Plastic,'' a show at the Katonah Museum of Art in Katonah, N.Y. On
view is just about as much as you want to see of the ``fun''
furniture, lighting equipment, inflatables, electronic gear,
fashions, decorative accessories and various works of pop art that
partook of the plastics revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The show was organized by the Atlanta International Museum of
Art and Design, with Scott Reilly, an art historian who specializes
in design of that era, serving as guest curator.
</P>
<P>
   Seating is high on the show's agenda. One well-known example is
the inflatable armchair called ``Blow,'' made in 1967 by the design
team of Jonathan de Pas, Donato d'Urbino and Paolo Lomazzi for
Zanotta of Italy. Of transparent polyvinyl chloride (or PVC), this
feather-light but grandiose plopdown is actually a takeoff on
Eileen Gray's upholstered ``Bibendum'' chair of 1929, based on the
puffy Michelin Man logo of Michelin Tire Co.
</P>
<P>
   More corporeally, there is the bright red ``Tomato,'' made in
1971 by Eero Aarnio for Asko Oy of Finland. This plump, bulbous
affair of glass-reinforced polyester would seem to put the sitter
smack in the middle of an overripe tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Among several stackable chairs in the show, the cleverest is
``Cantilever,'' designed in 1960 (but not produced until the
technology became available in 1967) by Verner Panton for Herman
Miller Co. in the United States. Jointless and legless, this
all-of-one-piece affair with a modified ``S'' contour is supported
solely by the cantilevered seat, which also acts as its base.
</P>
<P>
   A lovable quality of plastic furniture was its flexibility.
Take, for example, the ``Modular Room Divider With Lighting
Elements,'' made in translucent white by Pierluigi Spadolini and
Paolo Felli for Kartell of Italy in 1969. It is composed of simple
single and double cylinders in two heights, which can be arranged
in a do-it-yourself grouping to serve as both room divider and
lighting unit.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Baby,'' the bright red mobile cart made in 1970
by Joe Colombo for Bieffeplast of Italy. An elegant wheeled affair
with well-orchestrated shelves, drawers and pockets, it could be
used for anything from holding tools to serving tea.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Brick System,'' devised in 1971 by de Pas, d'Urbino and
Lomazzi, has as its basic unit a Lego-like plastic brick, used to
build bookcases and other kinds of storage units. Another multi-use
item was ``Quattriquarti'' (1960), by Rodolfo Bonetto for Bernini
of Italy: small, legged units in bright orange that could be used
singly or grouped to form a serpentine shelf or table.
</P>
<P>
   In lighting devices, the gamut ran from ``Tatu,'' a small yellow
table lamp shaped like a piece of industrial duct and designed by
Andre Ricard for Metalarte of Spain in 1973, to ``KD-59,'' a robust
1980 white floor lamp by Annig Sarian for Kartell that is nothing
more than a bare, tapering column topped by a big round bulb.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly whimsical entry is ``Sinus'' (1972), by Ettore
Sottsass for Stilnovo of Italy, a vertical row of bulbs that looks
like a cross between a traffic signal and a makeup strip for an
actor's dressing table.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic goods in the show _ radios, television sets,
telephones, turntables, clocks and calculators _ were the most
affected by space-age design, housed in curvaceous casings that
echoed the shape of the moon and other sky bodies, with
techy-looking instrument panels.
</P>
<P>
   The TR-005, a 1972 tabletop television set by Panasonic cased in
silver-painted plastic, was cued by an astronaut's helmet; so was
the Weltron 2001 portable eight-track radio of 1970. JVC's Video
Capsule of 1972 was actually designed to look like a space re-entry
capsule, with a swiveling flip-up screen. Panasonic's Toot-a-Loop
from the same year was a bright red radio that curved around the
wrist like a bangle.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled through the show are cleverly designed household
accessories like bars, umbrella stands, wastebaskets, ashtrays,
bookends, magazine racks, tableware and an ice bucket.
</P>
<P>
   And the Katonah Museum has thoughtfully added to the original
exhibition a section devoted to fashions. Its bevy of outfits range
from a 1967 Courreges-designed ``Baby Doll'' dress of crinkly white
organza, paved with pink satin daisies and iridescent plastic
paillettes, to an ankle-length evening ensemble of the same year,
with matching coat and dress in thin gold plastic.
</P>
<P>
   And it would be hard to top the shoes designed by Herbert Levine
in 1967: patent leather, clear and silver vinyl that take the form
of mini racing cars.
</P>
<P>
   It may not reflect the greatest moment in industrial design, but
no one can say that this show fails to deliver the (ersatz) goods.
And for those who love Toys ``R'' Us, the appeal will be instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop Goes the Plastic'' remains at the Katonah Museum of Art,
Route 22 at Jay Street, in Katonah, N.Y., through Nov. 29.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN HISTORY X,' starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed but gut-slugging,
renounced by its director yet still a showcase for his effective,
in-your-face style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who develops
a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And its toughest
images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing, presented in
the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials, spins out of
control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and versatility, Norton
plays a savage, racist killer who learns the error of his ways
through simple-minded but brutally effective plot devices, and
through trying to protect his younger brother (Furlong). Hotheaded
and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `APT PUPIL,' directed by Bryan Singer. Starring Ian McKellen and
Brad Renfro (R, 100 minutes). Adapted from the Stephen King novella
collection that seems to have been written under a lucky star (it
also yielded ``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption''),
this is a handsomely made film by the director of ``The Usual
Suspects,'' with some of the same misanthropic chill. But the
deftness with which Singer stages a war of nerves between an aged
Nazi and a cruelly inquisitive high school boy is more impressive
than the story itself, which loses much of its novelty as it goes
along. (Eventually, somebody is killed in a basement with a
shovel.) McKellen, who can also be seen playing a deeper role in
``Gods and Monsters,'' brings all his ingenuity to playing the
shrewd old war criminal, but there's nobody here to like (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BELOVED,' starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton
and Kimberly Elise. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 172 minutes). A
transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, with
all the complexity (and occasional opacity) that entails. Taking on
the most enticing yet daunting job of literary adaptation since
``The English Patient,'' Jonathan Demme succeeds in bringing the
novel's pulse to the screen. Though it begins too slowly and
literally, this daring effort escalates into a gripping,
imaginative film that mixes memories of slavery with the occult.
Its linchpin, Ms. Winfrey, is more often a person acting than an
intuitive actress. But she plays her character, a onetime slave
literally haunted by her past, with enough presence to hold the
film together. The other major performances are extraordinary,
especially Ms. Newton's in the bizarre title role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a psyche-bashing blowout is told with a
hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or sound,
and the effect is invigorating rather than austere. Imaginative
angles, nimble editing and agile camera work keep the film spinning
as a large Danish cast makes the festivities seem utterly real. The
central drama is Shakespeare for the tell-all age, as a patriarch
is haunted by past sins and vengeful children. ``It is quite a job
being toastmaster tonight,'' says one partygoer, putting it mildly
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CRUISE,' starring Timothy (Speed) Levitch. Directed and
produced by Bennett Miller (not rated; 76 minutes). Levitch, the
loquacious subject of Miller's fascinating documentary, is a
Manhattan tour-bus guide who happens also to be a sidewalk
philosopher, improvisatory poet and walking encyclopedia of New
York City history. More than anything, he is a free spirit.
Although he can be irritating at times, Levitch is a true original,
an erudite, intellectual version of a classic motor-mouthed New
York cabby. As he interweaves his personal story between spiels
about New York City landmarks, the city (beautifully photographed
in black and white) seems to come as alive as the man describing it
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,'' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen Elizabeth I
as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the monarch
as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled,
selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the
hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama
for those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
Queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman, afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at year's end, McKellen becomes
the deliciously urbane James Whale, playing the gay
``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the after-effects
of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet
him just as the present offers new fascination, in the Adonis-like
form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine) whom Whale finds mowing
his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film,
from a book by Christopher Bram, imagines what Whale's final days
may have been like while shaping a splendid character study, and a
droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides
ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized
housekeeper (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams and Dylan Baker. Directed by
Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than
his ``Welcome to the Doll House,'' this audacious, deadpan
filmmaker explores loneliness in his murderously funny fashion.
Outrageous touches _ none more so than its title _ come easily to
``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would surely have
brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloguing this film's
perverse details: what emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet
tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured
with enough acid precision to make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the
dartboard in a three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness.
Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a
respected doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget
(Maslin).
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize-winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIVING OUT LOUD,' starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen
Latifah. Directed by Richard LaGravenese (R, 102 minutes). Making
his directorial debut, this sensitive screenwriter remains very
much a writer, constructing a talky, introspective character study
laced with flights of musical fantasy. Ms. Hunter stiffly but
passionately plays a newly divorced woman trying to reinvent her
life. DeVito is warmly credible as a lonely elevator man who cares
for her. Queen Latifah is the film's most attention-getting figure,
in the small but glamorous role of a torchy nightclub singer.
Would-be Chekhovian touches abound in this story of lonely people,
but they don't make it jell (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen, William H. Macy and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Gary Ross
(PG-13, 116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a
back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise
of a 1950s television show, tends toward the black-and-white,
visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers
from the '90s try to awaken benighted '50s types from their slumber
is an attitude that wears thin. But in the meantime there are witty
tricks integrating color into black-and-white images, and nice
little touches abound. The cast is both poignant and amusing, with
Ms. Allen especially touching as a prefeminist housewife who's the
prime recipient of '90s hindsight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PRACTICAL MAGIC,' starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Griffin Dunne (PG-13, 105 minutes). A new look for
Halloween: super-cute. In a bouncy, bubble-brained movie with the
look of a shelter magazine, it's Barbie Joins a Coven time as the
stars shake long flossy hair and play witch sisters. They flounce
through a story (based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel) in which
magic is for dealing with menfolk, and brooms look all too cozily
at home. Fatuous and retrograde as this is, it's also guilty fun,
especially when Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are on hand to
play the senior witches of this family. Aidan Quinn plays clean-cut
Right without casting a spell (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIEGE,' starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and
Bruce Willis. Directed by Edward Zwick (R, 109 minutes). This
thriller about Arab terrorists in New York City starts out in
crisply efficient style, then evolves into a speechifying
consideration of civil liberties and constitutional rights. The FBI
(Washington, bringing teasing charm to an officious role), the CIA
(Ms. Bening as one brusque Mata Hari) and the military (Willis,
sneering evilly) all lock horns in a story that eventually sees New
York under martial law. (Inexplicably, the city's mayor doesn't
weigh in about this.) The screenplay is talky and carefully
evenhanded. It's much less forceful than the film's salacious
images of terrorism and Arab villains (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `VELVET GOLDMINE,' starring Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys Meyers,
Christian Bale and Toni Collette. Directed by Todd Haynes (R, 117
minutes). This dazzlingly surreal film reimagines the glam-rock
'70s as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality and sexual
possibility. And it offers a celestial ``Here's looking at you,
kid'' to the era's British pop flamboyance in general and to David
Bowie's chameleon heyday in particular. Haynes (``Safe''), a deeply
serious yet wildly experimental stylist, draws on influences from
Ken Russell to ``Citizen Kane'' to Fassbinder and winds up telling
his neo-psychedelic story the way operas do: blazing with exquisite
yet abstract passions, and with quite a lot to look at on the side.
An interest in its subject matter isn't a prerequisite for
penetrating the nostalgic world of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' but it
helps (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WATERBOY,' starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates and Fairuza
Balk. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG-13, 91 minutes). The team behind
``The Wedding Singer'' looks like honorary Farrelly brothers with a
comedy that, like ``There's Something About Mary,'' is both
cheerfully outlandish and genuinely endearing. Sandler plays an
``amazing 31-year-old freshman'' who morphs from ``water
distribution engineer'' to sports hero, and he succeeds in doing to
football whatever he did to golf in ``Happy Gilmore.'' There's a
lot more innocence to his happy-idiot antics here than there is in
many a film made specifically for children. Ms. Bates is a great
hoot as the waterboy's overprotective mama, perfectly in tune with
the film's sneaky sense of fun (Maslin).

   EDGAR G. ULMER RETROSPECTIVE. He served an apprenticeship with
geniuses like Max Reinhardt and F.W. Murnau. He directed in Berlin
with Robert Siodmak. When he arrived in Hollywood, he cast Boris
Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars for the first time in ``The
Black Cat'' (1934), regarded as a classic of the horror genre. He
ground out films by the score on Poverty Row, where the budgets
were minuscule and the scripts often wretched, but he had his
artistic freedom. And with snippets of film and even tinier budgets
and wages, he made movies for Yiddish- and Ukrainian-speaking and
black audiences. His name was Edgar G. Ulmer. He was born in Vienna
in 1904 and died in Los Angeles in 1972. From today through Dec. 3,
he will be the subject of a retrospective at the Film Forum, 209
West Houston Street, Manhattan, where 33 films, ranging across the
wide spectrum of Ulmer's work, will be screened. The series begins
Friday with a double feature of ``Detour'' (1945), his film noir
masterpiece, and ``The Man From Planet X'' (1951), a
science-fiction tale shot in six days on a set left over from
``Joan of Arc.'' Screening schedule and information: (212) 727-8110
(Lawrence Van Gelder).

THE BROTHER ACT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Bush brothers, George W. and Jeb, broke
the traditional Republican mold by attracting substantial votes
from women, blacks and Hispanics, they demonstrated they have
figured out something the rest of their party hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The core Republican base, rooted in the religious right wing,
has grown too narrow. To win, GOP candidates need help from voters
they previously scorned.
</P>
<P>
   The sons of former President George Bush defied the Democratic
trend in last week's elections by reaching out to liberal
constituencies normally resistant to the charms of the GOP. They
won statehouses in Texas and Florida with what they call
``compassionate conservatism,'' a vague concept that sounds more
friendly to women, blacks and Hispanics than familiar mean-spirited
GOP refrains that reflect the vested interests from which those
groups are often excluded.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's triumphant election to a second term as
governor of Texas has catapulted him to the forefront of GOP
presidential speculation, which gives him a national forum to
expound on his politics of inclusion. Without ever leaving Texas,
he even beat Vice President Al Gore by 12 points in a recent USA
Today/CNN/Gallup hypothetical match-up.
</P>
<P>
   He was re-elected with more than two thirds of the female vote,
70 percent of the independents, 60 percent of the moderates, nearly
a third of the Democratic liberals, three in 10 black votes and
nearly half of Hispanics. His brother Jeb similarly won with a
cross-section of voters, including women, blacks and 60 percent of
the Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, however, George W. Bush would have
a formidable task trying to modify the image of a party that has
long seemed overly preoccupied with appealing to white males while
ignoring everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bushes successfully stressed cooperation and conciliation
over confrontation, portraying themselves as working politicians
eager to govern responsibly. They downplayed the marginal wedge
issues that the social reformers in the GOP right wing love and
many voters find threatening. Instead, they emphasized pragmatic
steps to improve education and deal with other problems that
concern ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Competence is back. It should never have left. The Bushes
recycled Democrat Michael Dukakis's theme in his 1980 presidential
race against Ronald Reagan, during which Dukakis argued that the
future should not be about ideology but about competence. It didn't
work for him, but it was the fault of the messenger, not the
message. Dukakis was not competent.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders talk a good game about building ``a big
tent'' that would include minorities and women, but they too often
sound as though they think all they have to do is murmur sweet
nothings to lure Democratic-leaning voters. The GOP does not seem
to understand that the problem is policy, not public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The female gender gap that favors Democrats opened after the GOP
began crusading to criminalize abortion, wipe out popular
government agencies like the Department of Education, abolish
affirmative action programs, reverse the family leave act, block
gun control, discredit feminism and help private schools over
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, blacks have been turned off by insensitive
GOP stands _ ending affirmative action, ignoring the problems of
big inner cities, eliminating welfare and making fun of such
programs as midnight basketball that help primarily black children.
African Americans, traditionally the most loyal Democratic voters,
are also indignant about the gleeful GOP pursuit of impeachment of
a president who has championed diversity in education and the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, for their part, feel threatened by tough GOP
anti-immigration and English-only policies that single them out as
a special problem. And the Bush brothers have an advantage with
Hispanics that other GOP candidates do not have. Running in states
with huge Hispanic populations, they speak fluent Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bushes call themselves conservative. But Jeb projected a
softer philosophy this year than the hard-right candidate he seemed
to be four years ago when he lost to Gov. Lawton Chiles. And George
W., while anti-abortion and anti-gay rights, ducks those
inflammatory subjects whenever he can.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers come across as very like their father,
uncomfortable with ideological extremes and businesslike. The
family name has clearly been a political asset, although George W.
will have to overcome residual dismay in the GOP over Bill
Clinton's defeat of his father and the issueless campaign that the
senior Bush ran in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is unlikely to embrace ``compassionate
conservatism'' if it means tolerating the inclusion of views that
its leaders disagree with. George W. Bush is headed in the correct
direction, but he has his work cut out for him.

   NEW YORK _ In Jon Krakauer's best-selling book, ``Into Thin
Air,'' he recounts a disastrous 1996 expedition to Mount Everest.
Interspersed with the life-and-death drama on the summit are bits
of climbing lore that make readers share the urge to climb the
world's highest mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In one passage, Krakauer describes the Seven Summits, the
tallest peaks on each of the world's continents. In 1990, a pair of
adventurers set the seemingly unreachable goal of scaling all of
them in seven months _ and they succeeded with only hours to spare.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to perform a similar feat, one we believed no one had
ever attempted. Our goal: to scale nature's highest peaks in each
of the five boroughs of New York City. We even gave ourselves a
time limit: Five boroughs, five peaks, five days. What follows is a
log of our expedition:
</P>
<P>
   MANHATTAN'S MATTERHORN
</P>
<P>
   Day 1. First Ascent: 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   You would think in a city obsessed with superlatives _ ``bests''
and ``mosts'' _ the highest spot in Manhattan would be a well-known
fact. Instead, it is a matter of dispute.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Geology of New York City and Environs'' by
Christopher Schuberth, the top spot is ``a little over 260 feet''
above sea level and at the ``flagpole several hundred feet south of
the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire, according to Manhattan Borough Engineer Tony
Golata. His contour map puts it three-quarters of a mile to the
south, next to the lesser-known Bennett Park in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the expedition, we vow to settle this matter once and
for all. Since both peaks are in Washington Heights, we begin our
first campaign from the Dyckman Street Station of the No. 1 subway
train, elevation 10 feet above sea level. Trekking past a Hispanic
luncheonette and a Blockbuster video store, we cut left onto
Broadway. There, the sidewalk gradually begins to climb and the
tree-covered heights of Fort Tryon beckon. So long, flatlanders.
</P>
<P>
   Ascending the park's stone staircases, we immediately experience
the first difficult climbing of the day. While ``Into Thin Air''
describes hypothermia and even the swelling of the brain that
affect high-altitude climbers, the worst symptoms we encounter are
mild huffing and puffing.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes, we climb to a point level with the treetops
and emerge into the sunlight. In our quest for ``highs,'' we head
straight for the first possible summit: the Fort Tryon Park
flagpole. It turns out to be an ignoble peak with crummy views.
</P>
<P>
   There's no marker to indicate we've just conquered the island's
highest height and our intuition tells us Manhattan's real summit
lies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Heading south on Fort Washington Avenue, we pass the
prophetically named Hilltop Pharmacy and run smack into lovely
Bennett Park, a pocket of green surrounded by odd, Tudor-style
apartment buildings. We turn left onto Pinehurst Avenue and, with
growing excitement, we scan the 1.8-acre park. We spot an outcrop
of reddish rock rising gently perhaps three feet from the ground.
On it, a granite plaque from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey
reads: ``The Highest Natural Point on Manhattan: 265.05 Feet Above
Sea Level. USC &AMP; GS Datum.''
</P>
<P>
   Eureka. Scrambling to the top of the rock, we breathe in what
seems like thinner air and caress the summit's grainy surface. It's
an exhilarating feeling. After we've hopped down and are resting on
a park bench, we notice several toddlers and a pigeon summiting
after us.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Stern, 78, a math teacher who's walking her English
cocker spaniel in the park, informs us that many people actually
miss the decimal point on the plaque and think it says 26,505 feet.
</P>
<P>
   THE BRONX IS UP
</P>
<P>
   Day 1. Second Ascent: 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling pumped up after successfully scaling our first height,
we get back on the No. 1 train and head for the Bronx. Two
engineers for the Bronx borough president's office, Dan Donovan and
Bill Mouzon, have told us the Bronx's highest point is 284.5 feet
above sea level. They've even pinpointed the top spot on Grosvenor
Avenue a few feet north of 250th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a slight problem. North of 250th Street, Grosvenor
Avenue exists only on a map. ``They never extended the street,''
Donovan explains.
</P>
<P>
   When we get off the subway at Broadway and 242nd Street next to
Van Cortlandt Park, we leave the flat playing fields behind and
wander up into the hills to investigate. Ascending 246th Street, we
soon pass a sign that informs us we are entering Fieldston, a
``private community'' of ``private streets.''
</P>
<P>
   As we climb farther into the highlands, we notice the houses
here are large and eccentric. Some have castlelike turrets; others,
with steeply gabled roofs, look like witches' houses. The
atmosphere, if not thin, is definitely getting rare.
</P>
<P>
   We detour into a web of confusing side streets and make several
wrong turns. Finally, we turn on Goodridge Avenue, which sounds
promising until it dead-ends.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. we locate 250th Street and mount it to its pinnacle at
Grosvenor Avenue. There, we're confronted with the ugly truth: a
rusting fence topped with barbed wire. Grosvenor, indeed, does not
continue north of this point. Gazing through the chain-link fence
into a parcel of privately owned woodlands, we see a promising pile
of dark bedrock, almost hidden behind leafy maples. It's
tantalizingly close, yet there is no break in the fence that will
allow us to reach the summit.
</P>
<P>
   We feel like Everest climbers who reach the Hillary Step, just
200 vertical feet below the roof of the world, and must return
without reaching the summit. We are perhaps 10 vertical feet shy of
the Bronx's top spot. Drat.
</P>
<P>
   THE K-2 OF QUEENS
</P>
<P>
   Day 2. Third Ascent: 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   After yesterday's aborted ascent in the Bronx, we've agreed to
engage the help of an urban sherpa. Mike Greenman, a geologist with
the sub-surface section of the New York City Department of Design
and Construction, has arranged to reconnoiter with us in Queens at
the intersection of Little Neck Parkway and the Grand Central
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Greenman is not particularly acclimated to high elevations. In
fact, he has been farther beneath the city than above it _ 800 feet
below it during the construction of an underground tunnel. What
makes Greenman the ultimate guide for this expedition is that
during his 29 years working for the city, he's been on virtually
every street in the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The highest point in Queens is in Glen Oaks, a far-flung
neighborhood criss-crossed by a tangle of highways. The head of the
topographical bureau for Queens Borough Engineer Moghabhai Desai
has located the top spot for us: 258.2 feet above sea level on the
south side of the Grand Central Parkway. (Incidentally, K-2, a peak
in Kashmir, is 28,250 feet above sea level.)
</P>
<P>
   But how do we get there? A microscopic examination of Greenman's
topographical map reveals a tiny triangle with a dot in the middle,
presumably an elevation point. With his walkie-talkie in his back
pocket, our guide turns his back on the borough's suburban-style
homes and leads our ascent up the parkway's southern service road _
at a good clip.
</P>
<P>
   As we make the summit assault, traffic rages past on the asphalt
to our left, while, to our right, white golf carts whir along the
narrow paths of the Glen Oaks Golf Club. Somewhere hidden among the
links, a mockingbird chirps. After 10 minutes, the hill we've been
climbing begins to crest. The summit?
</P>
<P>
   We mark a spot with a stick beneath a black oak and, after
returning with Greenman's surveying rod, confirm that the exact
summit is only four inches away from our assessment. He pulls out a
can of spray paint and marks the spot with an X in fluorescent red.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate our successful summiting, we break out Snapples and
proudly survey the view: midday traffic on the Grand Central
Parkway below.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN'S HEIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Day 3. Fourth Ascent: 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wolfe's story ``Only the Dead Know Brooklyn'' provides
the leitmotif for our fourth campaign. It turns out the borough's
highest point is in Green-Wood Cemetery, a 478-acre necropolis
built atop a geologic formation appropriately called the terminal
moraine.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we have asked Greenman to join us. At the cemetery's
main gate he arrives with topographic map in hand and points at the
graveyard's northeast corner, where a crest rises to an elevation
of 220 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   We begin our ascent slowly so we can fully appreciate our
beautiful yet eerie surroundings. Green-Wood, which opened in 1840,
was originally intended to be a cemetery-cum-park, so great
emphasis was given to landscaping and plantings. Spread throughout
its hilly terrain are several picturesque ponds, which attract
wildlife, and the trees, given room to spread, have developed
massive green crowns. The gravestones are no less impressive. There
are granite obelisks and turn-of-the-century mausoleums built into
wooded hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   As we wend our way to the plateau, Greenman explains that the
terminal moraine marks the final resting spot of the last glacier
to cover North America during the Ice Age, which left behind a huge
load of boulders, rocks, gravel and sand that created the ridge
running through the cemetery. So, really, a dying glacier gave
Brooklyn its highest spot.
</P>
<P>
   We scramble up the grassy slope of the cemetery's summit and at
the pinnacle find a simple gray mausoleum where Philip and Latifee
Kiamie rest. Through a break in the trees we can just see the top
floors of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   After checking that there are no higher peaks in our vicinity,
Greenman announces that we have indeed summited. In respect to our
surroundings, we resist the urge to exchange high fives.
</P>
<P>
   Day 4. Rest.
</P>
<P>
   We spend the day planning our final ascent. Tomorrow, if all
goes well, we're going to bag the big one: New York City's highest
peak.
</P>
<P>
   STATEN ISLAND'S EVEREST
</P>
<P>
   Day 5. Fifth Ascent: 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 409.8 feet above sea level, Todt Hill on Staten Island is the
highest point on the Eastern seaboard south of Maine. It is a
formidable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   (A target of a different sort is offered by this borough's Fresh
Kills Landfill, dumping ground for the city's trash, which at 180
feet is taller than the Statue of Liberty, but this peak was
disqualified not only because of the clear discrepancy in height
with Todt Hill, but also because Fresh Kills was a man-made
mountain as opposed to a natural one.)
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the low country of Staten Island behind at the Dongan
Hills railway station, we travel light and fast up Seaview Avenue.
The climbing is steep, and the huffing and puffing, which has not
plagued us since Manhattan, returns. Adding to our discomfort, once
we enter the affluent, mansion-studded neighborhood of Todt Hill,
there are no sidewalks, and we're forced to sidle through a narrow
band of weeds on the side of Todt Hill Road to avoid being
flattened by speeding cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes of sucking exhaust alongside some of the city's
most expensive real estate brings us all the way to the top. At the
summit, at the intersection of Todt Hill Road and Ocean Terrace,
there is not much to look at. Just a 350-foot-tall radio antenna
surrounded by trees, and more traffic. In fact, we count 41 cars
driving across the roof of the city in a single minute. Still, we
congratulate ourselves for making a strategically perfect ascent.
</P>
<P>
   We descend by foot and bus to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal
and embark for Manhattan. Standing on the prow of the ferry,
watching the view of the skyline grow larger as we cross the
harbor, we reflect on our five-day, five-peak whirl and rejoice in
our current altitude: absolute zero.

and Construction, has arranged to reconnoiter with us in Queens at
the intersection of Little Neck Parkway and the Grand Central
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Greenman is not particularly acclimated to high elevations. In
fact, he has been farther beneath the city than above it _ 800 feet
below it during the construction of an underground tunnel. What
makes Greenman the ultimate guide for this expedition is that
during his 29 years working for the city, he's been on virtually
every street in the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The highest point in Queens is in Glen Oaks, a far-flung
neighborhood criss-crossed by a tangle of highways. The head of the
topographical bureau for Queens Borough Engineer Moghabhai Desai
has located the top spot for us: 258.2 feet above sea level on the
south side of the Grand Central Parkway. (Incidentally, K-2, a peak
in Kashmir, is 28,250 feet above sea level.)
</P>
<P>
   But how do we get there? A microscopic examination of Greenman's
topographical map reveals a tiny triangle with a dot in the middle,
presumably an elevation point. With his walkie-talkie in his back
pocket, our guide turns his back on the borough's suburban-style
homes and leads our ascent up the parkway's southern service road _
at a good clip.
</P>
<P>
   As we make the summit assault, traffic rages past on the asphalt
to our left, while, to our right, white golf carts whir along the
narrow paths of the Glen Oaks Golf Club. Somewhere hidden among the
links, a mockingbird chirps. After 10 minutes, the hill we've been
climbing begins to crest. The summit?
</P>
<P>
   We mark a spot with a stick beneath a black oak and, after
returning with Greenman's surveying rod, confirm that the exact
summit is only four inches away from our assessment. He pulls out a
can of spray paint and marks the spot with an X in fluorescent red.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate our successful summiting, we break out Snapples and
proudly survey the view: midday traffic on the Grand Central
Parkway below.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN'S HEIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Day 3. Fourth Ascent: 8:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wolfe's story ``Only the Dead Know Brooklyn'' provides
the leitmotif for our fourth campaign. It turns out the borough's
highest point is in Green-Wood Cemetery, a 478-acre necropolis
built atop a geologic formation appropriately called the terminal
moraine.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, we have asked Greenman to join us. At the cemetery's
main gate he arrives with topographic map in hand and points at the
graveyard's northeast corner, where a crest rises to an elevation
of 220 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   We begin our ascent slowly so we can fully appreciate our
beautiful yet eerie surroundings. Green-Wood, which opened in 1840,
was originally intended to be a cemetery-cum-park, so great
emphasis was given to landscaping and plantings. Spread throughout
its hilly terrain are several picturesque ponds, which attract
wildlife, and the trees, given room to spread, have developed
massive green crowns. The gravestones are no less impressive. There
are granite obelisks and turn-of-the-century mausoleums built into
wooded hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   As we wend our way to the plateau, Greenman explains that the
terminal moraine marks the final resting spot of the last glacier
to cover North America during the Ice Age, which left behind a huge
load of boulders, rocks, gravel and sand that created the ridge
running through the cemetery. So, really, a dying glacier gave
Brooklyn its highest spot.
</P>
<P>
   We scramble up the grassy slope of the cemetery's summit and at
the pinnacle find a simple gray mausoleum where Philip and Latifee
Kiamie rest. Through a break in the trees we can just see the top
floors of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   After checking that there are no higher peaks in our vicinity,
Greenman announces that we have indeed summited. In respect to our
surroundings, we resist the urge to exchange high fives.
</P>
<P>
   Day 4. Rest.
</P>
<P>
   We spend the day planning our final ascent. Tomorrow, if all
goes well, we're going to bag the big one: New York City's highest
peak.
</P>
<P>
   STATEN ISLAND'S EVEREST
</P>
<P>
   Day 5. Fifth Ascent: 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 409.8 feet above sea level, Todt Hill on Staten Island is the
highest point on the Eastern seaboard south of Maine. It is a
formidable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   (A target of a different sort is offered by this borough's Fresh
Kills Landfill, dumping ground for the city's trash, which at 180
feet is taller than the Statue of Liberty, but this peak was
disqualified not only because of the clear discrepancy in height
with Todt Hill, but also because Fresh Kills was a man-made
mountain as opposed to a natural one.)
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the low country of Staten Island behind at the Dongan
Hills railway station, we travel light and fast up Seaview Avenue.
The climbing is steep, and the huffing and puffing, which has not
plagued us since Manhattan, returns. Adding to our discomfort, once
we enter the affluent, mansion-studded neighborhood of Todt Hill,
there are no sidewalks, and we're forced to sidle through a narrow
band of weeds on the side of Todt Hill Road to avoid being
flattened by speeding cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes of sucking exhaust alongside some of the city's
most expensive real estate brings us all the way to the top. At the
summit, at the intersection of Todt Hill Road and Ocean Terrace,
there is not much to look at. Just a 350-foot-tall radio antenna
surrounded by trees, and more traffic. In fact, we count 41 cars
driving across the roof of the city in a single minute. Still, we
congratulate ourselves for making a strategically perfect ascent.
</P>
<P>
   We descend by foot and bus to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal
and embark for Manhattan. Standing on the prow of the ferry,
watching the view of the skyline grow larger as we cross the
harbor, we reflect on our five-day, five-peak whirl and rejoice in
our current altitude: absolute zero.

QUESTIONS, FEARS LINGER 20 YEARS AFTER JONESTOWN MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 15)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lone palm tree stands where Jim Jones exhorted
his followers to die for him, but the jungle encroaches even as
time shrouds memories of Jones, his Peoples Temple and his
followers' quest for a better world.
</P>
<P>
   Jonestown, located in the South American nation of Guyana, was
to have been a Utopian dream, free of racism, a haven for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Nov. 18, 1978, it became the scene of unspeakable horror
as Jones led his flock into the worst mass murder/suicide in modern
history. In a cataclysmic episode, more than 900 people, most of
them children or elderly, drank or were forced to drink
cyanide-spiked fruit punch at the behest of Jones, a
once-charismatic monomaniac who had curried favor with San
Francisco's left-leaning political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Others, children among them, died in murder-suicides in a hotel
room in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. Jones himself, by then
drug-addicted and mentally ill, died of a bullet to the head by an
unknown hand.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, do Jonestown and the Peoples Temple make
sense? And have any lessons been learned?
</P>
<P>
   Many say the primary impressions of Jonestown are the madness of
Jim Jones and the mounds of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Little attention has been paid to the real people who died at
Jonestown and why they were there. The Peoples Temple did not start
as a cult, some say, and most of those who died were decent people
hoping to improve the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   And, say others, too little attention has been paid to the fact
that the needs that attracted people to the Peoples Temple and the
forces that helped turn it from a social movement into a paranoid
and abusive cult still exist.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a fundamental lesson in Jonestown, it's that ``the
menace of cults still lingers; it's as real today as it was 20
years ago,'' said Jackie Speier, a survivor of the Port Kaituma,
Guyana, ambush that killed her boss, U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan, three
journalists and temple defector Patricia Parks. ``No one should
ever be so arrogant as to believe it couldn't happen again,''
Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Stoen, a former San Francisco assistant district
attorney who played a pivotal role in the life and death of the
Peoples Temple, said there was a thin line between legitimate
religious and social organizations and dangerous cults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is there probably will be some future Wacos if not
future Peoples Temples,'' Stoen said, referring to the fiery end of
David Koresh's Branch Davidian cult that claimed 81 lives in Texas
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there all over the place who would like
to be another Jim Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   James Warren Jones was born May 13, 1931, in Crete, Ind. He was
different from the beginning _ a Holy Roller preacher as a child,
selling spider monkeys on the streets of Indianapolis to buy food
as a young student and modeling himself after Father Divine, whose
Peace Mission drew a cult following at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In a credo that would refine and warp itself until the end, he
developed a set of professed beliefs, sometimes called ``apostolic
socialism,'' that ignored God while deifying social justice and
worshiping the salvific power of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   He became a student minister at an Indiana Methodist church in
1952. He left the Methodists because the church wouldn't
desegregate, and in the 1950s founded the movement that would take
various names as it evolved into the Peoples Temple. In 1965, Jones
and his wife, Marceline, took the nascent temple and a handful of
the faithful to California, the promised land for alternative
religions.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses and their rainbow family of adopted children and
about 70 followers settled at first in rural Northern California,
then relocated to San Francisco and Los Angeles. He moved the
Peoples Temple into an abandoned synagogue in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While attracting a growing congregation of urban blacks, he used
his considerable intellectual and acting skills to attract many of
San Francisco's leading politicians and then-Lt. Gov. Mervyn
Dymally.
</P>
<P>
   America in the late 1960s and early 1970s were ideally suited
for the rise of a charismatic power-seeker such as Jones. The civil
rights movement was still alive and the emerging politics of the
day exalted the quest for social justice and equality _ exactly the
things older religious blacks, idealistic young whites and others
were hearing from Jones' pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   But the politics of the day also fed the paranoia in Jones. He
believed the government was conspiring to continue the war in
Vietnam and spy on such groups as the Black Panthers. The
government was not to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   The government also was working covertly against Jones and the
temple, seeking to short-circuit the drive for a better society.
Jones believed all this and so, to an almost universal extent, did
his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones moved the temple and 1,000 or so followers to South
America, to Guyana's outback, leasing 3,852 acres in the Orinoco
River basin near the disputed border with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of temple pioneers moved in 1974 to what was to
become Jonestown, far from the hostile attacks of the news media,
government and others. The lease from Guyana's government required
the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project to ``cultivate and
beneficially occupy'' at least one-fifth of the land by 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Temple members raised livestock and grew tropical fruits and
vegetables. Charles Garry, the Peoples Temple's San Francisco
lawyer, called it a paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But there was trouble in paradise. The camp never became
agriculturally self-sufficient and swift tropical diseases ran
rampant. At the end, only one-third of the residents were
able-bodied. Worse, critics said, it was a prison camp _ people
were not allowed to leave. Abusive practices such as beatings and
forced sex, long-rumored but little-reported at the San Francisco
church, escalated. Jones' deteriorating mental stability made him
increasingly erratic and he demanded utter, unquestioning loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies were investigating or taking legal action
against the Peoples Temple for mail fraud, wresting Social Security
checks from members, arms and narcotics trafficking, and other
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding and abetting the conspiracy in the eyes of Jones and his
followers were the few temple defectors and families of members who
were getting attention from the hostile North American media.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Jones, who was white, and his
predominantly white inner circle, had faithful followers practice
mass suicide in a series of ``white nights.'' Such a drastic end
was the only possible response to the vast and growing outside
threat, according to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   His faithful believed him.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The final act began to unfold when Ryan, a respected Democratic
congressman from California with a taste for headlines, led a
delegation of newsmen and a group of family members called the
Concerned Relatives to Jonestown to investigate allegations of
thought control, imprisonment, and drug and gun running.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was knifed _ superficially _ during the visit. When he was
ready to leave, several Jonestown residents asked to leave with
him, an action that apparently triggered the subsequent killings of
Ryan and the others with him.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible scene of mass death quickly followed at
Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We died because you would not let us live,'' wrote temple
insider Annie Moore in her suicide note.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who survived was Jim Jones' son, Stephan, who was
away with the camp's basketball team. It was left to the younger
Jones, who had broken with his father and has denounced him
repeatedly, to declare Jim Jones' most durable epitaph. In a recent
ABC television visit to Jonestown, Stephan Jones said simply, ``My
father was a fraud.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While no one denies that Jones was a madman, some feel the
people of Jonestown have been unfairly characterized as mindless
zombies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who died in Jonestown were sweet, altruistic
people. One of the tragedies of Jonestown is that people haven't
paid attention to that,'' said Timothy Stoen, whose son, John
Victor, died at Jonestown. Stoen played the pivotal role in a
custody battle with Jones that helped precipitate the
murder-suicides. Among Ryan's reasons for going to Guyana was the
custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single theory could possibly explain the many complex and
related issues that led the members of the Peoples Temple to leave
family, friends and church communities and take residence in the
jungle of Jonestown,'' said Archie Smith Jr., professor of pastoral
psychology at the Pacific School of Religion and Graduate
Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif. ``Labeled by many as sick,
dysfunctional or disadvantaged, (they) were seeking an alternative
to the status quo, new and just ways of living and being in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Sawyer, an Iowa State University religion professor who
worked for Dymally at the time, blamed much of the image on
sensationalized media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of America quickly was persuaded that those who had
followed Jim Jones to Guyana ... had to have been naive and
gullible people at best, and demented radicals at worst,'' Sawyer
wrote in a treatise titled, ``My Lord, What a Mourning _ 20 Years
since Jonestown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amidst all the attention that was focused on Jim Jones, the
people were accorded scarcely any respect as thinking, feeling,
caring human beings. ... The dehumanizing of the victims of
Jonestown by the journalistic community was tantamount to the
withholding of permission to grieve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mary McCormick Maaga, a Jonestown scholar and a United
Methodist pastor in Sergeantsville, N.J., has written a new book,
``Hearing the Voices of Jonestown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to underplay the tragedy and loss of life, but I hope we
can now step one step back and look more at the community of people
who were involved and ask ourselves what went wrong in a more
sophisticated way,'' Maaga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we only talk about Jim Jones and his influence on
the community, we don't get to ask the broader questions. ...
Remember, Peoples Temple in the middle years was primarily a social
and political organization, not religious,'' Maaga said. ``The
members cared about caring for the elderly, the disenfranchised and
so on. They were not just blindly following.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peoples Temple at some point lost its ability to look
self-critically at itself and to challenge the decisions of the
leadership _ not just Jim Jones,'' he said. ``And Jones lost his
ability to lead because of his drug addiction and mental illness.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the benefit of hindsight, what can be learned from the
catastrophe that erupted from Jonestown?
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be talking about the fact that the menace of cults
still lingers,'' said Jackie Speier, who was elected to the
California Assembly after Jonestown and recently was elected to the
state Senate. ``Cults are still around. They're all around us. Many
continue to operate under the guise of being religious, under the
guise of religiosity and the First Amendment, violating state and
federal laws (while) the government again looks the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Warren Cromey, rector of San Francisco's Trinity
Episcopal Church, said that Jonestown created a distrust of
religion, particularly small sect religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the positive side,'' Cromey said, ``people are looking
more critically before getting involved in religious programs,
especially the more fringe type of things. Look at the kind of
scrutiny now given to Hare Krishna, Scientology and the like.
That's as it should be.''

BOOM, NOT GLOOM, IS GLOBAL ECONOMY'S FUTURE, AUTHOR ASSERTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the champagne corks pop at millennium parties, the globe
will have more to celebrate than the end of a wondrous thousand
years.
</P>
<P>
   As forecast guru Knight Kiplinger sees it, the best is yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   He delivers his optimistic prediction in, ``World Boom Ahead:
Why Business and Consumers Will Prosper'' (Kiplinger Books, $27.95,
404 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger is editor of ``The Kiplinger Letter,'' a leading
business-forecasting publication, and editor in chief of the
popular [ix]Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine.[nm] He has
covered business, economic and political trends for almost 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   And in two books published in the late '80s, he successfully
predicted a resurgence of the American economy in the '90s, despite
a more doom-and-gloom forecast by others.
</P>
<P>
   Now his opinion is as bright as ever, but this time he has
expanded his scope to the entire globe over the next 100 years.
Bottom line, he says: 21st-century global growth will double or
triple that of the past century, averaging at least 2 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   He defends his unabashedly rosy opinion with an analysis of
major turning points of this century, namely political trends away
from fascism, communism and colonialism; a freeing of the flow of
goods and capital; and the recognition of the talents of more than
half the world's population, namely women.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doubling or tripling of 20th-century growth is not a
pie-in-the-sky fantasy,'' he says. ``It's eminently doable because
the political and economic ideologies that stunted growth through
most of this century are discredited and in decline, freeing human
creativity and ambition to accomplish remarkable things.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States apparently will fare quite well in the global
resurgence, despite an increase in the pressure of low-wage
countries, Kiplinger predicts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States accounts for 22 percent of the world's total
annual output but less than 5 percent of its population, Kiplinger
writes. That share will diminish in 10 to 15 years as other
nations' growth increases, he predicts, but that doesn't mean a
decrease in personal income or standard of living in this country.
Those elements of the economy should continue to grow, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. will experience the seeming paradox of rising real
prosperity amid relative decline,'' Kiplinger writes. ``America's
increasing well-being will come about not despite the growing
economic power of the poorer nations, but because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world leader in technology and exporting, the United
States has the most to gain from the increased purchasing power of
poorer nations, Kiplinger writes. It will retain its world
leadership ``by maintaining its preeminence in scientific research,
its flexible military might and its uniquely successful
economic-development model, which will be emulated and adopted by
more nations around the globe,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand with this forecast, however, Kiplinger predicts
that the 21st century will labeled ``the Asian Century.'' The Asian
financial crisis that is affecting global economic growth will be
over in two years, he writes. And the correction will have closed
markets that politicians could not change themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions that fed Asia's economic miracle are still in
place, including geography, large and youthful populations, cheap
labor, and great determination to become manufacturing giants,'' he
writes. ``By 2020, it is likely that five of the world's six
largest economies will be Asian _ China, Japan, India, Indonesia
and a reunited Korea (the U.S. will occupy the number-two
position).''
</P>
<P>
   If those predictions tantalize your interest, the book will
surely be satisfying. Kiplinger examines a variety of topics in his
crystal ball, including global trends, biotechnology,
telecommunications, robotics, workplace issues, key industries and
even investments.
</P>
<P>
   Not all his predictions are made with rose-colored glasses. In
his chapter on threats to the world boom, he covers the
possibilities of widespread war, epidemics, nuclear or biological
terrorism, and a global computer or telecom breakdown. He estimates
that the risks are slight, but possible. There also will be
numerous regional slumps along the path of economic boom, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the fundamental changes swiftly coming to fruition in
the global business world may leave many a dead corporation in
their path, Kiplinger warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you prepare for them and adapt your way of thinking,
working and viewing the world, you will prosper mightily,'' he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Reading this book may be the first step necessary in that
preparation.

   ``Disgruntled: The Darker Side of the World of Work''
</P>
<P>
   By Daniel S. Levine
</P>
<P>
   Berkley Publishing, $12
</P>
<P>
   In his book, journalist Daniel Levine taps into an area
generally covered only in the comic strip ``Dilbert'' or around the
water cooler: employee issues. The subtitle is ``The fight-back
book for cube-bound corporate slaves, fast-food flunkies, and
anyone who works for a living.'' Levine has collected story after
story from employees around the world to illustrate bad bosses,
unfair corporate rules and other worker frustrations. The book
started from a Web site he set up, aptly called disgruntled.com.

</P>
<P>
   If percentages, compound interest rates, budgeting and other
similar necessarily evils of doing business have you and your
calculator running scared, this book should help. Organized by
writers for the esteemed international business magazine, [ix]The
Economist,[nm] the book covers myriad numerical methods, including
forecasting techniques and sampling testing to aid in business
analysis and strategy.

   ``Confucius in the Boardroom: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Lessons for
Business By Stefan Rudnicki''
</P>
<P>
   Dove Books, $13
</P>
<P>
   This is a tough book to follow. Author Stefan Rudnicki compiles
the writings of several ancient Chinese philosophers, including
Confucius, Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, as well as a handful of others.
The translations are put into categories relating to business, such
as management leadership, planning, strategy and employee
relations, but not enough explanation of the ancient writings is
there to make it clear how they relate to modern business topics.

TRAVELING ON YOUR STOMACH: OTHER JUNK-FOOD JUNKETS WORTH TAKING

   DR PEPPER MUSEUM AND FREE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, WACO:
</P>
<P>
   Heading to Central Texas any time soon? Pull off Interstate 35
to stop by the Dr Pepper museum in Waco to temporarily dilute the
kids' cries of ``Are we there yet?''
</P>
<P>
   The building containing the museum was the headquarters for the
Artesian Manufacturing and Bottling Co., which first bottled Dr
Pepper. A few blocks away is the site where the soft drink was
created by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist who enjoyed playing with
flavors to make new sodas.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia buffs will love the authentic soda fountain in the
museum's first exhibit. Drink in turn-of-the-century details such
as the tin ceilings while listening to an animatronic Alderton
describe the days when a Dr Pepper was known simply as a ``Waco''
and available only in Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered how they put the pop in soda pop? There's an
exhibit to explain how carbon dioxide works and another that lets
visitors try to create 50 pounds per square inch, the amount of
pressure that's in a Dr Pepper bottle at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the case full of old sodas; too bad that can of I
Like Worms cherry soda is inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   For the curious, there are videos on the Dublin, Texas, plant
where Dr Pepper makers still use cane sugar. Everywhere else, the
soft drink is made using corn syrup, and you can taste the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Watch your step on the museum's second floor: The floor is
raised 51/2 inches in the center and slopes gently toward the
gutters along the walls. At the turn of the century, when the
building was used as a factory, syrups were made on the second
floor. At the end of the day, workers could simply hose down the
floors and the sticky stuff would run down the sloped floor to the
gutters and out into the Waco sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the second floor features the history of soda pop
advertisements. There's a video with 28 years of Dr Pepper
commercials, and a 1920s vending machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder why there's no period after the Dr in Dr Pepper? In
the 1950s, the company switched typefaces on its cans and bottles.
The new style's Rs looked like sticks with dots on the upper right
side; the period to abbreviate ``doctor'' made the letter look like
a stick and a colon. Although the typeface changed, the new
spelling stuck.
</P>
<P>
   If you're running short on time, skip the third floor, home of
the Soft Drink Hall of Fame and Free Enterprise Institute. The hall
of fame contains sketches and biographies of inductees; the
institute features a video with phrases such as, ``Opportunity is
limited only by the size and quality of your dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, invest your time at the real soda fountain on the first
floor. Have an ice cream soda or malt, or just ask a soda jerk to
``shoot you a Waco'' _ a real fountain Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
noon-4 p.m. Sunday. Admission is $3 for seniors, $3.50 for adults
and $1.50 for students. There's also a virtual tour available at
www.drpeppermuseum.com.

   THE PRETZEL MUSEUM, PHILADELPHIA:
</P>
<P>
   Visit The Pretzel Museum in Philadelphia for some perspective on
junk food that was low-fat centuries before Olestra.
</P>
<P>
   The facility features an on-site pretzel bakery and hands-on
instruction in the art of pretzel twisting. Tours depart every 15
minutes, 10 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Show up early
to watch the professional pretzel twisters.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.50 tour includes a seven-minute film covering the history
of pretzels, a chance to twist your own, and a tasting. Call (215)

<P>
   Planning a ski (or other) trip to Vermont? Then get off Highway
100 between Waterbury and Stowe to see how Ben &AMP; Jerry make that
yummy Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey.
</P>
<P>
   Every tour starts with an eight-minute ``moovie'' (don't groan
yet; save it for that next-to-last spoonful) covering the company's
history and decidedly different philosophy. Next, it's a view of
the Production Room and an explanation of how ice cream is made.
Hungry? Off to the Flavor Room for samples.
</P>
<P>
   From November to May, tours run every 30 minutes, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
In September and October, hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m., and tours are
scheduled every 15 minutes. During premium ice-cream weather, hours
grow longer. In June, drop by 9 a.m.-5 p.m. for tours every 20
minutes; July and August tours run 9 a.m.-8 p.m. (It's vacation _
have ice cream for dinner!) and depart every 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No tours are conducted on Sundays, holidays and company
celebration days. Admission is $2 for adults.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: We've all heard of foodie tourism: wine-tasting
trips through Napa Valley, a visit to California's Gilroy Garlic
Festival, advice on munching your way through Manhattan or tours
highlighting Paris' finest restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Sound tempting? Get real.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us are more garbage pit than gourmet. When was the last
time you sat down to a meal with more than two or three courses?
Now think back to your most recent bite of vending-machine cuisine.
Bet that was easier.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be embarrassed. The folks at the Snack Food Association of
America estimate that each American eats 21.6 pounds of savory
snacks a year. That's stuff like potato chips, pretzels and beef
jerky. We eat even more of the sweet stuff: an average of 23.5
pounds per person, and half of that is chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   So on your next vacation, try foodie tourism with more mass
appeal: Take a junk-food junket.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ This is the home of the world's largest chocolate
factory, the ultimate destination in junk-food travel. It began as
a company town when Milton Hershey built his chocolate factory in
1903, and today bills itself as the ``sweetest place on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect your visit to be a realization of some Willy Wonka
fantasy. Sure, the streetlights along Cocoa and Chocolate Avenues
may be shaped like candy kisses, and chocolate is available in any
form you can imagine. But Hershey isn't Candyland sprung to life;
the leaves on trees are just leaves, not sweet treats, and every
whiff won't reward you with a big hit of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the air does smell like chocolate, but only near the
factory, where giant silos hold cacao beans awaiting their turn to
be turned into either cocoa or chocolate. The roasting beans are
what give the center of town its why-you're-here perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The factory is closed to visitors, but you can still get a taste
of what goes into making a chocolate bar at Hershey's Chocolate
World vistors center, which is blocks from the factory and shares
parking space with Hersheypark amusement park. If you'll spend more
than two hours here or plan to visit the nearby Hershey Museum,
park in the amusement park lot for $5. Staying 2-4 hours in the
Chocolate World lot will cost $5, and more than 4 hours will cost
you $15 _ hardly a sweet deal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the free tour ride inside Chocolate World, which
takes visitors through the life of a chocolate bar. You start on a
cacao bean plantation and learn how beans are harvested, then
follow the scent of chocolate to the guided cars for a journey as a
cacao bean. Be prepared for the room where overhead heat lamps
simulate the roasting process. Some children on our tour worried
that they would be roasted, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are free samples of Hershey candies as you leave the tour.
Snap these up to tame the chocolate craving you're sure to feel
after sitting through the ride. Otherwise, there's danger lurking:
thousands of bags of candy for sale in a large market area next to
gift shops with standard souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't leave without something, pick up a coffee cup
packed with miniature candies for $6.95. You'll still have the
bought-it-there chocolate, but the mug will last longer than the
pounds you'd pack on indulging in the large candy bars or
custom-made chocolate greeting cards and plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Still hungry after the sample, but not ready to break into the
bags you bought as gifts for friends? Try the Chocolate Town Cafe
near Chocolate World's entrance. The varied menu ranges from a
Greek salad for $5.95 to an 8-ounce sirloin for $12.95. The $4.49
children's menu offers kiddie staples: mac 'n' cheese, spaghetti,
hot dogs or chicken fingers served with applesauce and a beverage _
maybe Hershey's Chocolate Milk? _ in a souvenir cup.
</P>
<P>
   Grab a friend to try the cafe's Chocolate Overload: an ice cream
sandwich made from fudge brownies that's smothered with hot fudge,
topped with whipped cream and sealed in Hershey's Kisses. That's
enough calories to last you for one week for only $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   For a better idea of the town's history, set aside 45 minutes
for the Hershey Trolley Works tour. Tokens are available inside
Chocolate World's main entrance and are $6.75 for riders 13 and
older, $5 for children ages 3 to 12 and free for age 2 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   Try to be in line 10 minutes before your scheduled departure,
because the guides offer morsels of Hershey history. Think you know
your candy? Correctly answer the token-taker's question and be
rewarded with a chocolate kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Be ready to sing once the tour starts; conductors lead
sing-alongs with turn-of-the-century tunes as exit music for the
characters who pop up along the route. You'll meet Milton Hershey's
father, mother, a Pennsylvania Dutch chef and more as tour guides
tell how Hershey overcame four business failures to succeed as a
milk-chocolate mogul.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure to enjoy the view from the hilltop when the trolley
stops at The Hotel Hershey. Gaze into the valley, where the town,
factory and amusement park are, or into the nearby countryside. The
surrounding hills are foothills of the Appalachian mountains and
offer a different twist for Texans who head for the area's golf
resorts.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Hershey offers something different for roller coaster buffs,
too, with the Great Bear, a steel inverted roller coaster.
Thrillseekers are strapped into seats suspended from tracks, then
whisked 90 feet in the sky and through a 360-degree barrel roll
where they experience zero-gravity.

   The 110-acre amusement park has six roller coasters, six water
rides and more than 20 kiddie rides. Area hotels offer discounted
park tickets. At the gate, admission is $29.95 for ages 9 to 54;
$16.95 for ages 3 to 8 and those older than 55; and free for those
2 and younger. Consecutive day passes for those 9 to 54 are $18.95.
Also, check out the preview plan, which lets you into the park for
a few hours before closing the day of purchase and for the entire
next day.
</P>
<P>
   If your tastes run more to relics than roller coasters, visit
the Hershey Museum. Although a number of exhibits are related to
Milton Hershey's chocolate empire, most depict life in 19th and
20th century Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   There are several hands-on exhibits, including a game to learn
how chocolate is made. Don't miss the name-this-gadget game that
features 100-year-old objects such as hog scrapers and
denglestocks.
</P>
<P>
   For the younger set, there's a Discovery Room where children can
don Victorian costumes and play in model general stores and
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also find the story of Milton Hershey, a man who overcame
early business failures to found one of the world's largest
confectioneries. A small section of the museum looks at Hershey's
life and what may be his sweetest legacy: the Milton Hershey School
for disadvantaged youths.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey and his wife, Catherine ``Kitty'' Hershey, could not
have children; starting the school gave them a family of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The school began in 1909 as an industrial school for
Pennsylvania orphans. Nine years later, following Kitty's death,
Hershey placed $60 million _ his entire fortune _ in trust to
finance the school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school admits gifted students from ages 4 to 16 who
come from financially needy families. The 1,100 students live in
group homes and receive room, board, clothing and health care.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the candy-making mecca doesn't have to be junk food
for the brain. The Gettysburg National Military Park, site of one
of the most important Civil War battles, is only 55 miles away. The
battlefield surrounds the tiny town, which has several historic
buildings. Make sure to visit the house Gen. Robert E. Lee used as
headquarters during the Battle of Gettysburg. Today, it contains a
collection of Civil War relics.
</P>
<P>
   Other nearby points of interest include Pottsville, Pa., which
author John O'Hara immortalized as Gibbsville. The town is also
home of Yuengling, America's oldest brewery. The brewery features a
museum and gift shop. Tours leave at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Monday
through Friday. Call (717) 628-4890 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Further south is Lancaster County, the heart of Pennsylvania's
Amish country. Midway between Bird-in-Hand and Intercourse, you'll
find the Amish Experience, which includes a movie based on Amish
life, tours of an Amish homestead and bus tours of the countryside.
Hours vary according to season; call (717) 768-3600, Ext. 10, for
more information.

</P>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ This is the home of the world's largest chocolate
factory, the ultimate destination in junk-food travel. It began as
a company town when Milton Hershey built his chocolate factory in
1903, and today bills itself as the ``sweetest place on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect your visit to be a realization of some Willy Wonka
fantasy. Sure, the streetlights along Cocoa and Chocolate Avenues
may be shaped like candy kisses, and chocolate is available in any
form you can imagine. But Hershey isn't Candyland sprung to life;
the leaves on trees are just leaves, not sweet treats, and every
whiff won't reward you with a big hit of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the air does smell like chocolate, but only near the
factory, where giant silos hold cacao beans awaiting their turn to
be turned into either cocoa or chocolate. The roasting beans are
what give the center of town its why-you're-here perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The factory is closed to visitors, but you can still get a taste
of what goes into making a chocolate bar at Hershey's Chocolate
World vistors center, which is blocks from the factory and shares
parking space with Hersheypark amusement park. If you'll spend more
than two hours here or plan to visit the nearby Hershey Museum,
park in the amusement park lot for $5. Staying 2-4 hours in the
Chocolate World lot will cost $5, and more than 4 hours will cost
you $15 _ hardly a sweet deal.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the free tour ride inside Chocolate World, which
takes visitors through the life of a chocolate bar. You start on a
cacao bean plantation and learn how beans are harvested, then
follow the scent of chocolate to the guided cars for a journey as a
cacao bean. Be prepared for the room where overhead heat lamps
simulate the roasting process. Some children on our tour worried
that they would be roasted, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are free samples of Hershey candies as you leave the tour.
Snap these up to tame the chocolate craving you're sure to feel
after sitting through the ride. Otherwise, there's danger lurking:
thousands of bags of candy for sale in a large market area next to
gift shops with standard souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't leave without something, pick up a coffee cup
packed with miniature candies for $6.95. You'll still have the
bought-it-there chocolate, but the mug will last longer than the
pounds you'd pack on indulging in the large candy bars or
custom-made chocolate greeting cards and plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Still hungry after the sample, but not ready to break into the
bags you bought as gifts for friends? Try the Chocolate Town Cafe
near Chocolate World's entrance. The varied menu ranges from a
Greek salad for $5.95 to an 8-ounce sirloin for $12.95. The $4.49
children's menu offers kiddie staples: mac 'n' cheese, spaghetti,
hot dogs or chicken fingers served with applesauce and a beverage _
maybe Hershey's Chocolate Milk? _ in a souvenir cup.
</P>
<P>
   Grab a friend to try the cafe's Chocolate Overload: an ice cream
sandwich made from fudge brownies that's smothered with hot fudge,
topped with whipped cream and sealed in Hershey's Kisses. That's
enough calories to last you for one week for only $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   For a better idea of the town's history, set aside 45 minutes
for the Hershey Trolley Works tour. Tokens are available inside
Chocolate World's main entrance and are $6.75 for riders 13 and
older, $5 for children ages 3 to 12 and free for age 2 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   Try to be in line 10 minutes before your scheduled departure,
because the guides offer morsels of Hershey history. Think you know
your candy? Correctly answer the token-taker's question and be
rewarded with a chocolate kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Be ready to sing once the tour starts; conductors lead
sing-alongs with turn-of-the-century tunes as exit music for the
characters who pop up along the route. You'll meet Milton Hershey's
father, mother, a Pennsylvania Dutch chef and more as tour guides
tell how Hershey overcame four business failures to succeed as a
milk-chocolate mogul.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure to enjoy the view from the hilltop when the trolley
stops at The Hotel Hershey. Gaze into the valley, where the town,
factory and amusement park are, or into the nearby countryside. The
surrounding hills are foothills of the Appalachian mountains and
offer a different twist for Texans who head for the area's golf
resorts.

   HOMEWORK _ WASHINGTON _ Is homework out of style? Just as the
politicians are stuck on talking education, here's a reality check.
Students in the Boston high schools admitted that they rarely even
take books home, and teachers confessed they've all but given up on
expecting homework to be done, according to the Boston Globe. We're
checking on trends elsewhere. (Malone, Cox News Service).

his speakership: What happens to all the money in his campaign
coffers? What's his retirement pension? Will he run for president
in 2000? (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-IMMIGRANTS _ WASHINGTON _ How will the immigrant and
ethnic vote affect future elections, based on last week's results?
A panel of political and polling experts addresses the question at
a Thursday round-table discussion. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

   BORDER-SHOOTING _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, holds

   RUDOLPH _ ANDREWS, N.C. _ A federal agent was nearly hit by a
bullet when a shot was fired at the command post where federal
agents are coordinating their search for bombing suspect Eric
Rudolph. The shot, fired at the command post building around 8 p.m.
Wednesday, ``brushed the hair'' of an agent but did not wound him.
Agents were busy this morning trying to determine whether the
command post was the shooter's intended target. The FBI is back in

saying he's got the support of key committee chairs, including
Henry Hyde and John Kasich, in his bid to remain in leadership. (
Joyce, Dayton Daily News). 8
</P>
<P>
   BISHOP _ Anthony J. O'Connell, First Bishop of Knoxville, Tenn.,
was named the new bishop of the Palm Beach diocese. A native of
County Clare, Ireland, he attended Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis,
Missouri, and was ordained a priest in 1963 in the Jefferson City,
Missouri, diocese. O'Connell, 60, replaces J. Keith Symons who
resigned in June after admitting he molested five boys 25 years
ago. Symons was the first U.S. bishop to resign because of sexual
abuse of children. O'Connell, who moved to the United States when
he was 20, was appointed to the Knoxville post in 1988.

   TEXAS-BOARD-OF-EDUCATION _ The State Board of Education is
scheduled to vote Thursday on another round of charter schools,
including more than two dozen campuses proposed by Don Howard, a
former Kentucky public school official who runs charter schools
across the country for at-risk students. Howard wants 30 charters
in 28 Texas cities, including Austin. His charters have been
controversial because of their religious bent and now because of
their quantity. The board has not awarded so many charters to one
group before. (Brooks, Austin American-Statesman).

press conference to talk about the findings in The Status of Black
Atlanta, which reveals that little progress has been made despite
efforts to create an Olympic legacy in the city. (Suggs, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   STRIKELAWS _ WASHINGTON _ Promises of tough two- and
three-strikes laws were a convenient campaign pledges across the
nation, but a researcher has found that only two states _ Georgia
and California _ are implimenting the laws. A report released
Thursday by the Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy said 15 of
the 23 states with the harsher penalties, which include mandatory
minimums without parole or demand life in prison, virtually ignore
the statutes. California, which applies its law to almost every
repeat felon, has more than 40,500 inmates serving under the
stiffer laws. Georgia, which has a narrower law that lists only
seven of the most violent felonies, has 2,000 people incarcerated
for one of those crimes, including more than 50 serving life
without parole and 885 who have been sentenced to more than 20
years without parole for their ``first strike.'' (Cook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.

   BABYMUSIC _ As state officials try to piggyback a program
offering free classiscal music CDs to newborns with reminders to
have their infants checked for deafness, we look at the succes of
the CD program. How much music has been distributed and what do
recipients and others have to say about its value. (Helton, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Americans are eating more fat these days _
more pizza, Mexican food, steak, nachos dripping in cheese, and,
for dessert, ice cream. This might sound incongruous, given years
of health warnings about the risks of eating too much fat. However,
it turns out that Americans aren't completely ignoring these
admonitions: the percentage of fat in Americans' diets has declined
in recent years, but the total fat consumed has risen because
people are eating more food, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Food Surveys Research Group. By LILA LAHOOD. Story

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Maybe it was the Great Depression and a
tendency to look homeward. Maybe it was World War II and renewed
patriotism. Maybe it was a national coming of age, a realization
that American folk culture contained the fundamental elements of
high art. For whatever reason, the 1930s and 1940s witnessed a
blossoming of art, music and drama frankly focused on American
subjects. One of the most famous representatives of that era of
shameless nationalism, the ballet ``Rodeo,'' takes the stage this
weekend at Bass Performance Hall in a presentation by the Fort

STANDING BEAR IS A GUITARIST ROCKIN' THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the beginning, there was the blues. Then came
blues-rock _ played by guitarists who could still make an
instrument wail but who were as steeped in rock as they were in the
blues tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, there were Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. Then later,
Carlos Santana and Stevie Ray Vaughn. And in recent years, upstarts
like Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Jonny Lang leaned on the blues side,
while Todd Park Mohr (Big Head Todd &AMP; the Monsters) is more about
rock.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a new name to throw on the blues-rock altar: Mato Nanji.
Or if you prefer the English translation: Standing Bear. Just 24,
the Nakota Sioux from South Dakota has burst onto the scene in
recent months with his band Indigenous, a quartet of young
musicians from the same family. They are playing this weekend at
the 23rd Annual American Indian Film Festival here, an event that
includes taking part in a Sunday benefit for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to represent our people as best we can,'' says the
young prodigy, on the phone from the Midwest. ``We grew up poor, so
we feel strongly about helping whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanji's incendiary guitar-playing has been compared with that of
Hendrix, Vaughn and especially Santana _ something that he
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I appreciate when I hear those things, but it's wrong. I
mean, I'm nowhere near that good,'' he says shyly. Asked which of
the greats had the most impact on his playing, he responds,
``Santana. I've never met him, but I hope to someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanji is accompanied by his 22-year-old sister Wanbdi Win (Good
Eagle Woman) on drums, his 20-year-old brother Ptehcaka Wicasa
(Little Buffalo Man) on bass and his 20-year-old cousin Tasunka
(who goes by his English name of Horse), on percussion.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no Partridge Family. Raised on the tiny Yankton
Reservation in Marty, S.D., the children were home-schooled by
their parents _ both Indian activists. (Nanji was named Standing
Bear after an ancestor, the great chief Standing Bear, who
championed Indian civil rights more than 100 years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   They learned to play instruments in the basement by listening to
their parents' collection of blues greats. The name Indigenous was
their parents' suggestion, although, Nanji laughs, ``we were just
kids and weren't even sure what it meant.''
</P>
<P>
   But since there were few venues in the vicinity for Indigenous
to play (``just one casino and they just wanted Chubby Checker
tunes'' says Nanji), the family went on the road. They played
nearly 200 dates a year for the last few years, living in their
cars before getting some key breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Those include grabbing the attention of activist-rockers like
the Indigo Girls, Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt (no blues-rock
slouch herself). Raitt was so smitten with the young musicians that
she helped them get connected. The result: the release last month
of ``Things We Do'' on Pachyderm _ a rare major-label release of a
South Dakota (let alone Native American) band.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a winner, bristling with an accomplished zeal that
belies Indigenous' average age. Nanji's vocals are the perfect
accompaniment for a blues-wailing guitar _ a deep,
back-of-the-throat baritone, not unlike Mohr's.
</P>
<P>
   The first single, also titled ``Things We Do,'' is soon to be
released to MTV as a video, directed by Chris Eyre, the young
Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker responsible for the acclaimed feature
``Smoke Signals.'' The video will be unveiled Saturday night as
part of a tribute to Eyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping to get his attention, hoping he would be
interested in doing the video,'' says Nanji. ``And as it turns out,
he's a big fan of the band _ he saw us play once. So he agreed
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their name and history, Indigenous' subject matter is
light and politics-free _ relationships and life as viewed through
a young person's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our music to be color-blind,'' says Nanji. ``We want
anyone who comes to hear us to be able to get down with the music,
not with a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just being who they are is message enough, he says.
``We're proud of being Indian, and that's always part of us no
matter what.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains will douse parts of Texas on Friday and Friday night
as an upper-level low pressure system approaching from Mexico teams
with converging streams of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and
the tropical Pacific. The heaviest rains will likely occur over
southeastern Texas, where a developing surface low pressure system
focuses low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. By Saturday
morning, 5 inches of rain or more are possible from Corpus Christi
north to the Texas-Louisiana border. Flash flooding is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains will deluge south and west-facing slopes of the
Olympics, northern Cascades and Coastal Ranges of western
Washington state and northwest Oregon, where robust moist winds are
forced to rapidly rise over the sloping terrain. With a plume of
very moist air streaming inland from the Pacific, the stage will be
set for rainfalls to exceed 3 or more inches in some places by
Saturday morning. Flooding is likely, with the Skokomish River in
Washington already rising rapidly last night.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, gusty winds will buffet the Front Range and
foothills of the northern Rockies in Wyoming and Montana. Winds
from the west-northwest will average 25 to 35 miles an hour, with
gusts to 50 miles an hour or more in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, in the wake of wintry weather earlier in the week,
temperatures in the northern Plains will rise as westerly winds
warm on descent from the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered snow showers will dust the mountains of northern New
England and upstate New York in the wake of a cold front from
Canada. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hurricane Dearth &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The odds of a hurricane striking the United States are rapidly
vanishing as the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season,
Nov. 30, approaches. Barring a last-minute hurricane, this will
mark the ninth straight year without a hurricane making landfall in
Texas, an all-time record for the Lone Star State. Texas' previous
record dearth spanned eight years from 1972 to 1979. Still, Texas
did not escape unscathed in 1998. In August, Tropical Storm Charley
dumped record rains on south Texas, while, in September, Tropical
Storm Frances incited flooding along the upper Texas coast.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT ASSAILS INTEL WITNESS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and financial (f) queues
 &HT;    720 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft Corp. antitrust lawyer sought Thursday
to portray a crucial government witness as a liar and a corporate
renegade who was secretly in league with the software giant's
arch-rival in the Internet browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic exchanges of the month-old landmark
Microsoft antitrust trial, attorney Steven Holley depicted Intel
Corp. vice president Steven McGeady as being branded a ``prima
donna'' by his bosses, who shipped him off to academia in 1996
after his pet software project was scuttled at Microsoft's behest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called worse,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   But under a fierce grilling, McGeady stuck to his basic account:
Microsoft had bullied Intel into abandoning its software efforts by
threatening to withhold support in its Windows operating system for
the next generation of Intel microprocessors _ projects in which
the company had invested billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Holley also put into evidence a 1995 e-mail exchange between
McGeady and Netscape Communications Corp. co-founder Jim Clark,
seeking to show McGeady had pumped Microsoft's trade secrets to the
foe.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer suggested McGeady, a sailor, turned down an
invitation last July from Clark, now the Netscape chairman, for a
cruise on Clark's $50 million yacht, the Hyperion, because it might
appear as if they were conspiring against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Holley's efforts to discredit McGeady became so vehement that
the judge cautioned him after he showed the witness an e-mail to
Clark in which the witness referred to Intel's chief executive
officer as ``Andy 'Mad Dog' Grove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the point of this?'' U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson demanded. ``What are you trying to demonstrate?
Are you just trying to embarrass him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, your honor,'' Holley replied, ``although that might be the
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Holley presented the court with notes of a 1995 meeting between
McGeady and his boss, in which McGeady wrote that the demise of
McGeady's 700-person software lab was ``a response to (it) having
----ed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The screw-up was one of marketing and strategy, not one of
technology,'' McGeady responded. ``While the language may seem
harsh, it's more common than you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, McGeady had testified that Microsoft executive Paul
Maritz had told him at a 1995 meeting that his company's goal was
to ``embrace, extend and extinguish'' Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Holley showed McGeady his handwritten notes of that meeting _
notes in which McGeady wrote the words: ``embrace/extend/change the
nature of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see the word 'extinguish' anywhere in your notes, do
you?'' Holley snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no danger I would have forgotten,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't need to add it to your notes because you made them
up later, isn't that true?'' Holley thundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely untrue, and I resent the implication,''
McGeady said evenly.
</P>
<P>
   What weight to put on McGeady's testimony has emerged as a key
element in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Was McGeady, as the Microsoft lawyer claimed, merely a rogue
figure who had testified out of spite because his promising career
at Intel had been sidetracked when his work ran afoul of Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Or was McGeady, as the trustbusters contended, testifying
truthfully, with plenty of backup documents, about how Microsoft
had successfully used its Windows monopoly over the operating
system to block Intel from becoming a software competitor?
</P>
<P>
   After four successive rounds of verbal pingpong between the
opposing counsels had concluded, the judge posed the question
directly to McGeady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that your testimony here has your company's
blessing,'' Jackson asked?
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Blessing' could be a strong word,'' McGeady replied. ``Intel
is a large corporation with many opinions. My appearance here
creates a problem, your honor, only in the most fundamental sense
in that Microsoft is one of our very best customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sun-splashed plaza before the federal courthouse, an
Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said the chip maker maintains a
``strict neutrality'' between the Department of Justice and
Microsoft in the trial. Another reason for Intel to tread
cautiously, he noted, was its own current antitrust problems before
the Federal Trade Commission.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT ASSAILS INTEL WITNESS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and financial (f) queues
 &HT;    720 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft Corp. antitrust lawyer sought Thursday
to portray a crucial government witness as a liar and a corporate
renegade who was secretly in league with the software giant's
arch-rival in the Internet browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic exchanges of the month-old landmark
Microsoft antitrust trial, attorney Steven Holley depicted Intel
Corp. vice president Steven McGeady as being branded a ``prima
donna'' by his bosses, who shipped him off to academia in 1996
after his pet software project was scuttled at Microsoft's behest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called worse,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   But under a fierce grilling, McGeady stuck to his basic account:
Microsoft had bullied Intel into abandoning its software efforts by
threatening to withhold support in its Windows operating system for
the next generation of Intel microprocessors _ projects in which
the company had invested billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Holley also put into evidence a 1995 e-mail exchange between
McGeady and Netscape Communications Corp. co-founder Jim Clark,
seeking to show McGeady had pumped Microsoft's trade secrets to the
foe.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer suggested McGeady, a sailor, turned down an
invitation last July from Clark, now the Netscape chairman, for a
cruise on Clark's $50 million yacht, the Hyperion, because it might
appear as if they were conspiring against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Holley's efforts to discredit McGeady became so vehement that
the judge cautioned him after he showed the witness an e-mail to
Clark in which the witness referred to Intel's chief executive
officer as ``Andy 'Mad Dog' Grove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the point of this?'' U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson demanded. ``What are you trying to demonstrate?
Are you just trying to embarrass him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, your honor,'' Holley replied, ``although that might be the
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Holley presented the court with notes of a 1995 meeting between
McGeady and his boss, in which McGeady wrote that the demise of
McGeady's 700-person software lab was ``a response to (it) having
----ed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The screw-up was one of marketing and strategy, not one of
technology,'' McGeady responded. ``While the language may seem
harsh, it's more common than you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, McGeady had testified that Microsoft executive Paul
Maritz had told him at a 1995 meeting that his company's goal was
to ``embrace, extend and extinguish'' Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Holley showed McGeady his handwritten notes of that meeting _
notes in which McGeady wrote the words: ``embrace/extend/change the
nature of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see the word 'extinguish' anywhere in your notes, do
you?'' Holley snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no danger I would have forgotten,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't need to add it to your notes because you made them
up later, isn't that true?'' Holley thundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely untrue, and I resent the implication,''
McGeady said evenly.
</P>
<P>
   What weight to put on McGeady's testimony has emerged as a key
element in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Was McGeady, as the Microsoft lawyer claimed, merely a rogue
figure who had testified out of spite because his promising career
at Intel had been sidetracked when his work ran afoul of Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Or was McGeady, as the trustbusters contended, testifying
truthfully, with plenty of backup documents, about how Microsoft
had successfully used its Windows monopoly over the operating
system to block Intel from becoming a software competitor?
</P>
<P>
   After four successive rounds of verbal pingpong between the
opposing counsels had concluded, the judge posed the question
directly to McGeady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that your testimony here has your company's
blessing,'' Jackson asked?
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Blessing' could be a strong word,'' McGeady replied. ``Intel
is a large corporation with many opinions. My appearance here
creates a problem, your honor, only in the most fundamental sense
in that Microsoft is one of our very best customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sun-splashed plaza before the federal courthouse, an
Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said the chip maker maintains a
``strict neutrality'' between the Department of Justice and
Microsoft in the trial. Another reason for Intel to tread
cautiously, he noted, was its own current antitrust problems before

 &HT;    LAWMAKER: HOLD BORDER PATROL ACCOUNTABLE FOR TEEN'S DEATH
 &HT;    740 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, charged
Thursday that the U.S. Justice Department was negligent and
``sloppy'' in its internal investigation of the 1997 death of West
Texas teen-ager Esequiel Hernandez Jr., who was fatally shot by a
U.S. Marine corporal on surveillance duty for the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Smith decried the absence of punishment for the Border Patrol
officials who were working with the Marines, who encountered
Hernandez on May 20, 1997, while he was tending his family's goats
near his home in the border town of Redford. Hernandez, 18, fired
at least one shot from his .22-caliber rifle toward the camouflaged
Marines; he was shot to death 20 minutes later when he allegedly
raised his rifle again.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shooting, the Department of Defense suspended
its involvement in law-enforcement activities on the border, and a
Marine Corps investigation led to formal ``counseling'' letters in
the files of four Marine Corps officers. The Marines in the patrol,
including Cpl. Manuel Banuelos, who fired the fatal shot, were
cleared of criminal wrongdoing by state and federal grand juries.
Banuelos has since received an honorable discharge from the Marine
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Defense Department conducted a thorough investigation and
held individuals accountable,'' Smith said Thursday as he released
his report on Hernandez's shooting and its aftermath. ``The Justice
Department, at best, conducted a sloppy inquiry and held no one
accountable. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``When the nation's chief law-enforcement agency will not make
even a cursory attempt to hold itself and its employees accountable
for the wrongful killing of an American citizen, the life and
freedom of every citizen is threatened,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting wrongdoing, both the Justice and Defense
departments reached a settlement with the Hernandez family last
July, agreeing to pay about $1 million total.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the settlement was not enough: ``To this day, no
Justice Department personnel have been held accountable for their
negligence or wrongdoing in the Hernandez killing. Attorney General
Janet Reno should right this wrong immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   No one from the Justice Department or the Immigration and
Naturalization Service responded to repeated calls for comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his comments in connection with a report he initiated
in his role as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's
immigration subcommittee. The subcommittee oversees the Border
Patrol and its parent agency, the INS, which is part of the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's 250-page report contained previously unreleased
documents in which the Border Patrol and INS acknowledge that
supervisors from headquarters to the local Border Patrol sector
underestimated the differences between civilian law enforcement and
the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, the decision to expose armed, combat-oriented
personnel to an essentially domestic law-enforcement environment
set the forces in motion that caused the Redford incident,'' the
Border Patrol said in a section of an undated document titled
``What Went Wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol document went on to describe specific failings
on May 20, 1997, including the presence of a new supervisor who
hadn't been briefed on the Marines' activities in the area. Smith's
report suggests Border Patrol agents didn't know exactly where the
Marines were and so were delayed in reaching the scene after
Hernandez fired his rifle the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's report also makes much of the Marines' understanding
that Border Patrol agents would respond within 15 minutes to any
problems; the Border Patrol countered that the Marines had moved
from hiding to their surveillance position more than two hours
before they were supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Border Patrol agents arrived at the shooting
scene 38 minutes after the Marines' first encounter with Hernandez.
Smith's report suggests that Hernandez, who was alive for as long
as 20 minutes after Banuelos shot him once in the chest with an
M-16, might have survived if Border Patrol agents had reached the
scene earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But a Justice Department document from special litigation
counsel Barry Kowalski underscores how badly Hernandez was hurt:
``According to forensic pathologists from the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology,'' he wrote, ``the injuries to the victim
from the gunshot wound were so severe that he would have died even
if he had been shot inside a hospital emergency room.''

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 11 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   49ers (7-2) at Falcons (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: It's time to start taking these Falcons seriously. The
team is off to its best start ever and is 12-4 in the past 16 games
and have won 7 of past 8 against the NFC West. Here is the
dangerous part for the Falcons: The 49ers always dominate them. San
Francisco has won five straight and has scored 30 or more points in
11 of the past 13 games against Atlanta. Normally, this would be
just another blowout of the hapless Falcons. But the 49ers are
reeling. Their offensive line is in shambles and Young is still
aching from a groin injury. Quarterback Chris Chandler, the NFC's
fourth ranked passer, throws for 350 yards against a terrible 49ers
pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 28-23.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Bengals (2-7) at Vikings (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is one of those trap games for the Vikings. Under
Coach Bruce Coslet, the Bengals have always been strong finishers.
In 1995, they ended the year 4-2. The following season the Bengals
finished 6-2 and last year 7-2. If there was a second half of the
season championship, the Bengals would win it every year. Of
course, Vikings' Coach Dennis Green has mentioned to his players
how well Cincinnati plays late in the year. Now, it's just a matter
of whether his players will listen. Randall Cunningham gets the
start, and the Vikings squeak by.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 30-29.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins (6-3) at Panthers (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Panthers have kept games close because of
quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who is third in the NFC with a 91.7
rating. His completion rate of 65 percent leads the league. Maybe
the best thing that happened to the Panthers was Kerry Collins
getting cut. This game has upset written all over it, especially
since Kevin Greene, who leads the NFL in sacks with 13, likes going
against top teams. The Dolphins are 18-11 in first meetings against
a franchise but Carolina wins because of a steady Beuerlein and
Green will get at least two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots (5-4) at Bills (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Playing in Buffalo doesn't scare New England. The team
has won 3 of the past 4 games there and seems to relish playing in
front of the hostile Bills crowd. Basically, the loser of this game
is out of the division title race and it will come down to the
winner of the Patriots-Bills game, the Jets and the Dolphins. It's
hard to figure this Patriots team, since they got blown out last
week at home by Atlanta. But they know how vital this game is and
the league is starting to figure out Doug Flutie. New England wins
a big one on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 18-14.
</P>
<P>
   Jets (6-3) at Colts (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: After the Jets beat the Bills last week, Bill Parcells
started his campaign of disinformation with his players, saying
that the Colts are a good team, that quarterback Peyton Manning is
playing well, that this team shouldn't be taken lightly. Wrong. The
Colts are a bad team, Manning has a bright future, but he has
thrown 18 interceptions and the Colts should be taken lightly. The
Jets are clearly the better team as they demonstrated by blowing
out Indianapolis early in the season, 44-6. This time around,
Curtis Martin has one of those 28 carry, 150-yard, two-touchdown
days. Six of the past eight games have been decided by 8 points or
less, but this is a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 35-13.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (2-7) at Redskins (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Eagles are beginning to build a little momentum.
The team has been recently propelled by defensive end Hugh Douglas,
the former Jet who was cast off to Philadelphia because he didn't
get along with Parcells. He has a career-high 11 sacks, 33 sacks in
the past 49 career games. That's impressive. There is no reason to
think he won't add a few more sacks against the Redskins. The game
is almost guaranteed to be close, with 13 of the past 14 decided by
seven points or less, including the last two in Washington by three
points or less. Player to watch: Darrell Green, who has nine
interceptions against the Eagles, tied for most against any team.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers (6-3) at Oilers (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This promises to be one of the most bruising games of
the year. These two teams met earlier this month, and running back
Eddie George embarrassed a good Pittsburgh defense by running for
153 yards and one touchdown. In the NFL, there are very few times
when one team bashes another, then two weeks later does it again.
If quarterback Kordell Stewart has finally shaken off his problems
running the offense, which it seemed like against Green Bay on
Monday night, then the Steelers will get revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 21-17
</P>
<P>
   Rams (3-6) at Saints (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Collins gets the start, and his chance to save his
career begins. He'll have more help with the Saints than he did in
Carolina. New Orleans' defense is playing well. The last time these
teams met, the Saints recorded six sacks and defensive end Joe
Johnson had a 5-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown. Quarterback
Tony Banks throws three interceptions and Collins actually has a
solid game.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Ravens (3-6) at Chargers (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: You know a team is in a desperate state when it
benches the franchise quarterback, Ryan Leaf, for a backup that
last year was 0-7, Craig Whelihan. The saving grace for San Diego
has been the defense. The Chargers have given up just 254 yards a
game, especially impressive since the team hasn't led the NFL in
defense since 1965. It seems like its been that long since the
Ravens got a win.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks (5-4) at Raiders (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quietly, one of the best quarterbacks in the league
has been Donald Hallas. Donald Hallas? He replaced Jeff George
three weeks ago and his play, combined with a defense that has
allowed just two touchdowns in the last 10 quarters, means that
Oakland Coach Jon Gruden is in the running for coach of the year.
Seattle has a solid defense of its own and lead the NFL in sacks
with 37. Quarterback Warren Moon has traditionally done well
against the Raiders _ he is 3-1 in his past four starts against
Oakland _ but this Raiders defense is too good right now. Moon gets
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-15
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (6-3) at Cardinals (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Cardinals are over .500 for the first time since
the football was invented. They are talking about how they have a
chance to win the division. Next year, they will be good. This
year, the NFC East belongs to Dallas. The Cowboys are 5-0 in the
division, including 3-0 on the road. Their offensive line is
playing out of this world, allowing just 10 sacks, a league low. In
its last five games against Arizona, the Cowboys have given up just
five sacks. Arizona has done a great job of trying to shake its
recent sorry past and there is no doubt they will be a contender
next year. Just not now.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 24-17
</P>
<P>
   Packers (6-3) at Giants (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Packers are an angry team. They aren't used to
getting beat up on Monday Night Football like they were against
Pittsburgh. So they will come into the Giants game with a giant
chip on their shoulder. There is no way the Giants offensive line
can contain the Packers' front four. Defensive end Reggie White has
12 sacks in what has been a tremendous year. Plus, he's never
sacked Giants quarterback Danny Kanell and White would love to add
another trophy to the mantle. Something else to keep in mind: The
Packers are 22-7 against non-division teams since 1995 including
4-1 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 41-17.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers (4-5) at Jaguars (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay plays well against the AFC, winning 5 of the
past 7. But this isn't just any AFC team. The Jaguars are one of
the top five teams in the game and they've won 18 of the past 20
games at home. Their offense has been incredible, outscoring teams
66-13 in the first half of the past two games. Tampa Bay simply
does not have the offensive firepower to stay with Jacksonville.
The Buccaneers' only hope is fullback Mike Alstott. The team is 7-0
when he has at least 100 all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   Bears (3-6) at Lions (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Earlier this season, the Bears held running back Barry
Sanders to just 28 yards rushing on 14 carries. Sanders will likely
improve on those numbers, but not by much. The Lions have evolved
into a bad team, a very bad team, and it wasn't lost on some
players when after Detroit's loss to Philadelphia last week, Coach
Bobby Ross was blaming the players. The cracks are becoming the
Grand Canyon. Detroit needs to get Pro Bowl wide receiver Herman
Moore back into the offense to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (9-0) at Chiefs (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Broncos have a chance to become just the 16th team
in NFL history to start 10-0, but they have to get by the Chiefs.
It seems no matter how well the other team is playing, these
hard-hitting and intense games are always close. The last 4 at
Arrowhead Stadium have been decided by 3 points or less. Chiefs
quarterback Rich Gannon gets the start and if it isn't obvious by
now it should be _ he's better than Elvis Grbac. His scrambling
ability will give the Broncos fits and while Coach Mike Shanahan is
the best coach in the game right now, he's still not God. Not yet.
Even Shanahan loses a few and this is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 34-31.

`THE SPIRIT LIVES': SNAPSHOTS OF A WAR AND A LOST CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Spanish Civil War pitted the well-equipped and
well-trained nationalist armed forces, led by Franco, against the
poorly armed and trained troops of the elected Republican
government.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unequal contest: Franco's forces were backed by Hitler
and Mussolini, and the leftist-liberal Republicans, or Loyalists,
were supported by the Soviet Union and the International Brigades,
some 40,000 volunteers with little or no fighting experience from
52 countries who wanted to stop fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Long on idealism but short on military know-how, the Republican
cause was doomed, even as it drew such champions as Andre Malraux,
Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Tina
Modotti, Hans Namuth, David Seymour and Robert Capa.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, some of the most compelling images of that war are
Capa's 1936 photograph of a loyalist falling in battle; Picasso's
1937 painting ``Guernica,'' a wrenching tribute to the victims of
German aerial bombing of a Basque village, and Hemingway's 1940
novel, ``For Whom the Bell Tolls.''
</P>
<P>
   But if one could see the Spanish Civil War freed from these
familiar images, what would it be? ``The Spirit Lives: Photos From
the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39,'' at the Puffin Room in SoHo, comes
close to giving a freshly personal perspective to this conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from the archives of the International Institute of Social
History in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, most of the photographs in
this exhibition have not been shown before in the United States.
They survived the war because they were sent to the Paris branch of
the Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo, a major labor union and
player in the war, then to England and eventually to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the photographers in ``The Spirit Lives'' bring a
so-called snapshot aesthetic to their pictures of Republicans and
leftists preparing for war or at war. The photographers are all
anonymous except for Sam Walters, a veteran of the American
contingent of volunteers, the Lincoln Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   And the pictures are mostly quiet, taken by people who share a
casual familiarity with their subjects. It is that very
ordinariness that gives these images their surreal power.
</P>
<P>
   In an overhead shot of a roadside scene, a crowd has gathered
around a truck, which has the union's initials on the hood and
windshield. Another crowd stands and watches from the pavement,
both groups oblivious to a cannon parked nearby. What is going on?
``Distributing arms to the people from a CNT truck, Madrid, 1936,''
the caption says.
</P>
<P>
   In a picture of boys marching down the street on a
sun-splattered day, they appear to be playing at war, rifles over
one shoulder. But the rifles look suspiciously lethal, and
emblazoned on the chest of each boy's sweater is a star, at the
center of which is the hammer-and-sickle insignia. These are
``Young communists exercising on the streets of Madrid, 1936,'' the
caption says.
</P>
<P>
   Two young couples pose for the camera as if out walking in the
park, the men in uniform, the women fresh-faced and smiling. They
are part of the Garcia Oliver Column setting out in 1936 from their
barracks in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, a year before women first voted in Spain, the
Republican constitution introduced political equality for men and
women. Early in the war, a few women were leading figures of the
Republic, including the fiery Dolores Ibarruri, the Communist
leader known as La Pasionaria, who famously told the Republicans on
the radio in July 1936: ``It is better to die on your feet than to
live on your knees! They shall not pass!''
</P>
<P>
   But this liberating time for women was short-lived. They were
soon ordered back home to tend to housework or to work in
factories, replacing men who had gone to war. But while it lasted,
photographers made many striking images of fighting women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchist militiawoman, undated,'' in the exhibition, is a
close-up of a determined young woman, her hair tucked into a helmet
bearing a skull-and-bones sketch, the shiny barrel of a rifle
against one shoulder, her pale eyes steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militiawoman, Barcelona, July 1936'' shows a different kind of
fighter. Here a young woman in blouse, skirt and sandals, a purse
hanging from a belt, walks cheerfully down the street, toting a
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   In an arresting image, three loyalists lie in wait on the edge
of a cliff overlooking a bucolic valley. Two are uniformed
soldiers; between them is a woman in a dress and sandals. And in
``Three generations of resistance, undated,'' a grim white-haired
woman raises a clenched fist; her daughter and granddaughter follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   In the photographs by Sam Walters, his camera is turned on the
international contingent and loyalists waiting to go to war. These
pictures have a certain Yankee humor and directness, particularly
one of Jack Corrigan. According to the caption, this young man is
convalescing, but with his chest bare, a straw hat on his head, a
bunch of grapes in one hand, he looks in the pink of health. The
caption, however, says he was killed soon after the picture was
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Walters shows a volunteer painting while he waits to be called
to battle. A loyalist peruses an English-language newspaper. And in
a poignant photograph, three young women look out a high window
protected by a metal grille. They are smiling, carefree, seemingly
untouched by war.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint of this image, taken by an anonymous
photographer, is ``Militiaman and girlfriend saying goodbye,
Barcelona, August 1936.'' Photographed from above, this is a spare
picture of a couple surrounded by people, yet intensely alone, he
looking wordlessly at her and she with her eyes cast down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spirit Lives'' ends with photographs of death and
destruction. In a devastating picture that brings to mind the image
of the stricken young woman kneeling by the slain student at Kent
State, a weeping Spanish woman, her arms outstretched in grief,
kneels by a body.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when photography has become for many artists a tool for
purely aesthetic ends, the exhibition at the Puffin Room is a
welcome reminder that the camera can be both pitiless and powerful
when it records events that forever change people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spirit Lives: Photos From the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39''
remains at the Puffin Room, 435 Broome St., New York, through Nov.
29. ``The Spanish Civil War,'' by Abel Paz, published last year by
Hazan of Paris and available at $12.95 from DAP/Distributed Art
Publishers (800-338-2665), includes many of the pictures in the
exhibition as well as Paz's vivid recollections of what he saw and
did during one tumultuous and heady week in July 1936, when he was
a 15-year-old revolutionary in Barcelona.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fellow simply refuses to die. He's been down for
the count any number of times already. The doctor at his side,
monitoring his pulse, can tell you that, as can all those loyal
subjects keening at the foot of his bed.
</P>
<P>
   But Prince Cherney, the gnarled, one-eyed monarch of a
handkerchief-sized European country, keeps popping back up, tossing
off the sheet used to cover his face, a song in his throat and his
eyes afire with vitality. Parting may be sweet sorrow, but the
prospect of sticking around for an endless series of curtain calls
is even sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in the midst of death we are truly in life, or at least
Martin Short is. Ecstatically embodying eight different souls in
the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ``Little Me,'' Short
must perish repeatedly before the evening's end: by pistol, by
poison, by drowning and from digital injuries sustained during a
typing accident.
</P>
<P>
   This actor, however, keeps reincarnating himself with such
improbable reserves of energy and powers of impersonation that it's
a little scary. If he weren't so overwhelmingly enjoyable, you
might consider using a wooden stake on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me,'' the 1962 musical with a book by Neil Simon and
songs by Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh, was originally written for
the great television comic Sid Caesar. Its chain of burlesque-style
vignettes, designed as a showcase for its versatile leading man,
might have come from vintage episodes of ``Your Show of Shows,'' a
television series for which the young Simon, incidentally, was a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   On the page, these scenes read as hokey, crass and seriously
funny reworkings of classic Borscht Belt shtick. What Short does
with them, in the gravely imbalanced production that opened last
night under Rob Marshall's direction, becomes a testament to the
forces of will, instinct and incandescence that make a star. And
not just any old kind of star, but a star of the stage. Though
Short is best known for his work on television and in films, the
stage loves him the way the camera loved Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   When he's ``on'' (and when isn't he?) during a performance, he
gives off a heat that, at least temporarily, chases away the mortal
chills and worries of everyday life. Broadway used to be built
around such personalities: the Bert Lahrs and Ethel Mermans and
Gertrude Lawrences. Nowadays, with the human factor eclipsed by
technological spectacles created by corporate committee, such
figures are rare. When they surface, it's most likely to be in a
one-person vehicle like John Leguizamo's ``Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   So let us now praise the Roundabout for putting Short, whose
sole previous Broadway outing was in the disastrous ``Goodbye
Girl'' five years ago, where he does indeed belong, back on the
stage, and in a role that doesn't shortchange his vast talents.
</P>
<P>
   There is one little problem about ``Little Me,'' however, and
that is that Short is essentially the only thing in it, a life
force surrounded by dead air. You get the feeling that you're
watching a virtuoso high-wire act performed above a soggy field of
a show. And even Short can't totally distract your attention from
the bog beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   That bog claims some heartbreaking casualties. Chief among them
is Faith Prince, the heavenly Miss Adelaide of the fine Broadway
revival of ``Guys and Dolls,'' who is sorely misused in the pivotal
role of Belle Poitrine, an all-American femme fatale. Coleman's
frisky, melodious score is somehow transformed from likable
airiness into something leaden. And as staged by Marshall, a
co-director of the hit revival of ``Cabaret,'' the extensive dance
numbers register as perfunctory pastiche, like the theme
choreography of television variety shows in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Me,'' it seems, is a musical that just can't get an
even break. Its original production, though fondly remembered by
many theatergoers, received mixed reviews and was only a modest
hit, closing after 256 performances. It was retooled, with
extensive rewriting by Simon, 20 years later for a run of a mere 36
performances. In that version, the seven parts played by Caesar
were divided between two actors, James Coco and Victor Garber. Most
critics agreed that this revision robbed the show of its central
comic engine.
</P>
<P>
   No one can accuse this ``Little Me'' of lacking a center, given
the involvement of Short, who has even taken on an additional,
eighth role. Another consolidation of parts is less felicitous,
however. In previous productions of ``Little Me,'' which was
adapted from Patrick Dennis' novel, Belle, who narrates the story
of her rise from rustic poverty to mink-lined fame and fortune, was
portrayed by two actresses.
</P>
<P>
   There was the older, worldly Belle, who clearly was at least
partly making up her past as she described it, and her younger
self, a passive creature of unlikely innocence. The title ``Little
Me'' is ironic, a gibe at all those celebrity memoirs in which the
author modestly insists that success was just a matter of being in
the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   The girl remembered by the older woman is essentially a
variation on the voluptuous naughty nurses of vaudeville routines,
a pair of humongous breasts on legs. The young Belle Poitrine is
little more than a punch line in a ribald joke.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prince is a performer of lovely comic instincts, but she has
always exploited them in the name of character, not shtick, and
here she doesn't have a character to play. Unflatteringly bewigged
and costumed (by Ann Hould-Ward) in outfits that accent her
cleavage like a bull's-eye, she often seems ill at ease and even
slightly embarrassed. When a scene allows her to do a bit of old
movie-style parody, as when she evokes Joan Crawford in her
sacrificial mother mode, you can sense her relief at having
something to hold on to.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, she's forced to rely on complicitous, ``can you believe
this?'' glances to keep the audience on her side. What's more, in
her songs, she is bizarrely sabotaged by the production's sound
system and sight gags. You can't even make out the lyrics of her
opening number. And though she appealingly delivers the wry ``Poor
Little Hollywood Star,'' marking a new chapter in Belle's life in
the second act, she is undercut by the busy array of jokey movie
posters projected around her.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The talented David Gallo (``Jackie,'' ``Bunny Bunny'') is the
set designer here, but for once his inventiveness fails him.
``Little Me'' looks expensive with its flashy rotating scenery
evoking everything from hayseed squalor to the front lines of World
War I. But the visual jokes, which include an homage to the movie
``Titanic,'' usually feel strained and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Marshall's choreography never surprises. It is
dutifully vigorous, but what wit it has feels cheap. The brassy
seduction song, ``I've Got Your Number,'' performed as a striptease
by Michael Park, has the leaden eroticism of a late-night turn at
Chippendale's. And it was definitely a mistake to introduce an arch
Fosse-style routine for a courtroom scene. (Belle, shades of
``Chicago,'' becomes famous when she is tried for murder.) Bob
Fosse was the original choreographer of ``Little Me,'' and it's
better not to remind audiences of what they're missing.
</P>
<P>
   Such winning quick-sketch talents as Michael McGrath, Ruth
Williamson and Christine Pedi are largely wasted. McGrath does some
nifty, bantering teamwork with Short as half of a team of
vaudeville booking agents, and Ms. Williamson, portraying a pair of
monster mothers, at least has a specific comic presence. For the
most part, however, the supporting cast, like Ms. Prince, seems to
be treading water.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with Short, and mercifully, that leaves us with a
lot. He is the ideal purveyor of the kind of hefty, silly jokes
that Simon dishes out here, and is the only member of the cast who
can fill them with the helium they need.
</P>
<P>
   Watch him as an insufferably perfect rich boy, glazed with the
knowledge of his own wealth and virtue, sniffing the air of the
young Belle's trashy neighborhood and saying: ``Smells like
poverty. Someone must have left it out overnight.'' (The line is
new to the script, and unlike the jokes Simon has added about
Belle's chest size, the ones for Short's characters are mostly
winners.)
</P>
<P>
   Listen to how this actor, who has a sweet and solid singing
voice, grows in charm and poignancy during the number ``Real Live
Girl,'' selling the song without shedding the ridiculous nerdiness
of the myopic doughboy he is playing at that moment. When, as a
miserly, geriatric millionaire in a wheelchair, he emerges from
aged stiffness into vicious vitality, it's like watching a
personality being born.
</P>
<P>
   Whether playing a Maurice Chevalier-like music hall star or a
Teutonic tyrant of a movie director, Short's zestful performer's
glee, equal parts ego and generosity, turns cutout cartoons into
portraits of Dickensian robustness. This single blaze of light in a
disappointingly dreary production is enough to justify the ticket
price for ``Little Me.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the evening's most ingenious sight gags involve
making it seem as if Short were in two places at the same time. The
current of this actor's show-biz electricity runs so strong, I
wasn't at all sure that these moments were merely illusions.
</P>

COMMENTARY: SADDAM'S STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.) (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Forget the fascination with our semiannual
military buildup in the Persian Gulf to persuade Saddam Hussein
``this time we're really, really serious.'' That point's been made
with the U.N.'s evacuation of employees it does not want to be
chained to suspected anthrax storage sites.
</P>
<P>
   Focus instead on the strategy of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton strategy up to now has been to go along with U.N.
appeasement of Saddam to such an extent that even the French got
sick of sustained humiliation. Our doormat approach _ though it has
enabled Iraq secretly to steal a march on building terror weapons _
is now being presented as having brilliantly ``unified our
allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been dared by Saddam to launch air strikes, President
Clinton has four strategic options:
</P>
<P>
   One is to do nothing, become the world laughingstock, and watch
the United Nations go the way of the impotent League of Nations.
Another is to remove Saddam's threat by a second invasion, this
time setting up a democratic government in Iraq as we did in 1945
in Germany and Japan. Neither of these options is being considered
by this White House.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have strategic choice No. 3: ``300 pinpricks'' to
exhibit our extreme irritation. Cruise missiles launched from sea
for a couple of weeks, accompanied by film showing the uncanny
smartness of our munitions, would be followed by our unilateral
declaration of ``mission accomplished'' and a promise to annoy Iraq
again next year.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth choice is the ``degrade his capabilities'' option,
which seems to be in favor: Use cruise missiles at first to disrupt
communications and depress air defenses, then strike with carrier
aircraft and heavy bombers from land bases. This would target
suspected weapons manufacturing sites, tank parking lots and army
barracks, similar to our softening-up air campaign of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton joint chiefs would claim we successfully
``degraded'' his threat. That military jargon means ``temporarily
lessened'' but by no means ``ended.'' We would again wait for an
internal revolt to topple him (as we have been for Fidel Castro for
40 years). If it doesn't work out, that's the next U.S. president's
problem, though Saddam may then be in a position to reach for his
ultimate strategic goal.
</P>
<P>
   What is that goal? And could the incipient aerial punishment
help Saddam achieve it?
</P>
<P>
   First, it is to endure and survive. Because the U.S. mission is
limited to punishing but not ending his regime, Saddam is convinced
he can absorb the heaviest air attacks with personal impunity. Nor
is the United States. likely to knock out all his hidden germ, gas
and nuclear weapons potential.
</P>
<P>
   Second, counterattack with his people's suffering. He will
invite television crews to cover collateral damage to civilians. If
necessary, he can set off bombs in children's hospitals and
orphanages himself. Filmed atrocity will not only afflict the
Americans with self-disgust but bring about an alliance with Iran,
which will soon be able to swap its long-range missiles for his
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make a deal with the U.N. for limited access by
non-American inspectors. Clinton _ branded ``baby killer'' by Iraqi
propagandists _ is unlikely to resist, especially if our bombers or
helicopters crash or terrorists take allied lives. This will enable
Saddam's weapons development to go forward in secrecy while
sanctions are lifted. Within two years, Iraqi oil production will
finance purchase of fissionable material and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saddam miscalculated wildly a decade ago, his current
strategy takes full advantage of Clinton's expected decision to
wage limited air war with its modest compliance aim. So long as our
purpose is only to ``degrade'' facilities rather than to replace an
aggressive regime, the strategic advantage is his.
</P>
<P>
   His ultimate purpose is to be able to credibly bluff the West
into letting him dominate his part of the world. In 2002, he moves
on Saudi Arabia; we threaten to invade Iraq; Saddam announces he is
ready to risk national suicide by firing a nuclear missile at us.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no missile defense. Does a prudent
president let him grab those oilfields, or will Clinton's successor
be forced to gamble a U.S. city on the hope that a homicidal maniac
is only bluffing?

FACING NEW RIVALS, GERMAN TELEPHONE GIANT CUTS RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the clearest sign yet of the competition
now roaring through Europe's telephone industry, Deutsche Telekom
AG of Germany said Thursday that it would slash its long-distance
prices by as much as 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Germany's one-time telephone monopoly is
rapidly losing market share to an army of new rivals. Germany,
along with most other European countries, opened the doors to
competition in January.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, analysts estimate the company has lost as much as 25
percent of its long-distance business to new entrants. Some of
these new rivals are billion-dollar consortiums that are building
their own networks, but the vast majority are small companies that
re-sell Telekom's own services at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more visible newcomers is Mobilcom, a small company
that started out by re-selling cellular telephone service but has
recently begun offering cut-rate regular telephone service.
Mobilcom, which went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange earlier
this year, reported Thursday that profits in the first nine months
of the year quintupled to 111.9 million marks, or about $66.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Thursday's price cuts surprised investors, even
though the company had served notice several weeks ago that it
would act aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's stock dropped about 2 percent Thursday, as
company executives warned that the price reductions would probably
hurt profits in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is without question a big dip in our cash till,''
acknowledged Deutsche Telekom's chief executive, Ron Sommer, who
attributed many of the company's problems to hostile decisions by
German regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from the European Union, most West European
governments opened their telephone markets to competition last
January. Beyond simply allowing other companies to offer telephone
service for the first time, the European Union rules require the
traditional monopolies to give rivals access to their networks at
reasonable rates.
</P>
<P>
   German regulators have been particularly tough, forcing Deutsche
Telekom to let rivals use its network for comparatively low prices.
Those regulatory decisions have attracted a horde of competitors,
from giant enterprises like Arcor, partly owned by Mannesmann AG
and the German national railroad, to tiny upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Europe's traditional telephone monopolies are under fire
from new competitors. But analysts said that Deutsche Telekom added
to its own problems by being slow to revamp its rates, keeping many
of its prices too high.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sommer openly acknowledged several weeks ago that his company
had lost ground. Though Telekom reported that earnings had risen 22
percent during the first nine months of the year, its revenue has
stalled since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives have told analysts that about 15 percent of
the calls over its network last June were actually on behalf of
rival carriers. Most analysts assume that percentage has climbed to
about 20 or 25 percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer is now waging a vocal political and legal campaign to
modify some of the government's new decisions. Deutsche Telekom has
sued to overturn the price regulations and sued to block some of
its rivals' advertising. In the most recent spat, the company sued
to block Mobilcom from running television and print ads that
mimicked Deutsche Telekom's own logos and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer is also lobbying the new government under Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, arguing that his company is forced to subsidize
competitors and that Germany's new and independent
telecommunications regulator has been one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, company executives argue that the government
forced the company to spend billions of marks on a new telephone
network for eastern Germany as well as new digital phone lines
throughout the west. That left the company with a huge load of
debt, just when it was losing its protected monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing today is a price war being waged on
Telekom's back,'' Sommer said in a speech today. ``The present
situation fills me with worry about the future of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's new government appears to be sympathetic. Economics
Minister Werner Mueller recently said the regulators may have been
too tough.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with the Suddeutsche Zeitung, a
Munich-based newspaper, Mueller said he saw himself ``in the role

   MONTREAL _ Paul Newman, purveyor of a dandy spaghetti sauce and
a decent glass of lemonade, pours himself a cup of coffee. The
threat of rain has delayed filming here on ``Where the Money Is,''
a Marek Kenievska caper co-starring Linda Fiorentino. So the man
with two Oscars and a famous pair of blue eyes has a chance to sit
in a hotel coffee shop and chat about one of his consuming
passions, automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   That interest, which blossomed while he was filming the 1969
racing drama ``Winning'' with his wife, Joanne Woodward, inspired a
second successful career, as a race-car driver, and a third as a
race-team owner. (Newman and Carl Haas founded the respected
Newman/Haas Racing team.)
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wheel, Newman has won four Sports Car Club of America
national driving championships and claimed two Trans-Am victories,
along with a second-place finish at LeMans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, at age 70, he entered the Guinness Book of World
Records as the oldest driver to win a competitively sanctioned
event, a GTS-class win at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Through the
years, he has owned a succession of potent street cars, and last
year he acquired part interest in a Volvo-Mazda dealership in
Milford, Conn., not far from his Westport home.
</P>
<P>
   Off the track and out of his fire-retardant suit, Newman honed
his acting craft while his Newman's Own food-products business grew
beyond all expectations. (``It outgrosses my films,'' he said, only
half joking.) He oversees the donation of all Newman's Own profits
_ more than $80 million so far _ to a variety of charitable causes,
including the Hole in the Wall Gang camps he founded for seriously
ill children.
</P>
<P>
   As if all that did not keep him busy enough, he acquired a stake
in the United States' oldest news weekly, The Nation, an
institution known, like himself, for left-leaning views.
</P>
<P>
   Given many liberals' antipathy for cars and motor sports, it
seemed natural to ask how he squares his politics and his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I suppose everybody's entitled to a vice,'' he said with
a chuckle. ``But seriously, I think if you do the math on it,
you'll find out that football uses up more gasoline than automobile
racing. Baseball, too. I mean, figure out what the spectators use
in terms of gasoline getting to and from the games. The amount of
gasoline that is used by the participants in a race is nothing
compared to what it costs in terms of fuel to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman has burned plenty of fuel, even off the track, given his
native enthusiasm for going fast. ``I'm not interested in
off-the-line,'' he said. ``I'm interested in being able to get
around trucks to get out of trouble. And when you get behind two
trucks and a bus and you've got about 700 feet to pass all three of
them, you'd better make sure that you've got a lot of stuff. Third-
and fourth-gear stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of his Hollywood contemporaries have gone for gaudy
road monsters and flashy Italian exotics, his automotive ideal is
the low-key custom, the stealth machine, the street sleeper. For
security reasons, he will not confirm that a couple of souped-up
Volvos have passed through his garage in recent years, though he
used such a car earlier this year to give a reporter a lift to the
train station _ and the cantankerous beast broke down on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days, I had Volkswagens with Porsche Super 90
engines,'' he said. ``And Rabbits with Callaway turbos. I also
owned one Beetle that had a 351 Ford V8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly because they were inconspicuous. You can park in front
of a hotel and nobody pays any attention to it. It's not like
banging up in a Ferrari. This way, you can move like a crab into
the lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he is reminded, there can be nothing stealthlike
about a Beetle with a V8 residing where the back seat was meant to
be. ``Yes, it really was hairy,'' he said. ``Great in a straight
line, but boy, it never did the same thing twice.'' He remembers
more fondly a loaner from his former racing backers at Nissan, ``a
little gray four-door, a Maxima, with a turbo straight six that had
been stroked. A real rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   On one of the great enthusiasts' debates of today _ sport
utility vehicles, yea or nay _ Newman has a foot in both camps.
``We move from one consumer fad to the next,'' he said. ``In 1973,
everybody's running around buying Volkswagen diesels. And now
they're buying Expeditions. And this is the thing that I don't
understand about the government. As this fad grew, why they didn't
insist on certain bumper heights _ I mean, it's criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when an Expedition is 8 years old and it goes down to
7,000 bucks, there'll be a lot of kids buying them, and
unfortunately it's the younger generation that's responsible for a
lot of accidents. So you put a 17-year-old kid behind a 5,500-pound
car and have them run into your blue-haired lady driving her Tercel
Toyota. You know, it's going to be mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that sport utilities are great for towing, and he
has had one of his own. ``When Joanne was doing a play in the
middle of the winter up in New Haven, we got one for her because I
really wanted to have a four-wheel-drive car. And I wanted to put
her in something heavy. It's defensive.''

<P>
   Newman, born in Cleveland in January 1925, wasn't always a car
fancier. His first car, bought while he was at Kenyon College, was
a 1929 Ford Model A. ``Exuberant at winning a football game, I
think, we set the whole thing on fire,'' he said. ``Then, after
that, a 1937 Packard, which I drove all the way from Wisconsin back
to Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing his introduction to racing, he is characteristically
humble. ``I was very slow getting started,'' he said. ``It's just
like anything else for me. I was really very slow as an actor, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cautious. But like everything else, I was tenacious as
hell. And I really was determined. So I didn't do any work at film
from May until October for almost 15 years. I just wouldn't take a
job. I think maybe once or twice I took jobs that kind of
overlapped a month into the racing season or started a month before
the season was over, but always with the thing that I could come
down and run the runoffs down in Atlanta or run a couple of races
for Trans-Am.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the transition from well-heeled hobbyist to racer around
1979. ``And I was pretty good for about three or four years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean this as whining, but really, ask Joanne, I have
tried all sports,'' he said. ``But I really have no physical grace
and the only thing that probably made me go fast is that I finally
found some grace in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   While he advises would-be racers to start young, he began his
own racing career late, entering his first event at 47. Even now,
at 73, he runs an occasional race and has high words of praise _
``Delicious!'' _ for Panoz race cars he has driven, and for the
Lotus Esprit road car. But he reckons he is ``not as fast as I used
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won the GT1 championship in '85 and '86 and then I really
started to go downhill after that,'' he said. ``Drove a couple of
races, drove for Oldsmobile for a year or two. I think it was
probably everything _ I'm older, different crew chief. In Trans-Am,
I would qualify in the top five almost every time, and then it was
the top seven and then it was the top 10, and then it was the top
12.''
</P>
<P>
   How did that feel? ``Bad _ but the lack of practice and getting
older, it's got to catch up to you sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike most racers, Paul Newman has several other careers
to fall back on, and they're still moving at full speed. He hasn't
hit the wall yet.

GROCERY STORES IN NEW YORK HAVE SPECIAL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GROCERY-STORE-CHANGES) 
(lb) 
 By DANA CANEDY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most Americans shopping for hamburger or stewed
tomatoes lately have probably noticed new kinds of grocery stores
offering more kinds of exotic fruit, caseloads of staples, even
Italian cooking classes. Unless, that is, they live in or near New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Though New Yorkers still have the best selection of olive oil
and salmon at places like Zabar's, Balducci's and D'Agostino's,
many of the changes under way elsewhere in the food retailing
business have bypassed this complex market.
</P>
<P>
   Roads into the city are too narrow for caravans of huge
grocery-delivery trucks. Large lots to erect new stores are scarce.
And operating costs in the metropolitan area are steeper than, say,
in Cleveland or Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has always been a sort of poison pill,'' said Ken
Harris, a partner with Cannondales Associates, a consulting firm
that advises supermarket chains around the country. ``The barriers
to entry here are so high that you really have to look long and
hard at the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Large chains like Kroger and Safeway have been snapping up
competitors around the country and putting up bigger stores with
more bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it happening in our community, just because the
opportunity is not there to acquire chains as easily,'' said
Nicholas D'Agostino Jr., chairman and chief executive of D'Agostino
Supermarkets Inc., which operates 25 stores in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the return isn't there,'' D'Agostino said. ``I don't
think the big guys want to come in and waste their time.''
</P>
<P>
   The quirkiness of this market extends to New York's suburbs. In
Westchester County and other outlying areas, chains like Grand
Union and A&AMP;P have struggled for years. Available land, the high
cost of union labor and other factors make the market less
attractive to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   So, at least for now, it seems that Grand Union, D'Agostino's,
Pathmark and Gristedes will not have to fret that Kroger or
Wal-Mart might edge in on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual problems of the New York market ``are certainly a
factor anytime you look at expanding,'' said Lynn Marmer, a
spokeswoman for Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers and distributors also face less threat from
suppliers looking for new opportunities as chains elsewhere push
out the middle man. ``They don't affect us,'' said Richard Neff,
executive vice president and chief financial officer of White Rose,
the food distribution division of Di Giorgio Corp., which serves
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   His counterparts in other regions tend to shy away from this
market because ``there are a lot of problems in operating in New
York, cost being one of them,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In places like Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., where competition
and price wars have intensified, shoppers have become spoiled by
all the attention aimed at their food dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In stores in those markets, consumers have come to expect not
just bargain prices, but wine experts who can suggest which
burgundy goes best with what cut of beef, aisles wide enough for
carts to pass without bumping, and even health clubs for working
off the damage done at the pastry counter.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Agostino said New York supermarkets also provide the best
value for shoppers' money in a much more difficult environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't compare Manhattan supermarkets with a suburban store on
an item-for-item price basis,'' D'Agostino insisted. ``We don't
offer 25-pound bags of dog food and 10-pound bags of Tide
detergent, only because the majority of the customers we serve live
in apartments and are looking for smaller-quantity sizes. Also, we
are paying very high real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just other grocers that supermarket operators in
New York have to contend with. This, after all, is a market where
instead of having drive-through windows, some McDonald's
restaurants deliver Big Macs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer in New York,'' D'Agostino said, has ``so many
alternatives.''

HONDA AND MAZDA REPORT STRONG PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Despite recent trouble in the Japanese auto industry,
Honda Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. reported impressive profit
gains Thursday for the first half of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's carmakers have faced slumping sales in the domestic
market, a credit squeeze and a recent unfavorable swing in
dollar-yen exchange rates. Earlier this week, Nissan Motor Co., the
nation's troubled No. 2 carmaker, posted a loss and revised its
outlook for the fiscal year from flat to negative. And last Friday,
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a major reorganization and
continued losses in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But Honda said Thursday that net profit in the first half, which
ended on Sept. 30, jumped 25 percent, to 158.3 billion yen, or
$1.28 billion, compared with 126.5 billion yen in the period a year
earlier, thanks largely to robust sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda, which is controlled by Ford Motor Co. and trades
separately, was helped by strong sales in Europe and the benefits
of a cost-cutting program. It posted a net profit of 8.5 billion
yen, or $69.1 million, compared with a loss of 9.7 billion yen in
the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp., the largest Japanese car company, will
report its earnings next week and is expected to announce a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Honda _ which is Japan's third-largest automaker _ and
Mazda may already be confronting a tougher environment. For one
thing, the yen rose sharply against the dollar last month, which
makes their exports to the United States more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the 541,714 cars Honda sold in the United
States in the first six months of the fiscal year were also made in
the United States; the remainder of its sales came from shipments
of sport utility vehicles and some Acura models from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mazda's gains came in Europe, where sales rose 31
percent, to 132,000 vehicles, the yen has also gained against
European currencies in the last six weeks, which could make such
gains in the future more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And both companies said they would be affected by a worldwide
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mazda and Honda raised their earnings predictions
for the full fiscal year ending on March 31. Mazda said it now
expected profit to rise 6.7 percent, to 32 billion yen, or $260
million, which would be its largest since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is expecting a 7.4 percent jump in profit, to 280 billion
yen, or $2.3 billion, for the year. ``We don't see any slowdown in
the U.S.,'' said Koichi Amemiya, president of Honda's U.S.
operations.

NEELY BACK ON ICE FOR A SECOND DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ And on the second day of The Great Comeback
attempt, Cam Neely skated again.
</P>
<P>
   This time for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was pain, to be sure, but the former and perhaps future
Bruins right winger knows that's to be expected. And there was no
more pain than the day before, so he's encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   That means his bid to rejoin the Bruins and the rigors of the
NHL, which he was forced to abandon before the 1996-97 season
because of a chronic hip injury, will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after skating with the Bruins for the first
time since February 1996, Neely reported he ``felt good enough to
show up again'' and gave it another whirl at the Ristuccia Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some pain (Wednesday), which I expected,'' he said,
``but it subsided enough to come out here and try it again today.
The second day was more important than the first, and the third
will be more important than the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern and what I'm really going to watch and
judge for is, I do still have pain, but is the pain going to
increase over use or is it going to go away and then every time I
use it get a little more pain and then subside again?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that encouraged him was how he felt when he awoke
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I woke up in more pain today than what I woke up with
(Wednesday), I would have been concerned and probably wouldn't have
skated today,'' he said. ``But since I didn't have any more pain
than (Wednesday) morning, I gave it another go. And the same goes
for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm going to be able to tolerate, what I want to
tolerate. I'm not getting all that excited just yet. It's only been
a couple of days on the ice. I mean, it's nice to be out here,
don't get me wrong, but I'm not doing cartwheels yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely said his endurance Thursday was better Thursdaythan the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I felt a little better today, but you know, one thing
I'm not concerned about is conditioning,'' he said. ``If I can get
to the point where I can skate every day, the conditioning will
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Winger Peter Ferraro, who never played with or against Neely,
said he is awed by what the former 50-goal scorer is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable feeling to be even out there with a guy
like that,'' said Ferraro, whom the Bruins picked up as a free
agent this past summer. ``He's the epitome of a power forward, and
the courage he's showing in trying to come back, you have to hand
it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For being out two or three years and come here and be in the
shape that he looks like he's in, I mean, it looks like he hasn't
even missed a beat. It's definitely an honor to be out there with a
guy like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, too, seeing him out there is a wake-up call.
Sometimes you come to practice and say to yourself, `Maybe I don't
feel like going today,' and you might complain in certain
situations. But here's a guy that's injured trying to make a
comeback. It makes you thankful you're healthy and able to play
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely's on-ice comeback bid takes a brief recess Friday with the
Bruins in New York for Friday's game against the Rangers. He
indicated that he would work instead with physical therapist Dan
Dyrek and ``probably lift some weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely isn't taking anything for granted and knows he has a long
way to go to make The Great Comeback attempt a reality and call
himself a Boston Bruin again.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what reaction he was getting from his teammates, he said,
``Well, they're not my teammates. Some of them are former teammates
and some of them I played against and some I just know for the
first time. So I wouldn't call them teammates. But it's nice they
allow me to skate with them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the natural order of a food chain is upset, the battle for
survival intensifies. Such is the case in the nation's grocery
business.
</P>
<P>
   This Darwinian struggle has its roots in two evolutionary
shifts. First, discount giants like Wal-Mart have leapfrogged into
a powerful position by becoming big sellers of groceries as well as
garden hoses. And second, regional supermarket chains like Kroger
Co. are in a frenzy of consolidation, merging to create national
chains able to compete head to head with the discounters.
</P>
<P>
   As these giants battle it out, manufacturers, wholesalers,
distributors and independent grocers risk being trampled if they
can't learn the new rules and adjust to the new order quickly
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change? While retailers used to take many of their
marching orders from food suppliers, the balance has tilted, with
some retailers now so big that they often call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   All these forces converge in the story of James McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is president of John C. Groub Co., which runs a 30-store
grocery chain in southern Indiana that was sold to Kroger earlier
this year. In his 33 years at Groub, McCoy never expected his
company to lose its independence.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wal-Mart's Supercenters, which sell food and general
merchandise under one roof, moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been coming for five years, and we had been very
successful in competing with them in the beginning,'' recalled
McCoy, whose stores go by the names Jay C Food Stores and Food
Plus. ``But as time went on, we began to feel the effect because
they were going into smaller and smaller towns.'' And this, he went
on, was ``the profit lifeblood of our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, manufacturers of everything from paper
towels to soup began requiring ever-larger orders in return for the
best prices. ``It was all brought about,'' McCoy said, ``because of
the pressure Wal-Mart brought to bear on P&AMP;G, Campbell's etc. to
become more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he was approached by Kroger, the nation's largest food
retailer, it was as if a big brother had arrived to stare down a
bully.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger, he said, is committed to retaining the stores'
small-town flavor. ``If you accept the fact that it would only be a
matter of time and we would either have closed some stores or laid
people off,'' McCoy said, ``the communiy is going to benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana as elsewhere, this power shift is taking place far
from shoppers' view, but the impact will be felt from stockroom to
checkout counter. Supermarket operators and suppliers insist that
customers will be the biggest beneficiaries, and at least in the
short term that seems likely, as competitors clamor for consumer
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway Inc. chief executive Steven Burd said, ``If done well,
it lowers the operating expenses for those companies, which allows
them to be in a better position to compete with some of the
emerging formats out there that typically have lower costs.''
</P>
<P>
   If the recent mergers fail to produce cost savings, of course,
the long-term benefit will be minimal. The chains, though, are
betting big on the power of size.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buying Groub, Kroger announced plans last month
to acquire Fred Meyer in a $13 billion deal that will create the
largest supermarket chain in the country, with 2,200 stores in 31
states and combined annual revenue of about $43 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent deals, Albertson's plans to acquire American
Stores; Royal Ahold bought Giant Food, Stop &AMP; Shop and Bi-Lo
chains, and Safeway absorbed Vons and Dominick's.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is not necessarily good news to distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retailers are going to be a little stronger and have a
little more muscle in the marketplace,'' said former Agriculture
Secretary John Block, who is president of Food Distributors
International, a trade group. Already the changes are exacting a
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve years ago we had more than 300 full-line wholesalers,''
Block said. ``Today we're down to 97, and 12 of them do 80 percent
of the business.'' Though he sees advantages for the most efficient
suppliers, ``I don't see any end in sight to the consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, competition from discounters is likely to hit food
retailers even harder. Kmart, for example, has said that it is
converting nearly 2,000 stores to formats that include grocery
sections and is considering a merger with a major supermarket chain
or wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   As the market becomes more crowded, small independent grocers
will have an even tougher time holding on. Many lack the resources
to compete with megastores that sell 20 kinds of olives and
practically give away orange juice to lure shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mom-and-pops, the independent, the life of those people is
really very short,'' McCoy said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was a time when family-owned, one-store grocers were the
driving force in the business. Grocers date back to the days of the
tea merchants of the late 1800s and came into their own in the
1930s. Over several decades, independents and mostly regional
chains filled in the growing suburban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s and '80s brought new formats, like convenience stores
and warehouse stores. A wave of consolidation hit in the 1980s,
when chains became more aggressive about expansion. Now, many of
them control entire regions and are seeking to become national in
scope.
</P>
<P>
   While some food suppliers are folding under the pressure, others
are finding new ways to squeeze profits from, of all things,
sardines and cream of asparagus soup.
</P>
<P>
   A wholesale company called One Source, for instance, buys and
stocks slow-selling items for chains. The arrangement frees
retailers' warehouse space for better-selling products like Tide
and Coke and enables One Source to receive volume discounts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In most stores, ``chicken noodle soup and tomato soup fly off
the shelf, but cream of asparagus probably doesn't move a case a
month,'' said Jack Haedicke, chief operating officer for One
Source, a division of C&AMP;S Wholesale Grocers in Brattleboro, Vt.
``If you've got a warehouse full of slow movers and grab from
enough retailers and put them in one centralized location, they are
not slow movers any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In fighting back against discounters like Wal-Mart and Costco,
supermarket operators have been forced to reduce costs sharply,
invest in money-saving technology and remodel or close outdated
stores. Then, as leaner, more efficient operators, they have begun
to focus on growth, snapping up rivals to expand beyond saturated
markets and to benefit from economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Now the larger chains have the size to steamroll over weaker
competitors and to demand that manufacturers and distributors bend
on everything from promotions and product packaging to shipment
schedules and fees for shelf space in order to shave costs further.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an entire supply chain out there that talks about all
the costs embedded in moving product from the manufacturer's truck
to the trunk of the customer's car,'' said Burd of Safeway. ``We've
gotten very good at our element of the food supply chain, and we're
looking forward to working with vendors on their side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the largest manufacturers and wholesalers are the
least affected by the new industry demands. After all, even Kroger
and Safeway must sell Campbell Soup and Crest. And the makers of
these and other top-selling brands were the pioneers of many
changes now driving the retail business.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive were among
the first, for instance, to invest in the technology that retailers
now use to track product sales by store, manage inventory and
billing and control distribution.
</P>
<P>
   When retailers demanded Colgate's new Total toothpaste as soon
as it rolled off production lines last year, the company used
technology-driven distribution to get it on store shelves
nationwide in less than a month _ half the time it would have taken
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a $100 million marketing budget, the largest in the
company's history for a new product, ``Total was in your face from
a consumer point of view, but it was also in your face from a
retail point of view,'' said Ian Cook, president of Colgate U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, the company has cut its shipment time in half _
to 6 days from 12 _ and increased its on-time delivery rate to 97
percent from about 92. This enables it to meet the greater demands
from retailers. In the case of Total, it helped catapult the
product into a top-selling brand within months.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers and retailers that lack the size of a Colgate or
Wal-Mart are seeking strength in numbers. The membership of the
Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, has declined to 2,000 from
2,700 over the past decade as more independents have folded into
chains or closed altogether. But those grocers that remain are
increasing their sales volume, thus swelling the consortium's
marketing and purchasing power. The average revenue of an IGA store
increased to $5.2 million last year from $3.3 million a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller grocers like these are also trying other ways to fight
back. They say they are putting renewed emphasis on details that
big chains tend to overlook. One scrappy independent, David Skogen,
who owns six stores in La Crosse, Wis., says he is going ahead with
plans to expand by two stores a year even though Wal-Mart recently
said it would build a superstore in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Skogen, who owns two Skogen's supermarkets and four Festival
Foods discount grocery stores, said he would beat Wal-Mart and
other large chains by continuing to provide ``the things they don't
mess with.''
</P>
<P>
   His stores hold knife-sharpening promotions, for instance, load
their parking lots with pumpkins each fall and even provide
shoppers locked out of their cars with free locksmith services and
a spare set of keys. ``People don't forget those things,'' Skogen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Skogen says he also relies increasingly on his relationship with
Flemming Cos., a huge wholesaler, to get the most buying power.
``We lean on them for retail counsel, financial experts and their
real estate guru,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By refining his focus and maintaining a neighborly touch, Skogen
said, ``we will continue to have a seat once the music stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But even if he does, many others will be out of the
game.

FOLKMAN, HOSPITAL FAULT REPORT ABOUT CANCER DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's Hospital and Harvard
Medical School have taken issue with a newspaper report suggesting
that serious snags had arisen in the development and testing of two
novel cancer drugs from his laboratory that have received much
hopeful publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman acknowledged in an interview Thursday that the effort to
move the two drugs from mouse experiments into human trials has
experienced a ``bump in the road.'' But he said this is not
surprising, given that the drugs are extremely complex to make and
administer correctly, and he said such temporary hitches had
occurred in his work previously and had been overcome in time.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, head of the surgical research laboratory at Children's,
is the pioneer of ``angiogenesis inhibitors'' _ substances that cut
off the blood supply to tumors so they can't grow or spread. This
approach is considered by many scientists and pharmaceutical
companies to be among the most promising of all weapons in the war
on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman commented in response to an article in Thursday's Wall
Street Journal that said ``doubts and frustration'' have arisen
among some researchers because the Harvard scientist's promising
results have been difficult to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Folkman claimed that the article contained
misquotations and omissions that put the progress of the
anti-angiogenesis work in a falsely bad light.
</P>
<P>
   Responses were also issued by the National Cancer Institute and
EntreMed, Inc., the company that has licensed rights to develop the
drugs. Both EntreMed and the NCI are working on making endostatin
in large amounts, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is developing
angiostatin.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, EntreMed said it ``stands solidly behind the
data'' showing angiostatin and endostatin to be potent anti-tumor
drugs. The company, whose stock Thursday lost 24 percent of its
value and traded at 10 times its normal daily volume, said it has
not changed its plan to begin clinical trials with endostatin in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the cancer institute, however, said it's not
known when it will be able to begin human trials of endostatin and
angiostatin, originally slated to begin in 1999. The NCI has been
testing endostatin in mice, hoping to replicate the dramatic
results Folkman has reported, before moving to human tests.
However, the institute said in a statement, ``studies using either
the mouse or human forms of endostatin have not produced the marked
regession of these tumors in mice that Folkman's laboratory has
reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Commented Folkman, ``There are often many problems which have to
be overcome in transferring a new technique from one lab to
another, which mainly involve a learning period.'' Scientists from
his lab and the NCI lab will be visiting each other's facilities
over the next two months to try resolve the problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal article said that ``a number of experts say they
haven't been able to verify Dr. Folkman's findings'' on the potency
of endostatin and angiostatin, both of which were discovered only
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman agreed that there have as yet been no published reports
from other labs ``of complete regression of tumors in mice'' which
he and his colleagues said occurred when the two drugs were used in
combination. But he said this isn't surprising because that work
was published in 1997 ``and it usually takes two years'' for other
scientists to repeat the experiments and publish the results.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal quoted another Harvard scientist, Bjorn Olsen, a
collaborator of Folkman's, as saying he couldn't reproduce the
impressive results that Folkman obtained with endostatin alone in
mice. But Folkman said Thursday that Olsen had not carried out the
identical experiment. He added that Olsen had planned a separate
response but had decided to let Folkman speak for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we're two professors arguing (according to the
newspaper article) but we're not,'' he said.

CASKIE STINNETT, 87; TRAVEL WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caskie Stinnett, a travel writer and humorist who claimed he
traveled a lot because he didn't want his life ``disrupted by
routine,'' died of cancer Nov. 5 in his home in Wayne, Pa. He was
87.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Stinnett's stories appeared in Atlantic Monthly, Travel &AMP;
Leisure, the Saturday Evening Post, and the Ladies' Home Journal.
During his 65-year career he traveled all over the world, but
always returned to Hamloaf, his 3 1/2-acre island in Casco Bay in
Maine, where he had summered since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring Mr. Stinnett would enlist family and friends,
especially friends with large cars, to help him ``open the
island.'' Docks and floats would be installed, planters filled with
geraniums, and the reminders of animals that had wintered in his
cottage swept out.
</P>
<P>
   He appreciated the island, he wrote, ``for looking the same as
it did 1,000 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born Harry Caskie Stinnett in Remington, Va. He graduated
from William and Mary College in 1932 and began his career as a
newspaper reporter in Staunton, Va., before joining the Curtis
Publishing Co. in Philadelphia in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He became travel editor and eventually editor in chief of
Holiday magazine, a position he held from 1967 until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years with Curtis Publishing, he moved to New York
City, where he became editor of Travel &AMP; Leisure magazine.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from Travel &AMP; Leisure in 1977, he moved to
Boston, where he lived for 10 years. He also wrote a column called
``A Room with a View'' for Downeast magazine for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of his Downeast columns titled ``One Man's
Island,'' Mr. Stinnett wrote, ``The thought of owning an island is
perhaps the most romantic concept left to humankind in the 20th
century. On an island the corrosion of progress is as great as the
owner will tolerate and no greater. That fragment of land, floating
in the sea, offers such rare prizes as remoteness, privacy,
silence, and above all the opportunity to create a small world of
one's own.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his adopted state, he wrote, ``The miracle of Maine is that
those of us who have given our hearts to the place never seem to
get very far from it, regardless of how far afield we wander.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Joan B. Werblin; a son, James L. of Yardley,
Pa.; two daughters, Savannah Lewis of Seldovia, Alaska, and Karen
Gelband of New York City; two sisters, Lucille Hersberger and
Thelma Griffith; and three grandsons.

   IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) _ As the United States continued to
build up its forces for a possible attack on Iraq, there was an
eerie diplomatic silence Thursday that made this crisis with Iraq
different from previous confrontations. There were no last-minute
efforts to mediate, no high-level envoys rushing to Baghdad and no
plans for U.N. intervention. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-HOMEBUILDING (Jerusalem) _ Infuriating Palestinian peace
negotiators and underscoring Israeli insistence on permanent

   BRAZIL-IMF (Washington) _ After months of negotiations, the
International Monetary Fund and more than a dozen nations around
the world are expected to announce $45 billion in loans to Brazil
to stabilize its economy, including upwards of $5 billion from the
United States, the biggest American commitment of taxpayer funds to
a foreign economic crisis since the bailout of Mexico in 1995. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   SANFRAN-HOMELESS (San Francisco) _ Three weeks ago, someone
started stalking homeless people here, bending over them as they
slept and slashing their throats. One suspect has been arrested _ a
21-year-old man who told police he was a vampire who drank his
victims' blood, but the arrest is unlikely to cool the debate the
slashings have rekindled over what to do about the people with no
place to call home. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   SINATRA-CONFERENCE (Hempstead, N.Y.) _ At Hofstra University,
more than 1,200 scholars, friends, camp followers, colleagues and

animals with compounds that destroyed the tumors' blood supply. By
Denise Grady
</P>
<P>
   STATE-FARM-BANKING (Washington) _ Chipping away at legal

   LITTLEME-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ Ecstatically embodying
eight different souls in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival
of ``Little Me,'' Martin Short must perish repeatedly before the

injuries sustained during a typing accident. This actor, however,
keeps reincarnating himself with such improbable reserves of energy
and powers of impersonation that it's a little scary. By Ben

   HURRICANE-AFTERMATH (Managua, Nicaragua) _ With more than 10,000
people believed drowned in floods or buried in landslides, the
hurricane called Mitch ranks as the most deadly natural disaster to

   QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry if I'm running a little bit late. I was at Kinko's
last night and I had such a long wait. I was behind Newt Gingrich
who was xeroxing his resume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had told me a year ago that Newt Gingrich would be
out of politics and Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura would be in, I would
have said, 'You're nuts! What are you talking about?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even understand how Washington works. The Republicans
are the ones in power in Congress. They're in power, they fire
their leader. How does the coach of the Redskins keep his job?''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the latest DNA analysis, every single member of
our studio audience is related to either Thomas Jefferson or Shawn
Kemp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula Jones' lawyers are now quitting her case. This is the
second set of lawyers that quit. They said that Jones wasn't being
responsive to their suggestions. And today, Clinton said, 'Pffft,
tell me about it!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exciting news. Looks like the Rolling Stones are gonna tour
the United States again next year. 300 bucks a ticket. That does
seem awful high. Especially when you consider so many Rolling
Stones fans are now on fixed incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big rumor is Barbara Walters is going to interview Monica
Lewinsky on her TV show, '20/20.' Does anybody care what this woman
has to say? Unless she is going to demonstrate her techniques on
Hugh Downs, I'm not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Lee told MTV that while he was in jail he read New Age
doctor and spiritual guru Deepak Chopra's books. Actually he met
Deepak Chopra and he told him that he read his books and that he
admired him. Deepak said he saw Tommy Lee's video and admired
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A boy in Texas who bought a pack of football cards found one
of them had a picture of a naked woman on it. Actually very
valuable. Turns out it's a 1973 Dr. Laura Schlessinger rookie
card.''

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says if U.N. inspectors aren't allowed to do their
work in Iraq, ``they may as well be in Baltimore.'' Oh, right. Like
there's a Saddam Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors have left Baghdad. Maybe they could just
phone Iraq's suspected sites long distance and ask if anything bad
is going on.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 3,200 U.S. veterans of World War I are still
alive. And, we bet, would be willing to stay 80 more years telling
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace can never be a time for rest,'' Mr. Clinton says. Yes,
but it's harder to sleep with bombs exploding hither and yon.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House Judiciary Committee are preparing for Ken
Starr's upcoming appearance. But so far we've seen none of them
wearing a Peter Rodino mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former adversaries are becoming our partners,'' Mr. Clinton
says. He was talking about foreign matters, not Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Two supercomputers _ one named Big Blue, the other Big Mountain
_ now both claim to be the fastest in the world. But for speed in
leaving town, our money is still on Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Georgia are lining up to run for the House seat
Gingrich is vacating. What a guy. He not only made Democrats feel
good, he's providing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of top high school students admit they're
prejudiced, a survey shows. Hold on. Maybe all they said is they're
against polls.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, it's reported, got upset in a New York
restaurant recently and barked at the staff. It's breathtaking to
think about what would not have been news a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices are near an 11-year low. So there's one more great
cheap Christmas gift idea.
</P>
<P>
   The next House speaker, Bob Livingston, is 6-feet-4 and is said
to have an explosive temper. Yes, but is he tall and angry enough
to slam-dunk Dick Gephardt?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Livingston say he's not shy about using power.
Still, he may find in his new job that wise use of authority is a
hard Newt to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston used to be a prosecutor in New Orleans. One thing
we're sure of is that he didn't leave there because there was no
one left to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a manager,'' Livingston says. If he's right, we can think
of several baseball teams who may make him an offer.
</P>
<P>
   After Livingston's mother watched him on TV once as he shouted
on the House floor, she told him he looked like ``a raving
lunatic'' and to knock it off. Maybe she's the one who should be in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich says the GOP needs unity so it can push its ``big
ideas.'' Maybe first it should answer our question: ``Hey, what's
the big idea?''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Cohen says ``time is running out'' for Iraq to
back down on the U.N. inspectors issue. It seems more like it's
walking out.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton has decided to ease the sanctions imposed on India
and Pakistan for their nuclear testing earlier this year. Odd. We
didn't know sanctions, too, had a measurable half-life.
</P>
<P>
   In taped testimony at the Microsoft trial, Bill Gates has denied
trying to intimidate Intel. We'd like someone to intimidate the
computer industry as much as our computer intimidates us.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is trying to figure out what constitutes an impeachable
offense. How about whatever finally makes Hillary leave Bill?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some day each of us will be able to recall exactly
where we were and what we were doing when we learned Chris Cox was
withdrawing as a candidate for U.S. House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary,'' Mr. Clinton says.
Which is about what Miss Manners makes you say about anyone you're
glad to see go.
</P>
<P>
   The next House speaker is expected to be less confrontational
than Newt Gingrich. No surprise. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura _ even
in the ring _ is less confrontational than Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The likely next House speaker, Bob Livingston, says public
opinion should be considered in deciding whether to impeach Bill
Clinton. Careful. Let's not Gallup to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next Congress is the next Congress,'' Gingrich says.
Republicans must be upset he didn't offer such wisdom in the recent
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura says he doesn't plan to run for president in 2000.
Darn. If he won he could go to Iraq and settle things with Saddam
one on one.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is still trying to figure out what to do about Iraq.
Now that he's available, why not threaten to send Newt Gingrich?
</P>
<P>
   Some gun shows, says Mr. Clinton, ``have become illegal arms
bazaars for criminals and gun traffickers.'' No wonder they're so
popular.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn is undergoing three weeks of medical tests. In NASA
terms, this is known as your standard 3.68-million-mile checkup.

CARDINAL DECLARES UNITY WITH JEWS IN ADRESS TO ADL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With tensions between Jewish leaders and the Vatican
rising over several recent issues related to the Holocaust,
Cardinal Bernard Law Thursday stood before the national meeting of
the Anti-Defamation League _ the first cardinal ever to address the
annual convention _ and declared solidarity with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take realistic stock of the fact that nowhere else
in the world are Catholics and Jews as together in significant ways
as they are in the United States,'' Law said. ``That puts
tremendous responsibility on us to try and be models to the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Law gently alluded to some of the controversies in recent months
that have driven a wedge between Jewish leaders and the Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Those include the canonization of Edith Stein, the Jewish
convert who became a nun and was executed at Auschwitz. Some Jews
chastized Pope John Paul II for making Stein a saint because, they
charged, it was inappropriate to direct attention to a Catholic
victim of what was so unquestionably a horror directed at Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders are also angry over the beatification of a Croat
World War II cardinal who they charge collaborated with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The incident causing perhaps the greatest upset among Jews, is
the Vatican's move to beatify Pope Pius XII, the World War II-era
pope whom many Jews believe failed to speak out forcefully enough
against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, many Jewish leaders view these events as an
attempt by the church to gloss over centuries of Roman Catholic
anti-Semitism they believe helped fuel the Nazi's genocidal
campaign against the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Law tried to allay those concerns with the kind of pointed
comment that has earned him kudos among local Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say in as clear a way as I possibly can that Auschwitz
and the Holocaust are singular expressions of a determination to
annihilate the Jewish people,'' Law told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while others also lost their lives at Auschwitz and have a
right to be mourned there is absolutely no way that the unique
nature of the Holocaust as directed at the Jewish people can be
diluted and remain true to historical fact,'' Law added. ``I can
understand the fear that there will be a a desire to coopt the
meaning of Auschwitz and the Holocaust. This cannot happen. I say
all this from the depths of my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Law's appearance before the Anti-Defamation League was a
culmination, in a sense, of 14 years of local efforts to bridge the
divide between Catholics and Jews. Indeed Law, whose very first
homily as a cardinal inside St. Peter's Basilica in Rome in 1985
attacked anti-Semitism as incompatible with Christianity, was
greeted like an old friend of the family.
</P>
<P>
   He received a standing ovation at the beginning and end of his
speech. ``Bernard Law has long been our ally,'' noted Harold
Schwartz, chairman of the ADL's New England office.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to promote Catholic-Jewish understanding,
officials Thursday confirmed that Law will lead Catholics and Jews
next October on a religious pilgrimmage to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Law's warm reception there were clearly points of
tension. After Law spoke, Abraham H. Foxman, the ADL's national
director, raised again the issue of the Catholic Church's response
to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I listen to your sensitivity, the question I've been
dealing with is, what if in the years of Auschwitz there were
voices here and there like Cardinal Law's with the same kind of
sensitivity, courage and conviction?'' Foxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Law did not respond. But in an interview later, the cardinal
said it is ``very difficult'' to debate what church leaders like
Pius XII did not say or do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to make judgments about actions not taken
because we cannot be certain what kind of pressures the church was
under,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   Foxman said the Vatican needs to make public all Holocaust-era
documents so Jews can make an informed assessment of church
leaders. The Vatican has released a select number of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Another point of disagreement that formed the backdrop for Law's
appearance is the controversial issue of government funding for
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Law supports a tuition tax credit for parents of children who
attend Catholic schools. But the ADL, citing concerns over church
and state separation, has long opposed any public aid to religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these disagreements, Law and Jewish leaders vowed to
continue to work together. ``We may not always see eye to eye but
we have a relationship based on trust that allows us to move
forward and find ways to serve the world,'' Law said.

U.S. SIGNS GLOBAL WARMING ACCORD BUT APPROVAL REMAINS DISTANT
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday signed the
international agreement to fight global warming, affirming American
leadership in a prolonged environmental crusade but not raising any
hope that the accord would win ratification in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   By signing, the United States endorses the terms of the
agreement, including steep cuts of heat-trapping gases by
industrialized nations over the next 10 to 15 years, but does not
yet oblige itself to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the agreement in the United States immediately
raised an outcry, but the step was widely applauded in Argentina,
where some 150 nations are meeting to debate details of how the
accord can be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, the chief American delegate to the talks in
Buenos Aires, announced there Thursday morning that the United
States would sign the pact, which was negotiated last year in
Kyoto, Japan. Peter Burleigh, the acting U.S. representatives to
the United Nations, signed it in New York on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, as expected, will not yet submit the
Kyoto Protocol for approval by the Senate, where it faces
substantial opposition from critics who say the costs to industry
of compliance would damage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said all along that the United States would
sign the accord before the deadline next March, but would not
ratify it unless key American provisos are accepted. Given the pace
of the continuing talks, that probably means it will not be
approved before the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who may be more closely identified than
any other politician in the world with the fight against global
warming, emphasized that much more bargaining lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our signing of the protocol underscores our determination to
achieve a truly global solution to this global challenge,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of the United States, the leading
source of the waste industrial gases that scientists say cause
global warming, the agreement would collapse. The United States was
the 60th nation to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyoto is a landmark achievement, but it is a work in progress
and key issues remain outstanding,'' said Eizenstat, who is the
undersecretary of state for economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said the signing was intended to
strengthen the U.S. negotiating hand, but critics in Congress,
echoing the views of their constituents in industries like coal and
automobiles, said that it would reduce American leverage instead.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat called the announcement a high point in negotiations
that otherwise have focused on incremental advances toward putting
the complex agreement into force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not gilding the lily when I say there was near euphoria
among delegates here,'' he said. ``They just felt this was a real
sign of U.S. leadership. I think there was really a doubt that we
were really going to pursue this, with all the opposition in the
Senate and in other quarters. The feeling was that perhaps the
domestic opposition was so stiff that we were going to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   The protocol, which strengthens a global treaty negotiated in
Rio de Janiero in 1992 and ratified during the Bush administration,
would commit the United States to steep cuts in its emissions of
gases like carbon dioxide, which comes from burning fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists say that rising atmospheric concentrations
of these greenhouse gases, warming the earth's surface like an
invisible quilt, are threatening to disrupt the planet's climate
and to cause potentially grave environmental harm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the United States would have to cut its
emissions by about 7 percent from the 1990 level over the next 10
to 15 years. Since 1990, emissions have been steadily increasing,
making that target even more ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions that the United States is demanding are meant to
hold down the costs of compliance, and to increase the chances that
the Senate will eventually approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. condition is establishing a system of international
trading in emissions credits, effectively allowing the United
States to buy its way out of meeting goals by paying other
countries to reduce their emissions further. Another is persuading
developing nations to take a larger role in cutting emissions,
encouraging them with financial assistance from developed nations
who would take emissions credits in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Both ideas face strong resistance from some countries that say
the first steps must be taken by industrial nations like the United
States, which historically has emitted about a quarter of all
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, opponents of the treaty led by major energy
producers and consumers are continuing to marshal opposition in
Congress, arguing that its emissions targets cannot be met without
damaging the economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a leading proponent of the accord, said
in Buenos Aires that signing the protocol ``gives us the
credibility to be at the table'' in the continuing talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we can not only make sure it happens, but that it
happens in the way that we prefer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democrat who opposes the protocol, Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, said that ``the timing of this signing only encourages
countries who refuse to be part of any effort to limit greenhouse
gas emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Argentina pledged to limit its emissions, and on
Thursday Kazakhstan did the same, but populous countries like China
and India, whose emissions are growing quickly, continue to resist
accepting formal limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has chosen a risky path both domestically and
internationally,'' said Connie Holms, the chairwoman of the Global
Climate Coalition, which represents major industry groups opposed
to the treaty. ``Clinton has sent the U.S. careening down an
endless highway which appears on no maps, has no speed limits, no
police patrols, and no exit or entrance ramps.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R.-Neb., who sponsored a Senate resolution
last year that opposed signing the treaty unless certain conditions
were met, said the signing ``blatantly contradicts the will of the
United States Senate'' and dared President Clinton to submit it to
the Senate. A two-thirds majority is required for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this treaty is good enough to sign, it's good enough to be
submitted to the Senate for an open, honest debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups praised the signing, but some complained
that so far the United States is not doing enough to cut its own
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a more vigorous commitment to domestic action, U.S.
demands for more action by developing countries are like a
chain-smoking parent telling his children that smoking is bad for
them,'' said John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental advocacy group. He urged the
administration to take unilateral steps to cut emissions of carbon
dioxide from automobiles, power plants and other sources.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says if U.N. inspectors aren't allowed to do their
work in Iraq, ``they may as well be in Baltimore.'' Oh, right. Like
there's a Saddam Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors have left Baghdad. Maybe they could just
phone Iraq's suspected sites long distance and ask if anything bad
is going on.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 3,200 U.S. veterans of World War I are still
alive. And, we bet, would be willing to stay 80 more years telling
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace can never be a time for rest,'' Mr. Clinton says. Yes,
but it's harder to sleep with bombs exploding hither and yon.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House Judiciary Committee are preparing for Ken
Starr's upcoming appearance. But so far we've seen none of them
wearing a Peter Rodino mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former adversaries are becoming our partners,'' Mr. Clinton
says. He was talking about foreign matters, not Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Two supercomputers _ one named Big Blue, the other Big Mountain
_ now both claim to be the fastest in the world. But for speed in
leaving town, our money is still on Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Georgia are lining up to run for the House seat
Gingrich is vacating. What a guy. He not only made Democrats feel
good, he's providing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of top high school students admit they're
prejudiced, a survey shows. Hold on. Maybe all they said is they're
against polls.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, it's reported, got upset in a New York
restaurant recently and barked at the staff. It's breathtaking to
think about what would not have been news a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices are near an 11-year low. So there's one more great
cheap Christmas gift idea.
</P>
<P>
   The next House speaker, Bob Livingston, is 6-feet-4 and is said
to have an explosive temper. Yes, but is he tall and angry enough
to slam-dunk Dick Gephardt?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Livingston say he's not shy about using power.
Still, he may find in his new job that wise use of authority is a
hard Newt to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston used to be a prosecutor in New Orleans. One thing
we're sure of is that he didn't leave there because there was no
one left to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a manager,'' Livingston says. If he's right, we can think
of several baseball teams who may make him an offer.
</P>
<P>
   After Livingston's mother watched him on TV once as he shouted
on the House floor, she told him he looked like ``a raving
lunatic'' and to knock it off. Maybe she's the one who should be in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich says the GOP needs unity so it can push its ``big
ideas.'' Maybe first it should answer our question: ``Hey, what's
the big idea?''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Cohen says ``time is running out'' for Iraq to
back down on the U.N. inspectors issue. It seems more like it's
walking out.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton has decided to ease the sanctions imposed on India
and Pakistan for their nuclear testing earlier this year. Odd. We
didn't know sanctions, too, had a measurable half-life.
</P>
<P>
   In taped testimony at the Microsoft trial, Bill Gates has denied
trying to intimidate Intel. We'd like someone to intimidate the
computer industry as much as our computer intimidates us.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is trying to figure out what constitutes an impeachable
offense. How about whatever finally makes Hillary leave Bill?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some day each of us will be able to recall exactly
where we were and what we were doing when we learned Chris Cox was
withdrawing as a candidate for U.S. House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary,'' Mr. Clinton says.
Which is about what Miss Manners makes you say about anyone you're
glad to see go.
</P>
<P>
   The next House speaker is expected to be less confrontational
than Newt Gingrich. No surprise. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura _ even
in the ring _ is less confrontational than Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The likely next House speaker, Bob Livingston, says public
opinion should be considered in deciding whether to impeach Bill
Clinton. Careful. Let's not Gallup to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next Congress is the next Congress,'' Gingrich says.
Republicans must be upset he didn't offer such wisdom in the recent
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura says he doesn't plan to run for president in 2000.
Darn. If he won he could go to Iraq and settle things with Saddam
one on one.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is still trying to figure out what to do about Iraq.
Now that he's available, why not threaten to send Newt Gingrich?
</P>
<P>
   Some gun shows, says Mr. Clinton, ``have become illegal arms
bazaars for criminals and gun traffickers.'' No wonder they're so
popular.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn is undergoing three weeks of medical tests. In NASA
terms, this is known as your standard 3.68-million-mile checkup.

wearing a Peter Rodino mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Former adversaries are becoming our partners,'' Mr. Clinton
says. He was talking about foreign matters, not Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Two supercomputers _ one named Big Blue, the other Big Mountain
_ now both claim to be the fastest in the world. But for speed in
leaving town, our money is still on Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Georgia are lining up to run for the House seat
Gingrich is vacating. What a guy. He not only made Democrats feel
good, he's providing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of top high school students admit they're
prejudiced, a survey shows. Hold on. Maybe all they said is they're
against polls.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, it's reported, got upset in a New York
restaurant recently and barked at the staff. It's breathtaking to
think about what would not have been news a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices are near an 11-year low. So there's one more great
cheap Christmas gift idea.
</P>
<P>
   The next House speaker, Bob Livingston, is 6-feet-4 and is said
to have an explosive temper. Yes, but is he tall and angry enough
to slam-dunk Dick Gephardt?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Livingston say he's not shy about using power.
Still, he may find in his new job that wise use of authority is a
hard Newt to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston used to be a prosecutor in New Orleans. One thing
we're sure of is that he didn't leave there because there was no
one left to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a manager,'' Livingston says. If he's right, we can think
of several baseball teams who may make him an offer.
</P>
<P>
   After Livingston's mother watched him on TV once as he shouted
on the House floor, she told him he looked like ``a raving
lunatic'' and to knock it off. Maybe she's the one who should be in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich says the GOP needs unity so it can push its ``big
ideas.'' Maybe first it should answer our question: ``Hey, what's
the big idea?''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Cohen says ``time is running out'' for Iraq to
back down on the U.N. inspectors issue. It seems more like it's
walking out.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton has decided to ease the sanctions imposed on India
and Pakistan for their nuclear testing earlier this year. Odd. We
didn't know sanctions, too, had a measurable half-life.
</P>
<P>
   In taped testimony at the Microsoft trial, Bill Gates has denied
trying to intimidate Intel. We'd like someone to intimidate the
computer industry as much as our computer intimidates us.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is trying to figure out what constitutes an impeachable
offense. How about whatever finally makes Hillary leave Bill?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some day each of us will be able to recall exactly
where we were and what we were doing when we learned Chris Cox was
withdrawing as a candidate for U.S. House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary,'' Mr. Clinton says.
Which is about what Miss Manners makes you say about anyone you're
glad to see go.
</P>
<P>
   The next House speaker is expected to be less confrontational
than Newt Gingrich. No surprise. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura _ even
in the ring _ is less confrontational than Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The likely next House speaker, Bob Livingston, says public
opinion should be considered in deciding whether to impeach Bill
Clinton. Careful. Let's not Gallup to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next Congress is the next Congress,'' Gingrich says.
Republicans must be upset he didn't offer such wisdom in the recent
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura says he doesn't plan to run for president in 2000.
Darn. If he won he could go to Iraq and settle things with Saddam
one on one.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton is still trying to figure out what to do about Iraq.
Now that he's available, why not threaten to send Newt Gingrich?
</P>
<P>
   Some gun shows, says Mr. Clinton, ``have become illegal arms
bazaars for criminals and gun traffickers.'' No wonder they're so
popular.

ISRAEL PROCEEDS WITH EAST JERUSALEM HOUSING, TO PALESTINIAN
CHAGRIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened bidding
Thursday on a big state-run housing development in the
predominantly Arab east side of Jerusalem that has been a
flashpoint in relations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been our policy all along that Jerusalem will not be
divided again, and we will build in any part of Jerusalem that we
deem worthy of building in,'' Netanyahu said defiantly at a news
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding was announced a day after a divided Israeli Cabinet
approved the Israeli-Palestinian agreement on the next Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank, an accord that infuriated many
right-wingers who had been allies of Netanyahu. The announcement
was widely seen as a gesture to the disaffected right and was
immediately criticized by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The action Thursday _ the publication of a legal notice inviting
contract bids _ opens the way for building the first thousand units
of the planned 6,000-home Har Homa subdivision. After the initial
groundbreaking for the stalled Har Homa project in March 1997, the
Palestinian Authority angrily broke off peace talks, beginning an
impasse that continued until the negotiations last month at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Netanyahu's coalition who oppose the land-for-peace
agreement have strongly urged that work on the Har Homa project be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said for the last two years that I will build Har Homa
before the year 2000,'' Netanyahu said. ``What I have said, I have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned subdivision could eventually be home to 25,000 or
more Jewish residents, fundamentally altering the political
demographics of east Jerusalem. More immediately, Har Homa adds yet
another obstacle to the increasingly contentious implementation of
the peace plan. Palestinians consider any such project in east
Jerusalem illegal, a contention Israel adamantly rejects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major, major destructive move,'' said Saeb Erakat,
the chief Palestinian negotiator. ``These are issues to be resolved
with negotiations, not with bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abu Rudaineh, a spokesman for Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, called the housing project ``a clear new
violation of an agreement that has not even started yet.'' He
expressed concern that the project could provoke angry and possibly
violent street protests in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public won't accept it, and that will make it very hard
for us'' in the Palestinian Authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said they had appealed to the State Department
to ``intervene'' and seek a halt to the project. ``Dennis Ross is
coming tomorrow, and this will be at the top of his agenda,'' said
Erakat, referring to the American peace envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and the Palestinian negotiating team are scheduled to
meet with Ross on Friday evening in Nablus in the West Bank. The
Palestinians are also expected to raise the issue of Israeli land
expropriations in the West Bank for new roads to Jewish settlements
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli cabinet decided Thursday to build a dozen more of
these ``bypass'' roads, but agreed to postpone a proposed route
through a Palestinian refugee camp after military briefers warned
that it could trigger violent protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Har Homa dispute illuminated the seeming intractability of
the biggest unresolved conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians: the ``final status'' of Jerusalem itself, claimed by
each side as its rightful national capital and historic religious
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all of it is private Jewish land within the Jewish
capital,'' Netanyahu said Thursday referring to the Har Homa site.
``How this could be called a provocation is beyond me, but I
suppose anything could be called a provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is not a provocation,'' he continued. ``It is our
eternal value, our eternal rock. It is something that I don't care
to deal with in a political context.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians see Har Homa as a symbol of Israeli refusal to even
discuss Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem, which Israel annexed
after capturing it from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If they go ahead with this project, it renders the final
status talks meaningless,'' said Erakat.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who publicly criticized
the groundbreaking for the project a year and a half ago, had a
cool but restrained reaction this time. ``We frown on unilateral
actions,'' she said when asked on Wednesday in New York to comment
on reports that Israel was going ahead with the project.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palestinian negotiators welcomed this language as a sign
that Washington may also consider Har Homa as a violation of the
peace plan signed last month, which bans ``unilateral actions''
affecting the ``status'' of the West Bank, of which east Jerusalem
is, in their view, an integral part.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, however, considers east Jerusalem a permanent part of
its own national territory, in contrast to areas in the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank under Israeli military occupation. Government
planners have been explicit in their intent to reshape the ethnic
map of greater Jerusalem, precluding any future division of the
city between the Arab east and Jewish west.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of sovereignty,'' Netanyahu insisted in a
news conference Thursday. ``This is not an issue of community
needs, but of sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Har Homa summit, known to Arabic speakers as Jamal Abu
Ghneim, was seized from Jordan along with rest of east Jerusalem in
the 1967 war. Israel subsequently annexed east Jerusalem, and
vacant property there was expropriated from Jewish and Arab
residents for security and future settlement purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A rocky promontory rising southeast of Jerusalem's ancient
center and just northwest of Palestinian-governed Bethlehem, Har
Homa is today a rare remaining blank spot in an increasingly dense
urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   At 2,500 feet above sea level _ and 3,900 feet above Dead Sea
level _ the site offers commanding vistas of Jerusalem's Old City
and the ochre expanse of the Judean desert. Good new roads make it
a ten-minute trip to the city's main shopping districts.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective buyers are expected to be motivated more by views
and state-subsidized mortgage rates than by ideology.
</P>
<P>
   When earth movers began leveling the hilltop for eventual
settlement 17 months ago, the United Nations immediately adopted
resolutions condemning the action, the Palestinians stalked angrily
away from the negotiating table and U.S. officials voiced dismay at
the move.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli officials expressed relief that the Har Homa
announcement was overshadowed by preparations for possible American
and British air strikes against Iraq.

KILLINGS OF HOMELESS RENEW DEBATE IN SAN FRANCISCO

 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three weeks ago, when someone started stalking
homeless people here, bending over them as they slept in the alleys
and doorways and slashing their throats, a grim joke began making
the rounds on the streets: the killer had been hired by the city.
</P>
<P>
   After all, didn't the mayor call the city's homeless problem
``intractable'' and vow in his State of the City address last month
to clear the homeless from public places?
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured the slasher was the one way to get us off the
sidewalks,'' said Donald Behr, one of two homeless men leaning
against the wall of a downtown Subway delicatessen early Thursday
morning. He and his friend slapped their knees at the humor of it.
</P>
<P>
   At least they can afford to laugh. Early Tuesday, the police
arrested a man in connection with a knife attack on a homeless man
who had been sleeping in a Chinatown alley, and they say they have
linked the suspect to the three other attacks on homeless people in
the city, including the killing of a longtime homeless woman named
Shirley Dillahunt, whom, it is said, everyone loved.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest of the suspect, a 21-year-old Oakland man named
Joshua Rudiger, who was said to have told the police that he was a
vampire who drank his victims' blood, is unlikely to cool the
debate that the slashings have rekindled in this live-and-let-live
city over what to do about all the people with no place to call
home.
</P>
<P>
   The gallows humor that the slashings have inspired reflects the
magnitude of the homeless problem and how it has emerged as a major
issue for Mayor Willie Brown, particularly as the homeless have
become increasingly visible.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was considered one of the last of the liberal mayors
when he was elected three years ago, has enraged advocates for the
homeless with his policies, starting with a decision last year to
have the police forcibly remove hundreds of homeless people from
Golden Gate Park. The anger was refueled with the city's latest
plan to divert homeless people from four tourist zones into
shelters and to arrest those disobeying the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the mayor was bombarded with three pies by a group
calling itself the Bionic Baking Brigade, which said it wanted to
call attention to the city's lack of solutions to the homeless
problem. Meanwhile, members of the Coalition for the Homeless say
that this city, of all cities, should know that the homeless need
treatment programs, jobs and housing, and that sweeping them off
the streets and giving them jail time is no solution.
</P>
<P>
   One point on which all agree is that there are incredible
numbers of homeless people on the city's streets. They huddle in
doorways near the fanciest hotels of Nob Hill, sleep on the benches
near all the big department stores on Union Square, camp out by the
hundreds in the plaza by the Civic Center and crowd the corners of
Haight-Ashbury. Some panhandle politely, rudely, quietly, loudly.
Some talk to no one, or to everyone, or to themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On any night, there may be 16,000 people on the streets here,
twice as many as 10 years ago, giving San Francisco, the 13th
largest city in the country, the third-largest population of
homeless people, after New York and Los Angeles, according to the
Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom is that the city's weather and its reputation
for tolerance have brought homeless people here from elsewhere. But
the weather is not always great. It rains three months a year,
starting now, and the rain is not soft and sunny, as it is in
Southern California, but mean and cold, the kind that sends the
tourists packing and the commuters straight home from work. Paul
Boden, director of the Coalition for the Homeless and a board
member of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the notion
that people moved to a place to be homeless was a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of one city in the country that doesn't say that
it's a magnet and that homeless people come from somewhere else,''
Boden said. ``Fargo, N.D., was calling itself a magnet. It's kind
of sad, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's homeless, like the homeless everywhere, Boden
said, are usually longtime residents. About a third are mentally
ill, a third are drug addicts (or some mixture of the two) and the
rest have been displaced from their homes through a series of
personal misfortunes _ rising rents, loss of income and the like.
While the numbers of homeless are increasing all over the nation,
largely because of a decrease in federal benefits and public
housing, Boden said, San Francisco's problem is exacerbated by its
soaring housing prices, the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the worst I've ever seen it, and I've been
doing this 16 years,'' Boden said. ``We have 62 detox beds in the
city and 1,200 people on the waiting list. We have 1,800 shelter
beds and 140 families on the waiting list. The city doesn't even
keep waiting lists for singles.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, with $60 million budgeted for homeless-related services,
has introduced job training programs and put into effect an $11
million on-demand drug treatment program. But waiting lists are
long for that, too. Meanwhile, last Friday, the city began a police
crackdown on those caught drinking, urinating, defecating or
sleeping on the sidewalks, a mandate that would include just about
all the homeless. Those arrested for public drunkenness three times
within 60 days will face 30 days in jail unless they enroll in a
substance abuse program. But there is no guarantee that they will
get a bed in such a program if they want one, in which case they
will simply be cited and released.
</P>
<P>
   The city's homelessness coordinator, Terry Hill, said he was
working on a range of solutions, both short- and long-term, for
people in dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Behr, who has lived on and off the streets in Oakland and San
Francisco for five years, said he was one of that group. He said he
became homeless when his wife kicked him out of their apartment in
Oakland after he developed a cocaine habit and was dismissed from
his job. ``Half the people you step over have the same problem,''
he said. ``And there are more of us today than there used to be _
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, who would not give his name, said he was a drug
addict with ``mental problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need help,'' he said. ``But when I'm feeling good and go to
get help, they tell me I don't need it. Then, when I go crazy, I'm
too crazy to get help.'' At that, he and Behr laughed and laughed.

SUPPORT GROWS FOR US BOMBING OF IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton won key acceptance for an attack
on Iraq Thursday as eight Arab states, as well as Russia and
France, signaled that they would not oppose US bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministers of the Arab countries said Iraq would be
``held responsible for any consequences'' of its decision to expel
UN weapons inspectors. Their diplomatic language made clear that
they will not try to block a strike, as they did during the US-Iraq
showdown in February.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein's obstruction of the UN ``will expose the
innocent Iraqi people to more miseries and tragedies,'' said the
statement, signed by Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain steps,''
Kuwait's Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah said after the foreign
ministers met in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France, which also opposed US plans for an attack
last winter, have not criticized the Clinton administration this
time.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Security Council will meet to discuss the standoff Friday
afternoon, but US officials said they do not need any more
resolutions from the council because Hussein blatantly has broken
promises to the international community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for further warnings to Iraq,'' the State
Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said Thursday. ``They
understand our seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they see little chance that UN Secretary
General Koffi Annan will broker an agreement with Hussein this time
because the Iraqi leader has lost the confidence of Annan and most
UN members.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insists that Hussein must comply with
all United Nations resolutions about getting rid of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons because the days of negotiations are
over. ``We're not playing games any longer with Saddam Hussein,''
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a speech to Navy officers.
``We're saying comply.''
</P>
<P>
   All evidence points to a major assault on Republican Guard
installations, suspected weapons factories and even Hussein's
political offices. In continued preparations for an attack, the
Pentagon sent 3,000 more Army troops and 129 aircraft to the Gulf,
including 12 B-52 bombers and another 12 F-117 stealth fighters to
the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia from bases in Louisiana,
North Dakota and New Mexico, according to the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five more UN employees left Iraq Thursday, bringing the
number of UN relief workers and inspectors evacuated to 239 in 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of any attack remains unclear. The White House said
Clinton still plans to depart Saturday as scheduled for an
Asia-Pacific economic summit in Malaysia, the first stop on a
10-day trip. And it appears doubtful he would launch a U.S.
military strike while participating in economic talks overseas.
</P>
<P>
   While support abroad grew for a possible attack, Clinton faced
doubts at home about what to do after the missiles and bombs fall.
</P>
<P>
   Leading members of Congress and military analysts said that a
long-range plan is needed because Hussein's intransigence this week
shows he is ready to sacrifice the lives of Iraqis while he waits
for an end to UN economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest questions about what will follow a bombing
campaign have come from supporters of the attack. Richard Lugar, a
moderate Republican from Indiana who serves on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Thursday repeated a call for the US to bomb
Baghdad. But in a press conference he added, ``I'm suggesting that
even if (we) do, (we) will not get the job done. Therefore, the
planning really has to be for stages two, three or four or whatever
follows.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar said the Pentagon would have to do more than an aerial
bombing campaign, and that would probably require US ground troops.
If Hussein does not give up power, ``I suspect then he will have to
be killed,'' Lugar said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, aides said that most members of Congress favor
an attack but worry that Hussein and his inner circle will survive
and rebuild their weapons, as they have before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the administration has a Plan B,'' said one
congressional aide who closely follows military matters. ``I'm not
sure they know what Plan A is except that they'll use some kind of
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Other staffers said that the administration has made an attack
all but inevitable because of repeated statements that Hussein will
not be allowed to violate UN restrictions on developing chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest words of caution about using force came from
Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who demanded that
Clinton convene Congress for a special session to make his case for
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a top administration official Thursday who
conceded that there was no plan as to what was going to happen
after the initial attacks, and I think it is very important to know
what is going to happen,'' Specter said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have thought well beyond hour one, day one and week one,''
countered Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott during a speech
at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``There are
lots of ways we can make sure he loses on day one and thereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said Hussein still can stop an attack by honoring the
commitments he made to the UN. ``This crisis can end peacefully,''
he said.

COMMENTARY: THE ROAD TO BALTIMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites or
monitor compliance at known production facilities, they may as well
be in Baltimore, not Baghdad.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton said so on Wednesday, as he warned of striking Iraq
unless Saddam Hussein permitted inspectors to resume the hunt for
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and missiles. He was
talking about the crisis begun Aug. 5 by Saddam's decision to shut
down U.N. inspection _ for the third time in one year alone.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This crisis does not exist by itself but is part of an Iraqi
strategy of continuous crises that send the inspectors to Baltimore
when they come too close to his weapon stockpiles and documents.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strategy began not that day in August or this year, but
eight years ago, giving him more power with each crisis. America
and the U.N. are essential tools to his rolling-crisis strategy to
break the inspection system.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That would leave him free to develop weapons of mass destruction
with which he will become the major power in the Mideast, the
father of a new, ultimate world terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year he has seen the countries and world organization
supposed to contain him accept each crisis separately. He counts on
that. He knows they will eventually settle it by making inspection
weaker. That gives him time to manufacture the next crisis. Examine
the chronology.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement ending the gulf war in February 1991, Iraqis
were to supply all information about their weaponry, within 15
days.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. In August 1995, still hunting, struggling with
Iraqi thugs, inspectors followed a defector's direction to a cache
of one million documents detailing Iraq's power, plans and
potential for chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to
carry them. For five years Saddam had insisted they did not exist.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of filling out an arrest warrant for Saddam, in 1996
U.N. officials worked out with Iraq a list of sites where
inspection access would be restricted to protect Iraq's
sovereignty. Washington, ever the good sport, accepted.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal foreign diplomats were taken on managed
tours of Saddam's many palaces and other restricted sites, which
had been cleansed of documents.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997 Richard Butler of Australia became head of the
inspectorate. By September he told Iraq that the whole cockamamie
scheme for soothing Saddam's dignity was not working. U.N.
inspectors approaching the front door would see Saddam's boys
stroll out the back door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, a month later, Baghdad ordered U.S. and British members of
the inspection teams to get out. Butler, not disposed by duty or
nature to let Saddam run the inspection commission, pulled out
inspectors of all nationalities.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus Saddam created the crisis of 1997-1998. U.N. members,
carrying out their policy with which they met earlier inspection
crises, did nothing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in February 1998 enter Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to
negotiate. With approval of the Security Council, including the
once-big five, he goes to Baghdad. He tells Saddam where to get off
_ into a garden abloom with U.N. concessions, new bureaucratic
machinery, moral equivalency with Iraq's opponents.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Annan returns to cheering U.N. staff members and his photographs
bejeweling the walls, inspiring him to proclaim that he could do
business with the man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the inspectors had been gaining ground despite Saddam's best
harassments. They found stockpiles and plans of chemical war
weaponry and missiles. They were closing in on biological weaponry,
so on Aug. 5, Saddam decides to send inspection to Baltimore again.
For three months, no action against him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 10: U.S. sends Butler ``strong recommendation'' to evacuate
inspection teams. In a four-hour operation he gets them out to
Bahrain; no to-do, just professionalism and cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 11: Russia, furious, calls for Security Council meeting;
France suggests concessions, joins China and Russia saying bring
back Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The chronology is not just history, but likely will be the
future too. Saddam will never give up his weapons of mass
destruction. So either he is killed in Iraq, by Americans, Iraqis
or a combination, or millions face death in Baltimores, somewhere,
someday not far away.

BAY STATE HOSPITALS RANK HIGH IN NATIONAL POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts hospitals are outperforming their
counterparts nationwide in providing emotional support for new
mothers, ensuring physical comfort after surgery, and on every one
of 19 other measures of patient experience, according to a
statewide survey of nearly 13,000 patients released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the 58 participating Bay State hospitals may be
wondering whether they were too forthcoming in making public their
patients' preferences, the first time that has been done with a
poll like this anywhere in America. The survey reveals that
Boston's highly-touted teaching hospitals scored at or below the
state average on most measures, while Cambridge Hospital,
Somerville Hospital and Springfield's Baystate Medical Center did
even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The report, designed in part to help consumers pick a hospital,
yielded a series of ``winners'' as well, including such well-kept
secrets as Milton and Winchester hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they scored high or low, however, hospital executives
agree that such surveys already have helped them tailor their
services to what patients want, in the process improving the
quality as well as the popularity of their care. And nearly all
seem determined to continue such evaluations, a promise made easier
by a pledge they took not to advertise how their scores compare to
competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is high risk,'' acknowledged Jeffrey Otten, president of
Brigham and Women's, a hospital that is known for its leading-edge
care but which received relatively downbeat assessments from its
patients. ``The scores themselves, and how the hospitals stack up,
are less relevant to me than our commitment to make them public and
to describe our efforts to continuously improve our scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom Clark, president and CEO of Saints Memorial Medical Center
in Lowell, is also moving to upgrade his hospital's performance
even though it already scores among the highest in the state.
``This is probably the best consumer-driven study ever,'' he said.
``This thing started because hospitals really are not enjoying the
reputations they used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The questionaire unveiled Thursday actually was the second done
the last two years. The first, which was not made public, gave
hospitals a first look at what hundreds of randomly selected
patients thought about everything from whether their preferences
were respected to whether they were informed about what was
happening to them. Hospitals had a year to address concerns, with
tutoring from higher-scoring hospitals, before a second
questionaire was mailed to 600 adult patients at each hospital who
had spent at least one night there early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls were run by the Picker Institute, a Boston-based
non-profit that analyzes patient experiences, and were commissioned
by the Massachusetts Health Quality Partnership, a coalition of
insurers, business and professional groups. Hospitals and coalition
partners shared the $750,000 in costs. All but 18 of Massachusetts'
76 acute care hospitals participated, representing 80 percent of
general patients and 90 percent of maternities.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the survey was straightforward: To tell hospitals
what patients think they are doing right, and wrong, so they can do
better. And to guide future patients in choosing a hospital by
telling them what past patients thought.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that Bay State hospitals almost always meet
patients' needs for comfort, involvement in decision-making, and
getting family and friends involved. They do less well giving
patients information they want about treatments and tests, and even
worse helping them adjust to being back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as health care providers do not necessarily understand what
is important to patients, what kind of information they really want
as they are leaving the hospital,'' explained Susan Edgman-Levitan,
president of the Picker Institute.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the best-performing hospitals were small, it was
tougher to discern urban-rural trends. What was clear was that
Massachusetts hospitals fared better on each of 21 measures than
the 348 hospitals nationwide that Picker has surveyed recently _ a
finding that perplexed most health care analysts, especially since
it comes at a time when patients seem distressed by cutbacks,
mergers, and other transformations under way at hospitals across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Several major Boston hospitals and others statewide elected not
to join the survey. Some, like the Dana-Farber Cancer Center, are
too specialized, while Children's was not eligible since the survey
only included adults. Boston Medical Center said it opted out
because it was immersed in the merger of Boston City and Boston
University hospitals, while smaller facilities said the survey was
too expensive or they had too few patients.
</P>
<P>
   Similar surveys have been done in other states, including New
Hampshire and Colorado, but their results were kept confidential.
``The fact that hospitals here have been willing to share them,''
Edgman-Levitan said, ``is a real statement about their commitment
to quality.''

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Armey seemed to have a premonition of the
House leadership meltdown two years ago when, eyeing the majority
Republicans slipping a bit from their halcyon days of 1994, he
advised: ``Let's just dare to be not sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   This advice has become the Republican mantra with the removal of
Newt Gingrich as House speaker, and no one is more aware of this
than Armey. For he now must fight being purged as majority leader,
the second to the speaker in power.
</P>
<P>
   A politician who once openly yearned to succeed Gingrich, Armey
is beset from two sides in the leadership race: Rep. Jennifer Dunn
of Washington state is coming at him from the Republicans' uneasy
center, while Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma is challenging as an
unabashed purist even further right than Armey, the born-again
Christian and former economics professor who aims to scrap the
graduated income tax.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are due to meet Wednesday and settle the
competition among the three:
</P>
<P>
   ARMEY: Beyond his reputation as a doctrinaire conservative, the
seven-term Texan has a taste for flamboyance, from his cowboy boots
customized with the House seal to his raspy-edged denunciations
personalized for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Of Hillary Rodham Clinton, he has said, ``All her friends are
Marxists.'' When President Clinton angrily confronted him over this
at the White House, Armey responded, ``Perhaps it's my Western
upbringing, but I don't listen very well when someone's pointing a
finger at me.''
</P>
<P>
   After he referred to Rep. Barney Frank, a leading Democrat from
Massachusetts who is gay, as ``Barney Fag,'' Armey had to
apologize, but few critics believed his plea that it was an
innocent mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives appreciate Armey's Agnewish combativeness, as when
he criticized the International Monetary Fund's efforts to prop up
tottering nations and declared, ``I've been to Europe once; I don't
have to go again.'' But conservatives have been wary of Armey, too,
ever since their failed coup against Gingrich in 1997 when they
accused Armey of double-dealing in listening encouragingly to the
insurgents, then finally alerting Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my private moments I probably walk around the office
pretending I'm Gary Cooper,'' the 6-foot-2, 58-year-old country
music buff declared half-apologetically last year as he tried an
image makeover. ``In this position, I need to have a demeanor and
presentation of ideas that's attractive across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His policy ideas often whet the White House's political
appetite, particularly Armey's call to cut aid to education as a
way to make it possible to end the federal gasoline tax. As
majority leader, his line-in-the-sand effort to block any vote to
raise the minimum wage left Republican moderates apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we say in Texas,'' said White House political strategist
Paul Begala, ``if goofy ideas ever go to $40 a barrel, I want the
drilling rights to Dick Armey's head.''
</P>
<P>
   But Armey's toughness among the troops has been well
demonstrated across the past four years and is rated a considerable
strength in the leadership scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, who unseated Gingrich and
is expected to replace him as speaker, had run-ins with Armey over
fiscal matters in the past. But Livingston promised neutrality in
the majority leader fight after Armey made a pilgrimage to pledge
fealty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a great many successes in this next
Congress,'' Armey vowed on election night, insisting then that
there was no reason for Republicans to panic.
</P>
<P>
   LARGENT: As a 44-year-old standout from the Contract With
America class of '94, Largent brought to Congress his fervor as
both an evangelical Christian and a professional football Hall of
Famer. Some colleagues privately wince at some of his pep-rally
political advice (``Perfect Preparation Prevents Poor
Performance!'').
</P>
<P>
   But his conservative peers look to him for the ethical edge in
politics. ``You know, people say _ and I believe it's totally false
_ that you can't legislate morality,'' he has said. ``The truth is
every piece of legislation legislates morality, whether it's a
library fine or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, is an ardent advocate of ending the graduated income
tax and replacing it with a single, flat rate. Speaking of the
unfairness of Social Security to his generation, he has said he
wants to overhaul it and eventually end it.
</P>
<P>
   On hot-button social issues, Largent opposes abortion and
insists there can be no middle ground for lawmakers. In sponsoring
the Defense of Marriage Act, he draws a distinction between
condemning the ``sin'' of homosexuality while expressing Christian
charity toward the ``sinner.'' As a child of a broken family, he
says his foremost goal in politics is to rebuild the family. Still
gridiron trim, the 5-foot-11 lawmaker holds weekly ``accountability
sessions'' with like-minded conservatives for political
soul-searching and prayer against ``all the temptations'' of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For all his spirituality and caucus lectures on team solidarity,
Largent showed a keenness for the power play known in football as
the crack-back block when he moved quickly on national television
to cut down Armey as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he called on Gingrich to step aside while the
speaker's ethics case was before the House. When Gingrich finally
exited last week, he bitterly cautioned his successor about ever
hoping to satisfy the ``perfectionist caucus'' that is Largent's
power base. ``Brief But Brilliant'' is the political epitaph
Largent once suggested for himself, and one way or another his
current sprint for the leadership seems planned with that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MS. DUNN: When it comes to sports metaphors, Ms. Dunn once
estimated that the House seemed closer to hockey than football,
considering the free-form brawling and verbal stick checking that
goes on. But she warned the men of her party that they had better
drop all allusions to sports and war in their political talk if
they ever hope to end the gender gap in which women voters give an
edge to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing speech modules that are women friendly,''
she said earlier this year at a Republican women's conference. ``We
need to stress what I call the soft edge of the conservative
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who made a show of relying on Ms. Dunn as visible
front-office proof of his gender sensitivity, now finds himself
challenged by this resilient four-term lawmaker respected more as a
vote-savvy political technician than a policy purist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm someone who has broken a lot of glass ceilings,'' she said
of her current campaign to move up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first president _ first woman president of our
student body _ in the sixth grade, and was the first woman
Republican state party chairman,'' she added, having served 12
years as the party leader in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With two money-dispensing political action committees to help
bind her to her fellow Republicans, Ms. Dunn regularly attends
House strategy sessions of both conservatives and moderates.
Conservatives complain that she receives a favorable rating of 80
percent, not 100 percent, from the anti-abortion lobby. She hopes
this imperfection leaves her well placed for the new, possibly more
compromising, Livingston team. Some moderates privately rate her as
an earnest politician painstakingly devoted to party message, but
hardly a policy innovator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we got was that there was no message,'' Ms. Dunn
complained of shortcomings that she said voters found in the last
agenda of the Gingrich era.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old lawmaker built her initial reputation as a hawk
on the deficit and crime, co-sponsoring a law allowing localities
to protect children by openly tracking ``sexual predators.'' But
her basic message now to reeling House Republicans is that if they
are wise, they will replace the cowboy-styled Armey not with
Largent, a partisan rooted in football-speak, but with her, a
sensitized mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are seen as being partisan, it's going to be hurtful to
us,'' she warned Republicans before their election drubbing. ``It's
going to push women away.''

HUMAN-COW EMBRYOS SAID TO HOLD PROMISE FOR REPLACEMENT ORGANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying they wanted to test the waters of public acceptance,
scientists report they have created embryos that are mostly human,
but with a smidgen of cattle genes, in a technique they believe
could lead to human replacement organs for many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The work was carried out two years ago and left incomplete, the
scientists at a Worcester biotech company said Thursday,
acknowledging that the hybrid animal-human construction could make
people nervous and raise ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take a time-out,'' said Michael West, chief
executive officer of Advanced Cell Technology Inc., ``and get input
from ethicists and public policy-makers'' before committing more
time and money to the project.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments were privately funded, and therefore aren't
bound by government regulations on embryo research. However, ACT
scientists said they don't want to pursue an effort if it is
strenuously opposed by the public.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at ACT, a spinoff company from the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, said they used a technique somewhat like
the one that created the sheep clone Dolly in 1996. But they
emphasized they have no intention of creating whole individuals.
The embryos would be allowed to develop for only a few days, at
which time they would be stripped of their ``embryonic stem cells''
that would be grown in laboratory dishes.
</P>
<P>
   These stem cells, the primordial cells in every human embryo
from which all of the hundreds of different types of cells are
descended, would kept in their undifferentiated state for as long
as needed. Then, presumably, they could be directed to develop into
one or more of a long list of tissues and organs to treat human
illnesses, among them diabetes, heart failure and Alzheimer's
disease. However, the means to order stem cells down particular
developmental paths are in their infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Each patient's own cells _ scraped from a cheek or a piece of
skin _ would be used to make the human-cow embryo. The resulting
donor tissues could then be transplanted back into the patient
without the body's immune system rejecting them, because they would
be genetically identical.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers fused a human skin cell with a cow egg stripped
of its nucleus because that avoided using a scarce human egg to
nurture the genetic program of the new embryo, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to a report of the work in Thursday's New York
Times was swift, and mixed. Instead of prompting a calm ethical
discussion, the article's initial effect was to prompt skepticism
about what was accomplished and criticism over the way it was made
public. Most scientific advances are first published in journals
after being reviewed by other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this work as not being at a stage where one should
be talking about it,'' said Dr. John Gearhart, a researcher at the
Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions who this week published a paper
about another method for obtaining human stem cells and growing
them in culture.
</P>
<P>
   He said the scientists had not done even the most elementary
tests to confirm that the cells were stem cells _ or even human.
Gearhart added that instead of describing the work in a newspaper,
the scientists should have presented it to professional
organizations first. ``To go to the public, who doesn't have a clue
as to what this means _ it sends the wrong, wrong message,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   James Robl, a UMass-Amherst scientist who was a founder of ACT
and now serves as a consultant to the company, said the work was
done at UMass _ though funded by ACT _ by himself and Jose Cibelli,
a colleague. ``I don't disagree that to truly evaluate this work,
it has to be taken further,'' said Robl. ``We're not portraying
this as a valid and complete scientific experiment, We are seeking
approval to see if we should continue down this line.''
</P>
<P>
   Robl said that the cow egg contributes only a tiny amount of
genetic material and protein to the embryo that is created when the
transplanted human nucleus begins to divide. The only genetic
material that remains in the cow egg after its own nucleus is
removed is DNA in the mitochondria, tiny structures outside the
nucleus that provide power for biological functions.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the hybrid embryo work is ethical, George Annas, a
bioethicist at Boston University, said ``the idea that the
mitochondria are irrevelant is nuts. We can put human genes in
animals, that's one thing,'' he said. ``But putting animal genes in
humans, that's quite a different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the overall aim of using cloning techniques to
create transplantable organs is ethically justifiable.

BRITISH TABLOID BACKS OFF ANTI-GAY STANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On Monday, The Sun, Britain's most popular daily
newspaper, printed a front-page editorial warning that Britain was
being run by a cabal of gay men and urging gay members of
Parliament to come out of the closet as quickly as possible. On
Tuesday, it printed a photograph of Agriculture Minister Nick
Brown, who had been publicly identified as gay over the weekend,
wearing an unflattering regulation blue hair net on a tour of a
dairy farm.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, in the midst of a countrywide debate over
homosexuality, public office and the right to privacy, The Sun made
perhaps its boldest move of all: It changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   It said that it had a new policy: As of now, it would no longer
reveal the identity of any gay man or woman, except in cases of
``overwhelming public interest.'' What's more, it said, it had made
the decision, which flies in the face of its relentlessly anti-gay
reporting and editorial writing over the years, because of a
profound sea change in public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our readers are tolerant of private behavior and find
unwarranted intrusion offensive,'' the paper said, going on to make
an unusual (in its pages) plea for even more tolerance. ``We hope
our declaration will encourage gays to feel more at ease,'' it
said. ``In a perfect world, their sexuality would then cease to be
an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial came after a series of strange events. First, the
Cabinet secretary for Wales, Ron Davies, resigned in disgrace after
being beaten up and robbed at a park known for being a gay hangout.
Then, a gay columnist for The Times of London declared that Trade
Secretary Peter Mandelson was gay _ something Mandelson had never
publicly discussed. And then Brown, the agriculture minister,
learning that an ex-lover had given a salacious interview to a
Sunday newspaper, reluctantly told the world that he was gay, too.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, The Sun led the rowdy press in gleefully
reporting each new embarrassment. So in a country long accustomed
to the newspaper's role as the most homophobic of the generally
homophobic right-wing papers, the editorial was nothing short of
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   And, said supporters of gay issues, it was a long-overdue sign
that even the most stubbornly anti-gay segments of the British news
media were beginning to change with the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most extraordinary example I can remember of the
press suddenly realizing that they've been left behind by their
readers,'' said Benjamin Bradshaw, a Labor member of Parliament,
who is openly gay. ``The Sun has historically been the homophobic
tabloid, the one that hated gays, and now they've completely
flip-flopped. The tabloids are usually so good at judging their own
readership, but they've completely lost it on this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another unexpected move, Sun editor David Yelland announced
on Wednesday that he was dismissing Matthew Parris, the columnist
who caused the furor last week when he said that Mandelson was gay.
Mandelson has never publicly discussed the issue, and Parris'
remark was seen as a gaffe of such huge proportions that the BBC
banned all mentions of Mandelson's sexual orientation on its
television and radio stations. (Parris also writes for The Times of
London, which, like The Sun, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, but he has
not been dismissed from that job.)
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday what had prompted The Sun's U-turn.
Perhaps, as the paper implied, it had been deluged by a surge of
complaints from readers incensed at what they regarded as offensive
and outdated coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Reed, a spokeswoman for News International, The Sun's
parent company, said she could not explain why The Sun decided to
do what it did.

YOU REALLY CAN'T GET A CAB WHEN ROME TRIES REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Ask cabdrivers in Rome if they like their jobs, and the
uniform reply is an operatic screed about the petty bureaucratic
rules, clogged traffic, high cost of gasoline and dearth of
clients.
</P>
<P>
   But when the mayor of Rome proposed allowing drivers to set
their own prices and hours, the answer was a series of strikes that
culminated in a four-day citywide taxi blackout. Thursday hundreds
of striking cabdrivers parked in Piazza Venezia in the heart of the
city and next to the mayor's office, blocking all traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dictatorship, dictatorship, dictatorship,'' Carlo
Bologna, head of the strike committee, said.
</P>
<P>
   Bologna, who has taken to using the nom de guerre Spartacus,
complained that the effort to liberalize tariffs and shifts would
never work and would impoverish drivers. He wore a sling on his
right hand, injured during a speech Wednesday when he pounded a
desk that turned out to be marble, not wood.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi revolt is not new in Italy, which is also plagued by
wildcat and union-sanctioned strikes throughout the transportation
industry, from air controllers in Milan to telegraph operators at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the taxi strike highlights how even independent service
operators cling to a statist status quo. Italy, still burdened by
crippling bureaucracy and inflexibility in the work force, is
slowly seeking to liberalize its economy. But like the shop owners
who went on strike last year to protest a law setting their store
hours and raising the number of licenses, cabdrivers fear change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy competition can only help consumers and drivers,''
said Walter Tocci, the deputy mayor of Rome, who is also the city's
Traffic Commissioner. ``I'm an ex-Communist, and even I cannot
believe that the rules of Adam Smith apply to every economic sector
except taxis.'' He noted that the city had acted only after Italy's
antitrust commission determined that Roman cabdrivers operated as a
kind of cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Italian taxis are costly even by the standards of other European
capitals and New York. The drop rate on the meter starts at $2.80
in Rome, compared with $2 in New York and $2.40 in Paris. Roman
taxis, which do not cruise, can almost never be hailed. Customers
line up at taxi stands or summon a cab by telephone through a
dispatcher. The meter starts running when the driver accepts the
call, not when they pick up the fare.
</P>
<P>
   Bologna complained that 8 out of 10 of his clients were
tourists, because, he said, ``Romans think taxis are too
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the city government was to blame for not
taming Rome's notoriously clogged traffic. Roman taxi rates soar in
stalled traffic, according to city officials, when the charge rises
to 50 cents a minute, compared with 20 cents in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Francesco Rutelli proposed that cabs continue to use a
meter to set maximum limits, but that drivers be allowed to decide
whether they want to waive or lower a drop charge, as well as other
extras like a $3 night charge (it is 50 cents in New York), or
baggage fees.
</P>
<P>
   Roman cabdrivers are limited to seven-and-half-hour shifts, but
the mayor infuriated cabbies by saying they should set their own
schedules, driving as little or as much as they like, with a
six-hour minimum. He also suggested that family members be allowed
to put in extra hours driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants us to get our wives and children to drive the cab,
but my 23-year-old son is about to graduate with a degree in
biology,'' said Giancarlo De Murtas, 57, a 33-year veteran of the
trade whose father was a cabdriver. ``I made sacrifices so he
wouldn't have to do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the threat of liberalization, however, cabdrivers known
for grousing about their beastly conditions are now talking
wistfully about a paradise lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest job in the world,'' Bologna said. ``You have
freedom, you learn a lot, and you get to flirt with lots of pretty
foreign tourists.''

OUTSIDER QUITS AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT NO. 6 ACCOUNTING FIRM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (jw) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the nation's five largest accounting firms have been
sprinting away from their accounting roots to become aggressive
sellers of consulting services, most of the smaller firms have been
slow to change.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the partners at Grant Thornton, the nation's
sixth-largest accounting firm, made a bold move for a firm
considered to be among the more conservative ones.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the partners looked outside the firm, which
is based in Chicago, for a chief executive. In fact, the man they
hired, Adrian J.R. Smith, was not even an accountant. Instead,
Smith was an expert in sales and marketing _ skills that
accountants once thought to be little more than fluff.
</P>
<P>
   But just three months after Smith officially assumed his
executive role, he and the partners have agreed to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had failed to gain all the partners' confidence in making
changes,'' said Norman Hedgecock, a partner who will now share the
executive responsibilities with Richard Stewart, another partner,
until a new chief executive is named.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 53, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Grant Thornton, Smith was the managing partner of
global marketing and communications at Arthur Andersen, one of the
Big Five firms. Before that, he was a brand manager at Procter &AMP;
Gamble. Smith, who is from Liverpool, England, is also a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of changes that Smith had proposed was one to
let Grant Thornton accountants wear casual clothes every day if
they felt it was appropriate for their dealings with clients. One
insider said Thursday that many of the firm's younger professionals
had been wondering this week, after Smith announced his resignation
on Monday, whether they would have to pull their dark gray suits
out of their closets. Hedgecock said, however, that the casual
dress policy would continue.

SICARI GIVEN LIFE SENTENCE IN 10-YEAR-OLD'S KIDNAP DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The jury deliberated about 22 hours over four
days, even though many observers thought the evidence of the
defendant's guilt in a heinous, highly-publicized crime was obvious
and overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   But the Middlesex Superior Court jury ultimately agreed with the
prosecution: Salvatore Sicari is guilty of first-degree murder and
kidnapping for his role in the death of Jeffrey Curley, a
10-year-old boy who was lured from his neighborhood, then killed
when he refused to have sex with one of his abductors.
</P>
<P>
   After a tearful statement from Jeffrey's mother and an angry
call for justice from the boy's father, Judge Judith A. Cowin
imposed the mandatory sentence for first-degree murder: life in
prison without the possibility of parole. She also ordered him to
serve a 19- to 20-year sentence for the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Sicari, 22, who lived just blocks from the victim's home, had
blamed Charles Jaynes, his close friend, for the murder. In a
statement to police, he insisted he was merely driving the Cadillac
when Jaynes, wrestling with the boy in the back seat, stuffed a
gasoline-soaked rag into Jeffrey's mouth, suffocating him.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution argued that both men acted together,
therefore, both were responsible under the ``joint venture'' theory
_ a legal principle which allows a defendant to be convicted of a
crime even if an accomplice committed the act.
</P>
<P>
   Jaynes, 23, of Brockton, will be tried Nov 30.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's verdict was greeted by applause and shouts of `Yes!
yes!' by about two dozen relatives, neighbors and supporters of the
Curley family, who hugged one another.
</P>
<P>
   In their victim-impact statements before Sicari was sentenced,
the boy's mother described a void in her family which can never be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Curley tearfully described her son as ``sometimes
mischievous, but always delightful and full of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been robbed of watching Jeff grow, watching him pay
ball, graduate from school or fall in love and marry,'' she said.
``I have not been able to go in Jeff's room since this happened.
Sleep doesn't come. And if it does come, nightmares wake me. I pull
myself up every day.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Robert Curley _ who led a grass-roots campaign to reinstate
the death penalty _ glared at Sicari from the witness stand. His
voice edged with anger, Curley said the case provided ``just a
little glimpse of the dark side of society'' that few want to
acknowledge exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we found out to late about the darker side at a
tremendous price _ Jeff's life. Now we have an obligation to make a
statement to people ... that we as a commuinity won't tolerate
crimes like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror Edward Wack said the case took so long for them to decide
because it featured more than 200 pieces of evidence and up to 60
witnesses. Also, he said, the judge's hour-long instructions were
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts of the case were complicated. The law is
complicated,'' he said. ``We took our time to make sure that the
decision we made was correct. And the jury decided he was guilty of
kidnapping and murder in the first degree.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At a press conference &UR;  &LR; with prosecutor David R. Yannetti,
Middlesex District Attorney Thomas F. Reilly said he and his staff
had pledged not to rest until Jeffrey's killers were brought to
justice. ``With today's verdict, we are halfway there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Arthur Kelly left the courthouse immediately
after the verdict. He did not return a phone message.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty advocates have vowed to use the verdict and
Jaynes' upcoming trial as a rallying point to bring back capital
punishment in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who sided with those advocates last
year, said the conviction of Sicari is a ``powerful reason'' for
the legislature to get a death penalty bill to his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said for a long time that the two individuals involved
in the Jeff Curley are walking advertisements for the death
penalty,'' Cellucci said. ``I am glad justice was done today and I
hope this particularly individual is behind bars for the rest of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowleging it ``is not a panacea,'' Cellucci said the
return of the death penalty would allow society to ``express its
outrage about some of this horrific violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the prosecution's evidence and testimony in Sicari's
trial indicated Jaynes was the actual killer. But Yanetti's built
his case against Sicari on the defendant's own confession.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors will not be able to use Sicari's confession
as they did at this trial, they have a large amount of other
evidence, including videotapes of Jaynes buying items used to
dispose of the body. At one point, the judge suggested Yannetti was
going ``beyond overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the evidence, Jaynes had become attracted to
Jeffrey. In his diary, Jaynes said he wanted the boy with
``crystal-blue eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sicari and Jaynes enticed Jeffrey from his East Cambridge
neighborhood with the promise of a new bicycle when he vanished
Oct. 1, 1997. When the boy climbed inside Jaynes' Cadillac, the
three drove to Newton and stopped in a store parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   There, police said, Jaynes dragged him into the back seat and
tried to sexually assault him. The 77-pound boy fought for his life
against Jaynes, who weighs nearly 300 pounds, for more than 20
minutes, but Jaynes sat on him and brought out a cloth soaked with
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't fight it kid,'' Sicari quoted Jaynes as saying as he
held the cloth over the boy's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   After the boy was dead, Jaynes purchased a blue tarpaulin and
four rolls of duct tape from a hardware store, wrapped the body and
put it in the trunk, according to testimony. He and Sicari then
drove an auto dealership where Jaynes washed and detailed cars.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, the two men bought a 50-gallon plastic
container at a Bradlee's store in Watertown, then purchased bags of
cement and lime at the Home Depot in Somerville. They headed to
Jaynes's apartment in Manchester, N.H. where Sicari said Jaynes
molested the boy's body.
</P>
<P>
   They then put it in the Rubbermaid container, filled it with
concrete and dumped it in a river in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   When police searched Sicari's apartment, they found what Sicari
described as ``trophies'' Jaynes allegedly collected of the crime _
including the boy's maroon Boston College football jersey and a
brass button from his dungarees.
</P>
<P>
   Sicari's former girlfriend, Charlene Letourneau, testified that
Sicari called her the night of the murder and admitted he'd killed
someone. When she criticized his lack of remorse, she said, he told
her he couldn't care less.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, witnesses testified, Sicari was back in
Cambridge, paying a condolence call on Jeffrey's mother and handing
out fliers in a neighborhood search for the missing boy.

AMES TO ENLARGE BY PURCHASING HILLS STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., looking to bolster its standing
against big national rivals including Wal-Mart, Thursday said it
would acquire Hills Stores Co. for $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which some analysts say is likely to be the first of
several consolidations of medium-sized discount chains in the near
future, would create the fourth largest discount retailer in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hills, a Canton, Mass. company that has been ailing in recent
months, operates 155 stores primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New
York, West Virginia and Indiana. For October it posted a 9.7
percent drop in same-store sales, and for fiscal 1998 a loss of $9
million. Last month Hills named a new chief executive, Chaim Y.
Edelstein, to replace Gregory K. Raven, who resigned after less
than three years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle lately,'' said William Friend, senior
vice president for Hills. ``Our board of directors believes that
it's the best thing at this time for our shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., operates 301 stores in 14
Northeastern states and the District of Columbia. The full-line
discount retailer offers a broad range of merchandise, including
family apparel, housewares, domestics, electronics, toys,
ready-to-assemble and patio furniture, and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Ames said it will spent about $170 million to convert the Hills
stores into Ames stores over the next nine months. Company
officials said most or all of Hills' management and salespeople are
expected to be offered new positions with Ames, though Friend said
Ames will probably close the company's 600-person Canton
headquarters, which houses mostly merchandising and financial
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ames Thursday also posted a 77 percent jump in third-quarter
earnings from a year ago. For the quarter ended Oct. 31, net income
was $6.2 million, up from $3.5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales for the third quarter were $599.2 million, compared
with $527.6 million in the year-ago quarter, up 13.6 percent. Net
sales for the first nine months of the year were $1.64 billion,
compared with $1.46 billion for the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very successful the last couple of years. One of
the things our investors and analysts are constantly asking us is,
`how can you show us more agressive growth?''' said Joseph R.
Ettore, chief executive of Ames. ``We have a very successful retail
format that has worked very well, but the only other way to really
accelerate that growth is through an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames will pay $1.50 a share for each of Hills' 11.2 million
outstanding shares. The offer is about 14 percent higher than
Hills' closing price Wednesday of 1 5/16. Ames also will offer $550
per $1,000 principal amount for the $195 million in outstanding
Hills senior notes. The offer still must be approved by Hills stock
and bond holders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts hailed the acquisition, which comes as many regional
discount retailers are struggling to stay afloat in the face of
increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant because it provides Ames a huge strategic
opportunity to expand their franchise from the Northeast now to a
much larger part of the Midwest,'' said Steven A. Richter, an
analyst with Tucker Anthony in Boston. ``The key to Ames' success
is that they co-exist very effectively with K-mart and Wal-Mart
already in the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are similar in terms of their store size and
customer base: Hills has about 14,000 employees; Ames about 21,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many regional discounters ``will probably have to consolidate to
be able to compete nationally,'' said Jennifer Secallus, an analyst
with Atlantis Resource in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent discount chains in Massachusetts _ Norwalk,
Conn.-based Caldor and Braintree-based Bradlees _ are currently
grappling with financial reorganizations under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the discount retailing industry, Ames is known as the company
that came back.
</P>
<P>
   Ames weathered a difficult financial period that culminated in a
bankruptcy filing in 1990, which the company pulled itself out of
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ames has managed to carve a niche for itself,
touting the smaller size of its stores and a special senior
discount program it offers as an alternative to the more impersonal
retailing of its national competitors.

A BREAK FOR ALL OF US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a brain in your head or an ounce of common sense,
you will go to the door or nearest window, open it, and shout at
the top of your lungs, ``Thank you for sparing us five more years
of Mo Vaughn's bull.''
</P>
<P>
   What a break we all just got. I'm closing in on 40 years of
writing sports for this paper, and there was no bigger bore, or
earache, over those four decades than Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Mo is a great hitter, one of the best ever to play for the Red
sox. He did more in the Boston community than any other player in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   But recent history shows it was not wise to take as truth what
Mo had to say.
</P>
<P>
   The local baseball media and the regulars on WEEI's Welfare
Radio bought into his perpetual contractual harangue, and now they
are all running for cover, trying to rationalize excuses that would
make what they did seem plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make it simple. Mo is about money. Just as his good buddy
Roger Clemens is. And like Roger, wherever he gets the most is
where he will end up.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he left to play on a winner. So he went to Toronto,
which had no chance of winning anything, even while Roger was
having two of the greatest years any pitcher has ever had
back-to-back. Now the word is Roger wants out of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Clemens really wanted to play for a winner, he would
have gone to the Yankees or Braves and said, ``I'll sign for
anything you give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the winning stuff is phony. The money is what counts.
And if Toronto trades him, Clemens will go where he gets the most
money, and he won't agree to any deal unless he gets more money.
That's his history.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said a year ago that his beef with the Red Sox wasn't
about money. He said he had more money than he needed and would
play for $5 million a year if the Sox showed him they would spend
to get a winner. As of now, the Red Sox will have the
second-highest payroll in major league baseball entering 1999. They
spent. Mo went.
</P>
<P>
   If Mo is really about winning, he'll call the Yankees tomorrow
and say, ``Give me anything. I'll sign. I want to be on a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you know he won't do that. This guy is obsessed with
money. For more than five years, we have been tortured with stories
about his contract trouble. We have read how he wanted to be a
Yankee, wanted to be a Ranger, wanted to be a Blue Jay. Wherever he
went, even though he was under contract to the Red Sox, Mo was
setting himself up for this week, when Boston was willing to give
him a deal that would have made him the highest-paid player in the
American League and he said, ``So long, suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo's friends are scrambling now to explain it. The key word is
``issues,'' as in, ``There are other issues that Mo has that he
doesn't want to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Mo will attempt to explain why he didn't take a deal
that could have risen to an average of $13 million guaranteed
annually for the next five years from the Red Sox, a contract
length he asked for _ and said he would take _ just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are hints from his friends that Mo wanted a no-trade
clause and the Red Sox wouldn't give it to him. Of course they
wouldn't. Give Vaughn a no-trade clause and every other player and
his agent would be at the Sox' door looking for the same thing.
Does Vaughn really think anyone would trade for his $13
million-a-year contract? Does Vaughn think the Sox would unload him
within three years, before he became a 10-5 man (10 years in the
majors, five with the same team) and could veto any deal?
</P>
<P>
   Like Mo, that's all bull.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what went down in the final hours of the Red Sox-Vaughn
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' first contract offer was for five years, $60.5
million guaranteed. All the clauses in the contract were the same
ones he had in his prior deal, plus those added by major league
baseball that will be in all guaranteed contracts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a weight clause. But Mo has had one for four years,
and when he has been asked to weigh in, he wouldn't do so. Wouldn't
get on the scale. There was a clause about making a certain amount
of appearances on behalf of the team. The clause was in the last
contract as well, but it didn't make any difference because when
the Sox asked Mo to make those appearances, he wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``clauses'' excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the money.
</P>
<P>
   When his agent, Tom Reich, and Mo decided not to accept the
first offer, the Sox came back with a second. They would add a
sixth year, at the club's option. They would pay $13.5 million if
they kept Mo for a sixth year. That would raise the total value to
$74 million over six years, making it almost as good as Pedro
Martinez's deal, which is what the Sox thought he was holding out
for. Also, the Sox said, if they decided not to keep Mo for the
sixth year, they would have to give him a $2.5 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   When they left Reich Wednesday afternoon with the latest offer
that would give Mo at least $63 million guaranteed, general manager
Dan Duquette and his associate, Elaine Weddington Steward, thought
they had a deal. They told team CEO John Harrington they felt
confident Vaughn was coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Then they waited. And waited. Finally, at 9 Wednesday night,
Mo's people phoned the Sox and said, ``We are still far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mo's people had said it was close, the Sox would have kicked
in $2 million more to give him $65 million guaranteed for five
years, but when they said they were far apart, the Sox knew they
were being suckered and said, ``Good night.''
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months, they had tried to get the deal done. They opened
the talks more than a year ago at $30 million for three years, or
$10 million annually. His agents said at the time they would take
Mark McGwire money. McGwire got a three-year contact that averaged
$9.5 million annually in St. Louis. The Sox bettered that and got
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training this year, Mo mentioned to Duquette that he
might be interested in a two-year deal. That way, he might have two
more contracts before his career was over. The Sox offered him $22
million for two years, $11 million annually. This was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   In July, breaking with team tradition, they negotiated at the
All-Star break. Mo said he wanted more years. They offered him $38
million, or $9.5 million annually, for four years. This was just to
be a starting point. They were willing to go higher, but they never
got the shot. Mo's people walked out of the room in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for this week. So Vaughn turned down $9.5
million a year, $10 million a year, $11 milllion a year, and
finally this week $12 million, then $l3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   And after all this, some members of the media had the audacity
to report that the Sox didn't move fast enough or try hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same people who said what a great leader Mo had
been, even when he was saying he would like to play for just about
every other team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership? When Mo comes out with the bogus story that the team
has a private detective following him, without one shred of
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Leadership? When he continally bad-mouthed the organization
whenever he had the chance? When his own lawyer said in court he
was 50 pounds overweight at one point?
</P>
<P>
   If I read the Boston sports fans correctly, they now feel about
Mo the way they feel about the NBA: If he never comes back, we
won't be missing a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm hoping the Sox sign Albert Belle pronto. He's a
much better player than Vaughn. And what makes it even better ...
simply fantastic ... is that he doesn't talk. The Belle of Silence.
Has a beautiful ring to it.

NEW ADD-ONS GIVE YOUR PC MORE ZIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, the hardware shelf gets a bit overcrowded
here at the Computing World Headquarters. The goodies pile up, and
it becomes necessary to plow through them for certifiable gems.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in the world, computer add-ons are getting
cheaper, better and easier to use. There are so many of them, and
so little time!
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the better toys that have crossed my cluttered
computer desk in the past couple of months:
</P>
<P>
   (B) Mii Zip 100 _ $250, Microtech International. The
introduction of Iomega's Zip drive was a major event for portable
computer owners. The Zip's 100-megabyte disk capacity and easy
connection to a PC's parallel port made it a snap to transfer big
files between desktop and notebook; store large graphics or data
files on the road; or hold seldom-used programs that could be run
directly from the Zip, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two big drawbacks to the original Zip drive.
First, the parallel model is (BEGIN ITAL) ssslloooowwwww, (END
ITAL) and very few, if any, Windows-based notebooks have the port
necessary to take advantage of Iomega's SCSI-based model.
</P>
<P>
   Second, toting the paperback-size external Zip drive wasn't too
bad, but you also had a thick cable and a bricklike power supply.
Add that to a 6- to 7-pound notebook computer and other traveling
accessories, and dashing through airports becomes an Olympic Iron
Man event.
</P>
<P>
   The Mii Zip 100 fixes those two problems elegantly.
</P>
<P>
   Designed specifically for portable computers, this external
drive connects via a standard PC-card slot. Data can move through
these slots much, much faster than through a parallel port. In
fact, it's as fast as the internal Zip drives now being sold in
many consumer desktop PCs.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't use an external power supply, drawing its juice
from the computer. This has one obvious downside: the battery in
your portable won't last as long if you use the Zip drive much. But
given that transfers are so fast, the Zip won't be chugging for
long.
</P>
<P>
   The Mii Zip 100 is tiny _ just a little bit bigger than a Zip
disk. It weighs only 11 ounces, and it works with standard,
ATAPI-type drivers. That means later versions of Windows 95 and the
current version of Windows 98 should recognize it without having to
manually install new drivers for it. As a result, you can use it to
share data with most modern portables.
</P>
<P>
   (B) Diamond Viper V550 _ $200, Diamond Multimedia. One of the
hottest areas of competition in computing is in graphics cards.
They're getting faster, and prices are dropping. You now can get
excellent performance for very little cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V550 is one of the more expensive cards out there, but
if speed at high resolutions is a priority for you, it's worth it.
Powered by nVidia's new Riva TNT, a graphics chip that moves
information through the card 128 bits at a time, it's great for
business applications and games.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V550 comes in PCI and AGP versions _ I tried the PCI
model _ and has 16 megabytes of fast video memory. It can display
16.7 million colors (so-called ``true color'') at resolutions as
high as 1,920-by-1,200 pixels, and at refresh rates as high as 200
hertz.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been interested in adding a secondary graphics card
for fast 3-D gaming, such as a Voodoo- or Voodoo2-based card, but
you don't have enough open PCI slots in your computer, Viper V550
could be your answer. It provides beautiful 3-D graphics in the
Microsoft DirectX and OpenGL standards at impressive speeds.
</P>
<P>
   You can, for example, run Quake II in OpenGL mode at a
resolution of 1,024-by-768. Single Voodoo2-based cards can handle
this game in only 800-by-600 resolution _ you need a pair of
Voodoo2s for 1,024-by-768. You'll need a fast, Pentium II-based PC
to run at this resolution, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Viper V550's drivers still need some work, though. I had
some odd problems with screen freezes in America Online 4.0, as
well as ghost images left on the screen when some windows closed.
Diamond is good about updating its drivers frequently, so I suspect
these bugs will be history soon.
</P>
<P>
   (B) V900 monitor _ $649, Compaq Computer Corp. Compaq sells more
monitors than anyone else, which is not surprising, considering it
sells more desktop PCs than anyone. However, its monitors in the
past have been somewhat ordinary _ neither stellar performers nor
eyestrain machines.
</P>
<P>
   That changes with the new V900, an affordable 19-inch model with
a crisp, bright display that will impress even the most jaded
monitor junkie. In fact, the bright, high-contrast display rivals
that of my favorite monitor-maker, NEC Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   This monitor has a big 18-inch viewable area, crammed into a
cabinet that's about the size of a 17-inch monitor. Although this
is aimed at business users, that size advantage makes it the
perfect choice for home users who are cramped for space.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has moved the cables so they emerge from the bottom
of the cabinet instead of the back. This makes it much easier to
back the monitor against a wall _ another benefit if you are using
a shallow computer desk. There's also a USB hub built into the
base, which makes it easier to connect USB devices to your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The V900 has a .22mm horizontal dot pitch and can handle refresh
rates up to 85 hertz and resolutions up to 1,600-by-1,200. The
screen image is wonderful _ text and graphics stay sharp, even at
the very edges of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is Macintosh-compatible, too.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-inch monitor is excellent for business applications,
because there is more screen for open windows, and for games, where
a bigger screen gives more of a feeling of immersion. This Compaq
monitor costs about what a quality 17-inch monitor would have cost
a year ago. It's an excellent bargain.

$42 BILLION BRAZIL AID PACKAGE TO BE ANNOUNCED
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of negotiations, the International
Monetary Fund and more than a dozen nations are expected to
announce loans to Brazil totaling at least $42 billion to help
stabilize the country's economy, according to officials familiar
with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. contribution to the package, said to be more than $5
billion, would be the biggest commitment of taxpayers' money to
alleviate a foreign economic crisis since the bailout of Mexico in
1995. The package for Brazil comes four months after a Russian
bailout that turned into a financial debacle, wasting $4.8 billion
in IMF funds and touching off a panic among investors who pulled
their money from other emerging markets, including Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Brazil bailout carries considerable risks for
both the IMF and the Clinton administration, which have increased
the size of the loan package by nearly 50 percent in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Final details of the deal, which the Brazilian government said
Thursday night would ``probably'' be announced Friday, were worked
out in the last few days during secret negotiations in Washington.
The Treasury Department, which has been pressing American allies in
recent weeks to contribute more to the plan, refused to comment
Thursday on the details.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials from several countries who are familiar with
the details say that the IMF will offer $18 billion in loans, much
of which will be made available to Brazil almost immediately.
Another $4.5 billion will come from the World Bank and a nearly
equal amount from the the Inter-American Development Bank. The
World Bank is primarily responsible for anti-poverty and economic
development programs, but it has taken a larger and larger role in
containing the financial crisis that has spread around the world;
the Inter-American Development Bank plays a parallel role in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   At least $15 billion more will come from the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan and several
other nations. It is unclear when that money would be delivered,
but it is expected to carry a relatively high interest rate _ as
did the $12 billion in U.S. loans to Mexico _ to encourage Brazil
to repay it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Private banks and other major lenders to Brazil, who will number
among the biggest beneficiaries of any plan that stabilizes the
country's economy, will not be directly contributing to the
program. Under pressure from the United States, however, they are
expected to commit to maintain or expand lines of credit they had
extended to Brazil until the crisis that was touched off by
Russia's default on its loans in August.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past bailouts of Thailand, Korea and Indonesia, this one
has taken months to arrange _ so long that the total amount has
been increased, in part so that markets are not disappointed by the
revelation of a package no larger than the one they have expected
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that we are we are finally coming out of the
financial crisis, but that the package had to exceed market
expectations,'' said Nicolas Checa, the head of the emerging
markets division of Medley Global Investors, an advisory group to
large investors. ``Everyone wanted to exceed market expectations so
they are not back in the October nightmare,'' he said, referring to
the huge selloff that occurred after it became clear that the
Russian parliament was not about to impose any of the fiscal
discipline required to get the IMF to begin delivering aid to the
country again.
</P>
<P>
   All official loans to Russia have been suspended since August,
and private lending there has dried up, forcing Russia to speed up
the printing of money to pay pensioners and even the military.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is viewed by most experts as being in fundamentally good
shape. But inside the U.S. Treasury, there is concern that
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso may not have the clout
necessary to push through some of the politically painful spending
cuts that the loan package requires. Like most IMF aid, the Brazil
package will be turned over to the country in stages, as the
Congress enacts the conditions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. money will probably not be disbursed until Brazil has
met many of those conditions, according to officials familiar with
the plans. Administration officials say that while the world
economic turmoil has abated somewhat in the past three weeks,
members of Congress are sufficiently scared of the potential
effects here of an economic collapse in Brazil that they will offer
few objections. The chief critic in the Senate of the Mexican
bailout, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, was defeated in last
week's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of this have changed,'' one administration
official said this week. The distraction of the showdown with Iraq,
other officials say, may also lessen the attention on the U.S.
contribution. It is still unclear what Brazil will offer for
collateral in return for the American loans.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, nervousness about the delay in settling the final
details of the agreement has been growing daily. In Sao Paulo, the
country's industrial and financial engine, the Bovespa stock market
index dropped 3.76 percent Thursday in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reserves, which have fallen by more than $30 billion
since the crisis began in August, also continued their decline,
with another $280 million leaving the country Thursday. And though
the government announced a reduction in interest rates Wednesday,
the Central Bank's main rate remains a hefty 42.25 percent, to the
disappointment of business leaders, who are clamoring for any
relaxation of recessionary pressures. Recent economic indicators
have shown that Brazil's industrial production is falling sharply,
as companies feel the impact of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is selling the aid as a program
intended to help the country before it is forced to devalue its
currency or watch the remainder of its foreign currency reserves
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a debate has raged within the IMF over whether
Brazil should devalue its currency now, to make its goods less
expensive _ and thus more competitive _ on world markets. The high
interest rates in Brazil are intended to bolster the Brazilian real
by providing investors with an incentive to keep their money in the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe the latest moves will still not be
enough. Rudiger Dornbush, an MIT professor with close ties to top
officials of the IMF, warned at a conference here last week that
the country's huge debt burden and the unwillingness of its
Congress to impose fiscal discipline over the past year, leave ``no
reasons to be confident in Brazil.'' He predicted that aid for the
country may not ``last long'' and would only delay an inevitable
devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's fear is that major banks might repeat what they did in
Russia and South Korea: Use the brief period of stability created
by the aid to get their investments out of the country. But Brazil
is a different case: It still has roughly $40 billion in foreign
currency reserves, and the loan program is designed to strengthen
the government's hand, so that investors have more confidence in
the country's ability to emerge from the current crisis.

COMMENTARY: THE ELAGABALUS PARALLEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On hearing that Newt had fallen, I immediately ran to my Roman
history books.
</P>
<P>
   Newt's Republican warriors, according to the great engines of
media baloney, had risen up suddenly and savagely against him.
</P>
<P>
   A mighty blow being swiftly struck by men he thought the dearest
of comrades, Newt was fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cannibals!'' he had cried in the desperate instant when he
realized his end had come.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I'd read this story somewhere years ago. Something about
some great man's old soldier buddies carrying his severed head
around on a spear point. It had to be a Roman tale.
Declining-and-falling Roman.
</P>
<P>
   Being bushwhacked by your own troops _ it wasn't a bit like
Cicero having his throat cut by Mark Anthony's thugs. When Cicero
saw that resistance was pointless, he tilted his head back to give
the murderers easy access to his jugular. That was brave,
undeclined old Rome.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Cicero and Anthony, unlike Newt and his assassins,
had never been friends. Anthony hated Cicero, had always hated
Cicero, because Cicero had character. Anthony had no character at
all, and he hated Cicero for having so much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Murdering Cicero was rotten, but it was an early Roman, not a
declining-and-falling Roman, deed. In Cicero's days a Roman's
enemies were his enemies, not his friends.
</P>
<P>
   I opened Gibbon's ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' to
revisit Rome on the downhill slope. Newt's story was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It was the story of Alexander Severus, a young emperor like
Newt. Alexander's predecessor, Elagabalus, was so corrupt that the
army, which really ran the empire, murdered the disgusting lout
and, says Gibbon, had ``his mutilated corpse dragged through the
streets of the city, and thrown into the Tiber.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't precisely what Newt's Republicans did in 1994 to the
Democratic bosses of the House of Representatives, except
metaphorically, which is close enough.
</P>
<P>
   Needing an emperor fast, the Roman soldiers quickly installed
Alexander. Like young Newt coming unexpectedly to power in the
House after routing the old Democratic regime, young Emperor
Alexander was destined to learn that glory can be short-lived in a
declining empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman soldiers _ a nasty and corrupt bunch at this stage of
history _ were disappointed by Alexander's inability to sweeten
their existence, so had him killed, possibly by his own guards as
he slept, though Gibbon is inclined to think he was given a hearing
of some sort and showed a deplorable lack of Ciceronian character.
</P>
<P>
   ``... unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments
of his life,'' writes Gibbon, ``and converted into contempt some
portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortune must
inspire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbon would have approved of Newt's behavior on learning that
his hour had come. After that first startled outburst about
``cannibals,'' he did not invite posterity's contempt by disgracing
his last moments with unavailing cries and entreaties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, while cameras looked on, he flung himself into warm and
smiling embrace with congressman Livingston, the good friend whom
Newt had made chairman of a vital House committee and was now
revealed as the author of his ruin.
</P>
<P>
   And what of congressman Livingston, whose reputation for wisdom,
genius and good fellowship is now enjoying the media buildup
granted all newcomers to offices of power?
</P>
<P>
   I'm reading on in Gibbon. Rome's military emperor-makers have
murdered Alexander so they can give the emperorship to one of their
favorite generals, a Thracian peasant named Maximin.
</P>
<P>
   The army loves him, as the House Republicans who once loved Newt
now love congressman Livingston. Soon, however, Maximin's capital
is exhausted. He is behaving badly toward women and children, not
to mention politicians and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the soldiers feel Maximin is making them work and fight
under hardship conditions. And so Maximin, ``abandoned by his
guards, was slain in his tent'' with his son and chief aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sight of their heads, borne on the point of spears,'' says
Gibbon, convinced Romans that happy days were there again. They
weren't. Good night, Newt.

REPORT FAULTS FEDERAL AGENCIES IN DEATH OF YOUNG TEXAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 7thgraf to add Justice Department comment,
pickup8thgraf: Earlier this year)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Marines and Border Patrol officials were
negligent in the death of a young Texan who was tending his
family's goats when he was shot by an anti-drug surveillance patrol
on the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a congressional report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Marines involved in the incident failed to give
emergency aid to Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, who died about a half
hour after the May 20, 1997, shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The 249-page report ``tells the story of how two powerful
federal agencies ... were negligent in the shooting and killing''
of Hernandez, said Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both agencies made serious mistakes that contributed to this
terrible tragedy,'' said Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused the Justice and Defense departments of not
disclosing information about the deadly encounter near the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``They withheld necessary information that had the effect of
seriously crippling any possibility of finding the truth in a
criminal investigation,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a statement Thursday night saying
it shared evidence with Texas prosecutors ``to the extend permitted
by law.'' The Marines released a statement saying that while the
death ``was tragic,'' there was no criminal wrongdoing and the
patrol ``complied with the rules of engagement and acted to protect
a fellow Marine.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Hernandez family agreed to a $1.9 million
out-of-court settlement with the federal government over the death.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusions in the congressional report mirror those reached
earlier this year in an inquiry conducted for the Marines by
retired Maj. Gen. J.T. Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne found the four-man Marine patrol was inadequately trained
for the mission, lacked thorough knowledge of the area, and had
poor communications with their superiors, who were 70 miles away.
The report also questioned the use of troops for law-enforcement
purposes on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also investigated whether there were
civil rights violations involved in the shooting, but the probe was
closed without public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Documents obtained by congressional investigators show that
Justice Department attorneys believed Hernandez's wounds and
statements by Lance Cpl. Ronald Wieler Jr., who was part of the
patrol, contradict the claim that the shooting was an act of self
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Clemente Banuelos told investigators that Hernandez raised
a .22-caliber rifle to fire at one member of the patrol. Banuelos
said he fired to protect the Marine.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy and information gathered by Texas Rangers and FBI
agents, however, question whether the goat herder was raising a
rifle to fire at the Marines, who were camouflaged in shredded
burlap and facial paints, ``or raising his hands to surrender,''
the congressional report said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place on the outskirts Hernandez's hometown of
Redford, an agricultural town in the sparsely populated Big Bend
region of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional documents show that the Justice Department
sought immunity for the Marines to protect them from state
prosecutors who wanted to take the shooting before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting subsequently went before state and federal grand
juries, but neither issued an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, a year and a half later, it is impossible to tell
exactly how Hernandez died,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the congressional investigation did not look into
whether the four Marines were criminally responsible for the death.
Banuelos has since received an honorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has reprimanded supervisory personnel over the
incident and criticized the lack of training and preparations that
the four men were given.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department should do its job right and hold
accountable those responsible for this needless death,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting raised questions about whether soldiers should be
used to bolster civilian agencies in patrolling the borders for
drug smugglers and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol, which is part of the Justice Department, has
issued operational changes that would place law enforcement agents
in surveillance positions where contact with civilians is likely,
and relegating military personnel to administrative-type roles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the shooting, military patrols along the U.S.DMexico
border have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, said that suspension should be
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers are trained to kill, not police. That's the problem.
It's unfortunate that this young man's life was taken. It's
unfortunate they tried to cover it up,'' Rodriguez said.

CONCERN RAISED OVER CANCER RESEARCHER'S DISCOVERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at the National Cancer Institute have begun to express
frustration over their inability to reproduce the striking
discoveries described a year ago by Dr. Judah Folkman, the Harvard
researcher who reported that he and his colleagues had wiped out
malignant tumors in mice by treating the animals with compounds
that destroyed the tumors' blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's concerns were reported Thursday in a front-page
article in The Wall Street Journal stating that Folkman's work had
not passed an essential test of scientific validity: the
requirement that it be reproduced by other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday after the article appeared, the
institute said that it would continue to study the compounds,
angiostatin and endostatin, but it added: ``To date, NCI studies
using either the mouse or human forms of endostatin have not
produced the marked regression of these tumors in mice that
Folkman's laboratory has reported. Scientists from NCI and
Folkman's laboratory are working together to resolve the
differences in their research results.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the institute declined repeated requests for
interviews about their concerns, but a spokesman said that
institute officials believed The Journal's article was
substantially correct. The cancer institute was unusually
close-mouthed today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Folkman also declined to be interviewed, but issued a statement
asserting basically that research takes time and that it was too
soon for the institute's scientists, who began their studies within
the past year, to have mastered the complicated techniques that it
took his team years to develop. Folkman also said that his own
team, as well as two others, had confirmed that endostatin was a
potent inhibitor to the growth of both blood vessels and tumors in
mice and rats.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said he and his colleagues and scientists from the
cancer institute ``will go to each other's laboratories to transfer
the techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of Entremed, the company licensed by Folkman to
produce endostatin, said that more than 20 studies the company had
sponsored by other researchers in the United States and abroad had
confirmed Folkman's findings. The official, Dr. John Holaday, said
he expected to begin testing endostatin in 50 to 100 cancer
patients next year.
</P>
<P>
   Entremed's stock price dropped $7.75 in Thursday's trading, to
$24.88, a decline of 23.6 percent. But the company's stock had
still increased by 120 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman has been studying ways to choke off the blood supply to
tumors for about 30 years. He described some of his work in the
journal Nature in November 1997 and it leapt to public attention in
May when a front-page article in The New York Times described the
excitement his findings had provoked among other scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In the study published in November, Folkman and his colleagues
reported that they had completely eradicated all signs of cancer in
every mouse they had treated with a combination of endostatin and
angiostatin. The tumors did not recur, and the animals suffered no
side effects, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The report generated a flurry of studies by drug companies,
academic laboratories and the cancer institute, where the director,
Dr. Richard Klausner, said he was ``putting nothing on a higher
priority'' than developing the compounds into drugs for people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that sought to duplicate Folkman's findings
was the biotechnology company Genentech, in South San Francisco, a
company that is also pursuing other methods of starving tumors by
cutting off their blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech scientists tried several times to produce both
endostatin and angiostatin, following the methods described in
Folkman's scientific papers, and then tested them in mice. But the
substances did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Levinson, the chief executive of Genentech, said the
company's inability to reproduce the research did not necessarily
mean that Folkman was wrong. Levinson said that Genentech's
scientists might have erred in the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're doing something wrong, I would like to know what it
is, because we're all hoping he's right,'' Levinson said. ``But
things like this shouldn't languish too long, because the whole
basis of science is reproducibility. If they can't be reproduced,
at some point you have to ask yourself, are the initial claims
correct?''

 &HT;    Lehrer refuses to sit in the pundit's chair
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, Ga._Jim Lehrer refuses to be a hybrid or a hyphenate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started out in this business (as a reporter for the
Dallas Times Herald) there were three distinct categories of
journalists,'' says the anchor of PBS' ``The NewsHour With Jim
Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``1. There were reporters who told you what happened. 2. There
were analysts who told you why it happened. And 3. There were
columnists and editorial page writers who told you what they
thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's not unusual to see one person do all three. We have
people who give straight news reports going on the Sunday TV shows
and giving their opinions,'' he says. He won't mention names, but
it's clear he's talking about the Sam Donaldsons of the TV
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is it's hurt our credibility. We as
journalists are way down there in public opinion polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer refused to play the pundit on a swing through Atlanta
that started Thursday and continues today. He was tentatively
scheduled Thursday on CNN's ``TalkBack Live,'' but the show's
producers decided at the last minute to talk about Iraq and ask
Lehrer what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to ask the questions I want to ask, not the
questions I want to answer,'' he says. ``I don't answer questions
like that _ should the U.S. bomb Iraq? I'm not a pundit.''
</P>
<P>
   But dropping CNN from his schedule didn't exactly mean that
Lehrer had time to kill while in Atlanta. On Thursday he did two
meet-and-greets for pledge donors to Atlanta's two PBS stations: a
lunch with WPBA supporters at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta and a dinner
reception at the Governor's Mansion for GPTV supporters. He also
did a book signing and gave a speech at Emory University in
Atlanta. Today he's on National Public Radio and WAGA's ``Good Day
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta comes toward the end of a dual-purpose 17-city tour for
Leh-rer, to promote his new novel, ``Purple Dots'' (Random House,
$23.95), a breezy espionage thriller, and to thank PBS supporters.
He's taking vacation time to do his first big tour since co-anchor
Robert MacNeil resigned three years ago and left Lehrer solo at the
PBS anchor desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the supporters who make it possible for me to do what I
do,'' he says. ``It's been brutal,'' he says of the tour, ``but
extremely rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer did the first interview with President Clinton in January
immediately after the Monica Lewinsky story broke, a sit-down that
had been scheduled in advance. He asked Clinton about what were
then new and unsubstantiated allegations, Clinton denied any
relationship and that was the end of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear he wasn't going to say anything more. I could
take him, almost like combat, or I could move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And, saying that, Lehrer moved on.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Smits' swan song
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Smits wouldn't spill the beans Thursday on ``The Rosie
O'Donnell Show'' as to whether his character, Bobby Simone, will
exit ``NYPD Blue'' toes first or head held high, but he did prove
to be a good sport, singing ``TV Show Dropout,'' a spoof of
``Beauty School Dropout'' from the musical ``Grease.'' Sample
lyric: ``On the show I bared my tush so much, I might become a
stripper.''

   They're harnessing kid power
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Martin Luther King III and actor Andrew Shue have a
dream for the next Martin Luther King Jr. holiday: They want
youngsters to perform acts of kindness and justice.
</P>
<P>
   The encouragement is part of the Kindness and Justice Challenge,
to take place in the two weeks following the Jan. 18, holiday
honoring the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   The former ``Melrose Place'' actor created the challenge last
year. King is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important element here is getting that young
person to think about helping somebody else,'' Shue says. ``It's
such a great seed being planted in their life.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14,000 schools nationwide took part in last year's
challenge, timed to recognize the impact that the late King has had
on generations of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Marty King said the challenge can help keep alive his father's
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my father, I believe in the power of young people to
change the world,'' he said.

CHINA COURT SENTENCES HONG KONG CRIME BOSS TO DEATH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In the end, Cheung Tze-keung got exactly the verdict
his lawyers feared: a death sentence, handed down Thursday by a
Chinese court that found the 44-year-old Hong Kong crime boss
guilty of arms smuggling and kidnapping two of Hong Kong's
wealthiest tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   While the verdict is a grim ending to one of the most
sensational criminal trials in recent Chinese history _ watched
with daily fascination by people both here and on the mainland _ it
has kicked off a fresh controversy over whether China is
encroaching on the judicial authority of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung, 44, committed the bulk of his crimes, including both
kidnappings, in Hong Kong. Yet he was arrested across the border in
Guangdong Province and tried in the provincial capital, Guangzhou.
It was there, early Thursday morning, that the man known as the Big
Spender got the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung's lawyer, Ivan Tang, fought unsuccessfully to have the
case moved to Hong Kong. And Thursday, he accused the Hong Kong
government of buckling to pressure from China, which wanted to try
Cheung on the mainland, where his crimes carried a more Draconian
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If Cheung had been convicted of kidnapping in Hong Kong, he
could have received a life sentence. But in mainland China, if the
Guangdong court rejects an appeal by his lawyer, Cheung is likely
to face a swift execution _ probably with a single bullet to the
back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not only killing my client, they are killing `one
country, two systems,''' Tang said, referring to the agreement in
which Hong Kong has retained control over its affairs after its
reversion to China last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials maintain that because Cheung committed some
of his crimes on the mainland _ notably the buying of explosives _
the Chinese authorities had the right to try him there. Six of his
accomplices also received death sentences, while 29 others received
varying jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Big Spender case has become an acute embarrassment
for a place that prides itself on its British-style legal system.
On Tuesday, Cheung's mother, Tang Sai-mui, went to the offices of
Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, to plead for her son's
case to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians or legal experts are rushing to Cheung's
defense. But they are sharply critical of the government for not
defending the territory's judicial independence. Under Hong Kong's
constitution, they argue, Chinese criminal law does not apply in
this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a great outcry, but the government is
consistently defending the rights of China,'' said Martin Lee, a
prominent pro-democracy politician here. ``Surely they should be on
the side of the Hong Kong people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gladys Li, the former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association,
said the blurring of jurisdictions raised alarming possibilities.
``Could a Hong Kong citizen do something that is perfectly legal
under Hong Kong law and be prosecuted for it on the mainland?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Equally alarming, legal experts here say, are the circumstances
that landed Cheung in a Chinese courtroom. During the trial, Cheung
testified that he and his gang carried out criminal activities in
Hong Kong with seemingly blithe disregard for the local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Cheung kidnapped Victor Li, the eldest son of Hong
Kong's most famous tycoon, Li Ka-shing. While Victor Li was locked
in a cramped wooden box, Cheung negotiated a $133 million ransom
with his father _ whiling away the time at the Li family home as
the elder Li pulled together the money.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung also abducted another property developer, Walter Kwok.
After his family balked at the initial ransom demand, he worked out
a deal for $77 million in meetings with Kwok's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In neither case did the families of the victims call the Hong
Kong Police. People with knowledge of the Police Department said Li
Ka-shing did enlist the help of officials in Beijing, who began a
vast manhunt for Cheung. Authorities here said the lack of a police
report weakened their claim on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that a tycoon can pick up the phone and call Jiang
Zemin to complain,'' said Yash Ghai, a professor of law at Hong
Kong University, referring to the president of China. ``It's a type
of forum shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's legal conflicts with China are not likely to
disappear along with the Big Spender. Legal experts are now
focusing on the case of a Chinese man who is accused of killing
three women and two girls in a Hong Kong housing project. The
suspect was arrested in mainland China, and will be tried there.

U.S. AND ITALY AGREE TO DEREGULATE AIR FARES AND FREQUENCY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ After three days of intense negotiations, the United
States and Italy have initialed an agreement to drop restrictions
on air traffic between the two countries. There will be no
government control over fares or frequency of service.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached late Wednesday, effectively leaves
Britain as the only major European nation without a liberalized air
travel agreement with the United States. It also opens the question
of the European Union's future attitude toward agreements between
Washington and individual European governments on opening air
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, officials at the union's headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, have firmly opposed such two-party agreements and
threatened governments that entered them with legal action.
</P>
<P>
   For air travelers, the accord presumably means more competition
among carriers and lower fares. Under the previous accord, price
flexibility, flight frequency and destinations were restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the agreement with Italy would take effect only
after the Italian national carrier, Alitalia, was granted antitrust
immunity by Washington to enter an alliance that includes Northwest
Airlines and its partner, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The airlines
expect this legal protection to be granted by summer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will permit Alitalia to move ahead with the
alliance, which is intended to compete with global groupings,
including the Star Alliance led by United Airlines and Lufthansa,
and a second linking British Airways and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the British Air-American tie-in has encountered industry and
regulatory resistance because of its potential size and market
control on the lucrative routes between London and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Washington broke off talks on an open-skies
agreement with Britain after it accused London of making too little
headway in opening routes to U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the top six European markets, only Britain stands out as
not having a liberal agreement with the United States,'' said David
Marchick, deputy assistant secretary of state for transportation
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the failure to reach an agreement, six U.S.
carriers, including Delta Air Lines, United and Trans World
Airlines, petitioned Washington this week not to approve the
planned alliance between British Air and American until progress is
made in opening British skies. That can mainly be achieved, they
argue, through increased access to Heathrow Airport outside London,
Europe's largest.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Italy, pending approval of their
agreement, offered immediate measures with some benefits to
passengers. Beginning April 1, airlines from both countries will be
allowed to fly once daily between an American city and an Italian
city.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia called the agreement ``of historic importance,'' in a
statement this evening.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. carriers, the accord carries rich opportunities,
notably in the run-up to 2000, when celebrations in Rome of the
start of the third millennium of Christianity are expected to make
Italy a favorite travel destination.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and TWA now fly passengers to Italy, but Delta, for
instance, which acquired the old Pan Am landing rights, may now fly
only to Italian airports from New York and not from its base in
Atlanta. American, United, US Airways and Continental Airlines,
which serve Italy on a limited basis, have all expressed interest
in expanding their service.
</P>
<P>
   For Alitalia, which returned to profitability in 1997 after
eight years of losses, the agreement is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Though its terms foresee opening routes across the Atlantic to a
second Italian carrier, most likely a privately owned airline
called Air Europe, the agreement gives Alitalia the chance to
develop a global alliance with some of the strongest European and
U.S. carriers. Alitalia already has code-sharing arrangements with
Continental, which has agreed to become part of the alliance with
KLM and Northwest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ The highway network that is the backbone of
the entire Central American economy has been severed in more than a
hundred places. Bumper crops of bananas, coffee, rice, sugar and
tobacco have been destroyed; power and telephone lines are down
everywhere; and water, sewer and irrigation systems have been
ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 10,000 people believed drowned in floods or
buried in landslides, the hurricane called Mitch ranks as the most
deadly natural disaster to strike Central America this century.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm also inflicted an economic catastrophe on an area
already sadly familiar with calamity and privation, a crisis whose
full extent will become evident only when survivors finish giving
thanks just for being alive and try to resume their normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lives of hundreds of thousands of people have been saved,
but their houses and their jobs, their tools and their animals have
been lost,'' Peter Bell, president of the relief organization CARE
USA, said after returning from a trip to hard-hit rural areas.
``After the mud and the muck finally recede, what will again be
revealed is the bedrock social problem of the region, and that is
extreme poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic losses are hard to calculate, even two weeks after
the hurricane dumped more than 25 inches of rain on farmland and
factories up and down the seven-nation isthmus. But preliminary
estimates compiled by international lending agencies meeting in
Washington suggest that Honduras and Nicaragua, the countries most
affected, suffered losses equivalent to nearly half their gross
national products.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to about $5 billion, an enormous sum for the
two countries, which after Haiti are the poorest in the Western
Hemisphere. ``But then in addition,'' noted Mark Schneider,
regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, ``you have an additional $4.5
to $5 billion in lost future production.''
</P>
<P>
   The economies of Central America are predominantly agricultural,
and it is in the fields that the storm damage has been most
devastating. Nicaragua, which had been growing at a strong 7
percent annually in recent years, has reported losses both to
traditional activities such as cattle ranching, and to new ones
like shrimp farming. Honduran officials estimate that the country
suffered $900 million in losses from damage to crops such as
bananas and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Honduras' worst disaster in more than 100 years,''
said Billy Handal, a Honduran vice president. ``Ninety percent of
banana production was affected.'' In 1997 bananas accounted for
about $250 million of $1.1 billion in total exports from Honduras,
a country of 6 million people, about the size of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Because of widespread flooding of their plantations, foreign
banana producers that have dominated the Honduran economy for a
century, like Dole and Chiquita, have suspended operations. As a
result, about 17,000 field hands will be without work _ perhaps for
``several years,'' in a glum estimate by Carlos Flores Facusse, the
president of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 72 hours we lost what we had built, little by little, in 50
years,'' he said to reporters there, adding, ``In Honduras
everything will be measured before and after'' Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the damage is so widespread that there is no guarantee
that big banana producers will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning on assessing the damage as soon as possible,''
Steven Warshaw, president of Chiquita Brands International, said in
a telephone interview from corporate headquarters in Cincinnati
when asked about his company's intentions. ``Then we will make our
plans accordingly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The destruction extends beyond the countries that suffered the
most severe loss of life. The Guatemalan coffee growers association
estimates that up to 25 percent of this year's crop has been
destroyed, and officials in El Salvador calculate that $200 million
in exports, mostly agricultural, may have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Honduras has also developed a flourishing
export-processing zone, mostly for textiles, in the area around San
Pedro Sula. But that region suffered heavy flooding not just of
factories and the homes of some 80,000 workers, but also of
warehouses where supplies and finished products were stored and of
the nearby ports that shipped goods to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The factory owners association in San Pedro Sula estimates that
the 200 or so plants there have been losing a combined $1 million a
day because of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Small peasant producers, who make up the bulk of the population
in most of Central America, are perhaps even more seriously
affected. They live hand to mouth and have no insurance, and most
have all of their meager investment tied up in houses, crops and
animals, which for the most part have been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything I had,'' said Norberto Miranda, 26, a farm
worker from Posoltega, a town in northwest Nicaragua where a
mudslide killed as many as 2,000 people. ``We need money and
assistance to get back on our feet again, but so far there have
been no signs of help from our government.''
</P>
<P>
   The social burden on governments whose limited budgets are
already strained can also be expected to grow. The storm left a
high toll of orphans, amputees and the infirm at the same time that
it destroyed clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In many rural areas, those schools not destroyed by the storm
are being used as refuges for the impoverished survivors. When, if
ever, children will be able to return to classes remains uncertain,
and this in the long term could mean a labor force based even more
on subsistence.

   PAINE, Chile _ The deadly political grudges of the past are
rarely discussed in this town of grape and citrus growers. But ever
since Gen. Augusto Pinochet was arrested last month in London on
charges of human rights violations, the writing scrawled on Paine's
walls has been anything but discreet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Die Marxist Dogs'' and ``Viva Pinochet'' were scrawled outside
the grocery store of Sonia Carreno Saldias de Maureira and Juan
Leonardo Maureira, the wife and son of a man who was taken from his
home by soldiers 25 years ago and not seen again until his bones
were uncovered nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The People United Will Never Be Defeated'' _ a slogan of the
Chilean left going back decades _ was painted on a wall next door.
It was hardly a message welcomed by the property's owner, Francisco
Luzoro, who helped lead a truckers' strike against the Socialist
government of President Salvador Allende Gossens and actively
supported the Pinochet coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Both signs were quickly whitewashed away. But the stains of
discord in Paine (pronounced PIE-nay), a town otherwise graced by
pleasant single-story houses hidden behind thick hedges and sprigs
of purple bougainvillea, have barely faded over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and sisters of the disappeared speak of the humiliation
they suffer during chance encounters at the corner store with
former soldiers and paramilitaries who took part in the very raids
that took away their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters and mother of one disappeared man speak bitterly of
his widow, who has switched sides and joined a right-wing party
that promotes Pinochet's ideals as part of her own peculiar journey
to find peace of mind. One settlement of farmers that was raided by
soldiers and paramilitaries 25 years ago is known to this day as
``the country road of the widows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same as I did the day we lost our loved ones,''
said Silvia Munoz, 60, the sister of four men who disappeared.
``Pinochet's wife should suffer just as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Paine's turmoil began in the late 1960s, when landless farmers
began to squat on lands left unused by neighboring ranchers. The
land invasions increased when Allende came to power in 1970, and
socialist activists helped the peasants in organizing cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   Then Pinochet staged his coup in September 1973, and the
cooperative movement came to a violent halt. Over the next three
months, police and army troops accompanied by civilian
paramilitaries seized more than 70 squatters and other activists
from their homes and the street. The prisoners were taken to
detention centers, and never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lands were returned to the former landowners, while
survivors of the disappeared were given legal titles to others. And
over the next two decades, as the country grew economically and the
violence subsided, Paine went through another transformation. The
sprawling cattle ranches were converted to more profitable fruit
fields, and a growing middle class in Santiago, 25 miles to the
north, bought land here to build weekend homes.
</P>
<P>
   A patina of stability and concord replaced the political
violence as the town grew rapidly to its current population of
37,000. Today, there is a right-wing mayor. The city council, which
is elected by the town at large, includes representatives of the
Socialist Party and the two right-wing parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened, but it's a blur,'' said Christian Miller,
15, a student at a local military school. He said that his parents,
who own a local restaurant, rarely discussed politics but that he
had concluded ``all those deaths favored the country in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Florinda Millan, the 47-year-old town administrator, said, ``The
memories are painful and disagreeable, so most people try to keep
the door to their memories closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pinochet's arrest set that door ajar.
</P>
<P>
   A right-wing party has put a poster of Pinochet in uniform on
the window of its storefront headquarters, where signatures were
being collected this week on a petition demanding that Britain
refuse to extradite him to Spain and set him free. And students at
local schools, following the example of a previous generation, are
painting walls at night with phrases from Allende's last radio
address, spoken as the air force was strafing the presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
   Eight women related to men who disappeared in the violence 25
years ago gathered Wednesday, as they do every week, to decorate
pottery, which they sell to help support themselves. They share
tearful memories and small talk about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But eight women stopped attending the meetings two weeks ago
because, Patricia Vargas, president of the group, said, they are
afraid of possible attacks from their right-wing neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Their absence, she said, is a reminder of the fear that most
Chileans wish to view as something of a time gone by. Fearful
herself, she said she had prohibited her son from joining other
students who were painting the town's walls with leftist graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live among the right, and they all know us,'' said Ms.
Vargas, the sister of a man who disappeared the day after the
Pinochet coup. A man whom she identified as one of the policemen
who picked up her brother ``passes by my house all the time and he
laughs,'' she said, adding ``I cannot begin to forgive until
Pinochet is forced to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   While most people in Paine say they would like to forget the
political turmoil of the 1970s and '80s, activists of the right and
the left here say Chile cannot experience a true reconciliation
until ``the truth'' is told. The problem is that historical truth
is still a polarized commodity in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be impossible to have peace until everyone recognizes
why Pinochet had to take power,'' said Luzoro, 60, the former
leader of the truckers' strike, who is perhaps the most hated man
in town among those whose relatives disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Allende had held power there would have been a civil war
and maybe a million people would have died,'' he said. ``We thought
everything was forgotten until the general's arrest. Then the
rumors began, then came the graffiti on the walls, and what comes
next who knows.''

POLITICAL NOTES: THURMOND, MOORE, MOSLEY-BRAUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Miss., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMOND ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE, JUST YET
</P>
<P>
   At 95, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is not only the oldest
person ever to serve in Congress, but he also holds the record for
serving longest in the Senate: 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   The drawling Republican conservative says he is in good health
and expects to live to be 110. But it's best not to overdo the
legislator thing, he adds. And so, God willing, as he puts it, he
plans to retire when his term ends in January 2003. At that point
he will have just turned 100.
</P>
<P>
   Some think he should depart sooner. They say he has had his run
and should make room for a fresh face. And they are not all
Democrats. There are some fellow Republicans and conservatives
among them, allies whose aim is not so much to get rid of Thurmond
as to lay the groundwork for a stronger Republican hold on the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   They reason that if the senator were to resign now, Gov. David
Beasley, a Republican, would be able to appoint his interim
successor and that successor would, of course, be a Republican.
Then, the reasoning goes, the appointed successor _ the name most
mentioned is former Gov. Carroll Campbell _ would have a leg up
come the contest to fill the Thurmond seat permanently.
</P>
<P>
   It is a political scheme that seems to fail about as often as it
succeeds. But in any event, if it is to happen in Thurmond's case,
he will have to act quickly. In January, South Carolina will
inaugurate a newly elected governor, Jim Hodges, a Democrat. If
Thurmond should die in office after Hodges becomes governor, Hodges
would appoint the interim successor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those pressing the senator to resign are doing so
indirectly, suggesting to other Republicans and to reporters, but
not directly to him, that resignation now might help the party. But
this week, two leading voices of conservatism, the National Review
and The Wall Street Journal, publicly called on him to leave early.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who says he still does 45 minutes of calisthenics
every day, is sticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell anybody who asks,'' he said a few days ago, ``that I
expect to serve my full term.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE SPOTLIGHT AHEAD FOR THIS MISSISSIPPIAN
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moore, Mississippi's attorney general since 1988, has never
been short on political ambition, a yen to be in the limelight or
an aggressive willingness to use his office to promote and defend
the interests of his state.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Flashbulb Moore'' by both friends and
detractors, he first made national headlines four years ago when he
took the nation's major tobacco companies to court to recover
government money that had been spent treating Mississippians with
tobacco-related illnesses. That was the first tobacco damages suit
filed in the country, one that greatly pleased consumer groups and
greatly irked business groups.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in 1997, the companies agreed to pay the state a
whopping $3.36 billion over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since Moore filed suit, most other states also have taken the
companies to court and have frequently sought his legal advice. He
also has been deeply involved in the thus-far unsuccessful effort
to work out a congressional settlement of the tobacco issue.
</P>
<P>
   When you're hot, you're hot. Moore, a Democrat, says that
``after prayerful consideration,'' he has decided to run for
governor next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Kirk Fordice, a Republican, cannot seek a third term under
Mississippi law. So the 1999 race will be wide open and is expected
to draw half a dozen or more contenders for the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   One possible Democratic entrant, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, is
already firing away at Moore. He says there ought to be a law
against ``frivolous'' damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   MOSELEY-BRAUN READY FOR LIFE AFTER POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   Carol Moseley-Braun, who in 1992 became the first black woman to
win a seat in the U.S. Senate, says she is through with politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, a 51-year-old Democrat from Illinois who has
held public offices for some 20 years, was soundly beaten in last
week's election by her Republican challenger, Peter Fitzgerald, and
she is not thinking comeback.
</P>
<P>
   She told The Chicago Tribune the other day that the campaign, in
which she was heavily outspent and hammered hard as politically
inept, had left her physically exhausted. Further, she said that
after six years on Capitol Hill she was weary of being treated like
some kind of political symbol, as she put it, rather than like just
another first-term senator.
</P>
<P>
   So after a bit of rest, might she consider running again for
public office?
</P>
<P>
   ``Read my lips,'' she replied. ``Not. Never. Nein. Nyet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what would she do next?
</P>
<P>
   Tend her tulips and ponder a job in the private sector, she
said.

GOVERNING PARTY'S ECONOMIC PLAN IS GREETED WITH SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The governing Liberal Democratic Party released a draft
plan Thursday to bolster the economy, but the financial markets
greeted it skeptically and analysts described it as a hodgepodge of
measures that would have little effect.
</P>
<P>
   This new stimulus package could end up being worth $150 billion,
surpassing the last stimulus plan, which was itself a record. But
no official figure was disclosed Thursday, and in any case its size
and implementation will depend on political developments.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, which is expected to be formally endorsed by the
government Monday, aims to create one million jobs and to stimulate
consumer spending with less expensive housing loans, about $57
billion in long-term tax cuts and the distribution of $5.7 billion
in merchandise coupons. One proposal, a rollback of last year's
increase in the consumption tax, was not mentioned in Thursday's
outline.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's draft plan is clouded by uncertainty and could still
be redrawn, depending on a process of courtship underway among
Japan's political parties and factions. After a stinging election
defeat over the summer, the Liberal Democrats have been struggling
to maintain the upper hand, and have been forced to take up
measures demanded by opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Thursday's plan includes a shopping voucher program,
a demand from the small Komei Party.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Liberal Democrats have also entered intense
discussions to form a possible coalition with the Liberal Party, an
opposition group run by Ichiro Ozawa, who stormed out of the
Liberal Democratic Party in 1993, offending key members.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Ozawa plans to meet Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who
returns from a trip to Russia that day, and if an agreement is
struck, then Thursday's economic draft plan would be rewritten to
include some form of rollback in the controversial consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we reach agreement on a coalition, then today's package
means nothing,'' said Yoshio Suzuki, policy planning chairman for
the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party has called for a complete repeal of the five
percent consumption tax for at least one year, after which the tax
would be gradually stepped up again as permanent income-tax cuts
are phased in. But some senior Liberal Democrats have resisted such
a step, partly because it would be a big embarrassment for the
party, which sent the economy into recession by raising the tax to
five percent from three percent in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All this political jockeying has produced a package that
economists say may prevent the bottom from falling out from under
the economy, but that they also doubt will do much to nurture a
genuine recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable how the package came together, for it
seems a patchwork quilt that parlays to different interests,'' said
Christopher J. Calderwood, chief economist at Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd., in Tokyo. ``It lacks coherence or a theme, other
than keeping things the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some elements of the plan that are likely to
remain even if a coalition among the parties is reached. In one
notable move, the plan suggested that the government will take on a
greater role as banker to alleviate the liquidity shortage that is
afflicting cash-strapped companies across the country. Though the
Parliament recently enacted two sets of banking laws aimed at
easing the credit squeeze, new private lending by the weakly
capitalized banks is unlikely to flow into the economy in large
amounts any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Liberal Democrat's plan, the government would issue
tens of billions in credit guarantees to help midsize firms take
out loans. Moreover, in a two-year program, it plans to also make
available as much as $40 billion in taxpayer's postal savings
deposits to the Japan Development Bank, which would extend the
funds to corporate borrowers who need to repay bonds and have been
turned away by their bankers.

 &HT;    Facing graft trial, Edwards' defense is wisecracks
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ So how is former Gov. Edwin Edwards, 71,
going to prepare for his third racketeering trial?
</P>
<P>
   ``By getting pregnant,'' he said Thursday outside the federal
courthouse here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying,'' his wife, Candy, 34, confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's arraignment, Edwards, his son Stephen and four
other defendants, including a state senator, entered pleas of ``not
guilty'' to the 34-count indictment handed down a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses Edwards of orchestrating a wide-ranging
``corrupt enterprise'' set up to illegally influence the riverboat
gambling industry during and after his last two terms as governor.
He is accused of steering licenses toward his friends and
associates and extorting millions in payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a four-time governor and one of the most colorful
politicians in a state known for colorful politicians, seemed
confident and at ease, joking around with his wife and reporters.
He told reporters after the hearing that he and Candy are trying to
have a baby, which would be their first together. Edwards has four
children from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Edwards pleaded not guilty and then sat down
beside his wife to watch his co-defendants enter pleas. As Stephen
Edwards emphatically said ``not guilty'' to U.S. Magistrate Court
Judge Christine Noland's list of charges against him, his father
quipped, ``You think he's made up his mind?''
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving the hearing he said, ``I wanted to plead not
guilty to more charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Quips are about all Edwards can offer as public comment these
days. U.S. District Court Judge Frank Polozola, who will try the
case, issued a gag order this week intended to silence the six
defendants, their attorneys and all witnesses until there is a
verdict. The case is not expected to be tried for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who normally loves to talk to reporters and ignored gag
orders in his previous trial, appears to be taking this one
seriously. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   In the elevator with a pack of reporters, he said, ``I repeat,
whatever I said, it was no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time Edwards has gone to trial in a federal
court. He was tried twice in the 1980s, but was never convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to get on with this,'' he said. ``We're gonna have
fun _ oh, I can't comment!

 &HT;    Gingrich exit due by Jan. 5 at latest
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's decision to quit the House of
Representatives after 20 years has created opportunities for a new
generation of Republican congressional leaders. But the speaker's
pending departure also leaves a host of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When exactly will Gingrich leave Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: He has not made up his mind yet, spokeswoman Christina Martin
said Thursday. She added Gingrich has indicated that he will not
begin the two-year term to which he was elected last week. The term
begins Jan. 6 with the swearing-in of the 106th Congress,
suggesting that the latest Gingrich will leave is Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the 6th Congressional District be without a
representative for a period of time?
</P>
<P>
   A:The short answer is: probably. But, again, it depends on when
Gingrich relinquishes his seat. The governor will not call an
election to replace Gingrich until he has officially vacated the
seat, said Chris Riggall, spokesman for Georgia Secretary of State
Lewis Massey. The election may not be held for at least 30 days
after the governor acts, according to Georgia law. So unless
Gingrich were to step down today, it is unlikely there could be an
election before Christmas. And if the speaker does not leave
Congress before his term ends, there will be at least a month in
which the 6th District has no elected representative, Riggall said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who will pay for the election, and how much will it cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cherokee, Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties, the four
counties in which the district lies, will bear the cost of the
election, which Riggall estimates roughly at $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can Gingrich resign his seat and remain as speaker until the
new House of Representatives chooses his successor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. There is no requirement that the speaker be a member of
the House. Gingrich intends to serve as speaker until Jan. 6,
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will Gingrich earn a living?
</P>
<P>
   A: He will give up his annual salary of $178,000, but he is not
likely to have trouble putting food on the family table. Gingrich
has not yet said what he will do. Freed from House ethics rules
that prohibit members from pocketing fees for speeches, Gingrich
would be a natural candidate for the lucrative lecture circuit.
There also may be interest in a book about the sudden end of his
life in Congress. At the moment, however, he has no book contract.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will he receive a congressional pension?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but not right away and not as much as some of his
predecessors, according to Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers
Union. Gingrich will qualify for a $24,000 annual pension beginning
in 2005, when he turns 62, Sepp said. As with all congressional
pensions, it goes up with the cost of living. Gingrich arrived in
Congress in 1979 as a critic of what he saw as an extravagant
retirement system for members of Congress. But in 1989, Gingrich
changed his mind and joined the pension plan for reasons he has
never disclosed. Because he has been a part of the Federal Retirees
Employment System for only 10 years, he will qualify for a far
smaller pension benefit than 20 years of congressional service
otherwise would provide, Sepp said. ``He shorted himself badly by
doing that,'' Sepp added. Other former House speakers have received
far higher benefits, he noted, pointing out that Democrat Tom Foley
of Washington started out with a pension of $120,000 a year, and
Democrat Jim Wright of Texas with $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is he entitled to other benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ex-speakers receive an expense allowance for up to five years
after they leave Congress. Gingrich also can continue to use the
franking, or free-mail, privilege extended to all members of
Congress. In 1997, for example, taxpayers spent $169,495 on Foley,
$189,252 on Wright and $140,256 on former Speaker Carl Albert of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the speaker still have to pay his ethics penalty?
</P>
<P>
   A: Martin said Gingrich will pay the $200,000 that remains from
the $300,000 sanction imposed by the House last year. The next
$50,000 is due Nov. 30 and the $150,000 balance on Jan. 2. The
payment schedule was structured so that Gingrich would close the
books on his punishment by the end of the 105th Congress. He has
pledged to come up with the money from personal funds and already
has told Bob Dole that he would not need the loan Dole offered last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does he have campaign funds left? Can he convert those to
personal use?
</P>
<P>
   A: The speaker had $555,000 in his congressional campaign
account as of mid-October and another $38,000 in a political action
committee he controls. Federal election law no longer allows
retiring politicians to convert campaign funds to personal use. But
Gingrich has several options, said Ian Stirton, spokesman for the
Federal Election Commission. They include giving the money without
limits to charity or to Republican party organizations (or
Democratic ones, if he so chooses). He can make limited donations,
as set by federal law, to individual candidates or political action
committees. Or he can hold onto the money and use it for a future
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will there be a future campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The venue changes and the cause goes on,'' Gingrich
concluded his speech Monday night. What those words mean precisely,
of course, is anyone's guess. Gingrich said Saturday on his return
to Washington that he does not intend to be a candidate for
president in 2000, but he certainly could find sufficient room to
wriggle free of that statement if he so chose. Ronald Reagan was 69
when he took office. By that standard, Gingrich, now 55, has until
the 2012 campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will become of T. rex?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nature already has taken care of that. But seriously,
Gingrich, a lover of dinosaurs, might like to take the giant skull
that has sat in his suite of offices for the past four years with
him. But it is on loan from the American Museum of Natural History.
Its future resting place is unknown.

 &HT;    Intel exec's testimony attacked
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft Corp. antitrust lawyer sought Thursday
to portray a crucial government witness as a liar and a corporate
renegade who was secretly in league with the software giant's
archrival in the Internet browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic exchanges of the month-old landmark
Microsoft antitrust trial, attorney Steven Holley depicted Intel
Corp. Vice President Steven McGeady as being branded a ``prima
donna'' by his bosses, who shipped him off to academia in 1996
after his pet software project was scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called worse,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   But under a fierce grilling, McGeady stuck to his basic account:
Microsoft had bullied Intel into abandoning its software efforts by
threatening to withhold support in its Windows operating system for
the next generation of Intel microprocessors _ projects in which
the company had invested billions.
</P>
<P>
   Holley also put into evidence a 1995 e-mail exchange between
McGeady and Netscape Communications Corp. co-founder Jim Clark,
seeking to show McGeady had sent Microsoft's trade secrets to its
foe. The lawyer suggested McGeady, a sailor, turned down an
invitation last July from Clark for a cruise on Clark's $50 million
yacht because it might appear they were conspiring against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Holley's efforts to discredit McGeady became so vehement that
the judge cautioned him after he showed the witness an e-mail to
Clark in which the witness referred to Intel's chief executive
officer as ``Andy `Mad Dog' Grove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the point of this?'' U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson demanded. ``What are you trying to demonstrate?
Are you just trying to embarrass him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, your honor,'' Holley replied, ``although that might be the
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Holley presented the court with notes of a 1995 meeting between
McGeady and his boss, in which McGeady wrote of the demise of
McGeady's 700-person software lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screw-up was one of marketing and strategy, not one of
technology,'' McGeady responded. ``While the language may seem
harsh, it's more common than you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, McGeady had testified Microsoft executive Paul Maritz
had told him at a 1995 meeting that his company's goal was to
``embrace, extend and extinguish'' Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Holley showed McGeady his handwritten notes of that meeting _
notes in which McGeady wrote the words: ``embrace/extend/ change
the nature of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see the word `extinguish' anywhere in your notes, do
you?'' Holley snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no danger I would have forgotten,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't need to add it to your notes because you made them
up later, isn't that true?'' Holley thundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely untrue, and I resent the implication,''
McGeady said evenly.
</P>
<P>
   What weight to put on McGeady's testimony has emerged as a key
element in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Was McGeady, as the Microsoft lawyer claimed, merely a rogue
figure who had testified out of spite because his promising career
at Intel had been sidetracked?
</P>
<P>
   Or was McGeady, as the trustbusters contended, testifying
truthfully, with plenty of backup documents, about how Microsoft
had successfully used its Windows monopoly over the operating
system to block Intel from becoming a software competitor?
</P>
<P>
   After four rounds of pingpong between the opposing counsels had
concluded, the judge posed the question directly to McGeady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that your testimony here has your company's
blessing?'' Jackson asked.
</P>
<P>
   ```Blessing' could be a strong word,'' McGeady replied. ``Intel
is a large corporation with many opinions. My appearance here
creates a problem, your honor, only in the most fundamental sense
in that Microsoft is one of our very best customers.

 &HT;    Agent on lookout for Rudolph brushed by bullet
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ The army of federal agents searching for Eric
Robert Rudolph has been a routine presence in this mountain
community since the bombing suspect was last seen in nearby Murphy
on Jan. 30, so residents Thursday struggled to explain why someone
decided to fire several shots into the agents' local headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that it happened,'' Mayor Jim Dailey said of the
Wednesday night shooting. ``It makes us look bad. But the vast
majority of people here know these guys and ladies are just here
doing their job. They are good, good people just trying to do a
difficult job.''
</P>
<P>
   One agent was brushed by a bullet about 8 p.m. when shots were
fired from a passing vehicle into the Southeast Bomb Task Force
Command Center, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The round entered through a metal wall, grazed the head of an
agent standing in an office and barely missed another officer. The
command post is in a large metal building that until two years ago
housed a textile manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in a position to tell you why last night's incident
occurred or who might be involved,'' said Terry Turchie, an FBI
official helping direct the task force. ``We have developed no
information to connect Eric Rudolph with the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents have searched the rugged mountain area where the 33-year
old carpenter and former soldier grew up since the day after his
truck was spotted near a Birmingham abortion clinic Jan. 29, the
day a bomb exploded killing a moonlighting police officer and
seriously injuring a nurse. Rudolph was named a suspect in that
bombing Feb. 14, and last month was named a suspect in three
Atlanta bombings, including the one in Centennial Olympic Park
during the 1996 Games that killed one person and injured more than
100 others.
</P>
<P>
   A resident who lives along the road where agents found at least
eight shell casings said she saw the shots being fired from a car.
She could not identify the make or color of the vehicle in the
dark, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little ol' car came up the road slow, and then I heard three
gun shots,'' Barbara McClure said. ``It then sped up real fast, so
fast I thought they were going to turn over when they turned up the
(other) road.''
</P>
<P>
   The shots were fired across a large grassy field and traveled
about 300 yards before at least one shot struck the building,
authorities said. Neighbors said the shots sounded like a
high-powered rifle, but agents did not reveal the type of firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Two residents of an apartment complex adjacent to the command
center said they heard ``five or six'' shots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, additional agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms continued to stream into Andrews this
week as the task force redoubled its search of the surrounding
mountains, where investigators believe Rudolph is hiding.
Authorities think their chances of locating Rudolph are getting
better as the leaves fall from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   As few as 75 and as many as 200 agents have been involved in the
manhunt over the past nine months. Total manpower for the new push
probably will peak between 150 and 200, a task force spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrews, N.C., is known as the little town with the big
heart,'' Turchie said. ``That slogan is representative of the
people of the community, not last night's shooting incident. It is
with that spirit that members of the task force have been accepted
by this community, and it is through that spirit (that) we will
find Eric Rudolph and whoever is responsible for last night's
shooting incident.

 &HT;    Why stop at Bach? State hopes music makes baby smarter
 &HT;    By Charmagne Helton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nineteen-year old Kiona Capers would rather listen to
hip-hop or gospel music than to Mozart, Bach, or Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   But when she gave birth to her son Eric at Crawford Long
Hospital three months ago, a classical music CD was sent home with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it's to help develop the brain, to make him
smarter,'' she said. ``So I think that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a good thing,'' said Dr. Terri McFadden-Garden,
Director of Ambulatory Pediatrics at Grady Hospital. ``The studies
have been very clear. Any exposure a baby has to positive stimuli
definitely has a positive effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Capers is just one of thousands of mothers who have received
``Build Your Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music'' since the
tapes and CDs landed in hospitals across the state in July. The
recordings have 11 tracks by classical music composers Vivaldi,
Bach, Handel, Pachelbel, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   The give-aways are part of a yearlong initiative by Gov. Zell
Miller designed at improving how children think.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference Tuesday, Miller said he's expanding
the program to include a checklist of warning signs for parents
whose children may be deaf. Now when they leave the hospital, new
moms will get both the recordings and the checklist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CDs would not do any good for people who could not hear,''
Miller said. The checklist ``seemed to be the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   After Miller announced his plan in January, Sony Music
Entertainment agreed to produce the classical albums at no cost to
the state. It has distributed 110,000 to Georgia hospitals,
according to Robert Myers, the company's senior vice president of
operations. A governor's office spokesman said they are not
tracking how many copies have hospitals have distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has also created a new version of the CD. It added six
songs to the 11 original recordings, and is now selling that
version in stores around the nation. That CD, also called ``Build
You Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music,'' is ranked number two
on Billboard magazine's classical chart this week.
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``It's doing quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Capers said she doesn't know if any of that means her son will
be smarter, but she'll keep playing the CD occasionally anyway.
``Most of the time when I play it for the baby he calms down or
he'll fall asleep,'' she said. ``I can't stand the music, but he
seems to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   BABY'S BRAIN FOOD
</P>
<P>
   ``Build Your Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music!,'' which
is distributed to newborns free, contains these selections:
</P>
<P>
   ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' (A Little Night Music). Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fur Elise.'' Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrival of the Queen of Sheba'' from ``Solomon.'' Handel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rondo Alla Turca.'' Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintet for Piano and Strings,'' scherzo movement, from ``The
Trout Quintet.'' Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring,'' from ``The Four Seasons.'' Vivaldi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,'' from Cantata No. 147. Bach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canon in D.'' Pachelbel.

 &HT;    City improves housing status, new study says
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least three predominantly black Atlanta
neighborhoods have seen dramatic housing improvements, but the
city's management has caused delays in projects, resulting in some
losses of funds and fines that hurt black Atlantans in the
pocketbook, a new study released Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said community development corporations have helped
revitalize the communities by building and renovating more than 400
affordable and low-income housing units. Neighborhoods benefiting
from such efforts include Summerhill, Vine City and Reynoldstown,
said the annual report on the status of black people in Atlanta,
done by Clark Atlanta University's Southern Center for Studies in
Public Policy. The report looked at politics, women's issues,
minority manufacturers and housing in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with housing, the study suggested that black
manufacturing companies, which constitute 10 percent of the city's
manufacturers, may be key in jump-starting Atlanta's poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is work to be done, according to the study. In a
survey of issues important to women, 59 black women and select
women identified as leaders listed race and education as the two
most important factors in determining how they are viewed by
society, followed by income, gender and profession. The same group
identified crime and drugs as the two issues that most concern
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of this report is to point out problems that
exist,'' said Bob Holmes, director of the center and author of the
study. ``Atlanta is a poor city with many problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The report contended that the ``new'' Mayor Bill Campbell, who
was supposed to rise out of the bitter 1997 election to create
unity and cooperation between the mayor's office and the City
Council, has yet to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who teaches political science and is a state
representative, wrote that Campbell's combative style in dealing
with the council over the budget and water privatization; what
Holmes viewed as the mayor's refusal to explain the departures of
Aviation Commissioner Angela Gittens and Public Works Commissioner
Jarvis Middleton; and Campbell's alleged failure to acknowledge the
budget deficit until August 1998 are indications that nothing has
changed during the mayor's second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Mayor Campbell spoke about unity, cooperation, and
reaching out to the council and suburban elected officials in his
inauguration speech, there is little indication of a change in his
political style,'' Holmes wrote. ``His promises to make specific
appointments to his Cabinet and commission to help improve
management of city government now seem like hollow political
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Jabari Simama, a city spokesman, said Holmes'
``pseudo-intellectual attacks'' on Campbell are nothing new, are
unfair and do little to benefit the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is unfortunate that Mr. Holmes is carrying on a
vendetta he has had against the mayor for some time,'' Simama said.
``The mayor has moved beyond it, but Mr. Holmes continues to take
cheap shots at him.

 &HT;    Harsh approach toward crime criticized in report
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The get-tough-on-crime approach that was one of the
themes of this month's elections removes judges' sentencing
discretion, jams trial courts and forces states to build more
prisons while having virtually no effect on increasing public
safety, a group of law enforcement professionals said in a report
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't see what the cost will be over time, but our
children and our grandchildren will have a pretty big bill,'' said
Walter Dickey, special counsel to the Campaign for an Effective
Crime Policy said in an interview to discuss the report. The
nonpartisian Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy includes heads
of state prisons, wardens and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they think they're getting public safety in return,
they're not. It has some effect, but the effect is so slight, it's
not worth the cost,'' said Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Attorney General Mike Bowers said the sentencing
approach is clearly effective because people in prison cannot
commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Coweta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Pete Skandalakis,
president of the District Attorneys Association of Georgia, said
district attorneys and judges would rather have discretion but many
state prosecutors supported the mandatory minumum sentences because
``they were discouraged by the lenient sentences given by some
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Circuit Chief Judge Hal Craig sees many of the tougher
cases because his circuit of Henry, Lamar and Butts counties covers
two state prisons, including the state prison at Jackson, Ga.,
where ``Death Row'' is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is the Legislature's will and its lawful, we follow
it,'' said Craig, whose court is the first stop for death penalty
appeals. ``But sometimes, you have situations where you really
wonder if the Legislature, in a particular case, wanted them to do
the time. We'd be better off leaving a little discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 states that have tougher sentencing approaches _
generally known as the two-strikes or three-strikes laws _ only
Georgia and California have substantially enforced their
initiatives, said Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a political statement,'' said Dickey, adding that
every state, including Georgia, had mandatory sentencing provisions
before the two- and three-strike laws were enacted. ``The presence
of the law is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said 18 states with such laws have none or only had a
handful of prisoners sentenced under the popular laws that use
baseball term to describe them. Georgia has almost 2,000 inmates
serving mandatory-minimum sentences on a first conviction or life
without parole on a second for the seven most violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia law, enacted Jan. 1, 1995, demands at least 10 years
without parole for the first conviction of rape, armed robbery,
kidnapping, aggravated sodomy, aggravated child molestation or
aggravated sexual assault. A second conviction for any of those six
crimes or for murder _ known collectively as ``the seven deadly
sins'' _ calls for life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said the nationwide consequences have been crowded
prisons and court dockets. In Georgia, some judges and prosecutors
are accepting negotiated guilty pleas for one of the seven deadly
sins but ignoring the sentencing requirements, according to state
records.
</P>
<P>
   The prison overcrowding problem is fast becoming apparent in
Georgia, where Department of Corrections officials have erected
tents as cellblocks and moved bunks into common areas or put three
inmates in cells designed for two. Nearly 4,000 sentenced inmates
are in less-secure county jails because there is no room in a state
system with a record 38,000 convicts.
</P>
<P>
   For the next fiscal year, the DOC is seeking a budget of about
$1 billion, up 25 percent from its current allocation. And on
Thursday, a state agency that handled federal law enforcement
grants awarded DOC $18.2 million toward prison construction.
</P>
<P>
   The average daily cost to house, feed and clothe an inmate in
the Georgia prison system ranges from $26 at a low-security boot
camp to $78 for an inmate awaiting execution and up to $120 for one
in a prison hospital.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have predicted Georgia needs to immediately
build nearly 14,000 prison beds to handle because of the tougher
sentencing requirements. Corrections Commissioner Wayne Garner
wants to add 4,500 to the 1,800-inmate prison at Jackson. The State
Board of Pardons and Paroles and the governor's budget office put
the state need at 14,000. In some cases, Dickey said, prosecutors
use their respective two-strikes and three-strikes laws as a
``bat'' in plea negotiations. But many times, accused criminals are
taking their chances with a jury rather than pleading guilty to a
crime that carries a mandatory prison sentence and no chance of
parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better off with more (sentencing) discretion'' for
judges, Dickey said.

AD FOR JEWISH HOUSING IN JERUSALEM SAID TO BE POORLY TIMED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel Thursday took the first step toward
construction of a controversial housing project in Jerusalem by
advertising in a local Hebrew newspaper for bids for more than
1,000 homes at Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, placed by the Israel Land Authority and the
Housing Ministry, came only a day after Israel's Cabinet narrowly
passed the new U.S.-brokered Middle East peace deal in which Israel
will transfer West Bank land to the Palestinians in return for
specific security measures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to build on the tree-lined hilltop in southern
Jerusalem, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim, plunged the peace
process into deep freeze nearly 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The process was only revived by the land-for-security deal
negotiated at the Wye River conference center in Maryland last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the decision
to offer tenders to build at the site, while Palestinians condemned
the move _ and its timing _ as a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is not building there,'' said Netanyahu's media
adviser, David Bar-Illan. ``The government is just permitting _ or
issuing the necessary permits, I should say _ for building there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Private contractors will make bids on the various pieces of
land and try to sell them to various people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Hebrew Haaretz published the first of several expected
advertisements Thursday, inviting contractors to bid on building an
initial 1,025 homes at the site. Netanyahu has said he hopes to
build a total of 6,000 homes for Jews on the hilltop by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say the planned construction, which they call a new
settlement, is meant to foil their aspirations to make east
Jerusalem the capital of an independent Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza by surrounding the eastern half of the city with
Jewish neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, Israel has built eight large Jewish neighborhoods in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which Palestinians say make a
ring around the city that is meant to separate it from the rest of
the West Bank and solidify Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the reason for the destruction of the peace
process,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``It will make
meaningless any talk of permanent status negotiations and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Interim peace accords call on Israelis and Palestinians to reach
a permanent peace deal by May 1999, that will include agreement on
the sensitive issues of Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees,
water, final borders, Palestinian demands for statehood and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants the city, the eastern half of which was captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, to remain its undivided
``eternal'' capital.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians want the eastern side, home to 180,000
Palestinians, to become their future capital.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the advertisement _ only a day after Israel
attached strings to its ratification of the Wye accords _ may make
the decision to build at the controversial site that much harder
for Palestinians to accept, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Cabinet limited to 1 percent of West Bank
territory a final interim land transfer to the Palestinians, even
though the Wye accords created a joint committee to negotiate the
amount.
</P>
<P>
   It also called on Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to
reconvene the Palestine National Council to vote to annul clauses
of its charter that Israel interprets as a call for its
destruction. The Wye accords stipulate only that the smaller
Palestine Executive Committee ``reaffirm'' an earlier decision
taken by the full council to remove the offending clauses.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the advertisements also prompted allegations that
Netanyahu felt pressure to make concessions to right-wing members
of his fragile coalition, most of whom either abstained or voted
against the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of 17 Cabinet ministers voted to pass the accord. Several
staunch Netanyahu supporters from Israel's settlement movement said
they would back another right-wing candidate if new elections were
held. Thousands of angry settlers and their supporters demonstrated
Wednesday in Tel Aviv as Cabinet ministers voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publishing of tenders at Har Homa at this sensitive
juncture is bad timing,'' Ehud Barak, leader of the opposition
Labor Party, told Israel's Army Radio. ``It looks more like
political compensation for the people in (Netanyahu's) government
who oppose the deal than a wise, well-timed step.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel said the timing had nothing to do with the Wye accord or
the Cabinet vote. It said the tenders had to be offered now in
order to meet the goal of building by 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As the United States continued to build up its
forces for a possible attack on Iraq, an eerie silence on the
diplomatic front has made this crisis different from previous
confrontations with Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there were no last-minute efforts to mediate with the
Iraqis, no high-level Russian or French envoys rushing to Baghdad
and no plans for Secretary General Kofi Annan to intervene, as he
did in February when the United States last threatened to attack.
Annan, who returned Thursday afternoon from an aborted trip to
North Africa, will not meet the Security Council until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arab nations, which in the past have condemned threats of
U.S. military action, told Saddam Thursday that he could not count
on their support in a confrontation. Egypt, Syria and six Persian
Gulf countries warned that Iraq alone would take the blame for the
consequences of defying the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to allow arms inspections to resume, the Arab nations
said, ``will expose the Iraqi people to more misery.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration welcomed the warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Saddam is hearing now are the sounds of silence,'' James
Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in an interview. ``No
one is standing up to defend him, to argue on his behalf or to help
him out of the hole he's dug himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for U.S. military action continued Thursday, as
dozens more jet fighters and heavy bombers headed toward the Gulf,
and administration officials began rallying support in Congress for
an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Both Annan and Iraq's backers on the Security Council, including
Russia and France, are not trying diplomacy now because Saddam has
broken past agreements with them. Diplomats here, as well as
officials in Russia and France, have been angered and frustrated by
Saddam's latest moves to stop all cooperation with weapons
inspectors and Iraq's repeated demands that economic sanctions be
lifted before Baghdad has met all Security Council requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis clearly want Annan to intervene again, and they have
been pressing behind the scenes for talks with him. But the
Secretary General has seen the February agreement he concluded with
Iraq, at some political risk to himself, defied almost since its
signing and broadly violated in decisions on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31
that curtailed and then ended cooperation with arms inspections.
Diplomats say that Annan seems very reluctant to get involved
again.
</P>
<P>
   France and Russia, for their part, have repeatedly argued that
the sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 were
causing too much suffering, and that Iraq needed to be offered
incentives so that it would cooperate. French and Russian diplomats
successfully pushed the United Nations to offer a full review of
the sanctions. But Iraq made pre-emptive demands about how that
review should be conducted and what it should conclude. When the
Security Council agreed to the review on Oct. 30, but did not
promise a lifting of the oil embargo or other sanctions on Iraq,
Saddam shut down the inspections the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Under Security Council resolutions, sanctions on Iraq cannot be
lifted until the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, can
certify that Iraq no longer has the ability to make biological or
chemical weapons and nondefensive missiles which are prohibited.
The International Atomic Energy Agency. which must produce the same
findings on nuclear weapons, has already reported that it has found
no evidence of nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   Many Security Council members and several Arab nations still
oppose military action, but there are none willing to defend Iraq's
defiance of the United Nations, which appears self-destructive to
most diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States has not forced a divisive debate on
military action at the Security Council because Washington has not
sought new Security Council authority to wage war on Iraq, and
Iraq's former backers have not demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow Thursday, officials appeared resigned to U.S. attacks
on Iraq and too preoccupied with Russia's economic problems to
focus much attention on the crisis. Russian officials tell
reporters that time and again over the last decade, Yevgeny
Primakov, now prime minister, has gone the extra mile for Saddam,
only to have his advice rejected.
</P>
<P>
   They say that they know they can't sell Iraq's current
obstructionist position to anyone. Russia is expected to condemn
U.S. use of force if and when strikes occur, but like Russian
statements here in the Security Council opposing the use of force,
condemnations will amount to registering dissent on principle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a news conference in Baghdad Thursday, Iraq Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz delivered a defensive but defiant 11th-hour
message on behalf of Saddam. Aziz repeated Iraq's assertion that it
had no more prohibited weapons and was entitled to a lifting of
sanctions. He called the U.N. Special Commission, whose inspectors
have now left Iraq, ``a subsidiary of the CIA and Mossad,'' the
Israeli intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no peaceful solution to this situation unless
the United States agrees to the principle of lifting sanctions,''
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the Arab warning as misdirected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are sincere in dealing with this situation, if they
are sincere in dealing with the truth, they should criticize the
United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz brushed aside questions about Iraq's notable lack of
support in this crisis from its erstwhile friends, particularly
Russia and France, by charging that while they still supported Iraq
they were unwilling to buck the power of the United States. It was
as close as Aziz came to admitting that Iraq was friendless this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   When Annan returned to New York Thursday, he said that while the
Iraqis are always willing to talk with him, he had ``no plans to go
to Baghdad at the moment.'' He said that he had to talk with the
Security Council before making any moves.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz may have made Annan's task more difficult Thursday by
saying that while the secretary general had the moral
responsibility to get involved, he should come with ``guarantees''
for the Iraqis that sanctions would be lifted. ``Then we would
cooperate with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Iraq resumes cooperation with inspectors, sanctions will
remain in place. The Security Council is united on that issue,
although there are differences over when to conclude that there is
nothing more to be learned.

   RAMAT GAN, Israel _ They weren't battering down the doors on
Thursday at the gas-mask distribution center in this quiet suburb
of Tel Aviv, but a steady stream of people came by just the same,
to be on the safe side.
</P>
<P>
   Ramat Gan was hit hard by some of the 39 Iraqi missiles fired at
Israel during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, and as the latest
crisis with Iraq seemed to move toward new hostilities, there was
an undercurrent of concern here even as people went about their
routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything's going to happen, but even if the
chances are slim I don't want to be caught unprepared,'' said Avi
Aspir, a computer specialist who stopped by to pick up a mask
during a free moment at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned, but I'm not going nuts about it,'' said Natalie
Barkan, who arrived with her 5-year-old son to fit him with a gas
mask. ``I should be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The word from Israeli officials on Thursday was that the chances
of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel were very slim. Israel is not
a party to the standoff with Saddam Hussein, they said, and the
Iraqi leader is unlikely to risk Israeli retaliation or disclosure
of chemical or biological weapons he may have by firing them here.
</P>
<P>
   Only ``if Saddam is pushed to the corner and there is a real
threat to his regime might he use unconventional weapons against
us,'' said a military official who did not want to be identified.
According to Israeli intelligence estimates, Iraq has 30 missiles
capable of reaching Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But most Israelis did not seem alarmed by that prospect on
Thursday. By nightfall, only 6,000 people were reported to have
come to the 65 gas-mask distribution centers that were opened
across the country. Many people stocked up on gas masks during
previous crises with Iraq, and there was a general sense that
Israel could safely weather this flare-up, as it had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   To head off jitters, and in apparent response to American
prodding not to say anything that could offend Arab allies of the
United States, Israeli officials are keeping a low profile,
avoiding threats of retaliation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are examining the situation and making all the necessary
preparations,'' was all Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had to
say in televised comments on Thursday night. ``We will certainly
not remain indifferent to the developments.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ivry, a senior aide to Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai,
briefed Israeli reporters with a message to the public, ``Update
your protective equipment if necessary, but continue normal life as
usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were other signals that were unsettling to Israelis:
The State Department allowed nonessential employees at the American
Embassy in Tel Aviv and at the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem to leave
with their families, and private American citizens were also
advised to consider leaving Israel. Similar measures were taken in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli health minister, Yehoshua Matza, held a meeting with
the army's chief medical officer to review preparedness for a
chemical or biological weapons attack, and to take stock of
supplies of antidotes. Israeli television reports said that if
necessary, the United States would supply Israel with equipment to
identify chemical agents, as well as batteries of Patriot missiles
to protect against an Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching the reports on television, and now they've
really scared me,'' said Rinat Sivan, who arrived to get a gas mask
for her 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sivan said she was in her apartment when the missiles fell
during the Gulf War. ``It's all coming back,'' she said. ``Then we
believed that missiles couldn't fall on Israel, and that our army's
strong enough. But after it happens once, you don't wait around for
the second time, so I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizi Yaacovian, who arrived with her husband and infant son,
recalled that before the Gulf War, Israeli officials had also
assured the public that the probability of an Iraqi missile attack
on Israel was extremely low.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell me `yes' or `no,' and even the U.N. inspectors
can't tell, because Saddam hides things,'' Mrs. Yaacovian said.
``He's a crazy person. So whether you believe what you hear or not,
you do what you have to do.''

FOX PUTS STOCK IN NEW FACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tuesday, the day Fox Sports News announced the
hiring of Keith Olbermann as its headlining act, Fox Entertainment
Group made its initial public offering and sold all of the 124.8
million shares it made available. News Corp made a reported $2.81
billion on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, when Fox officially declared ESPN's Chris Myers had
been lured over as well to do some anchor work and host the weekly
news magazine ``Goin' Deep,'' the stock moved up to $24 from the
$22.50 a share it was sold at in the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   As much as Olbermann would like to take credit, Dow and Jones
themselves would tell you that's one of them unexplained Wall
Street occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the market's reaction to future Fox trading is anything
like Olbermann's Doberman-like moon swings, strap yourself in and
enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, the former (fill-in-the-network and/or L.A.
affiliate) sports/news anchor will relocate next month for
enlistment in FSN's kamikaze squad. It's an exciting, potentially
high-yield risk both Olbermann and Fox are willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   For Olbermann, he's set free from the oblivion of
minor-cable-news-show host shackles he thought was best for him and
his career at MSNBC just more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Fox Sports News, it finally gets (with all due respect to
Van Earl Wright) a high-profile anchor with a huge following and an
equally huge bit of publicity for a show that, frankly, no one
watches for anything more than to check out Randy Sparage's latest
land-mass acquisition or the latest Brad Goode/Lauren Sanchez
contribution to ``Sportscasters' Greatest Bloopers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Year 3, FSNews' bright lights and flashy decor try to dazzle
viewers, but it continues to be as compelling as nude pictures of
Dr. Laura Schlessinger on the Internet, as informative as John
Saunders and Todd Blackledge droning on during the college halftime
report, as dimensional as an Etch-A-Sketch.
</P>
<P>
   From a numbers standpoint that both ESPN and Fox love to fire at
each other, the fact is, the established ``SportsCenter'' reaches
75 percent of the TV homes; Fox cable programming is closer to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``SportsCenter'' ratings have been boosted lately because of NFL
game lead-ins; Fox's show ratings have been sluggish lately
because, for one reason, there's no NBA game lead-ins.
</P>
<P>
   So Olbermann's hiring is the nitro Fox needs as it tries to
throw more money at its problem _ an extra $2 million ad campaign
to raise Fox Sports News attitude awareness started last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, in particular FSNet chief Arthur Smith, is even more
convinced this is the right time to reel in Olbermann rather than
having him come straight over from ESPN, where he spent the best of
his 5{ years with Dan Patrick as his foil.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Olbermann said he's
a better man these days because ``I'll confess, announce and
gleeful endorse'' this epiphany-inducing therapy he's been in since
January. It's therapy, he said, that made him realize he had lost
the job he really loved most _ sports anchoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a problem with sports, it was the grind (at
ESPN) that brought so much anger and disappointment that I sought a
resolution,'' he said. ``I couldn't keep the pain inside. What was
going in my life wasn't adding up. I made a change (to news), but
something still was missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsure of the damage that misguided therapy could further cause,
Olbermann said he was finally comfortable with it when a
producer/friend introduced him to his parents, both psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, who has described himself as ``an iceberg that's 95
percent above water,'' says he just ``got lucky'' with therapy.
``There was nothing seriously wrong, I just needed help settling
some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, don't be surprised if you see him in cartoon form on
the couch with Comedy Central's Dr. Katz.
</P>
<P>
   While therapy is one of those sexy media words that many use to
wash away frailties from the past, it's an ongoing process, one
Olbermann hopes will keep him focused and somewhat repair his
erratic reputation. Meaning, if this job doesn't work out, another
train wreck in Olbermann's career could be quite damaging to his
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Olbermann used a train analogy when he said Fox's
rapid succession in cable TV makes this a better fit than going
back to a place like ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to `SportsCenter' (in 1992, leaving KCBS Channel
2), it was already established in the sport community as must-see
television and on the verge of becoming something beyond that. And
they'd been on 13 years. My perception of Fox Sports News is that
in three years, they've gone 10 of ESPN's years. This isn't the
ground floor but really the perfect scenario. It's the last stop on
the train and I can get a great deal of credit when we get it into
the station. That's a dream job, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, given the title of senior correspondent as well
rumored to replace Chip Caray as the network's future host of the
baseball studio show, says he feels he's been accepted ``as a
junior partner. I feel I have personal equity in this. I'm
encouraged to believe this will end when it's supposed to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, by the way, will make close to $1 million a year from
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who spent 10 years at ESPN and the last four encased in
the ``Up Close'' interviewer's chair, where he was forced to read
from a script of questions that rarely allowed him to free-lance on
an interview, will reportedly make about half that.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I'm here because) Fox needed someone to drive Keith to
work,'' Myers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He was only half-kidding.
</P>
<P>
   FOX SPORTS NEWS POSTSCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Fox Sports News' operation would just update its video
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Notice how the shows look like they have this filmy residue all
over them? The impulse is to get the Windex and wipe off the TV
screen. It never works. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   CBS will draw its own line in the dirt _ specifically, a yellow
graphic used to mark first downs on the TV screen _ starting with
the Pittsburgh-Detroit Thanksgiving Day game, two other
regular-season contests, and four AFC playoff games, including the
AFC title game on Jan. 17. It's an expensive process, but the fact
CBS saw its usefulness so quickly after ESPN introduced it for
``Sunday Night Football'' shows that borrowing a good idea that
helps the viewer is worth doing, no matter who came up with it
first, and it doesn't look as petty as NBC's decision to refrain
from using any constant time-and-score graphics during its games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Karl Ravech , 33, continues to recover from what's been
called a heart attack he suffered during a pick-up basketball game
with colleague Bill Pidto last week. Ravech had an emergency
angioplasty to clear a blocked artery and is resting fine. An ESPN
spokesman said he will be back to work soon.
</P>
<P>
   BCS alert: Saturday, KCBS Channel 2 decided to go with the
Tennessee-Arkansas contest in place of Navy-Notre Dame, and
L.A.-based Radio Sports Creations will deliver Nebraska-Kansas
State game (that's otherwise available only on pay-per-view) over
XTRA-AM (690) with Randy Rosenbloom and Warren Williamson
</P>
<P>
   doing the call.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   Tis a shame KALL-AM (910) in Salt Lake City couldn't afford to
keep airing the heralded Karl Malone show simulcast out of KXTA-AM
(1150) in Burbank since the Utah forward's agent, Dwight Manley ,
demanded the station start coughing up the same money _ namely,
$1,000 a show _ that L.A. was ridiculously paying. The Utahonians
missed out on hearing live the big guy's proclamation Wednesday
that he wasn't coming back to play for the Jazz when (if) the NBA
lockout ends. Which begs the question: If a Mailman delivers in a
forest with no one around, does anyone hear him complaining? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The longer KCBS Channel 2's Jim Hill avoids making any kind of
public statement about his involvement with the
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz Carson NFL bid _ outside that lame ``disclaimer''
following a recent story on Ovitz _ the more speculation will
continue to circulate about this unethical relationship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tell me new KABC Channel 7 sports guy Bill Weir didn't say it
the other night when introducing the standard leave-'em-laughing
clip about a high diver who sets himself on fire before leaping
into the pool: ``Finally, tonight, we have a story on a flaming
high diver, and I don't mean Greg Louganis
</P>
<P>
   . . .'' Be careful: There's drag racing this weekend at Pomona.

SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR TO RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lewis Merletti, the director of the Secret Service
who unsuccessfully tried to a establish a new right of
confidentiality for presidential bodyguards, is retiring to become
director of security for the Cleveland Browns' expansion football
team.
</P>
<P>
   Merletti, 50, sought to shield Secret Service plainclothes
agents and uniformed officers from having to testify in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation by asserting a novel ``protective function
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Merletti, a former head of President Clinton's bodyguard detail,
argued that forcing Secret Service agents to testify would endanger
the president's life because it would break the intimacy that
agents needed to guard his physical safety.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the Supreme Court rejected Merletti's claim,
agreeing with lower courts that Secret Service agents, like all
other law-enforcement personnel, had to cooperate with grand jury
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Secret Service agents and officers testified
in the inquiry by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, into the
relationship between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service witnesses documented Ms. Lewinsky's numerous
visits to the Oval Office when Clinton was there. But while
officers recounted much gossip and speculation about the
relationship between the president and the former White House
intern, none testified that they had seen the two in a compromising
position.
</P>
<P>
   Merletti, who has been with the Secret Service for 24 years,
will step down in January. He was named director of the agency in
June 1997, after serving as agent in charge of Clinton's detail and
as a member of the group that protected Presidents George Bush and
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement: ``On behalf of everyone who has
felt the reassurance of being in the care of Lew Merletti and the
Secret Service agents he led, I want to thank this distinguished
director for his remarkable devotion to duty and country. I will
miss him very much.''

   At a news conference in Cleveland on Thursday afternoon,
Merletti, who grew up in Pittsburgh, confessed that he had been a
fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, archrivals of the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' franchise was moved to Baltimore at the end of the
1995 season, but Cleveland retained the Browns' name and its
National Football League records. The expansion Browns team is
scheduled to begin play in a new lakefront stadium in the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   Merletti said Thursday that it was not a great leap from the
world of presidential security to professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service is about teamwork,'' he said. ``Football is
teamwork. The Secret Service goal is to preserve the American way
of life. Football epitomizes the American way of life.''

RIOT POLICE BATTLE INDONESIAN STUDENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a last line of defense, riot police
officers fired tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets Thursday
night to keep student demonstrators from invading the grounds of
Parliament as they did six months ago when they helped force the
ouster of President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were reported wounded in confrontations around
the city as columns of students dodged or just crashed their way
through police lines. Banks and shops pulled down their shutters in
fear of new rioting.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have built in number and intensity this week
as Parliament meets to lay the groundwork for a new election that
would replace the transitional government of Suharto's chosen
successor, President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary session is to conclude on Friday with a series
of strenuously debated decrees that will help shape the future of
Indonesia's fledgling attempt at democracy. The students say they
will be on the streets in force, ready to demonstrate their
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Although the electoral process has been generally endorsed by
the country's leading opposition figures, it is not enough for most
of the students, who are demanding an immediate break with the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the momentum of their victory over Suharto in May, the
students have taken over major streets in the capital this week by
the tens of thousands, marching and chanting, proud to make their
mark on history as the revolutionary ``class of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proved to the people that we are not just ignorant
boys and girls,'' said Benny Yuliawan, 23, a philosophy student.
``I have an obsession that this week will be as great an event as
May, only without the riots.''
</P>
<P>
   With their jeans, sandals, long hair and guitars, this is a
student movement to take its place alongside those of the French
and the Americans in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Their continuing campus demonstrations kept alive the country's
timid opposition to Suharto after he was anointed for a seventh
five-year term in March. And it was the killing by security forces
of four students at Trisakti University in mid-May that set off
three days of devastating riots that shook Suharto's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the students' ebullient and fearless weeklong
occupation of the Parliament building was the most visible part of
the end game that forced Suharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here see the students as an essential moral force,
assuring that Parliament will not back away from its outline of
democratic reforms. As the four-day parliamentary session continued
Thursday, delegates inside the building repeatedly asked reporters,
``What's happening outside?''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where all government institutions and almost all
public figures are holdovers from the 32-year Suharto era, the
students are the most insistent voice for a genuine change. And in
a country that does not yet have a true democracy, their voice must
be heard from beyond the spiked fence that surrounds the Parliament
building.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not a unified movement with clear leaders, and a
foreign diplomat said that in recent weeks they have increasingly
fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are kind of leaderless and some have abandoned their
positions of nonviolence,'' the diplomat said. ``The movement is
fracturing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their various agendas seem to converge on a demand that the
military withdraw from its dominant role in politics and that the
government investigate Suharto's wealth. Many students are
demanding the immediate resignation of Habibie, although a split in
the movement has emerged over that issue.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the students are still demonstrating against Suharto
and his legacy, demanding the completion of Indonesia's revolution.
Among the many cheers and slogans chanted on the streets this week,
the most popular by far is ``Hang Suharto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will watch the conclusion of the session, and if Suharto is
not punished, we will be back again,'' said Raja Maures, 19, a
student of management at Trisakti University.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the student movement is itself a legacy of
Suharto, the product of the rapid economic development he achieved
and the emerging middle class that was one of its results. The
students, with their vision of an open democratic society, are
Indonesia's first truly middle-class generation.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old philosophy student, Yuliawan, despite his bold
talk of revolution, is fascinated by the centrist politics of Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that not all the people agree with us,'' he said of
the students' political agenda. ``But our role is educational. By
staging our protests, we are saying to the people that it is
possible to speak out. For many years, we were held down. Now we
break the fence and move forward.''

 BY PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ ``I've got to get myself a Bloody Mary,'' said
comedian and visiting lecturer Alan King, an oil painting of
William S. Hofstra looming sternly behind him at a reception
Thursday morning. ``How can you have a Frank Sinatra conference
without booze?''
</P>
<P>
   They did their best at Hofstra University Thursday, as more than
1,200 scholars, friends, camp followers, colleagues and fans turned
out for ``Frank Sinatra: The Man, the Music, the Legend,'' billed
as the first academic conference dedicated to the entertainer whom
the conference hailed as ``the pre-eminent personality of popular
culture of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Vic Damone sang. King told jokes. James Bruno, an education
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, opined on
Sinatra as an expression of America's collective unconscious, and
Rocco Marinaccio, an English professor at Manhattan College,
delivered a paper titled ``I Get No Kick from Assimilation, or `My'
Frank Sinatra Problem.'' As pompous as the conference might have
seemed at times, the participants, both serious and not-so-serious,
seemed to agree that Sinatra deserved his day in academia, and that
he probably would have enjoyed the spectacle had he been around.
Indeed, the serious thinkers may have been ahead of the masses in
waxing grandiloquent about Sinatra's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two millennia ago, a Roman Caesar crossed the Rubicon River
and changed the course of civilization,'' Bruno said, beginning his
talk Thursday morning. ``In the late 1930s, an Italian-American
crossed the Hudson River from Hoboken, took on New York and changed
entertainment history. He became the entertainer of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which continues Friday and Saturday, will
include talks on Sinatra and race, gender, class and philanthropy.
A philosophy and iconography panel on Friday will include Elizabeth
Liebman of the Getty Research Institute on `` `All of Me': The
Cartesian Soul of Frank Sinatra'' and Edmund Santurri of St. Olaf
College on ``Prophet, Padrone, Postmodern Prometheus: Moral Images
of Sinatra in Contemporary Culture.'' Roger Borms of the Sinatra
Society of Belgium perhaps wins the most obscure topic award for
his eagerly awaited ``Frank Sinatra and Belgium.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for all the heavy lifting, popular culture is already so
entrenched in the academy that the most remarkable thing about the
Sinatra conference here may be not that it happened but that it did
not happen sooner.
</P>
<P>
   It might raise a few eyebrows, given that he is not one of the
names regularly bandied about in academic circles, said Will
Friedwald, author of the Sinatra biography, ``Sinatra! The Song is
You.'' ``But, in a very real way, we're just continuing the work he
began,'' Friedwald said. ``He was the first performer to realize
what popular culture could be, the first to grasp that it could be
serious, that it wasn't ephemeral, that there was real meaning
there. If you put Leonard Bernstein and Laurence Olivier in the
same person, it would be Frank Sinatra.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hofstra since 1976 has been putting on ambitious conferences,
usually based around a single person, beginning with French writer
George Sand and German dramatist and narrative writer Heinrich Van
Kleist. Figuring they could get more for their money with figures a
bit sexier than Heinrich Van Kleist, program organizers soon
branched into presidents (all of them from John Kennedy through
George Bush) and other popular figures.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1995 conference on Babe Ruth was a major success,
organizers looked for another major cultural figure. ``We asked
ourselves who else in the 20th century reached the same pinnacle in
his field as Babe Ruth,'' said Natalie Dadlot, co-director of the
conference. ``And right away, we came up with Frank Sinatra. We
really couldn't come up with anyone else who came close.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials contacted Sinatra two years ago, and he and his family
expressed their approval of the project. By the time it opened this
morning, with his daughter Tina in attendance, the schedule
included 43 panels, 120 professional papers, and presentations by
80 experts of various sorts.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, there is an exhibit of art including Sinatra's
own lithographs, movie and album art, and, probably unavoidably,
paintings of Sinatra by the ubiquitous LeRoy Neiman.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, for three days at least, changed the look and
feel of the campus here, adding an armada of middle-aged and older
Sinatrans to the campus. Instead of the Dave Mathews Band or Dr.
Dre, ``Fly Me to the Moon'' and ``I Get a Kick Out of You'' were
wafting out of music speakers. On TV screens, Sinatra and Ella
Fitzgerald were singing ``Ode to Billie Joe'' as if pulled from a
distant corner of multiple time warps. Most of those in attendance
seemed thrilled with the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really overwhelming,'' said Myron Krackow, a retiree from
Woodmere, N.Y. ``I go back to the battle of the baritones, so it
all means a lot to me.'' Students seemed a little less engaged.
Some expressed dutiful appreciation of the man and named ``New
York, New York,'' or other recent Sinatra standards. But others
seemed to find him as ancient as Cicero.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the conference, Evelyn Fischer, a 19-year-old
student from Queens, could not name a Sinatra song or anything else
about him. ``I know he was a singer,'' she offered. ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Elvis Presley has had a scholarly conference for
years, Sinatra, who became the subject of a new wave of scholarship
and biography when he turned 80 in 1995, was probably due his. And
panelists said that longevity, his immigrant background, his
political journey from Henry Wallace to Ronald Reagan, his status
as a seminal pop icon, his evocations of changing notions of
masculinity and sexuality were among the topics most of interest to
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Many admirers said the conference made sense not because he was
so philosophically profound, but because he was so good at what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He held the barbarians at the gates for many years and now his
work is a wax museum of the classic popular song,'' said Ervin
Drake, the songwriter who wrote the Sinatra standard ``It Was A
Very Good Year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank was the ultimate genius,'' Drake said. ``That alone is
reason to line up and pay tribute to the fact he passed this way.
There has to be more to life than simply tormenting President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the gathering was about reminiscence more than
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at his wedding to Mia Farrow,'' King said. ``She was
about 12, I guess. I said he didn't know whether to bed her or burp
her.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Sinatra might have been amused by some of the
philosophizing, but he would have approved of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have gotten a bang out of it,'' King said. ``He was a
vociferous reader. He sucked up all kinds of knowledge, right or
wrong. He was a vacuum cleaner for it, and he was impressed by
erudite people. And he deserves this. He's Muhammad Ali. He's
Horowitz. He's Picasso. The good and the bad it all played into his
mystique. You could do a month on him, and still have plenty left
over.''

BRITISH SWIMMER IS AIMING FOR JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sharron Davies was at her peak, she won a silver medal for
Britain in the 400-meter individual medley at the 1980 Summer
Olympics. But Petra Schneider, an East German swimmer, still
finished more than 10 seconds ahead of her to take the gold and set
a world record.
</P>
<P>
   Davies was convinced then that Schneider had an unfair
advantage, and 18 years later she believes she has proof after
speaking with Schneider in August and digging through East German
state files.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the help of the British Olympic Association, she wants
the International Olympic Committee to offer her some form of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crime is a crime whether it was 50 years ago, five years ago
or five minutes ago,'' Davies said Thursday. ``You will never be
able to give me or other swimmers back our moment of standing up on
the podium, but to be able to put it straight in the record books
would be a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Olympic Association filed the petition on behalf of
Davies. The U.S. Olympic Committee has filed a similar petition on
behalf of the U.S. women's medley relay team that finished second
to the East Germans at the 1976 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Both appeals will be evaluated by the IOC's executive board on
Dec. 11-14 in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the potential
repercussions are enormous if the IOC decides to order a revision
of history.
</P>
<P>
   According to IOC executive director Francois Carrard, the
executive board could make a ruling or refer the petitions to the
general assembly. It could also elect to explore the petitions
further at the conference on doping that the IOC has scheduled for
February in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the IOC making a radical move do not appear
great. Last month, Jacques Rogge, an executive board member, said:
``There is absolutely not going to be any change for things that
happened more than 10 years ago. At this stage, we still have no
documented evidence of doping of an athlete on the day of Olympic
competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carrard was less categoric Thursday. ``There have been
comments from members of the board that, in principle, the IOC
doesn't think it should rewrite history or re-allocate medals, but
I think we are going to see if some form of recognition can be
instituted in some cases,'' said Carrard, who added that he had
received Britain's request several days ago. ``The word
`recognition' is the word I would emphasize.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the USOC nor the British is asking the Germans to
relinquish their medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't like to see medals stripped,'' Davies said. ``And
if you ask me, it's a bit too late to reissue medals, but a
certificate or a rewrite of the record books would be satisfactory
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Davies, who is now a television reporter, spent
several weeks in Germany, seeking evidence to present to the IOC
and material for a television program that will air in Britain on
Sunday. During her research, she interviewed Schneider and her
countrywoman Rica Reinisch, who won both backstroke events at the
1980 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was put on a doping program at age 14 and
originally told that they were just little blue pills,'' Davies
said of Schneider. ``She then knew changes were taking place in her
body, and by the time she was 16 or 17, she was aware that she was
taking something illegal but by that time she was worried that if
she rejected it, her father might lose his job or something. That's
the very sad part of this. It wasn't a simple, straightforward
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies added: ``Both Petra and Rica Reinisch have heart
problems, and all the side effects that are apparent with steroid
abuse. But the fact is they had very little choice. If I had been
in East Germany at that time, I could have been one of those
people, too. But I do think the IOC should be held fairly
accountable that more was not done at the time. It's not like this
is all a surprise. The East Germans were dominating out of all
proportion. It was obvious to everyone what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies now supports life bans for proven drug users in sport,
but she recognizes that her former opponents have already
experienced a form of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petra has been told at the age of 35 that she could die of a
heart attack at any moment, Davies said, ``and she has an
8-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and her husband, Derek Redmond, have a 5-year-old son,

FFA IS ON ITS LAST DANCE WITH KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Every blue jacket is put on the shelf
sometime.
</P>
<P>
   Each autumn since 1928, rural teen-agers in blue cotton corduroy
have descended upon Kansas City for the annual FFA convention.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, those teen-agers grew out of their jackets, at least
figuratively, and went on with life.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City now faces a similar transition.
</P>
<P>
   This year's convention of the National FFA Organization, which
opened Wednesday and continues through Saturday, is the last one in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 40,000 teen-age conventioneers began filing through
Municipal Auditorium and Bartle Hall on Wednesday for the opening
sessions, which included the National Agricultural Career Show. The
first of three dances was Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Next October, many of those same teen-agers will be in
Louisville, Ky., where the National FFA has moved its annual
convention.
</P>
<P>
   For many former blue-jacket wearers, the last Kansas City
convention represents an opportunity to recall what the convention
once meant to them. Most meaningful, perhaps, was the sight of so
many young people just like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds trite, but when you come from a town of about 2,000,
and then see thousands of people in blue jackets _ kids like you in
all ways but yet different _ it gives you self-confidence,'' said
Jack Pitzer, who traveled from Toulon, Ill., in 1957 to attend his
first convention. Today he operates a trade show management
business in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days you hardly knew about the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Women weren't always part of the crowd. The national
organization voted to extend membership to women in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a lot more laser lights today,'' said Jeri
Mattics, who attended her first convention as an Olathe, Colo.,
teen-ager in 1979 and today is a public relations consultant in
Montrose, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are some constants.
</P>
<P>
   One is the emphasis on individual achievement. Another is the
unbridled decorum of the conventioneers.
Well behaved
</P>
<P>
   For years the now-vanished 12th Street strip of bars stood one
block north of the main doors of Municipal Auditorium, convention
headquarters. The strip was anchored at 12th and Central streets by
the Folly Theater, once known for its burlesque.
</P>
<P>
   Yet FFA convention delegates have been known for their lack of
adolescent rambunctiousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reaffirm your faith in human nature,'' said Sgt. Gerald
Gardner of the Kansas City Police Department, who has coordinated
security for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will turn in billfolds with hundreds of dollars in
them,'' Gardner said. ``Expensive cameras. They don't have a
thought of taking anything for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   FFA members long have policed themselves. One year during the
1950s, after pedestrians complained of water balloons dropping from
Hotel President windows, FFA officials established a ``courtesy
patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer members fanned out, urging colleagues to act their
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still see that,'' said Dave Sheets, who attended his first
convention in 1973 from San Pierre, Ind., and who today serves as
convention newsroom manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even see kids from different states or chapters trying to
put somebody else in line. They don't want the convention ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Many FFA members earn the right to attend the convention.
Shirley Sokolosky, then of Paris, Mo., came to her first convention
in 1973 as the winner of her chapter's FFA creed-speaking contest.
The last thing she imagined doing that year was causing trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also have to give the kids' teachers credit for that,''
said Sokolosky, today an Owasso, Okla., mother of four.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, any mischievousness has been mild. Mattics, for
instance, can only recall water fights in the hallways of the old
Dixon Inn, now demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that probably helped that old carpet,'' she said.
Unity in uniform
</P>
<P>
   The blue jacket helped maintain propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Fredericktown, Ohio, chapter arrived in 1933
wearing matching jackets. Eventually the jackets became official
convention dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put students in that uniform, there is a real
psychological leveling,'' said Mattics. ``They all get in the same
mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Case, a National FFA adviser, agreed. He attended his
first convention in 1957 as 14-year-old high school freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the other FFA members with all the different states and
towns on their jackets brought a sense of community that was larger
than Stet, Mo.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that community was an ethic of achievement, Mattics
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting there listening to people whom I could perceive as my
peers, talking about their dreams, was appealing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a flip side to the achievement ethic, said
Sokolosky, who tried but failed to win election as a national
officer in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest learning experience of my life,'' she
said. ``You have to learn to live with yourself when you don't get
something you really desire. I went from the excitement of having
thousands of people around me to getting in the car and driving
back to school in Columbia, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long drive home.''
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a decade earlier, Sokolosky would not even have
had the chance to run.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, William Nelson, president of his FFA chapter in
Brainerd, Minn., argued with his FFA adviser all the way to Kansas
City about a big issue on that year's agenda: women being admitted
as official members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't pass,'' said Nelson, today president of the
charitable foundation underwritten by Cenex Harvest States, a
cooperative system owned by farmers and ranchers near St. Paul,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking, `This isn't right.' We'd been criticized
for being behind the times. Now, nationally, we have seen a
phenomenal rebirth of the FFA, in part due to the inclusion of
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Daugherty, now president of Farmland Industries' North
American grain division, remembers the moment the issue passed in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the national FFA chorus,'' Daugherty said. ``As soon
as the vote went through, we adopted a girl from Ohio. She couldn't
even wear the blue jacket until it passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as it did, she got up and sang with us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Peg Armstrong-Gustafson, representing the chapter from
North Winneshiek County, Iowa, was chosen for one six national
offices in 1977, she was only the second woman to achieve that
rank.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one told me I couldn't,'' said Armstrong-Gustafson, an
executive in Des Moines with a plant genetics company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have been involved in agriculture since the beginning of
time, so it was just a natural transition for the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't make the election and interview process any less
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spent the entire week in the auditorium in what we all
called the `sweat box,' just waiting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the perspective of more than 20 years, Armstrong-Gustafson
regards her FFA convention experience as a defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When adults take an interest in young people, the positive
impact can be overwhelming,'' she said.
Traditions, memories
</P>
<P>
   For many now-grown FFA members, the last Kansas City convention
will be a poignant occasion. That includes Betsy Blades, who
attended her first convention from El Dorado Springs, Mo., in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was in Kansas City to receive the American FFA
Degree, the highest recognition that an active FFA member can earn,
in the early 1970s. Blades received her own in 1991. Her brother
later acquired his and this week, a younger sister will get her
American FFA Degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be some closure for my family,'' said Blades,
an advertising account executive at Farmland Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The convention has been a part of local culture for so long that
even those connected with it haven't noticed the number of years
slipping by.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leathers, for more than 30 years chairman of the KC/FFA
Advisory Council, a division of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce, attended his first convention in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   That year he interviewed convention delegates for a farm radio
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes wonder what those kids I interviewed in 1951 are
doing today,'' Leathers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I think, `Well, I know what they are doing. They are
retired and drawing Social Security.' ''

THERE'S SUCH A THING AS BEING `TOO NICE' 
</HEADLINE>
 WORK-COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agreeable. Extroverted. Smart. Important workplace assets,
right? Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   From Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management,
we learn it's possible to be too agreeable, too extroverted for our
own good. In win-lose bargaining situations _ negotiating for a
raise, haggling over a price or bargaining for power _ those traits
may help you lose.
</P>
<P>
   Two Vanderbilt professors spent two years studying
bargaining-table behavior. One of them, management Professor Bruce
Barry, explained one of the obvious problems: ``An agreeable person
has a tendency to value cooperation over protecting one's own
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry and fellow researcher Raymond Friedman defined
``agreeable'' as being courteous, flexible, trusting, cooperative
and tolerant. Good stuff, right? Not when asking for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Agreeable Joe asks for 6 percent. Boss counters
with 3 percent; gives passionate speech about budget constraints
and co-workers' needs. Joe understands; accepts 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barry and Friedman also studied the role of intelligence in
win-lose bargaining. Finding: It doesn't help to be smart.
</P>
<P>
   For example: IQ and graduate school admissions tests say Joe is
smart. He comes to his raise negotiations with solid research about
the economy and comparative salaries. He brings proof of his
high-performing contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligence doesn't matter at all,'' Barry said. ``Neither
did how conscientiously you prepared in advance for the meeting. We
found that personality tendencies can undermine the strategic
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   In win-lose negotiating, agreeable people were victims of ``a
bad thing called anchoring,'' Barry said. Anchoring occurs when a
person is hooked by the opposition's initially stated position,
even if extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anchoring sucks agreeable people into the other person's way
of thinking, into believing that's where the deal is,'' Barry said.
``Agreeables don't necessarily start out as wimps, but they do get
co-opted once the social interaction gets under way.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, bargaining situations usually are more complex
than a simple win-lose. Many have win-win outcomes. Barry and
Friedman studied win-win successes, too, and found gray matter can
matter in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most negotiating allows trade-offs, and when it does,
cognitive ability has an impact,'' Barry said. ``The presumption is
that smarter people are better at perceiving both parties'
interests, solving problems and finding creative ways to address
both. Conscientious preparation also helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Results of the professors' study were published in the Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology. Some of their pointers for
successful bargaining:
</P>
<P>
   Begin with the expectation of doing well; make an extreme, but
not insulting, first offer; don't let your counteroffer be swayed
by an extreme first offer; and try to bargain with the smartest
person available on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   If you're naturally agreeable, focus on what you want _ not on
protecting your relationship with the other party. If you're
naturally extroverted, be careful not to reveal too much
information that can be used against you.

RAMPAGING GUNMAN WAS ON THE HUNT FOR POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ William Eldon Lattin Jr. didn't leave a note
explaining why he launched a deadly rampage Tuesday that killed one
police officer and wounded three other persons. But investigators
are certain it stemmed from an intense hatred for police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to hurt some people, particularly people in black
and white cars, wearing dark blue uniforms,'' said St. Joseph
Police Lt. Jim Connors.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police that he waved some of them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be going for police vehicles,'' Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   An officer shot and killed Lattin, 33, early Tuesday evening
after he sprayed 80 to 200 rounds from a MAK-90 assault rifle into
the busy residential neighborhood in midtown St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his victims remained hospitalized Wednesday. Jack Martin,
57, remained in serious condition at a St. Joseph hospital,
suffering three gunshot wounds. Valerie Sharp, 28, remained at St.
Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, but officials there declined to
comment on her condition, which Tuesday was reported as stable
following injuries that weren't life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty firefighter Kenny Cordonnier was treated Tuesday for a
shrapnel wound in the arm and released.
</P>
<P>
   Information from investigators and interviews with acquaintances
on Wednesday revealed conflicting portraits of Lattin. To some, he
was a polite and withdrawn neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But with others, Lattin could be abusive and threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Information released Wednesday showed he has been arrested 12
times by St. Joseph police since 1985, the last arrest in 1993.
Most of the charges were municipal counts for theft, drug and
weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said Wednesday that Lattin was carrying more
than 300 rounds of rifle and shotgun ammunition as well as a
single-shot, black-powder derringer.
</P>
<P>
   In a military backpack, Lattin carried 10 30-round banana clips
for the assault rifle, taped together in pairs for quick reloading.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a gas mask found in Lattin's small apartment that led
officers to conclude that his murderous frenzy wasn't planned as a
suicide mission. Lattin may have hoped to fight his way back to the
third-floor apartment and then hold police at bay, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gas mask indicates he could have held out against tear
gas,'' Connors said. ``He could have lasted there a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jule Wykert, who lived across the hall from Lattin in the Empire
Apartments for about seven months, described him as ``scary and
creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's gone,'' she said. ``I don't miss him a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wykert said Lattin had threatened her recently, but he then
became confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd like to kill me and kill himself,'' she said.
``He talked to himself constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Lattin said small things about him began to
change within the last week. Wykert said Lattin often played loud
rock music in his apartment. But that had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got quiet this last week after the landlord told him he had
to keep the music down,'' Wykert said.
</P>
<P>
   And police said that before the attack, Lattin shaved his head.
</P>
<P>
   Alva Schottel, a secretary at the Calvary Baptist Church where
much of the shooting occurred, said she saw Lattin the morning of
the shooting. He had not yet shaved his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked perfectly normal,'' Schottel said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew why his son would have gone on a shooting
spree, Lattin's father, William E. Lattin Sr., said, ``No, I have
no idea why he did this, and I'd rather not talk anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors said police were not sure whether William Lattin Jr. was
employed. Though some said he worked as a driver, perhaps for a
pizza delivery service, police could find no evidence that he owned
a car.
</P>
<P>
   Others who knew Lattin said he was no trouble to live around.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, he was a very quiet person,'' said
Virginia Mitchell, who shares an apartment with her husband in the
basement of Lattin's apartment building. ``He kept to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of a nearby pawnshop, where in 1995 Lattin bought a
12-gauge pump shotgun that he carried during the shooting, said he
was a steady customer who always was polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a surprise to us,'' said owner Vernon Jenkins.
``He was a quiet, reserved gentleman. He had done business with us
for at least 12 years. We loaned him money, mostly.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee Donald Blakely said Lattin wore camouflage clothing
almost all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a `yes sir, no sir' person to us,'' Blakely said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hatfield, who owns an antique store across the street from
Lattin's apartment house, said he had occasionally tried to sell
antiques to him in the past. But Hatfield had refused to buy,
fearing they had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said Lattin did not frequent his store, which sells
guns, probably because he sells only sporting arms and avoids
paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Lattin's motivation was less important to St. Joseph Mayor Larry
R. Stobbs than his police department's ability to end the mayhem
far earlier than Lattin had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had this person not been taken down by that officer,'' Stobbs
said, ``we very well could have stacked up a hospital with
bodies.''

DOW EKES OUT SMALL GAIN WHILE OTHER GAUGES FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were mixed Thursday after failing to sustain a
morning advance.
</P>
<P>
   Only a surge by two oil components in the Dow Jones industrial
average _ reflecting possible military action against Iraq _ kept
the average in the plus column. Investors are also waiting for the
results of Tuesday's meeting by the Federal Reserve concerning
possible interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's gain, which reached nearly 84 points just before noon,
was 5.92 points, to 8,829.74. All other major averages declined.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.05 points, to 1,851.06, while
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.28 points, to
1,117.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is buffeted by uncertainty and stocks aren't as
cheap as they were,'' said Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bonds and the dollar strengthened as jittery investors
around the world sought safer havens. Stock buyers, too, have
seemed to migrate toward larger, higher-quality stocks of late
after a month in which the Nasdaq market climbed twice as much as
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, ``investors seem to be discriminating among
companies,'' said Daniel Knight, portfolio manager at Columbine
Capital Services in Colorado Springs. ``Lower P-E stocks are
outperforming high P-E stocks,'' he added, referring to the
relationship of prices to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent speculative casualty was Entremed, which dropped
7} a share, to 24~, after The Wall Street Journal reported on
problems that scientists have had in replicating one of the
company's experimental anti-cancer compounds. The stock traded as
high as 85 in May.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Earthweb built on its spectacular Wednesday debut
by surging another 20 9/16, to 69\, nearly quintupling in two
trading sessions from its initial price of 14 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Oil shares jumped on the assumption that an attack against Iraq
would jeopardize at least some Mideast oil supplies. Chevron, up 3[
a share, to 83, and Exxon, up 2 9/16, to 72 13/16, were the Dow's
most important performers; without them, the Dow _ with only 10
gainers out of 30 _ would have declined.
</P>
<P>
   Airline shares were mixed. Delta Air Lines gained 1 5/16, to
101\, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1 3/16, to
61\, while other lines slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts still expect the Fed to make another cut in
short-term interest rates _ and the case for it might have been
bolstered a bit with the Labor Department's report that first-time
claims for jobless benefits climbed last week to the highest level
in four months. But conviction was missing in the market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said James Pizzo, market strategist at CIBC
Oppenheimer, ``you have more people concerned that it will not
happen, compared to a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer, software and Internet stocks were mostly lower, though
Ebay, up 10 1/16 a share, to 126, and Amazon.com, up 4], to 131,
were prominent exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway, the grocery retailer that is replacing Chrysler in the
S&AMP;P 500, gained 1 5/16 , to 50{, after trading as high as 55 late
in the session. Index funds, which try to match the market as a
whole, were said to be adding the stock in their portfolios at
closing levels. In its last day of trading, Chrysler shares edged
up 1/16, to 47[, and were the day's most actively traded; the
company begins trading as part of DaimlerChrysler on Tuesday.

CONGRESSMAN SAYS INFORMATION WITHHELD IN 1997 BORDER SHOOTING 
 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice and Defense departments undermined
criminal investigations by withholding information about the
inadequate training of Marines who killed a Texas teen-ager while
on border patrol, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the two agencies refused requests from him and Texas
prosecutors for documents related to the fatal shooting of Esequiel
Hernandez Jr., an 18-year-old Redford goatherd, on May 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the appearance of a cover-up, at a minimum,''
Smith said in releasing a 249-page report that his staff prepared
on the shooting and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Clemente Banuelos has testified that he shot Hernandez when
the teen aimed his rifle at another Marine on anti-drug patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The information the government departments provided reveals that
the camouflaged Marines had no knowledge of the Texas community and
little border-patrol training before encountering Hernandez, armed
only with the .22 caliber rifle he used to ward off thieves and
snakes, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman, who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration and Claims, said the departments' failure to provide
information to Texas law enforcement ``had the effect of seriously
undermining any possibility of finding the truth in a criminal
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas grand juries declined to issue indictments in the
summer of 1997. A federal grand jury also issued no indictments
after conducting a civil rights investigation. The federal
government has agreed to pay $1.9 million to the Hernandez family
to settle a wrongful death claim.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps issued a statement defending its investigation
of the Redford shooting, saying it reprimanded officers in the
chain of command for failing to properly supervise and support the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to investigating the incident itself, the
investigating officer looked at every aspect of Marine Corps
support of counterdrug operations,'' the military service stated.
``Our efforts to make this an open, thorough and responsible
investigation enabled us to identify that the level of support and
priority of effort that (border patrol) missions received from
higher headquarters was, in some instances, less than acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said there was insufficient evidence to
show an intentional violation of Hernandez's civil rights and
rejected Smith's contention that the agency impeded criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After our investigation, we shared all of our evidence with
the local prosecutor to the extent permitted by law,'' the
department's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas congressman reviewed information that the departments
provided to him voluntarily and under congressional subpoena. He
said the Justice Department was more culpable than the Pentagon,
because the Marine Corps at least conducted a detailed
investigation and punished several officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which supervises the Border Patrol, has
refused to take any action or acknowledge any responsibility for
the incident, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is troubling that the Justice Department, which is
responsible for enforcing the law, decided instead to obstruct law
enforcement in the Hernandez case,'' he added. ``Life and liberty
are dependent upon citizens and their government being held
accountable. When the nation's chief law-enforcement agency will
not make even a cursory attempt to hold itself and its employees
accountable for the wrongful killing of an American citizen, the
life and freedom of every citizen are threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said he has no plans to conduct hearings on his
report's conclusions, placed most of the blame for the shooting on
the Border Patrol for failing to teach law-enforcement techniques
to the Marines and to tell them that many law-abiding residents in
the area carry light rifles for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Marines) were not made to understand how threatening they
might appear to local residents with no knowledge of their
presence,'' Smith said. ``The Marines were not told that their
observation post was located near a number of family homes,
including the Hernandez home. They were not told that Hernandez
regularly brought his goats to the Polvo Crossing area.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said the goatherd might have fired two shots at
the Marine patrol to protect his animals, not knowing that the
sounds he heard in the underbrush were U.S. military. However,
those shots _ followed quickly by Hernandez's return to tending his
goats _ did not warrant the four-member Marine patrol's decision to
shadow the goatherd for 20 minutes, Smith contended.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has suspended the use of military personnel in
border enforcement. Proposed legislation to bar military border
patrols died in Congress this year.

A BREAK FOR ALL OF US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a brain in your head or an ounce of common sense,
you will go to the door or nearest window, open it, and shout at
the top of your lungs, ``Thank you for sparing us five more years
of Mo Vaughn's bull.''
</P>
<P>
   What a break we all just got. I'm closing in on 40 years of
writing sports for this paper, and there was no bigger bore, or
earache, over those four decades than Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Mo is a great hitter, one of the best ever to play for the Red
sox. He did more in the Boston community than any other player in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   But recent history shows it was not wise to take as truth what
Mo had to say.
</P>
<P>
   The local baseball media and the regulars on WEEI's Welfare
Radio bought into his perpetual contractual harangue, and now they
are all running for cover, trying to rationalize excuses that would
make what they did seem plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make it simple. Mo is about money. Just as his good buddy
Roger Clemens is. And like Roger, wherever he gets the most is
where he will end up.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he left to play on a winner. So he went to Toronto,
which had no chance of winning anything, even while Roger was
having two of the greatest years any pitcher has ever had
back-to-back. Now the word is Roger wants out of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Clemens really wanted to play for a winner, he would
have gone to the Yankees or Braves and said, ``I'll sign for
anything you give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the winning stuff is phony. The money is what counts.
And if Toronto trades him, Clemens will go where he gets the most
money, and he won't agree to any deal unless he gets more money.
That's his history.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said a year ago that his beef with the Red Sox wasn't
about money. He said he had more money than he needed and would
play for $5 million a year if the Sox showed him they would spend
to get a winner. As of now, the Red Sox will have the
second-highest payroll in major league baseball entering 1999. They
spent. Mo went.
</P>
<P>
   If Mo is really about winning, he'll call the Yankees tomorrow
and say, ``Give me anything. I'll sign. I want to be on a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you know he won't do that. This guy is obsessed with
money. For more than five years, we have been tortured with stories
about his contract trouble. We have read how he wanted to be a
Yankee, wanted to be a Ranger, wanted to be a Blue Jay. Wherever he
went, even though he was under contract to the Red Sox, Mo was
setting himself up for this week, when Boston was willing to give
him a deal that would have made him the highest-paid player in the
American League and he said, ``So long, suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo's friends are scrambling now to explain it. The key word is
``issues,'' as in, ``There are other issues that Mo has that he
doesn't want to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Mo will attempt to explain why he didn't take a deal
that could have risen to an average of $13 million guaranteed
annually for the next five years from the Red Sox, a contract
length he asked for _ and said he would take _ just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are hints from his friends that Mo wanted a no-trade
clause and the Red Sox wouldn't give it to him. Of course they
wouldn't. Give Vaughn a no-trade clause and every other player and
his agent would be at the Sox' door looking for the same thing.
Does Vaughn really think anyone would trade for his $13
million-a-year contract? Does Vaughn think the Sox would unload him
within three years, before he became a 10-5 man (10 years in the
majors, five with the same team) and could veto any deal?
</P>
<P>
   Like Mo, that's all bull.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what went down in the final hours of the Red Sox-Vaughn
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' first contract offer was for five years, $60.5
million guaranteed. All the clauses in the contract were the same
ones he had in his prior deal, plus those added by major league
baseball that will be in all guaranteed contracts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a weight clause. But Mo has had one for four years,
and when he has been asked to weigh in, he wouldn't do so. Wouldn't
get on the scale. There was a clause about making a certain amount
of appearances on behalf of the team. The clause was in the last
contract as well, but it didn't make any difference because when
the Sox asked Mo to make those appearances, he wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``clauses'' excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the money.
</P>
<P>
   When his agent, Tom Reich, and Mo decided not to accept the
first offer, the Sox came back with a second. They would add a
sixth year, at the club's option. They would pay $13.5 million if
they kept Mo for a sixth year. That would raise the total value to
$74 million over six years, making it almost as good as Pedro
Martinez's deal, which is what the Sox thought he was holding out
for. Also, the Sox said, if they decided not to keep Mo for the
sixth year, they would have to give him a $2.5 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   When they left Reich Wednesday afternoon with the latest offer
that would give Mo at least $63 million guaranteed, general manager
Dan Duquette and his associate, Elaine Weddington Steward, thought
they had a deal. They told team CEO John Harrington they felt
confident Vaughn was coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Then they waited. And waited. Finally, at 9 Wednesday night,
Mo's people phoned the Sox and said, ``We are still far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mo's people had said it was close, the Sox would have kicked
in $2 million more to give him $65 million guaranteed for five
years, but when they said they were far apart, the Sox knew they
were being suckered and said, ``Good night.''
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months, they had tried to get the deal done. They opened
the talks more than a year ago at $30 million for three years, or
$10 million annually. His agents said at the time they would take
Mark McGwire money. McGwire got a three-year contact that averaged
$9.5 million annually in St. Louis. The Sox bettered that and got
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training this year, Mo mentioned to Duquette that he
might be interested in a two-year deal. That way, he might have two
more contracts before his career was over. The Sox offered him $22
million for two years, $11 million annually. This was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   In July, breaking with team tradition, they negotiated at the
All-Star break. Mo said he wanted more years. They offered him $38
million, or $9.5 million annually, for four years. This was just to
be a starting point. They were willing to go higher, but they never
got the shot. Mo's people walked out of the room in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for this week. So Vaughn turned down $9.5
million a year, $10 million a year, $11 milllion a year, and
finally this week $12 million, then $l3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   And after all this, some members of the media had the audacity
to report that the Sox didn't move fast enough or try hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same people who said what a great leader Mo had
been, even when he was saying he would like to play for just about
every other team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership? When Mo comes out with the bogus story that the team
has a private detective following him, without one shred of
evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Leadership? When he continally bad-mouthed the organization
whenever he had the chance? When his own lawyer said in court he
was 50 pounds overweight at one point?
</P>
<P>
   If I read the Boston sports fans correctly, they now feel about
Mo the way they feel about the NBA: If he never comes back, we
won't be missing a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm hoping the Sox sign Albert Belle pronto. He's a
much better player than Vaughn. And what makes it even better ...
simply fantastic ... is that he doesn't talk. The Belle of Silence.
Has a beautiful ring to it.

 &HT;    Bush taps Gonzales to lead court
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush, whose political star is rising in
proportion to his increasing strength as a Republican who can lure
minority support, on Thursday appointed Alberto Gonzales, his
secretary of state, to the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to elevating a Hispanic, the move clears the way for
Bush to make his highest-level appointment of an African-American.
Clark Kent Ervin, now the assistant secretary of state and a former
aide to President George Bush, is a prime contender for the top
post.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales will replace Justice Raul Gonzalez, who is retiring at
the end of the year. In 1984, Gonzalez became the first Hispanic
elected to statewide office in Texas. The new justice will face
election in 2000. He also faces Senate confirmation next year, but
Gonzales' hometown senator, Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, has
cleared the appointment, which means it almost certainly will win
approval in the Republican-majority Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it mattered what his ethnicity is,'' Bush, who
opposes quotas, said of the Gonzales appointment, adding that
qualifications and integrity mattered more.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's already-high profile as a potential presidential
contender got a boost last week when an exit poll showed he
captured 49 percent of the Hispanic vote and 27 percent of the
black vote in winning re-election. Both are unprecedented figures
for a Texas Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 15, 79 percent of Bush's 2,200 appointments went to
whites. Twelve percent went to Hispanics, and 8 percent went to
blacks. When he took office in 1995, Bush acknowledged he would not
be able to meet the minority appointee levels posted by Democrat
Ann Richards, his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Richards made 2,409 appointments. Eighteen percent went to
Hispanics and 16 percent to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales will ascend to the state's highest civil court despite
never having served as a judge. It's not the most common route to
the court, but it is not unprecedented. Current Justice Priscilla
Owen was elected in 1994 with no judicial experience. Joe
Greenhill, who served as chief justice from 1972-82, donned his
first judicial robe when he joined the court as an associate
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he took the lack of judicial experience into account,
but decided Gonzales is ``absolutely'' qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 39, is a Houston native and graduate of Rice
University and Harvard Law School. After working in Houston for the
law firm of Vinson and Elkins, he served as Bush's general counsel
in the governor's office. In December 1997, Bush made Gonzales the
100th secretary of state, where his duties included overseeing
elections and acting as liaison with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be a pretty interesting mix to have
somebody who may not have been a judge before on the court,'' Bush
said. ``I think the judges, and I think those who argue in front of
Al, are going to see that he is a great judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who in recent weeks denied that the job was his for
the asking, said he brings a simple goal to his new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work hard for all Texans to fairly interpret and apply
the laws of our state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that maintaining a Hispanic presence on the high
court is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that justice needs to be fair, and in a
democracy fairness often means equal representation,'' Gonzales
said. ``I think this helps validate the integrity of the court's
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Ervin is a contender to replace Gonzales as secretary
of state, a job that in recent years has become a place for
governors to boost the careers of minorities. Gonzales'
predecessor, Bush appointee Tony Garza, resigned to make a
successful run this year for the Texas Railroad Commission. Garza
followed Ron Kirk, an African American appointed by Gov. Ann
Richards. Kirk, an Austin native, is now mayor of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, insisting the search for a new secretary of state has just
begun, called Ervin a good man who has done a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin, a Houston native, said Thursday was not the day to talk
about his possible ascension to the top spot. In addition to a
career in legal practice, he served as associate director of policy
for the White House Office of National Service under Bush's father,
former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he returned to Houston to run an unsuccessful race as a
Republican candidate for a U.S. House seat. Ervin, a Rhodes Scholar
with undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard, has served as
assistant secretary of state since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzales appointment also marked the end of a Texas era that
stretches back to Reconstruction. Combined with last week's GOP
sweep, the appointment means Republicans will hold all 29 statewide
elected posts in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas choose the best qualified people,'' said
the retiring Gonzalez, ``and it seems like the pendulum has swung
to the Republican Party.''

 &HT;    Boehner backed by top officials to keep House post
 &HT;    By Shannon Joyce
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six chairmen of House committees _ including Budget
Chairman John Kasich of Westerville, Ohio, and Judiciary Chairman
Henry Hyde of Illinois _ have endorsed U.S. Rep. John Boehner to
continue as chairman of the House Republican Conference, the
House's fourth ranking leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to House Republicans, the chairmen praised
the leadership, communication skills, and vision for the party of
Boehner, a Republican from West Chester. His district includes all
of Butler, Preble, Darke, Miami and Shelby counties, and parts of
Montgomery, Mercer and Auglaize.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Boehner) has consistently provided strong support to our
legislative and communications efforts, has been an honest broker
when disputes arise and has been a fair and balanced voice at the
leadership table,'' the letter says. ``We support his re-election
for conference chairman and urge you to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kasich and Hyde, the letter was signed by
Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman Rep. William
Goodling of Pennsylvania, House Oversight Chairman Rep. William
Thomas of California, Veterans' Affairs Chairman Rep. Bob Stump of
Arizona, and Joint Economic Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Saxton of
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., is running against Boehner. U.S.
Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., dropped out of the race this week
and gave his support to Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the momentum is with us at this time,'' said Tobi
Edwards, Watts' spokeswoman. ``I think at this point we are close
to 100 (votes).''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Transportation Committee which authored a massive, project-filled
highway bill earlier this year, signed a letter in support of Watts
on Thursday. U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chair of the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, also signed the letter,
along with two House members.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Schnittger, Boehner's spokesman, said Boehner believes he
has the votes to be re-elected, but said it's too early to give an
exact count.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable,'' Schinttger said. ``We continue to pick up
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership positions were thrown up for grabs last week when
House Speaker Newt Gingrich first announced he would step down as
speaker, then said he would quit the House altogether. The party's
five leadership positions will be chosen Wednesday by secret
ballot.

CHICAGO IS SUING OVER GUNS FROM SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., La.)  (lb) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The City of Chicago and Cook County filed a $433 million lawsuit
against the gun industry on Thursday, charging that a three-month
police undercover operation found that firearms dealers in
Chicago's suburbs were flooding the city with illegal guns with the
knowledge of nationwide gun manufacturers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which names 22 manufacturers, 12 stores, and four
distributors is based on a new legal theory, that the gun industry
causes a ``public nuisance'' by creating excess costs for Chicago's
police, fire department and public hospitals. It is expected to be
the model for suits by Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco
in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's suit follows another lawsuit brought against the gun
industry by New Orleans two weeks ago, based on different legal
grounds, that gun makers manufacture an unsafe product by failing
to incorporate sufficient safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits represent a new front for cities in their efforts
to reduce urban violence. They incorporate legal arguments used
successfully by several states in suits against the tobacco
industry, and come at a time when individuals have recently stepped
up lawsuits against gun makers who for years successfully beat back
product-liability suits with the assertion that guns do not kill
people _ people do.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of these suits is to go to trial in January in U.S.
District Court in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun manufacturers and retailers know exactly what they're
doing,'' Mayor Richard Daley said Thursday in announcing Chicago's
lawsuit. ``They knowingly market and distribute their deadly
weapons to criminals in Chicago and refuse to impose even the most
basic controls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If money is the only language they understand, then money is
the language we will use to make them understand that they have no
business in Chicago,'' Daley said in announcing the suit at a
police building on the city's west side.
</P>
<P>
   The building is where the police have stored 171 handguns bought
from the suburban gun dealers during the undercover operation.
Posing as members of street gangs, motorcycle toughs or soldiers of
fortune in camouflage, the undercover police officers were able,
they reported, to buy guns from the suburban shops even when they
did not have a state gun permit, and when they boasted they would
use the guns for criminal acts inside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has some of the strictest gun-control laws in the United
States, essentially banning the private ownership of handguns, and
the city's police have led the nation in confiscating handguns,
seizing and destroying more than 178,000 in the past 10 years, the
mayor's office said. Despite these efforts, Chicago continues to be
flooded by new guns, according to a 75-page complaint filed in Cook
County Circuit Court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun manufacturers are saturating gun stores just outside
Chicago's border with far more guns than the lawful gun market
could possibly absorb, because they know there is a large, illegal
market for guns in the city,'' said Brian Crowe, the city's
corporation counsel. This creates a public nuisance in Chicago
comparable to a suburban industry polluting the city with poison
gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Nichols, president of the American Shooting Sports
Council, a trade group, said, ``We as an industry really feel there
is no basis for a suit against the legitimate sale of a product.''
If some rogue dealers are selling guns illegally, Ms. Nichols said,
they should be prosecuted. ``We don't want our guns used for
criminal purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But most manufacturers sell their guns legally to distributors
who in turn sell to the dealers,'' Ms. Nichols said, ``so there is
not the clear-cut chain'' that the lawsuit alleges. The solution to
gun violence, Ms. Nichols said, is for federal and local
authorities to better enforce existing gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School who helped
prepare some of the successful state litigation against cigarette
companies, said several of the state suits, including those in
Mississippi, Florida and Texas, had included arguments about the
tobacco industry causing a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't know for sure how well the theory went'' in winning
the cases, Tribe said, but he said he believed the public-nuisance
argument was helpful.
</P>
<P>
   As for the gun makers' argument that they could not be sued,
because they were several steps removed from the actual illegal
sale of guns, Tribe pointed out that the cigarette companies
invoked that argument in vain when they said cigarettes were sold
by small local stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is irrelevant when you are seeking to show the harm to
a community in the aggregate,'' Tribe said. ``You may not be able
to trace the straight line from the place where the gun is
manufactured to the aorta of the victim, but you can apply
market-share theory,'' Tribe said, as Chicago is trying to do, in
calculating the gun makers' proportionate share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The public-nuisance approach also sidesteps arguments based on
the Second Amendment right to bear arms, Tribe said, since the
constitutional guarantee does not protect gun manufacturers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The suit in New York brought against 50 companies on behalf of
victims of gun violence, is based on an argument similar to the one
in Chicago, said Elisa Barnes, the lawyer representing the victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes argues that the gun companies negligently fail to
supervise how their handguns are distributed and have oversupplied
dealers in states with lax gun-control laws, like Georgia, who then
sell guns illegally to buyers in states with tough gun laws like
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, Hamilton vs. Accu-Tek, will use analysis of statistics
recently collected by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
to try to show that the manufacturers must have known they were
selling far more guns in Georgia and other Southern states than
there were legitimate local buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes said she drew her arguments from cases against
pharmaceutical companies in which the courts allowed the argument
that drug manufacturers could be sued as a group for negligence
even though it was hard to trace whose products had caused harm to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tide has turned,'' Ms. Barnes said. ``The American
public has changed and awakened to the idea that manufacturers have
a responsibility for their products, even gun manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes said it was impossible to tell which legal strategy
would succeed. ``There are many roads to the mountain top,'' she
said. ``So I think it will be a combination of everyone pulling
together.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kairys, a professor at Temple University Law School who
helped prepare the Chicago suit, said that the gun industry, which
is far smaller and less profitable than the tobacco industry, may
have fewer resources to defend itself against multiple lawsuits.
But unlike the tobacco companies, Kairys said, the gun makers have
shown no inclination to settle. ``They are going to have to get
over their feeling of immunity,'' he said.

 &HT;    New crop of station wagons offers versatility, style, space
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Station wagons reached their glory days in the 1950s,
but decades earlier, they were conceived to fetch the elite from
the train station to a hotel or spa and provide adequate space in
the rear to carry everything from overnight case to steamer trunk.
</P>
<P>
   This was when those grand vehicles were clad in real wood. Even
today when an auto enthusiasts gets the chance to inspect a well
restored ``woody,'' it is a pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late '60s and early '70s, the station wagon had
become an icon of suburbia, and not always a flattering one. The
ugly image was parodied in the Chevy Chase movie ``Vacation,''
where the family car was a bizarre conglomeration of vehicles
painted a ghastly army green. The color fit; the station wagon had
become almost military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there's a new crop of wagons. The niche was
nearing extinction _ except for the popular Volvo wagon _ until
European manufacturers opted to give the concept an injection of
youth and vitality.
</P>
<P>
   European drivers love station wagons. Just like Americans, they
have lots to carry. But they don't have lots of road space. The
natural solution is a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   There is a buffet of wagons in the marketplace. Looking for
elegance, luxury and style? Check out the Mercedes E320.
Resplendent with every option, including all-wheel drive, it can
take on the tasks of any highway sport-utility vehicle and still
fit under the portico at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a bit more of a traditionalist, Volvo offers wagons
in a variety of configurations from turbo-charged to all-wheel
drive, leather to sunroofs.
</P>
<P>
   If you need the space, but deep down you want a sports car, Audi
has a new Avant. If the Audi A4 is a sports car with a back seat,
then the Avant is a sports car with a back seat and a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a $34,000 sticker price, but its corporate cousin,
the Volkswagen Passat GLS, offers most all of the same amenities
and performance in an almost nearly as attractive package at about
$23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these wagons offer great performance, handling and
style, they give superior fuel economy to sport-utilities and
better insurance rates as well. And it doesn't hurt a bit that they
are really cool cars.

 &HT;    Cox Interactive shifts gears with new partners
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Interactive Media (http://www.cimedia.com)
unveiled a new look for its 20 city-specific Web sites Thursday,
and a roster of content partners enabling users to shop, chat,
search and catch up on local news.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Winter, president of Cox Interactive, led reporters
through an online presentation highlighting the new features of the
city-specific Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cox seems to have borrowed the best of portal sites, search
engines and other city sites to create a chain of sites geared
toward local communities but also providing other popular services
such as search and chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, people come for content, but they also come for ways to
manage their busy lives,'' Winter said as he announced the addition
of several new content partners including Realtor.com, AutoConnect,
Talk City and the search engine LookSmart. The new additions are
designed to complement the news and information content it gleans
from Cox media partners in each city. Cox Interactive is a unit of
Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc., which also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, which contributes content to the
AccessAtlanta Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Winter also emphasized increased attention to local and
community content. In addition to chat, the company also offers Web
sites for community groups and boasts 2,750 local groups across the
network. Cox also seems to have taken a page from Scott Kurnit's
Mining Company project, allowing individual users to act as
``scouts'' and develop content areas based on personal areas of
interest. The Mining Company (http://www.miningco
</P>
<P>
   .com) recruits experts in various areas from sports to soap
operas and invites them to build their own area filled with links,
news, chat events, features and other information. The Mining
Company's guides, like Cox's scouts, aren't paid employees, but
devoted hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that appears to have potential, as consumers
increasingly turn to the Web for one site that can provide them
with not only news but shopping, search and other online
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said each Cox Interactive Studio has at least 20
staffers, and this commitment to local content and providing the
local community with resources and personal pages fills a huge gap
in the city-site market. With Microsoft's Sidewalk focusing on its
buyer's guide, and Digital City emphasizing links rather than
original content, Cox Interactive seems like a good local news and
community alternative. ``We are sensitive to the fact this is a
highly interactive product and our users seem to like that,''
Winter says.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive spent $1.2 million on research in these markets
and has concluded the combination of search, along with increased
content including chat, classified ads and community involvement,
are the keys to success. Plans also call for the company to add
employment listings and an ``aggressive move into the electronic
shopping arena'' in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have emerged as the leading network of local sites,''
Winter said, adding the network receives an average of 3 million
unique visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a fast maturing medium,'' he says. ``The local
market is maturing more than many people realize. Consumers are
interested in the world, but they want local content as well.

 &HT;    Marketers' natural gas rates heat up consumer confusion
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Betty Wilcher says she's having a hard time figuring
out which natural gas company in Georgia will give her the best
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is you want to know which one is going to save
you money on your bill,'' Wilcher said Thursday. ``It could make a
difference if you're on a fixed income.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's increasingly confused and frustrated by offers coming
from companies certified to sell natural gas now that the industry
has been deregulated in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers' call centers in Atlanta, Syracuse, N.Y., Charleston,
S.C., and Toronto have been buzzing this week with inquiries from
consumers trying to figure out who's offering what, and at what
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Service Commission says it has been receiving
100 calls a day, more than at any time since emotional public
hearings concerning Georgia Power Co.'s Plant Vogtle nuclear plant
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a barrage of conflicting and confusing claims by
marketers about savings, little separates the offers. An analysis
of prices for an average November bill quoted by seven leading
marketers shows a difference of less than $10 between the highest
and lowest monthly charge, with most within $2 of one another.
</P>
<P>
   What may matter most to consumers is to what extent competitors
are willing to guarantee rates in the future, given the volatility
of wholesale gas prices. In addition, marketers themselves say
consumers may base decisions on which competitor they think is the
most reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Latham, president of Roswell, Ga.-based Peachtree
Natural Gas, one of 19 marketers certified to sell gas in Georgia,
compared the process to negotiating car repairs with a mechanic.
``I don't have a clue what he's talking about, so I just go to
someone I trust,'' Latham said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Georgia's gas deregulation law went into effect Nov. 1,
about 1 percent of 1.4 million Atlanta Gas Light Co. customers
eligible to buy gas from an alternate supplier have opted to do so.
Atlanta Gas Light customers who don't make a choice will eventually
be assigned to a marketer at random by the Public Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light customers will see noticeable changes in their
bills in the months ahead, since the company's gas service rates no
longer are controlled by the Public Service Commission. (The PSC
now only regulates AGL's charges for delivering gas.)
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of consumers are expected to choose marketers soon
when temperatures plunge and they pay more attention to their
heating bills. Interest also will be sparked when marketers turn up
the temperature on advertising and promotional campaigns in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, consumers have been bombarded with a wide variety of
claims for gas bill savings and promotional gimmicks reminiscent of
the early days of telecommunications deregulation. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ South Carolina-based SCANA Energy is offering new customers
$50 worth of free gas or $50 gift certificates for groceries for
those who sign up at SCANA stands at Kroger supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Columbia offers home energy audit computer software worth $60.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shell offers a home safety kit or five free movie rentals from
Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia-based Columbia Energy this week launched a joint
marketing deal for 25,000 Amway distributors in Georgia to tout
Columbia's gas service when the sales reps sell cosmetics and
detergents door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone promises savings. United Gas Management, an affiliate
of a Canadian energy company, promises a 10 percent saving on gas
usage plus a 15 percent saving on base charges for delivery of the
gas to homes. Georgia Natural Gas Services, the marketing affiliate
of Atlanta Gas Light, offers a 12 percent saving on delivery
charges. Columbia Energy promises an 18 percent saving on gas and
SCANA, 5 percent. Shell also promises to lock in its rate for one
year, United Gas for three years. Georgia Natural Gas will lock in
a rate for one year but at a rate that is higher than its November
rate. Most other players say future prices will continue to be
subject to a wholesale price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   So consumers will be faced with choices similar to those when
choosing between fixed rate and variable rate mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   A major source of confusion is that marketers are promising
savings on different portions of monthly gas bills.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's new law, marketers can charge whatever they
want for gas.
</P>
<P>
   But they must pay Atlanta Gas Light a long list of regulated
charges for such things as delivering and storing gas, meter
reading, renting capacity on interstate pipelines, replenishing a
fund to pay marketers for uncollectable accounts and the gas
company's public education campaign about deregulation. Those
charges come to about $22 a month for the average residential
account.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the bill is for the gas itself. For a marketer to
calculate that cost, it has to take into account a customer's
``Dedicated Design Day Capacity,'' which measures how much gas a
home or residence will require on the coldest day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But marketers need the statistic to make their calculation, and
they report difficulty in obtaining it. Atlanta Gas Light doesn't
plan to start listing the capacity figure on bills until January.
Next year, marketers will also get broader access to consumer
information from Atlanta Gas Light that will make it easier for
them to quote prices.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers were thrown for a loop this week when Atlanta Gas
Light published the rates it plans to charge for gas itself during
the transition to deregulation _ a charge separate from regulated
delivery charges.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers that had planned to base their rates on particular
savings from Atlanta Gas Light's said the company's formula was too
much of a moving target for them to use as a benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It throws our pricing off, no two ways about it,'' said Randy
S. Michael, SCANA's manager of Georgia operations. Instead of
immediate 5 percent savings, SCANA is promising the savings over a
12-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Energy Services abandoned an offer of 10 percent below
Atlanta Gas Light's rates, said Tim Sheehan, Georgia marketing
manager for the Texas company, because AGL's rates ``were all over
the board.'' The company is now offering a rate that is guaranteed
for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light's new gas rates came months after the company
adopted a new formula for its charges for delivering gas that
evened out costs over the year. Before, those charges were pegged
to monthly gas usage.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers accustomed to low summer rates were subjected to rate
shock in July, prompting the PSC to order a rate rollback. Now,
however, consumers who use low levels of gas are expected to see an
upturn on their gas charges this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that the smaller users could once again see
increases,'' said PSC member Lauren McDonald. He added that the
commission could step in again if Atlanta Gas Light's rates ``get
too out of line.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Gas Light President Paula Rosput said the utility made
the changes to protect itself against risks as an unregulated
company. She said AGL is aiming to ``make unregulated sales
indistinguishable'' from last year's rates and to withdraw from gas
sales as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to profit from the sale of gas,'' she
insisted. ``It's confusing to the consumer, but what are we
supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the promised savings and benefits of deregulation,
James Frazier of Covington said he's skeptical. Frazier said he has
heard claims by marketers that they will save their customers 5 or
6 percent, ``but until you get their bill how will you know?''

 &HT;    State hangs up on telemarketers with `don't-call' list
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Georgians who want to limit telemarketing calls,
today _ Friday the 13th _ is a lucky day.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, consumers may, for a $5 charge, place their
telephone number on the ``Georgia No-Call List'' most telemarketers
are banned from calling. Telemarketers who call someone on the list
may be subjected to a $2,000 fine per call.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission has scheduled a news conference
today to announce a toll-free telephone number and an Internet
address for consumers to sign up if they want to join the list,
which goes into effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, applications for the no-call list were mailed with
telephone bills to all telephone customers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who join the list should expect fewer calls from
Georgia-based telemarketers, at least. The no-call list also
applies to telemarketers based in other states, but it may be
difficult to enforce the law against out-of-state marketers who say
the law doesn't apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Reid, administrator of the Georgia Office of Consumer
Affairs, charged with enforcing the no-call list, said he has
``every intention of vigorously enforcing the law,'' including
legal actions in other states when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Exempted from the no-call list are companies that have a current
or previous relationship with the customer, political pollsters and
candidates for public offices, and religious or charity groups.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have unsuccessfully lobbied Congress for several
years to pass legislation requiring a national do-not-call list for
telemarketers. Eventually, a national list may be established, but
meanwhile a number of states have established their own lists.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress did require telemarketers to establish
their own no-call lists of consumers who say they don't want to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   But it was left up to the consumer to tell each unwanted

 &HT;    Durable Corolla still on a roll
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Toyota Corolla is far from being the flagship of
Toyota's fleet, but it continues to sail along with some features
not always found on top-of-the-line models and a remarkable record
of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Durability, in fact, is a major reason why Consumer Guide and
other value-conscious raters consistently give the compact
front-driver ``best buy'' ratings. If that isn't convincing,
consider this: The Corolla, now available in three trim levels with
a base price range of $12,218 to $14,868, has been on the American
market for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Look at all the models that have come and gone since the first
Corolla arrived from Japan, including Toyota's recently axed Supra
sports car, and it's obvious there's something right about the
little sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The list has to include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Optional side air bags ($250). OK, the 2,400-pound Corolla's
174-inch length means it's only a blip on the windscreens of
trucks, sport-utility vehicles and many cars, but it's got these
and other safety features aplenty. Anti-lock brakes, too, are
optional ($550), but at least they're offered, and Toyota's system
is one of the smoothest and most effective around.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cheerful little engine _ 1.8 liters and four cylinders _
that gets good mileage even when driven vigorously or when heavily
loaded. Like any four-cylinder, it can be noisy when it's time to
hustle and merge, but it manages to make 122 pounds-feet of torque
at a rapidly reached 4,400 rpm and pulls willingly up to the
6,000-rpm range with maximum muscle of 120 horsepower coming at
5,600 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Both three- and four-speed automatic transmission are offered,
and they're smooth enough to be a boon in creep-and-crawl
situations, and the overdrive lockout improves driveability up and
down hills. But Toyota's manual transmissions are well-developed
ones, and while the five-speed noticeably improves fuel mileage by
2-3 mpg, the real advantage is that manual shifting makes the most
of the engine's perkiness.
</P>
<P>
   _ An interior with trim and conveniences that won't leave owners
feeling their car was yanked off the assembly line before getting
its fair share of features and attention. The plastic, to be sure,
is apparent, but cloth door inserts give a touch of class, and the
fit and finish don't suggest that the Corolla doesn't get the same
workmanship as Toyota's higher-priced vehicles. Seams are
close-fitting, and the controls are more than basic without being
complex or redundant.
</P>
<P>
   The test Corolla CE _ more equipment than the VE, but not as
much as the LE _ went from a base price of $12,908 to a bottom line
of $16,403 after adding options and destination charges. Included
were the four-speed automatic, air bags, anti-lock brakes and a
$1,670 package of features both expected (AC, power locks and
windows) and questionable (heavy-duty defogger with timer). The
add-on pricing is a major reason most reviewers note the Corolla is
not the cheapest little sedan on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the Corolla is a car that goes willingly, has the interior
space to take a family of four and some cabin cargo and won't
create discomfort because it's a rough or noisy ride. It's got the
inherent small-car weaknesses of a tight back seat, barely adequate
headroom and less-than-great visibility but, in the long run, the
Corolla's got a record that says it will go the distance
efficiently and reasonably comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Toyota Corolla CE front-wheel-drive compact
sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $16,403 (includes discount not always
available; base: $12,908)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, optional side air bags
($250), optional power anti-lock brakes with front discs and rear
drums ($550), side-impact beams, height-adjustable front shoulder
belts, daytime running lights
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine (120 horsepower),
optional four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive lockout
($800)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: cruise control, $250; value
package with air conditioner, cassette player with four speakers,
heavy-duty rear defogger, heavy-duty starter, heavy-duty wiper
motor, rear heater/AC ducts, power windows and locks ($1,670),
dealer-installed mats, $74
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 28 mpg regular unleaded city, 36 mpg highway

 Pac Bell Balks At Paying Rivals  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Pacific Bell is refusing to pay more than $30 million it owes to
competing local phone companies despite a ruling by state
regulators ordering the company to pay its bills.
<P>
   MCI WorldCom, Pac-West and ICG Communications say Pac Bell owes
their companies millions of dollars for handling phone traffic that
comes to their networks from Pac Bell customers.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the state Public Utilities Commission ordered
Pac Bell to pay the money, but the company has so far refused.
Company officials say they are confused by the commission's ruling
and plan to file an application for a rehearing to clarify the
PUC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Pac Bell is keeping the money it owes in an
interest-bearing escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear from the commission's ruling how much Pac Bell
could potentially owe the phone companies, and the definitions they
use in the ruling need clarification,'' said Bill Mashek, a Pac
Bell spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's competitors say the company is not confused about the
issue and is merely stalling because it doesn't want to turn over
the money. At least one company, Pac-West Telecomm, plans to ask
the PUC to intervene and has already filed a lawsuit against Pac
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They owe us more than $27 million,'' said Wally Griffin, CEO
of Pac-West in Stockton. ``They're in violation of the order and
it's time for them to pay up.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, competing phone companies must reimburse one
another for ``terminating'' local calls. For instance, if a Pac
Bell customer calls a neighbor who uses MCI WorldCom for local
service, Pac Bell is supposed to pay MCI WorldCom for taking the
call on its network.
</P>
<P>
   It's known as reciprocal compensation, and it's meant to
compensate competing local phone companies, which must sink
millions of dollars into their networks in order to handle calls
from other telephone providers.
</P>
<P>
   The competing carriers are owed so much money because they
provide dial tone to Internet service providers, such as America
Online and Netcom. Whenever a Pac Bell customer logs on to the
Internet, Pac Bell is supposed to pay whichever company provides
phone service to the ISP. In some cases, Pac Bell provides service
to ISPs, but most ISPs have alternative carriers because their
rates are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid paying the fees, Pac Bell and other regional Bell
operating companies have been arguing that calls to ISPs are
long-distance, not local, and therefore exempt from reciprocal
compensation. They contend that the Internet is a global network
and calls to it cannot be considered local.
</P>
<P>
   But the PUC disagreed. In its October 22 ruling, it said calls
to ISPs are local if the modem being called is within 12 miles of
the caller's home. About 23 other states have also classified the
calls as local.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to decide
within the next two weeks whether the calls are indeed local or
long-distance. In a speech Wednesday, FCC Chairman William Kennard
said the agency won't interfere with what state commissions have
already ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell said it wants to see how the FCC classifies the calls
before paying the money, but its competitors say that's not fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ruling that says they should pay, so they should
pay,'' said Doug Garrett, senior director of government affairs
with ICG in Colorado. ``As long as it remains unsolved it's a sword
hanging over our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said ICG is owed more than $5 million by Pac Bell, an
amount that Pac Bell officials dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell is not alone in its refusal to pay reciprocal
compensation. Baby Bells across the country have been withholding
payment, including SBC Communications Inc., the parent of Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The tide seems to be turning in some regions, however. Three
weeks ago, Ameritech Corp. agreed to pay Focal Communications Corp.
$7 million the company said it was owed for calls in Chicago.

 Netscape's KidsZone Wins Privacy Seal  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Netscape's KidsZone has become the second Internet site to receive
a privacy ``seal of approval'' from TRUSTe, a nonprofit privacy
group.
<P>
   The TRUSTe endorsement, to be announced in the next few days,
indicates that KidsZone ( &LR; www.netscape.com/kids &LR; ) adheres to
privacy guidelines passed by Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation requires sites to disclose when they are
collecting personal information from children and to obtain
parents' permission beforehand. Currently, many Web sites use
games, contests, surveys or electronic pen pal programs as a guise
to get kids to disclose their names, e-mail addresses, weekly
allowances and shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   Having the TRUSTe endorsement ``lets parents know that our
data-collection practices are up to par and its a safe place for
kids to go and explore the World Wide Web,'' said Tess Koleczek,
data protection manager at Netscape of Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   The TRUSTe kids' seal is a drawing of a seal balancing a red
ball on its nose. After proving that they meet TRUSTe's privacy
standards, companies pay a licensing fee ranging from $299 to
$4,999, based on revenues, to carry the seal on their sites.
Yahoo's children's site (www.yahooligans.com) recently received a
TRUSTe endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Founded in 1996, TRUSTe is a business-backed group pushing
voluntary guidelines on the Internet rather than legislation. The
Palo Alto group, supported by such businesses as IBM, America
Online and Microsoft, also licenses a privacy seal for 345 general
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet, you don't know who you can trust,'' said
Susan Scott, TRUSTe's executive director. ``The goal (of the seal
program) is to make people more confident with buying on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some privacy advocates have criticized TRUSTe because
they argue that legislation is necessary, the children's seal
program has received a warmer reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our criticism of TRUSTe was that anyone who posted privacy
information would get the (general) seal. But the children's
program has some value because it is backed by legal standards,''
said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Group, a public interest research center.

TORRE TAKES AL'S PRIZE AS MANAGER OF THE YEAR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some might find it surprising that on a team that won
114 regular-season games and 11 more in the post season, including
four straight in the World Series, it's likely that only one member
will be awarded a major individual honor: Manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not so odd to Torre, who was named the American
League manager of the year Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not strange when you look at our club,'' said Torre, who
was co-manager of the year with Texas' Johnny Oates in 1996 and who
won the National League version of the award with Atlanta in 1982.
``I've been comparing our club to the old Celtics, where everyone
scored 16 to 18 points a game and worked well as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   That unit may not be exactly the same next season for Torre, who
has now guided the Yankees to two World Series championships in his
three years as manager. Torre is well aware that his best player,
Bernie Williams, may sign elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At Yankee Stadium Thursday, Torre said he hoped that his
free-agent center fielder would base his decision on ``something
more than dollar signs'' in ``what could be the last contract of
his career.'' Torre, who last spoke to Williams at the Yankees'
victory parade, said he has told Williams just that. He said he
also told his center fielder he is available for him if he has any
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to weigh what everything means,'' Torre said. ``But
don't minimize the comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that comfort zone obviously has to do with the
58-year-old Torre, who received 23 of the 28 first-place votes in
balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. But that
might not be enough to keep Williams with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the realization of the chance he wouldn't be back
started a couple of years ago,'' Torre said. ``And if he won't be
back, we had a great three years together. You can't ask for much
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, someone like Brian Jordan to replace Williams,
should Williams leave the Yanks. Torre managed Jordan with the St.
Louis Cardinals. Torre said he thought he had a good relationship
with Jordan then. He remembered the outfielder, who also played in
the National Football League, as ``a very aggressive young man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' Torre said, ``I had to send him out to the
minors a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has mostly played right field during his career. But,
Torre said, that was because the Cardinals always had Ray Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Brian can play center field,'' Torre said, adding that
he will probably be with General Manager Brian Cashman next week
when Cashman meets with Jordan, who has been extended an invitation
to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And so, it seems, Torre is moving on _ with or without Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand where Bernie has to take it all in,'' Torre said.
``But if you wait too long, you wind up with an empty Christmas
tree.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Torre will probably get a contract extension soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very close,'' said Torre, whose 302 victories
with the Yankees are the second-most three-year total of any
manager in franchise history (Ralph Houk's teams won 309). ``It
hasn't been talked about with everything else going on. But I don't
anticipate there will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for Joe,'' Steinbrenner said of Torre's award.
``This is a richly deserved honor. Joe has done an outstanding job
for the Yankees and we have a great rapport. This has been a great
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``George is going to fix it if it's broke. The great
thing about working with him is that he wants to win and needs to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what Torre has done with the Yankees. His
record with them is 302-184. Torre has guided the Yankees to the
postseason in each of his first three seasons with them, something
only Casey Stengel and Houk had done. Torre was 894-1,003 in his
managerial career before joining the Yankees; his career record as
manager is now 1,196-1,187.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thursday's honor, Torre was gracious.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes me a pretty good manager is pretty good players,''
Torre said. ``You can't win the Derby on a quarter horse.''

 Firm May Have Broken Disability Act  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My sister was recently demoted from a marketing job to a
clerical position because she has a hearing problem. Her supervisor
complained that the other staff always had to ``get up from their
desks'' in order to speak to my sister. The supervisor had
encouraged her to get a hearing aid and initially said the company
would pay for it. But later he changed his mind and said he'd give
my sister her bonus early so she could buy the hearing aid herself.
What can she do, without having to spend a fortune on legal help?
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  This company may have violated your sister's rights
under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA and similar state laws require employers to provide a
``reasonable accommodation'' for their disabled employees. That
doesn't mean the company should have paid for a hearing aid: The
ADA doesn't require firms to foot the bill for personal aid devices
that employees use outside of work.
</P>
<P>
   But it does mean the company should have at least explored ways
to help your sister continue in her marketing job, said Linda Kilb,
an attorney with the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund
in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   There are some jobs _ such as a Wall Street trader who must
instantly respond to shouted buy or sell orders _ that would be
impossible to do with a hearing impairment. But many typical office
jobs can be adapted quite easily for someone with limited hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my office know I can't hear overhead pages, so they
just come and get me,'' said Kilb, who uses a hearing aid. ``It's
very unlikely that having to take a little more time to communicate
would be an undue hardship on the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Your sister doesn't need a lawyer to file a complaint about her
demotion with federal or state civil rights agencies. For more
information, she should call the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission at (800) 669-4000 or the California Department of Fair
Employment and Housing at (800) 884-1684.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't hurt to get a professional assessment of her
situation from a lawyer. Most good attorneys will provide an
initial consultation for free or for a small fee.
</P>
<P>
   Your sister could also call the nonprofit Employment Law Center
in San Francisco, which offers free legal advice to low-income
workers, at (415) 864-8208. Or she could call the Disability Rights
Education and Defense Fund for assistance and referrals at (510)
644-2555.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: I just noticed that my company 401(k) plan passes charges
an annual fee of 1 percent to its employees. The fee is charged by
the plan administrator. Is this a standard practice? It seems to me
that if we employees are paying for the plan, it isn't much of an
employer-provided benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's pretty common for employees with 401(k) accounts to be
charged for the administrative costs of their plan, according to
Gary Blank, a 401(k) expert with William M. Mercer in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size of the plan _ its total assets and number
of members _ such fees can range from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative fees cover the cost of services like quarterly
statements and annual reports on the plan, 24-hour hotlines with
information on your account, or educational brochures about
investing and retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal pension law says that any reasonable charges for
administration of a plan can be charged against the plan,'' Blank
said.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're footing the bill for these administrative costs,
what benefit is your employer really providing?
</P>
<P>
   Most employers pay the legal expenses and audit costs of their
401(k) plans, which can add up to $10,000 or more. Some employers
also match their workers' contributions to the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, employers help you out simply by offering the plan _
a tax-deferred savings option that wouldn't be available to you
without their help.

RED SOX TALK TO BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ While the Red Sox are among the high rollers
pursuing free agent center fielder Bernie Williams in the wake of
Mo Vaughn's departure, a more attainable target appears to be
Albert Belle, the free agent left fielder whose skills as a slugger
have often been overshadowed by his antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday general manager Dan Duquette flew to an undisclosed
location to meet with Belle, who has a unique contract provision
that gives him until Dec. 2 to decide whether he wants to leave his
current team, the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials with three other clubs attending this
week's GM meetings here, the New York Yankees are the only other
team besides the Red Sox with major interest in Belle, and the
Yankees may be looking at him only as a fallback plan in case they
cannot retain Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, meanwhile, has a host of suitors, including the
Arizona Diamondbacks, who Wednesday denied reports that they
offered him a seven-year, $100 million deal after his meeting with
owner Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's contract with the White Sox stipulates that he has a
30-day window to explore free agency if he no longer ranks among
the three highest-paid players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who has three years left on a contract paying him $10
million annually, has dropped out of the top three, and when the
White Sox rejected his request to increase his salary by $1.42
million a year, he entered the free agent market. His agent, Arn
Tellem, also represents Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and had
already spoken with Duquette before Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There were strong indications that a deal for Belle could happen
very quickly. While White Sox GM Ron Schueler said here this week
that he wants Belle back, there was speculation that the Red Sox
were able to issue a take it-or-leave-it offer to Vaughn because
they had been given assurances that Belle would sign with Boston.
Duquette has spoken highly of Belle in interviews, as has CEO John
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best hitters in the game,'' Duquette said of
Belle, who last season batted .328 with 49 home runs and 152 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Red Sox appeared to be closing in on a deal for
Belle, they're looking at Williams as well. Last night there were
indications that Duquette could be attempting to arrange a meeting
Friday, probably in Arizona, with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's contract with the White Sox, which includes a $5 million
buyout, established a benchmark salary when he signed as a free
agent after the 1996 season. He undoubtedly will seek an extension
of several years at a higher sum from the Red Sox, who almost
certainly can expect to pay more to sign Belle _ or Williams _ than
the five-year, $60 million-plus offer they made to Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has said he would not be
``afraid'' to sign Belle. New York could platoon Ricky Ledee and
Chad Curtis in center if it loses Williams, with Belle playing
left.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two biggest prizes among position players on
the free agent market, the Red Sox have made overtures to
lefthanded-hitting free agent Robin Ventura, the Gold Glove third
baseman for the White Sox who could move to first.
</P>
<P>
   They also are expected to inquire about free agent first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro, who hit 43 home runs for the Orioles last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox can also be expected to ask about San Diego left fielder
Greg Vaughn, who may be on the market despite hitting 50 home runs
last season, and Dodgers right fielder Gary Sheffield. White Sox
first baseman Frank Thomas also could be available in a trade, a
scenario that became even more plausible when Chicago acquired
promising first baseman Paul Konerko from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox sign Belle, they are expected to attempt to trade
incumbent left fielder Troy O'Leary, whose contract (he has three
years left on a four-year, $14.8 million deal) may scare away
potential suitors. O'Leary hit just .233 in the second half of the
season and went 1 for 16 in the playoffs, further reducing his
value in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   While Duquette has said replacing Vaughn's bat now becomes the
club's No. 1 focus, both he and Harrington have also said that
acquiring another front-line starting pitcher was the club's most
important offseason priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are not in the running for free agents Randy
Johnson, Kevin Brown, or Todd Stottlemyre. And as farfetched as it
may sound, the club has not abandoned the possibility of trying to
reacquire Roger Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays, whose budget
has been slashed. The Jays listened to offers for Clemens this
week. They've been asking for impact players in return, which would
seem to leave the Sox out of the mix, though Boston could perhaps
package a second baseman (Jeff Frye) and an outfielder for Clemens,
which would meet two of the Blue Jays' most pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be a paltry return for a pitcher expected to
win his second straight Cy Young Award and record-setting fifth
overall next week. Officials with two other clubs insisted that the
Blue Jays will not move Clemens unless they can get star players,
but the righthander also has the right to ask to be traded to a
contender if Toronto opts to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Belle evokes strong feelings among club officials, many of whom
are as impressed by his potent bat as they are repulsed by his
actions away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as intense and as focused a player as I've ever seen
after 7 o'clock,'' said one American League executive. ``But he is
such a negative presence in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Another club official and former big league manager said that in
order to replace Vaughn, the Red Sox would have to sign both Belle
and Ventura. Asked whom he would want on his team, Vaughn or Belle,
the official said, ``It's not even a question. Mo Vaughn is such a
leader, such a standup guy for his teammates, such a presence in
addition to being a great hitter, that he's the guy you have to
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Boston, this is worse than losing Roger Clemens. A player
like him comes around just a couple of times a century. For the Red
Sox losing players, it goes Babe Ruth, Mo Vaughn, then Roger
Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   When Belle became a free agent for the first time after the 1996
season, he attracted attention from several clubs, including the
Florida Marlins, before White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf swooped in
with an offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had big-time interest,'' said former Marlins executive Gary
Hughes, now with the Colorado Rockies. ``He's just a tremendous
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being twinned with the Big Hurt, Thomas, Belle was
unable to make a winner of the White Sox, who were not in
contention in either of the two years in which he played in
Chicago. The team's attendance also dropped dramatically in the
last two seasons.

 A Shot of Prevention   By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Michael Garey oversees staffing at a Sunnyvale startup firm with
just 72 employees _ small enough that even one person's illness can
create a big problem.
<P>
   So Garey jumped at the chance this week to bring in nurses from
El Camino Hospital to give flu shots to his employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that by giving them on site, we'd encourage more
people to get shots than if we left them to their own devices,''
said Garey, human resources director at Somnus Medical Technology,
which makes surgical devices to cure snoring and other sleep
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   More employers like Somnus are offering flu shots at work these
days, spurred by a 1995 study showing that vaccinated adult workers
took about half as many days off for flu and flu-like ailments as
their unvaccinated peers.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for Human Resource Management says that 57 percent
of its member companies provide on-site flu shots. And Aviron _ a
Mountain View firm that is developing a flu vaccine that can be
administered nasally _ estimates that eight out of 10 companies
with 1,000 or more workers now offer flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty percent of all flu shots given last year were given
through employer-based programs,'' said Carol Olson, senior vice
president at Aviron. ``Companies see it as an employee benefit,
because employees like it. Companies also get the benefit of
increased productivity, because people don't all call in sick at
one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Flu shots are part of a bigger trend toward greater corporate
involvement in preventive health programs. Companies today offer
services ranging from stop-smoking classes and on-site fitness
clubs to annual cholesterol screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate flu shots really took off in the wake of a 1995
Minnesota study by Dr. Kristin Nichol that was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   That study tracked 849 working adults who received either a flu
shot or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccinated group reported 25 percent fewer episodes of upper
respiratory illness, 43 percent fewer days of sick leave due to
such illnesses and 44 percent fewer doctors' visits.
</P>
<P>
   It estimated the cost savings from flu shots at an average of
$46.85 per person vaccinated _ about $6 in averted medical care,
and $40 in sick days that didn't have to be taken. Workplace flu
shots typically cost employers about $10 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nichol's study was very well done and documented that there
were substantial illnesses prevented and costs saved,'' said Dr.
Raymond Strikas, an epidemiologist with the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Strikas and some other medical experts caution that
researchers haven't yet shown that flu shots are equally effective
in other years or over a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would want to see this reproduced over time in order to
say to an employer, `You will definitely save money by offering
this vaccine to your employees,''' Strikas added.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also warn that not all corporate flu shot programs will
be equally effective.
</P>
<P>
   Their success depends on how many employees choose to be
vaccinated. That, in turn, depends on how strongly a company
promotes its flu shot program _ and on whether it subsidizes it.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like Somnus, pay the entire cost of flu shots
for their workers. Others, like Hewlett-Packard, ask their
employees to pay the cost of the shots, which in HP's case is $8.
</P>
<P>
   Aviron's market research indicates that only 20 percent of
employees get shots if they have to pay, while 30 to 40 percent get
them if the company foots the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When employers fully subsidize it, the participation rates
double,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a risk that if federal health experts don't
prescribe the correct vaccine recipe for a particular flu season,
shots won't do anyone much good.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter was a good example. Federal health officials, who
tell vaccine manufacturers what to produce each year, didn't
predict one particular strain of flu called ``Sydney A'' that ended
up sweeping across America.
</P>
<P>
   So the flu shots received by 70 million Americans didn't stop
Sydney A. And countless people ended up feverish and miserable,
despite those needles in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a study last year and found it was not cost-effective
to vaccinate working adults _ but that was because it was a poor
match between the vaccine and the virus,'' said Dr. Carolyn
Buxton-Bridges, an epidemiologist in the influenza branch of the
CDC. ``We're crossing all our fingers and toes that we'll have
better luck this year.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Buxton-Bridges and other CDC researchers will
continue trying to measure the efficacy of workplace vaccinations.
Meanwhile, some companies are also trying to do their own research
on the costs and benefits of flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron is one local company doing its own study. The oil
company gave shots to about 1,200 of its 6,400 Bay Area employees
this fall. In some of its work sites, Chevron asked employees to
pay for the shots. But it arranged for a health insurer to cover
the full cost for its truck drivers based in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chevron will try to track the number of flu-related absences
this winter among its vaccinated and unvaccinated drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really moving more toward trying to evaluate the success
of these programs,'' said Sara Kashima, preventive health
specialist at Chevron.

 Gap Profits Beat Street's Estimates _ Again  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Gap Inc. exceeded earnings estimates for the third quarter in a row
yesterday when it reported a 45 percent surge in profits, driven by
strong sales across most divisions.
<P>
   Diluted earnings per share jumped from 40 cents in last year's
third quarter to 60 cents, beating Wall Street estimates by about 6
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Net earnings totaled $237.7 million for the quarter ending
October 31, up from $164.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Net
revenue jumped 36 percent to $2.4 billion from $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gap's profits are growing significantly faster than sales
because it is getting more bang for its real estate buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``When same-store sales are growing and you pay the same amount
in rent one year as the next, those payments are a smaller
percentage of sales,'' said Warren Hashagen, Gap's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Gap's cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses, which includes
lease expenses, rose 32 percent in the third quarter, according to
the company's earnings statement.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, Gap's same-store sales, which measure performance at
stores open at least a year, rose 13 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing Old Navy division led the company, with
same-store sales rising slightly more than 20 percent, Hashagen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales increases at Banana Republic hit the
mid-teens &UR;  &LR; on a percentage basis and at Gap stores sales rose in
the high single digits, said Hashagen, declining to be more
specific. GapKids lagged the others with growth in the low single
digits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the retailer's strong financial performance, Gap's stock
slid $2.56 yesterday to close at $66.13. Investors apparently are
worried about Gap's earnings in the fourth quarter. In the final
quarter of 1997, Gap same-store sales grew 10 percent, making it
harder to generate strong increases this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gap stock has nearly doubled in value this year from about $35
in early January.
</P>
<P>
   Gap operated 2,344 locations at the end of the quarter, up from
2,077 at the same point in 1997. Earlier this year, it opened its
first personal care and intimate apparel store, GapBody, in New
Jersey. It also runs 1,083 Gap stores, 616 GapKids, 262 Old Navy
and 281 Banana Republic stores.

 Matrix Using Injections to Attack Tumors  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A Fremont biotech firm said it's been able to shrink tumors by
injecting them directly with chemotherapy drugs, giving doctors a
new way to attack cancers that have resisted treatment by surgery,
radiation or traditional chemotherapy.
<P>
   Matrix Pharmaceutical will present its cancer trial data today
at a Chemotherapy Symposium at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company will report that it injected its chemotherapy agent
directly into the tumors of 30 women with advanced breast cancer.
In 13 cases, the tumors shrank by more than 80 percent, a result
that Matrix chief scientist Dennis Brown called ``very promising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These were late-stage cancers that had already failed to be
cured by surgery, radiation or typical systemic chemotherapy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously,
flowing through the patient's bloodstream. They generally are used
to kill cancer cells that have spread from the original cancer
site.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said large tumors resist traditional chemo because it's
hard to get enough of the cancer-killing drug to the tumor without
harming innocent tissue on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix has patented its system for injecting tumors with a
natural gel that carries the cancer-killing drug. The gel coats the
tumor, releasing the chemo slowly, concentrating its power while
lessening its side effects on healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   Rhett Brown, a financial analyst with Volpe, Brown &AMP; Whelan,
said Matrix is the only company he knows of that is developing
targeted-delivery systems for chemotherapy agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a little less competition than other biotech firms
in the cancer realm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer David Ludvigson said Matrix is more than
a year away from asking the Food and Drug Administration for
approval to market its cancer technology, called IntraDose.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the FDA surprised Matrix by turning down a request to
sell a similar direct-injection technology for genital warts.
Although several European countries approved the technology, the
FDA said the injections left bumps on patients.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix's Brown said he doesn't think the FDA will judge the
cancer technology as harshly. Genital warts are considered mainly a
cosmetic problem, &UR;  &LR; whereas cancer is life-threating. He predicted
that the benefit of shrinking tumors would outweigh the possibility
that the injection would cause bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix shares had hit a high of $7.69 before the FDA rejection.
They tumbled on the news but recovered somewhat after the company
laid off a third of its workforce, now 110, and refocused its
efforts on cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix closed up 19 cents yesterday at $2.63.

DOLLASE DAZED AS WIN SINKS IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Craig Dollase hasn't come home from Kentucky
yet. And the youngest person to train a Breeders' Cup winner hasn't
come back to earth, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just kind of letting it soak in right now,'' Dollase, 27,
said on the phone from Churchill Downs in Louisville, where he
watched Reraise and jockey Corey Nakatani lead most of the way to
win the $1 million Breeders' Cup Sprint on Saturday. ``It was a
thrilling experience, especially being there with my family; that
was the special part of it. I didn't want it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   After a big day at the track, racing tradition says the winning
trainer goes to dinner with the winning owners. After the Breeders'
Cup, Dollase went to dinner with his parents, sister Michelle,
brother-in-law Nakatani, and one of his owners, Moon S. Han.
</P>
<P>
   Two reasons: Reraise's four-way ownership was going off in too
many directions that night. And Dollase wanted to share the
celebration with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's father, Wally, is a Breeders' Cup-winning trainer in his
own right, having saddled Jewel Princess for the Distaff in 1996 at
Woodbine. Craig assisted Wally and gives him credit for his own
fast start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been my mentor from day 1,'' said Dollase, who will
return to Hollywood Park after running Golden Eagle Farms' Fleet
Lady in the Churchill Downs Distaff Handicap on Saturday. ``Like my
dad says, you're only as good as your help is, and I really have a
good team behind me.'' His assistant, Nick Hines, runs some horses
in his own name.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase, an Arcadia High graduate, briefly studied business at
Citrus College before ``I got the racing bug.'' After working at
the Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Del Mar barns alongside his
father, his mother Cincy and his sister Aimee, Craig got his
trainer's license in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Wally signed a contract to train exclusively
for Saudi Arabian Prince Ahmed bin Salman's Thoroughbred Corp.
Wally turned most of his other horses over to Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Craig cashed in that lucky break by leading all trainers at
Hollywood Park last summer, winning with 19 of 38 starters, an
incredible percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He has about 35 horses in his barn and about 15 owners, and
hopes the numbers and the quality will increase because of the
Breeders' Cup publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to do this all my life,'' said Dollase, who lives in
Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase disagrees with the notion that he's hitching his future
to a dying sport. ``Seeing 80,000 people out here at Churchill
Downs (for the Breeders' Cup), I think it's pretty popular,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits, ``It's getting hard for the little guy (trainer)
to survive. Hopefully, I'll be in the other (bigger) category.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: Three-year-old Reraise is on his way back to
Hollywood Park too and could run again as soon as the Dec. 26
Malibu Stakes at Santa Anita. That opening-day race is expected to
include Artax and Event of the Year as well.
</P>
<P>
   It was hoped that Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again
would show up here, especially since owner Frank Stronach predicted
last week that he'll complete the purchase of Santa Anita by
mid-December. But Awesome Again's retirement to stud at Stronach's
Adena Springs Farm in Kentucky was announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Likely Horse of the Year Skip Away and Southern California
favorite Gentlemen, both soundly beaten in the Classic, are
retiring as well.
</P>
<P>
   At least Silver Charm is going on. The Classic runner-up is
scheduled to stay at Churchill for the Clark Handicap on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The other major post-Breeders' Cup retirement is that of Sharp
Cat, the nation's leading 4-year-old filly, who had to miss the
Distaff after a severe case of muscle cramps nearly killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Skip it: Let's not dignify the Awesome Again-for-Horse of the
Year campaign by discussing it at length, at least not until we
need an end-of-year column.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say: If you vote for Awesome Again, who was

CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLANNER ASKS COURT TO CLEAR HIS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Ira Magaziner on Thursday urged a
federal appeals court to clear him of a judge's accusation that he
lied under oath about the work of President Clinton's task force on
health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong hearing before the court, a Justice Department
lawyer maintained that Magaziner, the chief architect of Clinton's
ill-fated health care plan, had told the truth and nothing but the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Magaziner's declaration was not false,'' said the lawyer,
Jacob Lewis. ``There was no need to correct or update it.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusation at issue dates from last December, when U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth found that the White House and the
Justice Department had participated in a ``reprehensible'' effort
to cover up false statements by Magaziner. The judge said he had
relied on those statements as an authoritative account of the
President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform and its
inter-agency working group.
</P>
<P>
   In his finding of misconduct, Lamberth ordered the government to
pay $285,864 to cover legal fees and other costs of doctors and
consumer groups that had filed suit to gain access to meetings of
the task force and its staff in 1993. The Clinton administration
challenged that order Thursday in the District of Columbia U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors who investigated the case at Lamberth's behest
concluded in 1995 that there was no evidence Magaziner had tried to
mislead the court. Magaziner still works on the White House staff,
as the president's adviser on the Internet and electronic commerce,
but he plans to leave by the end of this year and is now trying
redeem his reputation. He wants the appeals court to void the lower
court's finding that he lied.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin Nathan, his lawyer, told the appeals court, ``Mr.
Magaziner is an honorable and honest public servant whose
previously impeccable reputation has been improperly stained by the
District Court's unfounded conclusion that he deliberately swore to
a false and misleading declaration.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said Lamberth had distorted
Magaziner's statements and in any event had not relied on them in
his original rulings. Moreover, they said, Magaziner merely signed
statements that had been drafted for him by White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The case has a tangled history. In a sworn declaration in 1993,
Magaziner said all members of the task force and its staff were
government employees _ a statement that, if true, might have
allowed them to conduct their business in secret.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the task force recruited scores of experts from private
industry to advise the Clinton administration on how to redesign
the nation's health care system to control costs and guarantee
insurance for all Americans. Magaziner contends that these people
were all regular or special government employees, under rather
elastic definitions of those terms.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 law requires that the meetings of federal advisory
committees be open and that the committees make their work papers
available for public inspection. But the law does not apply to
committees ``composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of
the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration initially indicated that it would use this
exception to defend the secrecy of the inter-agency working group
that sifted options for the president's task force. But it later
emphasized another argument, telling Lamberth that the president's
health plan had been devised by ``an anonymous horde'' of more than
500 people operating in creative confusion with no organized
structure and no fixed roster of members. Hence, it said, the 1972
law did not apply.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed recently with the appeals court, Magaziner cited
statements made this year on the floor of the House of
Representatives as evidence of the damage to his reputation. Rep.
Ernest Istook, R-Okla., said Magaziner had ``lied to the court.''
Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., said Magaziner ``chose not to tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said Clinton should have dismissed Magaziner and
should not require taxpayers to foot the bill for the $285,864
sanction.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Spencer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, including the
Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told the appeals
court Thursday that the reprimand of Magaziner was appropriate
because he had engaged in ``outrageous conduct.''

BUSH TO APPOINT TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE TO SUPREME COURT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: Has optional trim.) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday completed the
Republican sweep of statewide elective offices by announcing that
he will appoint Secretary of State Al Gonzales to the Texas Supreme
Court when Justice Raul A. Gonzalez retires later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, a migrant workers' son who grew up in Houston and
became a partner in a major Houston law firm, has never been a
judge. But Bush praised his ``strong work ethic'' and said Gonzales
has ``great judgment and ... tremendous integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 43, will be Bush's fourth appointee to the nine-member
high court. He will have to be confirmed by the state Senate after
the Legislature convenes Jan. 12 and must win election two years
from now to keep the court seat.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Gonzalez, a Democrat appointed to the Supreme Court by Gov.
Mark White in 1984, wasn't on the ballot last week when Republicans
won the statewide offices that were up for election. He had
announced before the election, however, that he would retire from
the court in midterm on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Rose Spector, the only other Democrat on the Supreme
Court, was unseated by Republican appellate judge Harriet O'Neill
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Gonzalez has been the only Hispanic to serve on the Supreme
Court, the state's highest civil court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been actively trying to increase the Republican
Party's appeal to Hispanics and who won by as much as 49 percent of
the Hispanic vote in his re-election, said it is important that Al
Gonzales also is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important consideration was `could he do a good job;
is he a man of integrity and decency?' '' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it mattered what his ethnicity is, but first and
foremost what mattered is I've got great confidence in Al. I know
him well. He's a good friend. He'll do a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Gonzalez praised Bush's choice for a successor and
downplayed the fact that he and Al Gonzales are from different
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas, you know, choose the best qualified
people, and it seems like the pendulum has swung toward the
Republican Party,'' Raul Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a sign of the times, and this is something that I
cannot forestall or do anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   The retiring justice, who has been one of the court's most
conservative members during a period of major philosophical and
partisan changes, said judges shouldn't be partisan anyway. He said
Bush's three previous appointees to the court haven't been.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Al Gonzales won't be the first person to join the
Texas Supreme Court without any previous judicial experience.
</P>
<P>
   Only one current justice, Priscilla Owen, falls into that
category. Owen was elected to the high court from a Houston law
firm in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important question is, `Does he know the law?
Is he smart enough to handle the job? Does he work hard? And is he
a person of integrity?' And the answer to all those questions is
`yes, absolutely,' '' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a pretty interesting mix to have
somebody who may not have been a judge before on the court. I think
the judges, and I think those who argue in front of Al, are going
to see that he's a great judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Raul Gonzalez, who was a migrant farmworker as a child, Al
Gonzales comes from a modest background.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gonzales was one of eight children. His parents were migrant
workers when he was born in San Antonio. But the family soon moved
to Houston, where Gonzales' father, Pablo, became a construction
worker. He died in a construction accident when Al was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gonzales joined the Air Force after graduating from high
school in Houston. He attended the Air Force Academy and earned
degrees from Rice University and Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He was a partner with the Houston-based law firm Vinson &AMP; Elkins
before becoming Bush's top staff lawyer in 1995. Bush appointed him
secretary of state last December.
</P>
<P>
   One of his primary duties in that office was to administer state
elections. Gonzales also was the governor's chief adviser on Mexico
and border issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales thanked the governor for giving him ``a boost up, for
the opportunities you have passed on to me and the faith you have
in my abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said he will have a ``big robe'' to fill, and said he
was honored to succeed Raul Gonzalez, ``not because he is Hispanic,
but because he is a good, decent and fair man who made decisions
based on the laws of our land.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STORY CAN END HERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All current members of the Supreme Court _ several of whom
attended Thursday's announcement _ say they would like to see the
Legislature replace the partisan system of electing state judges.
Bush said he still favors the partisan election system, but called
for more reforms in how campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Texas Supreme Court was criticized on
CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' program because justices accepted campaign
contributions from lawyers and others who may have interests at
stake in the court's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales' pending appointment and O'Neill's election means that,
come January, all nine members of the Supreme Court will be either
from Houston or Dallas. And Houston will hold a 5-4 edge.

MARKET PLACE: WALL STREET UNMOVED BY POSSIBLE FEDEX STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things have been looking pretty dire lately at Federal Express,
the company that invented overnight delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The air-freight carrier's 3,500 pilots stopped flying overtime
this week and will decide on Dec. 3 whether to authorize a strike
during the peak holiday shipping season. Fedex has withdrawn the
contract offer it made last month and is busy making plans to
reorganize so that it can conduct business without most of its
pilots. Customers are beginning to get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   And investors and Wall Street analysts are, well, pretty
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of FDX Corp., the holding company that owns
Fedex, has remained fairly steady in the last few weeks. On
Thursday it fell 68.75 cents a share, to $52.875.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately this is typical of labor negotiations for an
airline or air-freight company,'' said Keith Patriquin, an analyst
at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., which owns 2.5 million shares of FDX,
commenting on this week's saber-rattling between the union and the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Is Wall Street onto something?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is. On Thursday the pilots began toning down their
language in an effort to lure the company back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for both sides to take some logs off the fire,''
said Bob Clement, the spokesman for the Federal Express Pilots
Association. ``We understand the company's resolve. They understand
the pilots' resolve. Now is the time to make the best decision for
Fedex, its customers and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the pilots had sent Fedex a written proposal,
something the company has been demanding as a condition of its
return to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are seeking an increase in wages and retirement
benefits and some control over how their flying time is scheduled.
They say the difference between the company's last offer and what
they are asking for amounts to only $3 million a year over a
four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a strike is hardly out of the question. Fedex management
is known for its fierce pride. The company, which has been
negotiating with the pilots on and off since 1993, has never signed
a union contract.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Smith, the former Marine pilot who founded Fedex in
1971 and is now chairman of FDX, cannot be happy about seeing Fedex
operations threatened by anyone. The company appears to be moving
on a course intended to break the union's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that a strike doesn't serve either
side's interest,'' said Scott Flower, the freight transportation
analyst at Paine Webber. ``But nobody wanted to fight World War I
either.''
</P>
<P>
   William Margaritis, a Fedex spokesman, said that he was not
aware of any new offer from the pilots. ``We are willing to review
and consider any reasonable _ and I underscore `reasonable' _
proposal that balances the interests of our customers, shareholders
and employees,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The more conciliatory tone by the pilots may be a result of
Fedex's aggressive move to shift deliveries to FDX's trucking
subsidiaries and to outside cargo carriers. On Thursday, Atlas Air,
a cargo airline based in Golden, Colo., said that it had leased
three 747 freighters to Fedex, complete with pilots, maintenance
and insurance for use in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Margaritis said the deal was a direct result of the threat of a
pilot walkout. Industry executives said that Fedex was probably
negotiating more such leasing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Fedex insists that the needs of its customers are paramount and
that it is confident it can keep its business going even if the
pilots walk out. But cracks in the company's facade are already
beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice to customers on Thursday, Fedex said that in the
event of a strike it might have to suspend its money-back
guarantees for overnight service. It also said that it might cut
back deliveries to some areas and suspend certain services like
overnight delivery by 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service, Fedex's main rival, took the opportunity
to say on Thursday that it had enough capacity in its ground and
air-delivery network to accommodate Fedex customers during the
holidays _ if they shift their business now and commit to UPS for
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   UPS knows how painful a strike can be. Many of its customers
were surprised last year when it was crippled by a two-week walkout
by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. They shifted to
Fedex and others. More than a year later, the company is still
trying to lure some of that business back.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street think that even if Fedex and the pilots
cannot settle their differences on their own, they may ultimately
be compelled by outside forces to reach an agreement. Under federal
law, President Clinton has the power to order the pilots back to
work for 60 days while a special emergency board tries to reach a
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used an emergency board to halt a strike last year by
pilots at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines. This summer, Bruce
Lindsey, Clinton's close aide, used the threat of an emergency
board to force a settlement between Northwest Airlines and its
striking pilots.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the White House has kept its distance from the Fedex
negotiations, waiting to see whether the two sides could work
things out. But an administration official who requested anonymity
said that the White House had been briefed by federal mediators who
have been talking to the company and the union.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say, though, that even in the worst case of a
strike, the damage to the company would not have a large effect on
FDX's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a strike, based on what has happened at other
airlines, it is not going to last long enough to have a significant
long-term effect on the company's customer base and its business,''
Patriquin of Loomis Sayles said. ``It will cost a ton of money, but
it won't affect the long-term cash-generating power of the company,
which is what investors are looking at.''

BOSTON, CONVENTION FINALIST, GOES ON THE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moments after Boston emerged Thursday as one of
three finalists to host the coveted Democratic national convention
in 2000, the city's supporters turned against Los Angeles, the
front-runner, and criticized its bid as ``soft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston team, whose pursuit of the 2000 gala has been a long
shot from the start, also raised questions about whether Democrats
should patronize California, battleground for Republican-sponsored
initiatives against bilingual education and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Boston leaders launched the thinly veiled assault on Los Angeles
after the Democratic Party's site advisory committee announced the
finalists Thursday. The attack came despite strong support in the
White House for the California site and indications from Democratic
sources that party officials plan to use Boston as leverage to
sweeten LA's $35.3 million bid for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Denver was selected as the third finalist in the race for
hosting the convention. The winning city, which will be chosen in
January, will receive an estimated $140 million boost to its local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Three other semi-finalists _ Miami, Minneapolis, and New Orleans
_ were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Los Angeles proposal is soft,'' said state
Representative Joan Menard, the only Massachusetts member of the
Democratic Party site advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has pledged to raise $32.4 million in cash and services
to host the convention. The state and the city each have committed
to provide $8 million in cash, goods and services, with the balance
to be raised from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Party sources said that Boston's bid may be used as a bargaining
chip since it is considered more generous than Los Angeles's
because of the extra travel costs associated with staging the
convention on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite sure they have really made firm commitments to
this convention,'' Menard said, referring to Los Angeles's
financial offer. ``We're hoping that with our commitments being
firm, we will end up with the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   California's Democratic Party chairman, Art Torres, a member of
the site advisory committee and leader of the LA convention effort,
said Menard is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very close to raising the $35 million that is required
in our bid,'' Torres said, although he said he could not estimate
how close the city is to raising the money.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, apparently taken aback by the swift attack from Boston,
added: ``The thing we need to avoid is this kind of back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Steven Grossman, the Massachusetts businessman who is
the Democratic Party's national chairman, described Los Angeles as
the ``presumptive favorite'' to win the competition, he said, ``I
would not discount Boston's chances at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither would Mayor Thomas M. Menino. Despite lingering concern
among some members of the site advisory panel that Big Dig blight
could mar the party's celebration in 2000, Boston has surged closer
than ever to hosting the city's first major party national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, who has led the Boston effort, scoffed at the widely
held view the convention is Los Angeles's to lose. ``That's
California thinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference with Senator Edward M. Kennedy at the
Parkman House, Menino also cited support in Boston and
Massachusetts for affirmative action and bilingual education as
metaphors for Clinton-Gore successes. In citing both policies,
Menino drew attention to the GOP-led fights in California against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a battle on this,'' Kennedy said of the
convention derby. ``We were a long shot from the start, and now we
have to push the ball across the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy acknowledged that the White House is leaning toward
California. ``I think if you had the president, you'd be in pretty
good shape,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But he downplayed the lure of California's 54 electoral votes,
which could be pivotal in the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we'll carry California in 2000,'' Kennedy said,
asserting that Democrats should come to their traditional base in
New England to shore up the Northeast now that Republican governors
predominate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry issued a statement expressing pleasure
``that Boston is one step closer to realizing its rightful place as
host of the 2000 convention'' and pledging to continue to
contribute to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials will now conduct a 60-day assessment
of the three cities to ensure they have the technical, financial,
and logistical capacity to host the event.
</P>
<P>
   Amid indications that Los Angeles will prevail in the
competition, Menino and Kennedy showed no signs of resignation. But
some Boston insiders grumbled that the trip by party officials to
Boston in mid-December might be little more than an attempt to show
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Menino resolved one concern among party officials Thursday by
agreeing to close Causeway Street in front of the Fleet Center to
traffic during the four-day gala. As for a possible Big Dig
eyesore, Menard told the panel that most of the project's work
above ground will be completed before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said he and Colorado Governor Roy Romer, the party's
general chairman, will announce the final decision in January after
consulting ``all the party's top leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, Grossman said, ``the president will have a very
important voice. But I hope the president's confidence in us is
such that when we make a final recommendation to him, he will
believe it's in the best interest of the country.''

TEXACO TO CUT 1,000 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest example of the effect that low oil prices are
having on energy companies, Texaco Inc. said Thursday that it would
cut 1,000 oil-exploration jobs worldwide, or about 5 percent of its
work force, as part of a cost-cutting effort that is intended to
save $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 employees in Britain and 750 employees in the United
States are expected to lose their jobs, including full-time
employees in business and support areas such as public relations
and information technology, as well as some independent
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the company cut 100 jobs at its corporate
headquarters in White Plains, N.Y., and agreed to lease about half
of the office space to an outside company.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization comes on the heels of a 58 percent decline in
third-quarter earnings at Texaco, the United States' third-largest
oil company, and a string of recently announced cost-cutting
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A refining and marketing joint venture with Royal Dutch/Shell
Group and Saudi Aramco, for example, is expected to cut $800
million a year in costs for the three companies beginning in 1999.
Two other joint ventures are expected to save Texaco about $40
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes in the industry have fundamentally altered the
competitive landscape, and Texaco must respond in order to improve
its position,'' said John O'Connor, president of Texaco's
exploration and production operations.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are also intended to place greater emphasis on
Texaco's long-term production and reserve growth.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texaco rose $1.625 to close at $59.9375. Shares of
most other oil companies and the price of crude oil also rose
Thursday, but analysts attributed the gains to concerns that
Persian Gulf oil shipments could be disrupted if the United States
takes military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the reorganization Thursday, Texaco becomes the
latest of the world's largest oil companies to make deep cuts to
combat the continuing decline in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Mobil Corp. promised $500 million in new cost
savings and said that capital spending in 1999 would be lower than
the projected $5.9 billion for this year. The new reductions are in
addition to a three-year program of $1 billion of cost savings that
began in 1996. And Unocal Corp. said it would cut spending by 30
percent to 40 percent, or as much as $650 million, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, the country's largest energy company, whose third-quarter
earnings declined by 23 percent, and Chevron have also warned that
declining oil prices would crimp spending next year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, British Petroleum announced that its
third-quarter profit fell a less-than-expected 36 percent, to $445
million from $691 million in the quarter a year earlier. British
Petroleum benefited from a 2-year old program to cut costs in its
European refining operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is buying Amoco, expects to gain $2 billion
in savings once the combination is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the recent peak of about $20 a barrel in October 1997, oil
prices have declined steadily, hitting a low of $11.90 a barrel in
June. In the third quarter, crude-oil prices averaged a little more
than $14 a barrel, more than 25 percent less than their average
price of $19.79 in the third quarter a year ago. The price
represents the lowest average price in the third quarter since
1986. On Thursday, oil for December delivery rose 29 cents, to
$13.84 a barrel.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The latest moves by Texaco continued a reorganization prompted
by the naming of Peter Bijur as chief executive two years ago,
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the reorganization, Texaco named several executives
to lead the efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Farley will become president of exploration and new
ventures. She most recently served as president for North American
production. Robert Solberg, formerly president for international
production, in Asia, the Pacific Rim, West Africa and Latin
America, will become president for commercial development. Clarence
Cazalot Jr. will become president for production operations. He had
been president for international production in Europe, Eurasia and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts offered mixed views on whether the latest
round of cuts would be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is a Band-Aid for a much bigger wound,''
said Fadel Gheit, senior oil analyst at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies can't admit it's not business as usual,'' Gheit
said, adding, ``I expect industry consolidation to pick up
considerably in the next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, while the price of oil has declined about 40
percent, oil companies' cost-cutting moves will trim only about 5
percent to 10 percent of their costs, Gheit said. As a result,
additional joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions are likely, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Pfeifer, senior oil analyst at Prudential Securities,
said, ``This moves them well on the way to being competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeifer thinks that oil prices will remain above their June lows
through the end of the year, averaging about $14.85 a barrel in
1998 and rising to an average of $17.50 a barrel in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've seen the worst and things are going to improve
in future quarters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco planned to remain independent but might be interested in
acquiring smaller companies, O'Connor said.

MICROSOFT TRIES TO DISCREDIT INTEL EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Microsoft Corp. made a broad and
aggressive attempt on Thursday to discredit an Intel executive who
has emerged as an important government witness, portraying him as a
resentful employee and introducing testimony from his own
supervisor that differed from his memory of events.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony early this week, Steven McGeady, an Intel vice
president, said Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and other
Microsoft executives had threatened Intel's leaders in 1995 as part
of a successful effort to push them out of the software-development
business, and to dissuade them from supporting Netscape
Communications Corp., Microsoft's major competitor in the market
for Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Whittier, a senior vice president for Intel and McGeady's
supervisor at the time, attended some of the meetings where the
threats were purportedly made, and in his deposition he said he did
not remember hearing them.
</P>
<P>
   But McGeady was unbowed, by this or any other bit of evidence
introduced Thursday and intended to contradict his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Ron's telling the truth that he doesn't remember,''
he told Steven Holley, a lawyer for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when David Boies, the government's lead attorney, got
another chance to question McGeady, he played longer portions of
Whittier's deposition intended to show that his failure to remember
the events in question should not be surprising. The longer
passages showed that Whittier could not remember much of anything
about that period.
</P>
<P>
   McGeady completed his testimony Thursday evening, as the
government's antitrust trial against Microsoft ended its fourth
week. Just before the trial began, Microsoft's lawyers complained
that the charges involving threats against Intel were new and were
added to the case at the last minute, and that the company could
not possibly prepare a defense in time.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, Microsoft lawyers presented a voluminous
and detailed attack on McGeady, portraying him as an arrogant,
difficult Intel employee who held a strong personal animosity
toward Microsoft _ even though he knew that Intel's leaders were
intent on maintaining a good relationship with the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Notes from one meeting showed that another manager had told
McGeady that he was a ``prima donna.'' But that did not seem to
bother McGeady. ``I've been called far worse,'' he said with a
slight smile.
</P>
<P>
   As the morning advanced and the attacks grew sharper, Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson asked Holley: ``What is the point of this?
What are you trying to accomplish? Are you just trying to embarrass
him?''
</P>
<P>
   Holley said he did not want to respond in public.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, Microsoft's attacks seemed to have
had some effect. Holley had worked to show that McGeady was a
disgruntled employee out of the Intel mainstream. And after both
sides had finished asking their questions of McGeady, Jackson asked
the witness if he was speaking for Intel, or just for himself.
</P>
<P>
   McGeady said the answer was complicated; he was here because the
government had subpoenaed him to testify. But, he added, he was a
senior executive directly involved with the issues in question
during 1995 and 1996, when the threats were reportedly made.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the courtroom audience all this week were a senior
Intel spokesman and a corporate lawyer who had been sent to support
him. And it seemed clear that while the company wished it could
stay out of this case, once an executive was subpoenaed, Intel's
leaders would back him.
</P>
<P>
   During his cross-examination of McGeady, Holley introduced
several e-mail and deposition excerpts intended to demonstrate that
the only reason Microsoft tried to push Intel out of the software
business was that the company thought Intel's software was of poor
quality.
</P>
<P>
   But then, when Boies got his turn, he showed his own excerpts
that seemed to show that Microsoft was most concerned about the
threat Intel's work posed to Microsoft's control of the software
industry. The larger impression left by the dueling and
electronic-mail snippets from Microsoft and Intel files was simply
that large corporations do not speak with one voice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, by the end of the day it was clear that McGeady was no
fan of Microsoft. In one internal memo he wrote in August 1995,
McGeady noted that Microsoft had bought rights to the Rolling
Stones song ``Start Me Up'' to promote Windows 95. McGeady wrote
that ``Sympathy for the Devil'' might have been a more appropriate
choice.
</P>
<P>
   And in an electronic-mail message to Andrew Grove, Intel's chief
executive, in December 1996, he wrote that he had ``long taken the
position that anything that weakens Microsoft without indirectly
weakening us is good for Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain, McGeady said, ``Anything that could bring more
competition to the software industry is good for Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Holley ended his cross-examination of McGeady by
reading another passage in the note to Grove. In that one, McGeady
wrote that perhaps ``Microsoft could be goaded into doing something
really stupid and anti-competitive, finally enraging the apparently
placid antitrust police.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, McGeady observed that what he predicted had come
to pass.

SLAYING OF A GIRL, 8, TESTS TIES IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For several years, Jim and Peggy Poston
have toyed with the idea of moving from the working-class
neighborhood where they have lived for the last 41 years to a more
affluent one. But they could never quite bring themselves to make
the change.
</P>
<P>
   The Postons were too attached to the community of Lakewood, in
southern Jacksonville. It is where they raised a son and a
daughter, where most of the neighbors know each other and where
their Yorkshire terrier, Daffy, is a kind of mascot for the
half-dozen or so children who bicycle, skate and play ball on their
street.
</P>
<P>
   Among those children were Madlyn Rae Clifton, known as Maddie,
and Joshua Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last week have severely tested the
tight-knit quality of their community. On Nov. 3, 8-year-old
Maddie, who had been playing in front of a neighbor's house just
before dinner time, vanished. For days, hundreds of people joined
in a hopeful search for the child.
</P>
<P>
   Now the community has closed ranks in grief. On Tuesday, Maddie
was found dead, and Joshua Phillips is the suspected killer.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua, 14, was arrested Tuesday at his school after Maddie's
body was found ``securely entombed'' under his water bed in the
house he shares with his parents, Jacksonville Sheriff Nathaniel
Glover said. Maddie, whose house is cater-cornered from Joshua's,
had been hit in the head and stabbed numerous times, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua, who apparently had removed a broken sideboard from his
bed frame and stuffed the body in the space between the base and
the platform that holds the mattress, confessed to the killing, the
sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's office officials said they were also investigating
earlier burglaries at the Clifton house after finding a stolen
photograph of Maddie's 11-year-old sister in Joshua's room. Police
believe they have the murder weapon _ a bat found in the house _
and a multipurpose tool, which includes a knife, that was used to
stab Maddie after she was struck.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no official explanation for the crime, although
the unofficial speculation has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some neighborhood discussion that he was infatuated
with the older sibling,'' said Rick Seibler, the sheriff's chief of
detectives, who would not say how such an infatuation, if it
existed, was connected to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua's lawyer, Richard Nichols, confirmed local news reports
that the boy told law enforcement officials he had hit Maddie with
a ball while they were playing in his backyard, and then took her
inside. The lawyer declined to offer more details, but said his
client ``has acknowledged his involvement in that death.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nichols said that Joshua's statement to investigators ``does
not rise to a confession of first-degree murder,'' which he
described as an intentional, premeditated killing by someone
capable of such crime, and said the boy would plead not guilty to
that charge if he is indicted. Prosecutors said they will announce
next week whether Joshua would be tried as an adult, in which case
he could face life imprisonment if convicted, or as a juvenile,
which would allow a possible release by age 19, if he were found
guilty. The death penalty could not be invoked because Joshua is
under 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nice 14-year-old boy who's in a horrible situation, and
his friend is dead, and he's heartbroken about it,'' said Nichols.
``He understands what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the A. Philip Randolph Academies of Technology, where Joshua
was a ninth-grader with a C average and had no record of discipline
or truancy problems, his arrest caused disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students can't fathom him doing something like this,''
said Gerome Wheeler, the principal. ``They say Josh? Josh? Josh?
like they say his name two or three times. They cannot believe
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua moved to Lakewood with his parents, both computer
specialists, less than two years ago. He quickly became a familiar
figure, walking his beagle and occasionally joining games of
softball and hockey. Neighbors said they thought him polite, if a
bit of a loner.
</P>
<P>
   Maddie, a third-grader at San Jose Catholic school, was born in
Lakewood, where her parents moved 15 years ago. She was described
as a smiling, well-behaved, polite child who took piano and dance
lessons but was as ``tough as nails'' with a passion for touch
football and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of grief,'' said Larry Grisham, 45, who has
lived in the neighborhood for 30 years. ``It'll never be back to
what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the investigation focused on Maddie's two-street
neighborhood because she had been seen shortly before her parents
reported her missing, sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For seven days, police staked out the area and searched houses
while hundreds of volunteers combed through woods and swamps and
handed out fliers. The Postons recalled that Joshua had joined in
the search the first night.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham, who is well known to neighbors because he sometimes
played games with the children, was questioned by police because he
had a criminal record. He had been hitting golf balls with Maddie
on the afternoon that she disappeared. Grisham, who is not a
suspect, said Maddie had gone home to get more balls, and when she
did not return, he assumed her parents had kept her home.
</P>
<P>
   Around Jacksonville, Maddie's face appeared on fliers, hats and
T-shirts, and a $100,000 reward was offered. But hope for her
return ended early Tuesday morning, after neighbors saw Joshua's
mother, Melissa, apparently distraught, approach the police
officers stationed on her street.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Phillips had noticed fluid on the floor under her son's
waterbed. When she pull apart a corner of the bed frame that had
been taped together, she saw Maddie's legs. Glover said his
officers had searched the Phillips house three times and detected a
peculiar smell, but Mrs. Phillips had told them it was probably the
birds the family kept inside.
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood is now filled with pilgrims who come to the Clifton's
house to drop off flowers, stuffed animals and heart-shaped
balloons reading ``I love you'' and ``I'm sorry.'' The yellow
ribbons of hope worn on lapels have been replaced by purple ribbons
of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole city felt this one,'' said Lori McDonald, 35, a
legal secretary whose son, 10, and two daughters, 12 and 4, attend
Maddie's school and brought flowers to the Clifton house. But she
and other parents said they were not sure what lessons to draw from
such a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You teach them `Don't talk to strangers,''' said Brenda
Thomann, 37, who also brought her children to the Clifton house.
``You don't say, `Don't play with friends.'''

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEMENTE TO SOSA, AND BEYOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ As much as the number he faithfully chose
to wear, it was the way Sammy Sosa moved, the way he carried
himself, that made Roberto Clemente Jr. think Sosa had something
special inside him that was destined to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   It was similar to the way his father galloped from the batter's
box, a lasting vision for the oldest of Roberto Clemente's three
sons. ``We sat along the first-base line at Forbes Field, so we got
to see the players as they ran down the line,'' he said. ``To me,
my father didn't run, he floated. That was how I as a little kid
could tell he was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemente Jr. was 6 on Dec. 31, 1972, when he walked into the
kitchen of his family's Puerto Rico home, looking for his father's
plane ticket, a kid's playful habit in trying to delay the
inevitable. Except this time, the last time, there was no ticket,
no commercial flight. Roberto Clemente was going on a relief
mission to earthquake-ravaged Nicaragua. He was going despite what
Roberto Jr. says he still believes was a premonition of his
father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still remember just feeling that something wasn't
right,'' he said. ``I told my mother, `Don't let Daddy go. That
plane's going to crash.' She yelled at me. I ran outside. He came
out and said, `I'll come back soon and we'll play catch. I told
him, `You're not coming back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his 6-year-old imagination had conjured up, the reality
of that being the last time he would see his father has had a
profound ethereal effect on Roberto Clemente Jr. At the All-Star
Game last July, long before Sosa chased Mark McGwire deep into
September, Clemente and Sosa sought each other out at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father is my hero,'' Sosa told him. ``I wear his number.
I watched his films. I studied his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemente replied with something he knew was strange to say to
someone he hardly knew. ``My father's spirit is with you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Clemente strongly suspected as Sosa, in this of all
seasons, emerged from at least a half-dozen other power-hitters'
shadows. That is what Clemente decided had to be as he watched Sosa
juggle baseball and, eerily, his own relief efforts for a Dominican
Republic battered by Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six home runs, it turned out, were a statistical baton,
the passing of a legacy, one No. 21 to another.
</P>
<P>
   After the Latino season of Sosa, Clemente came to the Yogi Berra
Museum on the campus of Montclair State University on Thursday to
show a film and speak about his father to a group that included a
baseball team from Essex Catholic High School in nearby East
Orange. Most of the players were Hispanic kids who had come through
Newark's Roberto Clemente Little League. The team's best pitcher,
Arnaldo Mateo, wears No. 21. The coach, Frank Stanco, said Clemente
Jr. was, in this case, preaching to the converted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already know what Roberto Clemente did, why he died,''
Stanco said. ``I've been coaching nine years at this school and if
I've learned anything, it's that these kids have a fierce Latino
baseball pride. Because of Sosa this year, it just came out that
much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and Juan Gonalez and Pedro Martinez and Mariano Rivera and
too many more to mention. It gave David Kaplan, the Berra Museum's
director, the idea to conduct a Spanish Heritage Month symposium he
titled, ``From Clemente to Sosa.'' It was, as much for the purpose
of celebration, to examine the extant cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   We had an example of one just this week in New York, as the Mets
so conveniently bypassed Omar Minaya _ Sammy Sosa's discoverer _ to
dust off Frank Cashen as Steve Phillips' temporary replacement. The
Mets said they wanted to continue their troubled general manager's
program. Who better than his hand-picked assistant?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to be a spoilsport but there are some important issues
to deal with precisely because of the proliferation of the Latino
player,'' said Roberto Gonzalez Echetarria, who teaches Hispanic
and comparative literature at Yale and whose book on Cuban baseball
will be released next season. He mentioned, for one, the widespread
use of Latino youngsters as cheap and, ultimately, disposable
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are so essential they wind up speaking, moving,
even giving their lives for others. From Clemente to Sosa, the
Latino baseball community at least has itself a galvanizing leader
for the 21st century. ``We've been waiting for someone like my dad,
someone like Sammy, for a long, long time,'' Clemente Jr. said.

   RENO, Nev. _ After a recount of ballots here in Washoe County
this week, Nevada officials announced Thursday that the latest
tally showed that the incumbent Democratic U.S. senator, Harry
Reid, had defeated his Republican challenger, Rep. John Ensign, by
401 votes, or less than 0.1 percent of the total 435,787 votes cast
in the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The delay was caused by computer malfunctions and a hand recount
of 5,942 misprinted ballots in the county. Statewide, Reid held a
459-vote lead when results were first announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign's local campaign manager, former Gov. Robert List, said
he would advise his candidate to seek a statewide recount.
</P>
<P>
   The latest vote count _ 208,621 for Reid and 208,220 for Ensign
_ will go to the Nevada state Supreme Court for certification Nov.
25. According to the recount, Ensign defeated Reid by 2,162 votes
out of 96,123 votes cast in Washoe County.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign has until Dec. 2 to to request a statewide recount.

`RELAXING' MEXICAN TRAIN TURNS TO HORROR AS BANDITS BOARD, KILL
TOURIST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Doug Martin badly needed this vacation, a relaxing
train ride through Mexico's majestic Copper Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out an open door, Arizona's newly re-elected mine
inspector admired the rugged scenery and chatted with Ernest
Schmidt, a Swiss passenger traveling with his wife of 50 years. All
of a sudden, the train began to slow down as it approached a
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   He saw a man with a gun jump onto the locomotive, and in a flash
Martin's vacation was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to Mr. Schmidt and said, `Let's go!' '' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt stayed behind to videotape the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned and was walking from the end of the car, got about
halfway down the car and heard `bam,' '' Martin said. ``I turned
around and looked just as Mr. Schmidt was falling to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Trapped in the train stopped in the blackness of the tunnel,
Martin, his Valley travel companions and scores of others were held
hostage for 30 to 40 minutes Monday as the bandits went person to
person, guns drawn, demanding money, gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Schmidt was dead and at least six other
passengers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Martin survived by hiding in a closet with another man. Their
feet jammed against the sliding door, they listened to the gunfire
and the screams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing whether my companions had been shot or not . . .
my decision was stay put and help when it's over,'' he said. ``Stay
alive was the first thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The robbery took place on the Chihuahua-Pacific Railway in
Copper Canyon, a popular tourist destination that draws visitors
from all over the world to vast pine-covered canyons four times the
size of the Grand Canyon and almost 300 feet deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said Thursday that there had been no recent
problems on the train; the last robbery was three years ago,
according to a local police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that I hear something about Copper
Canyon,'' said Roberto Rodriguez Hernandez, Mexican consul in
Nogales. ``Traditionally, this point is a resort. It's very safe,
no problems at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendale travel agent Bettie Wright, who organized the trip, had
been to the canyon twice before without problems.
</P>
<P>
   This time, armed guards accompanied the group on the first leg
of their trip _ something that had been standard practice. But no
guards were on board during the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   The group included three Valley residents: Wright, 70; Martin,
59; and Lloyd Dickson, 55, a prison psychiatric nurse. Alberta
Parker, 81, Wright's cousin and a retired doctor, flew in from
California. Roberta Van Alstyne, 86, came in from Texas for the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, the group flew together to the town of Los Mochis,
then began the ride through the scenic canyon. On a typical trip,
the railway _ which stretches from Los Mochis to Chihuahua _ passes
through 86 tunnels and crosses 37 bridges as it climbs almost 8,000
feet into the Sierra Madres.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's group stopped short of Chihuahua, exploring towns and
villages for several days before returning to the train going back
to Los Mochis.
</P>
<P>
   They boarded the four-car train at 1:30 p.m. Monday. About six
hours later, Martin was hanging out the open door in the first car;
Dickson and his three companions were reading and chatting in the
second car.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing it, some of the bandits had already boarded the
train, unarmed, at the last stop. They were then joined by others
with guns who overpowered the engineer and forced the train to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin spotted the first gunman and began to flee, he
expected that Schmidt would follow. But according to Mexican news
reports, Schmidt stayed behind with his video camera. The bandits
commanded him to stop _ but Schmidt didn't understand Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   So the bandits started shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's wife jumped from her seat and Martin heard her scream,
``That's my husband! That's my husband!''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. ``And then `bam' again,'' Martin said. ``They
didn't shoot her. They shot him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and others rushed to the second car, whose passengers
hadn't heard the first gunshots over the rumble of the train
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what it was . . . then it was quite clear they
were frightened,'' Parker said. ``They were hurling themselves
forward. Then we heard the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers fell to the ground, hoping to hide themselves between
the seats. At 86 years old, Van Alstyne wasn't limber enough to
crouch down, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the only one sitting up,'' she said. ``But they didn't
do anything to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The bandits _ there were at least nine but possibly 16 _ went
person to person, demanding American money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just came down the aisle pointing guns at each one of our
heads, shouting, `Dolares! Dolares! No pesos! Dolares!' '' Dickson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers handed over their cash, and Wright did the only
thing she could think to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started praying,'' she said. ``I prayed and looked at their
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and a Mexican passenger remained quiet inside the closet,
watching from small holes in the door where a handle was missing.
At one point, the bandits struggled to slide open the door but then
gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who carried his mine inspector's badge, feared being
found and mistaken for a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if they looked in my wallet and saw that, they'd kill
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bandits continued to the third and fourth train cars, and
then returned. This time they wanted gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Guns drawn, they inspected fingers and wrists and demanded all
jewelry be put in a bag. They also grabbed backpacks belonging to
several young European travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The bandits made a second attempt to open the door to the closet
that hid Martin, then fled into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When the train began moving, the passengers slowly got up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chaos,'' Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded were cared for by passengers, some of whom were
doctors. At least five suffered bullet wounds; one was
pistol-whipped. Schmidt's body, which lay in the first car, was
covered up. Martin said his wife rode with him to the nearest stop,
where police were waiting. &QL;

BOSTON, CONVENTION FINALIST, GOES ON THE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moments after Boston emerged Thursday as one of
three finalists to host the coveted Democratic national convention
in 2000, the city's supporters turned against Los Angeles, the
front-runner, and criticized its bid as ``soft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston team, whose pursuit of the 2000 gala has been a long
shot from the start, also raised questions about whether Democrats
should patronize California, battleground for Republican-sponsored
initiatives against bilingual education and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Boston leaders launched the thinly veiled assault on Los Angeles
after the Democratic Party's site advisory committee announced the
finalists Thursday. The attack came despite strong support in the
White House for the California site and indications from Democratic
sources that party officials plan to use Boston as leverage to
sweeten LA's $35.3 million bid for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Denver was selected as the third finalist in the race for
hosting the convention. The winning city, which will be chosen in
January, will receive an estimated $140 million boost to its local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Three other semi-finalists _ Miami, Minneapolis, and New Orleans
_ were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Los Angeles proposal is soft,'' said state
Representative Joan Menard, the only Massachusetts member of the
Democratic Party site advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has pledged to raise $32.4 million in cash and services
to host the convention. The state and the city each have committed
to provide $8 million in cash, goods and services, with the balance
to be raised from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Party sources said that Boston's bid may be used as a bargaining
chip since it is considered more generous than Los Angeles's
because of the extra travel costs associated with staging the
convention on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not quite sure they have really made firm commitments to
this convention,'' Menard said, referring to Los Angeles's
financial offer. ``We're hoping that with our commitments being
firm, we will end up with the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   California's Democratic Party chairman, Art Torres, a member of
the site advisory committee and leader of the LA convention effort,
said Menard is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very close to raising the $35 million that is required
in our bid,'' Torres said, although he said he could not estimate
how close the city is to raising the money.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, apparently taken aback by the swift attack from Boston,
added: ``The thing we need to avoid is this kind of back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Steven Grossman, the Massachusetts businessman who is
the Democratic Party's national chairman, described Los Angeles as
the ``presumptive favorite'' to win the competition, he said, ``I
would not discount Boston's chances at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither would Mayor Thomas M. Menino. Despite lingering concern
among some members of the site advisory panel that Big Dig blight
could mar the party's celebration in 2000, Boston has surged closer
than ever to hosting the city's first major party national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, who has led the Boston effort, scoffed at the widely
held view the convention is Los Angeles's to lose. ``That's
California thinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference with Senator Edward M. Kennedy at the
Parkman House, Menino also cited support in Boston and
Massachusetts for affirmative action and bilingual education as
metaphors for Clinton-Gore successes. In citing both policies,
Menino drew attention to the GOP-led fights in California against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a battle on this,'' Kennedy said of the
convention derby. ``We were a long shot from the start, and now we
have to push the ball across the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy acknowledged that the White House is leaning toward
California. ``I think if you had the president, you'd be in pretty
good shape,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But he downplayed the lure of California's 54 electoral votes,
which could be pivotal in the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident we'll carry California in 2000,'' Kennedy said,
asserting that Democrats should come to their traditional base in
New England to shore up the Northeast now that Republican governors
predominate.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry issued a statement expressing pleasure
``that Boston is one step closer to realizing its rightful place as
host of the 2000 convention'' and pledging to continue to
contribute to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials will now conduct a 60-day assessment
of the three cities to ensure they have the technical, financial,
and logistical capacity to host the event.
</P>
<P>
   Amid indications that Los Angeles will prevail in the
competition, Menino and Kennedy showed no signs of resignation. But
some Boston insiders grumbled that the trip by party officials to
Boston in mid-December might be little more than an attempt to show
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Menino resolved one concern among party officials Thursday by
agreeing to close Causeway Street in front of the Fleet Center to
traffic during the four-day gala. As for a possible Big Dig
eyesore, Menard told the panel that most of the project's work
above ground will be completed before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said he and Colorado Governor Roy Romer, the party's
general chairman, will announce the final decision in January after
consulting ``all the party's top leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, Grossman said, ``the president will have a very
important voice. But I hope the president's confidence in us is
such that when we make a final recommendation to him, he will
believe it's in the best interest of the country.''

`WEDDING IN BASRA' SPOTLIGHTS SOFTER SIDE OF IRAQ: ITS PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ego-driven title may be a little off-putting, but ``A
Wedding in Basra With Arthur Kent'' is nevertheless an eye opener.
</P>
<P>
   In the harsh light of President Clinton's renewed threat to bomb
Iraq, it is also timely and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, the former CBC and NBC correspondent best known for his
rooftop reports of Iraqi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia during the
Gulf War, spent a month back in the Persian Gulf region trying to
get a sense of how the United Nation's postwar economic sanctions
against Iraq are affecting average citizens there.
</P>
<P>
   His report is not the first to reveal that sanctions have dealt
a serious blow to the health and well-being of Iraq's lower and
middle classes, chiefly by limiting supplies of food and medicine.
But it may be the most personal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the close watch of Iraqi government ``minders,'' Kent's
crew was able to film the wedding celebration of two young Iraqis,
Sahar and Ali, who demonstrate that life goes on despite hardships
that were largely unknown before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, for example, could never afford to buy Sahar's wedding gown
in today's economy. He had to borrow money from friends just to
rent Sahar's dress for a day, and he can't afford to provide a home
for his new bride. For now, a room in his father's house is their
honeymoon haven.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed among these views of real life are visits to the
streets of Baghdad and Basra, where formerly well-off families now
rely on meager handouts of food; to Iraq's oil fields, still
pumping less than half of what the country produced before the war;
and to a couple of members of the intelligentsia whose identities
are masked because they fear reprisals from Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Kent is careful not to ask the average man in the street for
opinions about Hussein. An innocent comment could be misconstrued
by a minder. Even a visit to a school-
</P>
<P>
   yard ends with the youngsters shouting pro-Saddam chants on the
command of their nervous teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Kent makes clear that Hussein is a master of making the United
Nations _ and, by extension, the United States _ the villain in
this drama. Popular opinion on that score is easy to measure, even
if Hussein might be responsible for worsening the effects of the
international economic embargo to further his own agenda. But, in a
police state where 30 percent of the population is thought to be
malnourished, Hussein is the only public-relations practitioner and
people have little choice but to accept his spin on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wedding in Basra'' is the first in a planned series of ``World
Watch'' television specials produced by Kent's Fast Forward Films
with Detroit Public Television and Lark International, a
production/distribution consortium consisting of four
PBS-affiliated stations that includes Seattle's KCTS/9.
</P>
<P>
   Its fairly obvious conclusion is that Iraqis will never rise up
against their oppressor if they're hungry and poor. Yet sanctions
continue in place and there seems to be no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting hallmark of ``Wedding in Basra,'' though, is the
uncertain future of innocent Iraqis caught in the latest squeeze.
After seeing the faces of Sahar and Ali, or the anguish of a baby
who cries without tears because of severe dehydration, the specter
of renewed bombing can never be viewed solely as a ``strategic''
option.

U.S. SIGNS GLOBAL WARMING ACCORD BUT APPROVAL REMAINS DISTANT
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Retopping, moving up Gore.) 
 (htv) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday signed the
international agreement to fight global warming, affirming a
crucial American role in a long environmental crusade but not
raising any hope of Senate approval in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The signing, which the administration has long promised,
reinforces its commitment to the agreement, which calls for sharp
cuts in emissions of industrial gases from burning coal, oil, wood
and natural gas. But the accord is not legally binding unless the
Senate approves it.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said, ``Our signing of the protocol
underscores our determination to achieve a truly global solution to
this global challenge.'' But he emphasized that much more
bargaining lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the agreement in the United States immediately
raised an outcry, but the step was widely applauded in Argentina,
where some 150 nations are meeting to debate details of how the
accord can be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, the chief U.S. delegate to the talks in Buenos
Aires, announced there Thursday morning that the United States
would sign the pact, which was negotiated last year in Kyoto,
Japan. Peter Burleigh, the acting U.S. representatives to the
United Nations, signed it in New York on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, as expected, will not yet submit the
Kyoto Protocol for approval by the Senate, where it faces
substantial opposition from critics who say the costs to industry
of compliance would damage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said all along that the United States would
sign the accord before the deadline next March, but would not
ratify it unless key American provisos are accepted. Given the pace
of the continuing talks, that probably means it will not be
approved before the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of the United States, the leading
source of the waste industrial gases that scientists say cause
global warming, the agreement would collapse. The United States was
the 60th nation to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyoto is a landmark achievement, but it is a work in progress
and key issues remain outstanding,'' said Eizenstat, who is the
undersecretary of state for economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, he said the signing was intended to
strengthen the U.S. negotiating hand, but critics in Congress,
echoing the views of their constituents in industries like coal and
automobiles, said that it would reduce U.S. leverage instead.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat called the announcement a high point in negotiations
that otherwise have focused on incremental advances toward putting
the complex agreement into force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not gilding the lily when I say there was near euphoria
among delegates here,'' he said. ``They just felt this was a real
sign of U.S. leadership. I think there was really a doubt that we
were really going to pursue this, with all the opposition in the
Senate and in other quarters. The feeling was that perhaps the
domestic opposition was so stiff that we were going to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   The protocol, which strengthens a global treaty negotiated in
Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and ratified during the Bush administration,
would commit the United States to steep cuts in its emissions of
gases like carbon dioxide, which comes from burning fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists say that rising atmospheric concentrations
of these greenhouse gases, warming the earth's surface like an
invisible quilt, are threatening to disrupt the planet's climate
and to cause potentially grave environmental harm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the United States would have to cut its
emissions by about 7 percent from the 1990 level over the next 10
to 15 years. Since 1990, emissions have been steadily increasing,
making that target even more ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions that the United States is demanding are meant to
hold down the costs of compliance, and to increase the chances that
the Senate will eventually approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. condition is establishing a system of international
trading in emissions credits, effectively allowing the United
States to buy its way out of meeting goals by paying other
countries to reduce their emissions further. Another is persuading
developing nations to take a larger role in cutting emissions,
encouraging them with financial assistance from developed nations
who would take emissions credits in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Both ideas face strong resistance from some countries that say
the first steps must be taken by industrial nations like the United
States, which historically has emitted about a quarter of all
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, opponents of the treaty led by major energy
producers and consumers are continuing to marshal opposition in
Congress, arguing that its emissions targets cannot be met without
damaging the economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a leading proponent of the accord, said
in Buenos Aires that signing the protocol ``gives us the
credibility to be at the table'' in the continuing talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we can not only make sure it happens, but that it
happens in the way that we prefer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democrat who opposes the protocol, Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, said that ``the timing of this signing only encourages
countries who refuse to be part of any effort to limit greenhouse
gas emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Argentina pledged to limit its emissions, and on
Thursday Kazakhstan did the same, but populous countries like China
and India, whose emissions are growing quickly, continue to resist
accepting formal limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has chosen a risky path both domestically and
internationally,'' said Connie Holms, the chairwoman of the Global
Climate Coalition, which represents major industry groups opposed
to the treaty. ``Clinton has sent the U.S. careening down an
endless highway which appears on no maps, has no speed limits, no
police patrols, and no exit or entrance ramps.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R.-Neb., who sponsored a Senate resolution
last year that opposed signing the treaty unless certain conditions
were met, said the signing ``blatantly contradicts the will of the
United States Senate'' and dared Clinton to submit it to the
Senate. A two-thirds majority is required for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this treaty is good enough to sign, it's good enough to be
submitted to the Senate for an open, honest debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups praised the signing, but some complained
that so far the United States is not doing enough to cut its own
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a more vigorous commitment to domestic action, U.S.
demands for more action by developing countries are like a
chain-smoking parent telling his children that smoking is bad for
them,'' said John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, an environmental advocacy group. He urged the
administration to take unilateral steps to cut emissions of carbon
dioxide from automobiles, power plants and other sources.

GOP DELAYED INQUIRY FAR TOO LONG, GEPHARDT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill.)  (jw) 
By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt on
Thursday scathingly criticized the congressional investigation of
President Clinton, accusing Republicans of wasting weeks when they
could have been focusing on disputed material.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview, Gephardt made clear that despite his
criticism, he wanted the House to finish the inquiry this year. But
he still called on Republicans to conduct a fair and thorough
investigation in that period. He said Republicans were putting
Congress in the position of having to vote on impeachment with only
the independent counsel's report as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed to really get on this, really do a good job and
really work hard, and they just didn't do it, partly because I
don't think they understood what the impact was politically,'' said
Gephardt of Missouri.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the full House to vote on articles of
impeachment, ``on or about Dec. 15,'' but he did not predict the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's comments were his most pointed and detailed critique
of the Republican-led inquiry headed by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel dismissed Gephardt's complaints. ``The
minority leader is apparently working from the same playbook as the
White House and committee Democrats, which is avoid the facts and
attack the process,'' said a Republican committee spokeswoman, who
spoke on condition on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, if we had taken some action before the election,
it's certain that we would have been attacked by the Democrats for
conducting the inquiry in a political manner,'' the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt questioned the committee's decision to call Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr on Nov. 19 as its first, and so far, only
witness, although many Democrats on the panel were demanding a few
weeks ago that Hyde summon Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure out what he's going to say, other than reading
the report, and most people can read who are on the committee,''
Gephardt said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starr may ``raise the specter'' of his other unresolved
inquiries _ involving the White House travel office and former
Justice Department official Webster Hubbell _ Gephardt said. Asked
how Democrats would respond if that happened, Gephardt said with a
laugh, ``Complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats should avoid questioning Starr about how he conducted
his inquiry, Gephardt said. ``We don't have time now to do what we
were supposed to do, much less go off on another wild goose
chase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' first big mistake, Gephardt said, was not
establishing bipartisan standards for impeachment after voting on
Oct. 8 for a formal inquiry. That would have allowed lawmakers to
compare Starr's findings with the standards to determine if further
investigation was even warranted.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next misstep, Gephardt said, was not quickly identifying
disputed facts and focusing on them. ``What did Betty Currie do or
didn't do?'' said Gephardt, referring to Clinton's personal
secretary, who retrieved gifts the president had given to Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to drag everybody before the committee and have
a circus,'' Gephardt said. ``You can go out and do depositions with
these people. I just don't think it's sensible for the Congress to
just take this thing from Ken Starr and say we assume all of this
is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee sent Clinton a questionnaire last week,
asking him to say flatly whether he had lied under oath, obstructed
justice or tampered with witnesses. White House spokesman James
Kennedy said Thursday that White House lawyers were still mulling
over the request.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt asked why the committee didn't send the 81
questions to the president sooner. ``Why did they wait until after
the elections to send the questions?'' he said. ``They could have
had a deposition of the president or sent him interrogatories and
gotten answers. Anything they didn't like the answer to they could
have then gone back with other questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledge that meeting Hyde's goal of finishing by
year's end is ambitious. ``That's why we were out six weeks ago
saying, let's start now,'' Gephardt said. ``The committee could
have worked right up to the election. They sat for two weeks while
we were doing the whole budget.''
</P>
<P>
   When Congress adjourned before the mid-term elections, committee
members left, too, though most of them did not face tough races,
Gephardt said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have had the staff at least doing some of the
depositions if they had agreed on what they needed to find out,''
he said. ``They didn't do anything. They sat.''

   STATE FARM INSURANCE WINS APPROVAL FOR THRIFT CHARTER
</P>
<P>
   Federal thrift regulators have permitted State Farm Insurance,
the automobile and homeowners' insurer, to begin using its network
of agents to market such banking products as car loans, mortgages
and certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   While other insurance companies have received charters in the
last year, officials said that none had as wide a base of agents
who could offer as broad a line of full-service consumer banking as
State Farm.

   A $42 BILLION PACKAGE FOR BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, the International Monetary Fund
and more than a dozen nations are expected to announce a package of
loans to Brazil totaling at least $42 billion to stabilize the
country's economy, officials said. The total is said to include
more than $5 billion from the United States, the biggest commitment
of taxpayers' money to alleviate a foreign economic crisis since
the Mexico bailout in 1995.

   A NEW STIMULUS PLAN FOR JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the governing Liberal Democratic Party of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi released a plan to bolster the economy, but
the markets greeted it skeptically and analysts described it as a
hodgepodge of measures that would have little effect. This new
package could end up being worth about $165 billion, but the size
and implementation will depend on political developments.

ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING AGENCIES AND ADVERTISERS SQUARE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contentious dispute between the two associations representing
advertisers and agencies, which began when the advertiser
association unexpectedly extended membership to agencies, is
growing more pronounced as some longtime agency executives express
their qualms about the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are being voiced a month after officials of the
Association of National Advertisers stunned the leaders of the
American Association of Advertising Agencies by revealing that they
would open their ranks of paying members to agencies. The proposal
was couched in terms of the benefits of agencies joining with
clients to bolster efforts to build brands.
</P>
<P>
   To help draw attention to the new welcome mat, Denis Beausejour,
vice president for advertising at Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. in
Cincinnati _ the world's largest advertiser _ sent brief,
encouraging letters to the heads of 11 P&AMP;G agencies, including Leo
Burnett Co., Grey Advertising and the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi unit of
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to have agencies participate in the ANA will
help us create a much stronger voice for brand building,''
Beausejour wrote, adding, ``I will look forward to handling any
questions you may have on this.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the new policy startled the agency association
leaders was that they were notified only moments before it was
announced from the stage during a general session of the 89th
annual conference of the advertiser association in Naples, Fla.
Other agency executives found out only later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' said David Bell, president and chief
executive at Bozell Worldwide in New York, a unit of True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era when there has been greater-than-ever cooperation
between the associations,'' he asked, ``why would anyone launch
such a program without having discussed it?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the
agency association, known as the Four A's, wrote cautionary letters
to senior management of 25 large agencies that are likely to be
solicited for membership in the advertiser association. The
letter-writing campaign was reported this week by the trade
publication Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``As proposed, what the ANA is seeking is free marketing advice
for their members from the top agencies in the business,'' Drake
wrote, ``advice the agencies will have to PAY to give.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the ANA has stated that raising money is not the
purpose of this,'' he added, ``the cost of full membership in the
ANA would be a significant additional expense for our agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and agencies have cooperated on important matters of
mutual interest ``via joint committees, task forces and/or
coalitions,'' Drake wrote. ``I know of no reason why we cannot do
the same'' in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, in a telephone interview yesterday from his office in New
York, demurred at a suggestion that he was stepping up a fight with
the advertiser association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to go to war with the ANA,'' he said. ``The
Four A's will go on regardless how this turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's incumbent on me to give something in writing to my
members expressing my point of view,'' he added, which is in
essence that the proposal was ``a stupid idea'' and ``not very well
thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pralgever, a spokeswoman for John Sarsen, president and
chief executive of the advertiser association in New York, said he
was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The letter duel _ and the increasingly loud buzz about the
widening rift between the two trade organizations _ is being taken
seriously by several Madison Avenue veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all for anything that builds the value of brands,'' said
Edward Wax, chairman emeritus of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, who
advises the agency on association relations, ``and we welcome any
opportunity to work closely with the ANA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But personally, I don't think agencies need to become members
of the ANA to work hand in hand with advertisers,'' he added. ``ANA
represents the advertisers, and they have some goals that aren't
necessarily the same as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a former chairman of the agency association, said that he
was worried about the expense of paying dues to an additional
organization; such fees can cost $100,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is ``to bring us together for the purposes of brand
building,'' Bell said, ``I wish the ANA would consider an associate
membership at a more afforable cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Another association, the American Advertising Federation, which
includes advertisers, agencies and media companies as members, has
formed a task force to assess the implications of the shift by the
advertiser association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real challenge here,'' said Wally Snyder, president
and chief executive of the federation in Washington. ``It's time
for groups to work together, not split apart in internecine
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he was not worried that agencies would cancel
memberships in the federation if they joined the advertiser
association because of the federation's focus on other programs
like ``grass-roots lobbying in 220 markets, cultural diversity''
and advertising education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dues mailings went out in late October,'' he added.
``We'll know for sure when the dollars come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The testy debate between advertisers and agencies should not be
allowed to obscure some fundamental verities, an advertising
educator asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there was another way to introduce it,'' said Robert
Lauterborn, who attended the advertiser conference, ``but the
principle that agencies should be treated as marketing partners
instead of second-class citizens makes all the sense in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't us against them,'' said Lauterborn, the James L.
Knight professor of advertising at the School of Journalism and
Mass Communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. ``Branding is the business both are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Many chief executives who received letters from Drake were not
available to discuss whether they planned to join the advertiser
association, according to spokesmen at their agencies, who
described them as ``out of town,'' ``traveling'' and ``off site.''
</P>
<P>
   One spokesman, questioned about all the similar explanations,
replied, ``In this case, it's true.''

GM MEETINGS END WITH HUNDLEY STILL A MET, WILLIAMS STILL UNSIGNED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ The New York Mets' altered contingent left for
home Thursday with one expected trade made (Bobby Bonilla) and one
expected trade not made (Todd Hundley). Their New York Yankee
counterparts left having conducted no business, but confident that
the upstart Arizona Diamondbacks had not blown them out of the
uncharted Bernie Williams waters.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, actually left the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel after the general manager meetings ended without
knowing for sure if the Diamondbacks had really offered Williams
$100 million for seven years, as a television report had
proclaimed. But, he said, he did not care. ``It doesn't matter if I
believe it or not,'' he said when he was asked if he believed the
report. ``We'll do what we're comfortable with and not be governed
by what any other club might do. We'll compete for this player in
the area we're comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Cashman left to drive north to Tampa and a meeting
with his boss, George Steinbrenner, the man who supposedly had made
the eye-popping offer to Williams said he had made no offer at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can start and end it with we did not make an offer to
Bernie Williams or Scott Boras,'' Jerry Colangelo, the
Diamondbacks' managing partner, said in a telephone interview,
including the center fielder's agent in his characteristically
direct response. ``None. No offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have received offers of another kind for Hundley, but
they have not liked any of them enough to trade their erstwhile
catcher, and the teams that have made the offers have not liked
what the Mets have requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here and I would have said the absolute chances of him
being traded at this meeting are very, very good,'' said Frank
Cashen, the Mets' interim general manager. ``As each day passes,
they become somewhat slimmer that we do it. The next step would be
the winter meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashen said about six teams have expressed serious interest in
Hundley, including the Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles
Dodgers. The Dodgers have offered second baseman Eric Young; the
Mets have asked for Darren Dreifort, a starting pitcher. The talks
with the Orioles have centered on relief pitching.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Orioles' organization said the Mets asked for
two relievers, Armando Benitez and Arthur Rhodes, plus a third
player. The Orioles would be willing to trade one of them,
especially after reaching agreement Thursday with a free-agent
reliever, Mike Timlin, on a four-year, $16 million contract. If
they had to settle for one, the Orioles believe, the Mets would
prefer Rhodes, a hard-throwing left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Cashen, without discussing other players, said the teams were
not close on a deal. Even if they were to agree on players, the
Orioles would want extensive medical data on Hundley's surgically
repaired right shoulder before completing a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was April 1,'' Cashen said, ``there would be a better
chance because a lot of people would like to see him play before
they invest that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has $11.7 million guaranteed for the next two years.
Would it be to the Mets' advantage to wait?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared to do it now,'' Cashen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cashen said some clubs have inquired about Hundley only to learn
they were on his list of 12 teams he could not be traded to. Cashen
did not identify them, but Anaheim, Toronto and Milwaukee fit that
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them have very serious interest and were kind of taken
aback that he didn't want to go there,'' the unretired executive
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not been mentioned as a team interested in
Hundley, but they are not on his no-no list, and the general
manager of another club suggested how Hundley could get his wish
and be traded to the other team in town.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen, he said, if the Yankees became desperate to
acquire center fielder Jim Edmonds to replace Williams, and the
Angels asked for Jorge Posada. That would open a spot for Hundley.
It is highly unlikely, however, that the Mets would take a chance
on having Hundley stay in town.
</P>
<P>
   Another center fielder came up in a conversation the Yankees had
Thursday. Walt Jocketty, the St. Louis general manager, met with
Cashman to ask about pitching, but the only player the Yankees
would want from the Cardinals is center fielder Ray Lankford, and
Jocketty again said he was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said he spoke with Boras Thursday, but he divulged
nothing of their conversation, including whether they talked money.
Colangelo spent much of the day Wednesday with Williams in Phoenix
and had dinner with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about everything but money,'' Colangelo said. ``I
wanted to find out what Bernie is about, what are his motivations.
He wants to see what's out there. He hasn't eliminated any options.
He has great respect for what the Yankees have accomplished and his
part in that. I don't rule out the strong possibility that he winds
up back where he is. He didn't say he's gone or he's going anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said no offer would be made until he heard from Boras
about Williams' plans and his desire to play for the Diamondbacks.
If the time comes when he makes an offer, the owner said: ``I'll
announce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to compete dollar for dollar. There will be a
time when we do that, but I can't compete now with teams that are
much further along. If someone likes what we're doing and wants to
be part of this, I have a great interest in him. But if it's
someone who wants to go to the highest bidder, I pass. With Bernie,
I think he wants to take a look.''

 &HT;    OHIO CONGRESSMAN TELLS OF FAMISHED CHILDREN EATING CORN COBS IN
NORTH KOREA
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just finished with his fourth tour of North Korea,
Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, spoke Friday of seeing famished children
eating corncobs and of hillsides across the country crammed with
fresh white gravestones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no heat for hospitals and buildings,'' he said.
``There's no medicine in the hospitals. We saw doctors operating
without pain medication, and they had to do it by sunlight because
there were no (electric) lights. They had to hold the person
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also spoke of a hard-edged mood he found among North Korean
diplomats, who told him that Kim Jong Il's regime feels
``insulted'' by American pressure to obtain on-site inspection of a
suspected underground nuclear weapons facility.
</P>
<P>
   Hall quoted vice minister of foreign affairs Kim Gye Gwan as
telling him during five hours of face-to-face talks: ``We won't
sell our sovereignty rights to purchase food.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by telephone from a stop-over in South Korea, Hall
said his driving tours of southern and northeastern areas of North
Korea suggested malnutrition continues to be widespread throughout
the countryside, even though conditions in the capital Pyongyang
appear to have improved slightly since his last visit about a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw grave markers on almost every hill,'' said Hall of his
drives outside Pyongyang during a five-day North Korean visit.
``You know they're new because they are white, while the older ones
are gray and worn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he was told by officials of the United Nations
Children's Fund in North Korea that 95 percent of water throughout
the country is contaminated and that 30 percent of North Korean
children below the age of 2 are ``acutely malnourished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he questioned some 50 foreign humanitarian workers in
North Korea on whether they knew of evidence that Western food aid
for hungry civilians was being diverted to feed the Army and other
security technicians, as was charged recently by the international
relief group Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that food aid is not being diverted in any
large-scale way,'' said Hall, who said he was convinced that with
some exceptions, donated Western food was reaching people in real
need.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton congressman said he would return to Washington to
caution colleagues that the United States should try to avoid a
needless confrontation with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say we've got to be careful about rattling our
sabers,'' Hall said. ``We've got to be firm, but we have got to be
patient. We shouldn't connect the issues of humanitarian aid to the
issue of site visits. If we do that, we will force a
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall spoke just three days before Charles Kartman, a high-level
U.S. State Department official, is due in the North Korean capital
to press for access to the nuclear site. He said he was concerned
about recent news reports from Washington suggesting that Kartman
will insist on inspecting the underground site near the city of
Yongbyon, where American surveillance cameras spotted more than
10,000 workers last August.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, asked what he had learned from North Korean officials
about the suspected underground plutonium-making facility, said,
``I didn't learn anything about it. Of course they've got lots of
underground facilities and have had ever since the Korean War. It
is not new for them to have excavations.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a secret system would violate the 1994 Agreed Framework in
which North Korea pledged to freeze its nuclear weapons development
in return for $4.5 billion in American nuclear energy reactors and
alternative energy supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kartman team is not expected to try to visit the underground
site during its three-day visit. Negotiators may threaten to pull
out from the 1994 agreement if North Korea does not grant site
access to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also supplies food aid to North Korea, including
300,000 tons of grain just pledged in September.

POWERHOUSE GROWS ON THE PRAIRIE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Their quarterback has been muzzled and their
most decorated player is a 5-foot-9-inch Argentine-born kicker.
Their coach prefers chief executive officer-styled power suits over
the warmups sported by most members of his fraternity. He doesn't
eat until midnight, when his workaholic day is over, and he acts as
if he would rather play the most important game in his program's
history on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Just the Kansas State Wildcats against the Nebraska Cornhuskers
in an empty stadium. Instead, Bill Snyder and his K-State players
have been found out.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of the college football world and the national
television cameras have turned to this windswept prairie town in
the northeast part of the Sunflower State to see whether the
Wildcats are the best team in the nation, as the coaches have
voted, or a pretty nice squad puffed up to 9-0 on a diet of
nonconference rice cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will know on Saturday, when Kansas State plays host to
Nebraska, a team that already has two losses this season, but also
holds a huge psychological advantage over the Wildcats: the
Cornhuskers have beaten them 29 straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a make-or-break game for this program,'' Snyder
said. ``If you lose, it means you're 9-1. If you win, you're still
undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a profession that finds comfort in cliches, Snyder, 59,
fields questions the way Bill Gates gives Senate testimony:
pointedly, defiant and utterly confident.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what Snyder has done for Kansas State is the college
football equivalent of what the Microsoft chief did to the computer
industry. Ten years ago, Snyder was the offensive coordinator at
Iowa when Kansas State brought him in to do something, anything,
for a program considered the worst in college football. The
Wildcats were 3-40 in the four previous seasons, averaged about
20,000 in attendance _ less than half of capacity _ and had
facilities worse than some junior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder rebuilt, however, with attention to detail rather than
inspired genius. He got his assistants' salaries doubled, offered
to write a $100,000 check to help fund a new football facility and
insisted Wildcat football operate on a minute-to-minute schedule _
practices, meetings, even pre-game introductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we've got it to four and a half minutes,'' Snyder
offered, though no one asked, on how long it would take to
introduce his 25 seniors for their final home game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season, 1989, Kansas State was 1-10. But the
Wildcats are 74-27-1 since then, have won at least nine games for
six consecutive seasons, and have won 17 consecutive games _ the
nation's second longest streak, only one behind U.C.L.A.'s 18.
</P>
<P>
   Now, KSU Stadium is consistently sold out at 42,000-plus and
soon will be expanded to 50,000 with 31 luxury suites. Jack Vanier,
a Kansas rancher, came up with the money to build a weight room and
resource and office center so Snyder didn't have to. Still, the
Vanier Football Complex is a monument to the coach's
fastidiousness, down to the doormats ordering visitors to wipe
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is all about business,'' said Martin Gramatica, who is
closing in on his second Lou Groza Place-Kicker Award, is a
consensus all-American and has kicked field goals from 55 and 65
yards this year. ``He pays attention to things others don't think
about. He wants us to do the same. I guess you can say we're
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Wildcats have been deadly efficient. They are ranked
in the top 3 nationally in special teams and total defense. Their
offense, led by the voluble and, by all accounts, combustible
quarterback Michael Bishop, averages 478.4 yards, 10th in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   On a roster filled with good players you've never heard of,
Bishop may be the greatest you may never hear from _ at least for
the rest of this year. He has 10 rushing touchdowns and 18
touchdown passes against only one interception and is the nation's
sixth most efficient quarterback. Last season, at the Fiesta Bowl,
college fans saw why pro scouts predict a terrific National
Football League career for the 6-foot-2-inch, 205-pound
quarterback. He threw for 317 yards and 4 touchdowns and ran for 73
yards and another score in a 35-18 victory over Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   One statistic, however, says more about Bishop's makeup and is
responsible for the silence Snyder imposed on him after Kansas
State's fifth game this season. Bishop is 44-1 as a starting
quarterback, including two perfect seasons capped by national
championships at Blinn Community College in Texas. He is maniacally
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Colorado game in Boulder last month, Bishop
publicly predicted a big day for Wildcat running back Frank Murphy,
comments that the Buffaloes turned into bulletin-board fodder.
Bishop proceeded to struggle through a 9-of-25 passing performance,
throwing his only interception of the year, and the Wildcats barely
escaped with a 16-9 victory. Worse, in the course of the night,
Bishop berated himself and his teammates for their poor play. After
the game, Snyder told him he could no longer talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Bishop had been silenced. Last year,
after a 56-26 loss at Nebraska _ Bishop's only collegiate defeat _
the quarterback questioned his teammates' heart and quickly found
his media privileges revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is a super-nice guy,'' said wide receiver Darnell
McDonald, who leads the team in catches. ``But he is hyper. He
screams and yells before and, sometimes, during the game. He hates
to see us play badly. But he's our guy. He's our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder does not apologize for making his leader unavailable,
explaining matter-of-factly it is a distraction Kansas State
doesn't need. There will be no muddy footprints trampling on the
Wildcats' concentration. His team, too, has taken on his
businesslike character. None of them were highly recruited _ all of
them have settled into the anonymity of this town of 43,000 at a
school more renowned for its veterinary school than football.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bishop, McDonald came from junior college. Gramatica was
unearthed in Florida after a single high school season of kicking.
Both acknowledge the Nebraska game is one they have been waiting to
play their whole careers. They are locked in on a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, people don't know who we are and they question our
schedule,'' said McDonald, referring to nonconference games against
Indiana State, Northern Illinois and Northeast Louisiana. ``But
that isn't what it's about. We're just a bunch of fellas who came
here to play for each other. We work hard and have unity. We know
who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Future national champions?
</P>
<P>
   ``We win, we're still undefeated,'' said McDonald, echoing his
coach. ``We got a lot of days left before we can say we took care
of that business.''

 &HT;    Irish bishop sent to serve Palm Beach diocese
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Since Bishop J. Keith Symons resigned in
disgrace five months ago, the 210,000 Catholics of the Palm Beach
diocese have wondered who might be sent to tend to their spiritual
torment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the answer came _ from the Vatican, through the
mountains of East Tennessee, by way of County Clare, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. O'Connell, a 60-year-old Irishman and the first
bishop of Knoxville, Tenn., has been named by Pope John Paul II as
the new leader of the troubled diocese with 51 parishes sprawling
from Boca Raton to the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think I was chosen because of the Holy Spirit,''
O'Connell said. ``The Holy Father did me no favors in sending me to
a place I'll sweat my life out. I hope it will trim me down a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   The portly, gregarious cleric's gift for homespun humor will be
tested as he attempts to repair the breach of faith caused by
Symons' ouster in June, when he admitted sexually molesting five
altar boys early in his career as a priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't want to underestimate the amount of healing
that needs to be done,'' O'Connell said. ``But there's always
healing that's needed. I have tireless energy. I can wear people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons, who the church says has been receiving psychiatric
treatment since his removal at an undisclosed site, was one of the
first to congratulate O'Connell on hearing the news two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for 10 years,'' O'Connell said. ``He sounded as
close to ecstatic as a man could sound. He said he was delighted
for me and offered to help in any way he could. I was glad to hear
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's performance since 1988 in building the fledgling
15,000-square-mile Knoxville diocese from 30,000 Catholics to
45,000 was an important reason for his selection, said Bishop
Robert N. Lynch, who replaced Symons as the diocese's interim
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has demonstrated a wonderful ability to lead the church in
a rural area, all the while increasing the number of priests,
parishes and vocations,'' Lynch said. ``He is known as wonderfully
happy, very approachable, a good listener and collaborative in
every way.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, Lynch said, was equally adept at bringing the Word to
those in the Appalachian hills or people in the college town. In
Knoxville, O'Connell was known as a cleric who worked to foster
unity among religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very, very dear friend to me,'' said Rabbi
Howard Simon of Knoxville's Temple Beth El. ``He is my ideal as a
clergy. I've told him if I can be as good a rabbi as he is a
bishop, then I'll be a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Under O'Connell's leadership, the diocese involved itself in
local issues. Several years ago, Catholics joined with Methodists
and Episcopalians to intercede in the behalf of Wade Houston, the
former University of Tennessee basketball coach. Houston, who is
black, wasn't invited to join a local country club when other
coaches at the school were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bishop O'Connell has a kind of calming influence, whether it
be in addressing racial concerns or social problems,'' Simon said.
``People from all walks of life respected him because they knew
this was a genuine man.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, O'Connell's 10th anniversary in the city was
celebrated with a gala at the Knoxville Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an overflow crowd,'' Simon said. ``The place was
packed. If it had happened in the '60s, they'd have called it a
love-in.''
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of ecumenism was not evident in O'Connell's early
life in the Republic of Ireland, where Catholicism rules
throughout. ``I was 21 years old and teaching in England when
somebody was pointed out to me as a Protestant,'' he recalls with a
smile. But from that first encounter with someone of another faith,
his record is a reflection of overtures to people of all faiths and
colors.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell served as the president of Knoxville's Association of
Christians, a diverse group that included Southern Baptists,
charismatics and evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a guiding light to many of us as a person who has
brought us together,'' said Rev. Robert Tharp, Episcopal bishop of
the Diocese of East Tennessee. ``One occasion was forging an
agreement among several churches against capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   When a predominantly black church was burned, O'Connell was
outspoken in condemning the act and bringing the community
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a commanding figure,'' Tharp said. ``He has been a
wonderful force and an enthusiastic supporter of the faith. I'm
just shocked. I'm so sorry he's leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being sent to Tennessee, O'Connell taught English,
chemistry and physics and was dean of students at the St. Thomas
Aquinas Seminary in Hannibal, Mo. He said he was ``serenely happy''
there when he was promoted to bishop and balked at going to
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resented being named bishop,'' he said wryly. ``Anyone who
wanted to be my friend would not talk to me about anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   With similar apprehension, O'Connell received the call last
Friday to move to Palm Beach County. He had just returned from Rome
on a trip with his church's choir. He had met with the pope two
days before the new assignment was given him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally cried all weekend,'' O'Connell said, lamenting his
departure from the ``beautiful mountains and valleys'' of
Tennessee. ``I'm giving up my family. I don't want you to think I'm
miserable _ I don't want you to cry in your beer for me, but that's
what I've been feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   He said turning the pope down was not an option: ``I probably
would have faced a papal firing squad if I did.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell will be installed officially at St. Ignatius Loyola
Cathedral in Palm Beach Gardens on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Within the diocese, there was relief that the leadership void
soon would be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we have a bishop,'' said Rev. Timothy Lynch,
pastor of Mary Immaculate Church in West Palm Beach. ``He will play
cautiously. He's going to wait and look and see and observe for the
next six months before he will move on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Whalen, deacon at St. Ignatius, thinks O'Connell is
suited for the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounds like he has a good, big heart,'' Whalen said. ``This
is very welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Knoxville, Rabbi Simon is mourning his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will miss him terribly,'' he said. ``He is a big, Irish
wonderful thing that I love to hug. I guarantee you he is the ideal
man to heal that diocese.''

MYTHS ALIVE: CRYPTOZOOLOGISTS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR UNEXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early last century aboriginal people in Africa talked about a
giant ape that was aggressive and stole their women. The Colonial
British administrators dismissed the stories as so much ``native
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1847 the stories turned out to be real. The Western
scientific community was shocked over the discovery of gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 it happened again. A primitive fish thought to be
extinct for 80 million years was pulled from South African waters.
Scientists were nonplussed over the rediscovery of the coelacanth.
</P>
<P>
   It happens more often than you think _ vertebrates once
steadfastly believed not to exist are suddenly discovered or
rediscovered. In fact, about 40 percent of all recognized mammal
species have been discovered in this century. Most of these are
bats and rodents, but there have been larger, more varied species,
too, like the Komodo dragon monitor lizard (Indonesian Islands,
1912), the giant forest hog (East Africa, 1902), the pygmy
chimpanzee (Congo, 1929), and the Vu Quang ox (Vietnam, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a 15-foot shark called megamouth was identified,
representing a completely new species, genus and family.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the search is a new breed of researchers called
cryptozoologists who go beyond traditional scientific methods as
they scour the planet looking into reports of zoologically
``unexpected'' animals.
</P>
<P>
   Most discoveries are being made in South America, Africa, Asia,
and, in the case of larger fish vertebrates, the ocean. But at
least one new specie of vertebrate is described in North America
every year, also.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, French zoologist Bernard Heuvelmans coined the
term ``cryptozoology'' in reference to researchers who study the
possible existence of hidden or secret animals. The publication of
his book, On The Track of Unknown Animals, attracted more
researchers to the field. In 1982 the International Society of
Cryptozoology was formed, which today consists of a small but
intrepid membership of 850 scientists and non-scientists
</P>
<P>
   Richard Greenwell, a mammalogist from Tucson, is the society's
secretary. He recently returned from a monthlong expedition in a
remote area of northern California. Object of the expedition was to
search for evidence supporting the existence of a very large
hominoid commonly referred to in this country as Sasquatch or
Bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this animal does indeed exist, it's a primate, a bipedal
ape covered with hair, very muscular and timid,'' Greenwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes there is considerable evidence supporting Bigfoot's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now over 3000 eyewitness reports that are so
consistent they're boring,''Greenwell said. ``Then there are
hundreds of footprint castes that have been analyzed by top people.
Most have been found to be anatomically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most dedicated researchers in this area, Greenwell believes
it's unfortunate that the tabloids and media often distort and
sensationalize the larger animal sightings like Bigfoot and the
``lake monsters'' seen around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough, he says, that cryptozoologists receive no
funding and are often quickly dismissed by those in the official
sciences.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say cryptozoologists don't apply scientific
methodology in their searches. They do, but their approach is
different from mainstream science.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike zoologists who accidentally discover new species while
doing broad ecological inventories, cryptozoologists target
specific animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is examine pre-existing evidence for a supposed
species,'' Greenwell said.
</P>
<P>
   They can get their leads from artwork, accounts in old
historical manuscripts, folkloric tales and reports from explorers
or native peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best places to look is in native markets,''
Greenwell said.
</P>
<P>
   That's where a biologist on his honeymoon last year in Indonesia
stumbled upon another coelacanth. The ``living fossil'' was just
hanging in an open market for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being outmanned by researchers in other areas,
cryptozoologists have in their brief existence been responsible for
the descriptions of several animals including a burrowing snake
from Vietnam, a giant gecko and a new parrot from Peru.
</P>
<P>
   James King, a primatologist and psychology professor at the
University of Arizona, is also a member of the International
Society of Cryptozoology. He said disproving reports of alleged new
species is also an important aspect of cryptozoological work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago we checked into a report of a mermaid around a
South Seas island,'' King said. ``It turned out to be a dugong, a
close relative of the manatee.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwell worked on that project as well as looking into reports
of onzas _ large, legendary cats of northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a specimen 10 years ago,'' Greenwell said. ``But when
the genetics were done we found it was just a longer-legged puma.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, sometimes, myths really are just that and do not have
biological counterparts. Such was the case with the chupacabra, a
devillike creature of Latin America that was supposed to be
especially taken with killing goats and pets. Cryptozoologists
believe it's a composite taken from several different folkloric
tales about animals of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But the way cryptozoologists look at it, you don't know until
you check it out.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the talk of this city's new civility, its
inhabitants have not exactly made ``Service With a Smile'' their
motto. So it seems an unlikely place to find candidates for a job
that turns on cheerful customer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Kathleen Arnold, perky and self-possessed in her
navy blue uniform and low-heeled pumps, standing in a basement room
in a hotel near La Guardia Airport last week, gamely auditioning
applicants for flight attendant positions with United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my job _ does anyone want it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd she faced was a real slice of the city: male and
female, ages 19 to 49 or more, heights from under five feet to
almost seven, clothes from snappy suits to faded jeans, and accents
redolent of Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, France, India,
Italy, Lebanon, Poland and West Africa (as well as the Bronx,
Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the group looked less like the smiling stewardesses
featured in airline ads, and more like the slightly surly
passengers whose plane has just circled Newark one time too many.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the point.
</P>
<P>
   More Americans, from all economic and cultural backgrounds, are
flying than ever before. Airline passenger traffic keeps setting
new records: Anyone who needs proof can visit the New York region's
three major airports around Thanksgiving, when more than a million
people will be getting on or off planes, according to the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is no longer the elegant, elitist activity it was
back in the 1950s and 1960s _ and being a flight attendant is no
longer the next best thing to being a movie star, as it was back
then. So in these days of low air fares and low unemployment,
airlines are frantically trying to find enough flight attendants to
serve travelers peanuts _ and, more seriously, to help them in
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone, all the major carriers, are hiring flight
attendants right now,'' said Karen Watson, a spokeswoman for
Dallas-based American Airlines, which stopped actively recruiting
in 1993 but is now hiring again, in New York and around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Because the airlines are looking for a more diverse group of
flight attendants to match their more diverse passenger base, they
are seeking employees who speak more than one language. That skill
is more common in New York than in, say, Boise, Idaho, or
Burlington, Vt., which is one reason the major airlines are
recruiting in the city. (Another reason is that they want to find
more flight attendants who are willing to live in New York which
many find too expensive or otherwise uncomfortable, Ms. Watson
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines has been doing a lot of interviewing at its
hub in Newark, where it is starting to fly larger planes that take
15 flight attendants, rather than the usual maximum of 10, said Jan
Bednar, manager of in-flight recruiting for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   But finding people who meet the airlines' exacting standards _
and who really want the job _ is not easy. Last year, United
Airlines interviewed 54,000 people to fill 2,000 jobs, and Ms.
Arnold's experience in Queens showed why. Of the roughly 300 people
who came after seeing newspaper advertisements, fewer than a third
will go on to a second interview in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average for last week was 33 percent, but in New York it
was much less,'' said Cathy Kress, manager of flight attendant
employment for United. One reason for the high rejection rate, she
said, was poor dependability records at previous jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle for aspiring flight attendants was the
audition. Ms. Arnold had each of the six groups she interviewed
line up and speak for half a minute on a topic she chose. The
reason, she explained, is that flight attendants must demonstrate
safety equipment to passengers before every flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally like to see that you can stand up in front of a
group of strangers and not pass out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few of the applicants had trouble following Ms. Arnold's
directions, especially in the group she asked to describe the last
time they had received ``really good customer service.'' Several
had prepared statements about why they wanted to become flight
attendants and had trouble switching gears, Ms. Arnold noted later.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the folks _ quite a big group _ who had trouble
coming up with any example of good customer service. Several
mentioned bus drivers who unbent enough to give them directions, or
waiters who actually brought them the food they had ordered. A
couple fell back on random acts of kindness, like the doorman who
said one of the tenants in his building brought him a roast chicken
one night when he worked a double shift.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest applause went to Nicole Taylor, a 20-year-old
student from Queens, who praised the waiter who first served her a
whole lobster _ and sat down at the table to show her how to eat
it.
</P>
<P>
   The job applicants also had to take a reading comprehension
test, which required them to read a paragraph related to the
airline business and then answer some multiple-choice questions.
Many of the New Yorkers performed poorly, Ms. Arnold said later,
after grading the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised, but in certain cities that happens
more often than in others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the candidates were put off by Ms. Arnold's explanation
of what the job entails. Recruits must spend nine weeks _ unpaid _
at a training school in Chicago, where they must pass weekly tests.
Then they are assigned to one of the 13 bases the company runs
across the country, from Boston to Seattle, and they have no hope
of transferring for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   New flight attendants then work ``on reserve,'' which means that
on the days they work, they are on call from midnight to midnight,
with no notion of where they are to travel. Depending on where they
are based, flight attendants can stay on reserve for years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen De Riso, an office manager from Queens, said she found the
idea of relocating to parts unknown ``a little disconcerting,''
adding that ``it's the not knowing _ but I haven't changed my
mind'' about the job, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   For all of this, flight attendants in their first year at United
make about $22,000 _ which is probably the most generous salary in
the industry, according to the Association of Flight Attendants,
which reports that at some airlines, the starting pay is as low as
$12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a surprising number of job seekers said they would be
willing to take a big pay cut to become a flight attendant. One of
those was Richard Appleman, 41, of Manhattan, who works in the
computer business and loves to travel. ``I'm sick of sitting in a
cubicle,'' Appleman said. ``I'd make less money, but be more
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Spearman, a recent college graduate from Long Island who
is working as an accountant, would also have to take a pay cut, she
said. But she was excited enough by the prospect of becoming a
flight attendant that she had even persuaded her mother, Alexandria
Spearman, to come try out with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother, who paid for my college, would have a heart
attack,'' she said, ``but I always wanted to be a flight attendant,
from when I was 7 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``lifelong dream'' theme was common among older applicants,
who make up a growing number of new flight attendants, according to
Ms. Kress from United. Mary Gil, 49, has raised four daughters in
Queens while working several jobs, including as a ticket agent. ``I
got married and postponed my dream,'' she said, ``but now that my
kids are grown up, I can pursue it.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the decision to try out for the job was born more of
a sudden restlessness. Jean Jason of Manhattan was flying back from
a vacation in Australia and got to chatting with the flight
attendants. ``On a 22-hour flight, they have a lot of time to spend
with you,'' she said. They convinced her that, after 16 years in
office jobs, she had found the career for her.
</P>
<P>
   A love of travel lay behind many people's decisions to try out
for the job. Flight attendants fly almost free; Ms. Arnold told her
groups of paying $30 to fly from Newark to San Francisco _ in first
class. Attendants also get scads of time off; they can work only 90
hours a month at United.
</P>
<P>
   That is part of the appeal for Art Titzell, a 30-year-old who
traveled from his home in southern New Jersey to the United
auditions. Titzell said he loves his work as a hair colorist, but
needs to find a job with benefits like health insurance. Since
flight attendants are allowed to have other jobs, he could continue
to do hair in his free time.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how strong the economy is, few of the applicants
said they really needed a job. One who did was Mellisa Sheppard, a
21-year-old from Brooklyn who has two young children. ``I want to
get my life on track and off public assistance,'' she said. Her
mother had agreed to take care of the children if she made it to
training school, and their father will help out ``until I get on my
feet,'' she said. ``I have it all worked out _ a job makes
everything much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the successful candidates will hear from United, which will
contact them within six weeks to arrange their visits to Chicago.
That interview will weed out more candidates. Some will prove to be
too tall (those over 6 feet 2 inches tend to bump their heads);
others will be too small to reach the safety equipment that is
stored in overhead bins.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the would-be flight attendants will be rejected because
they do not look ``professional,'' which boils down to just a few
rules, like ``no visible tattoos,'' Ms. Kress said. A surprising
number, she added, will fail the criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, United hopes to hire 2,500 flight attendants this
year, which keeps recruiters like Ms. Arnold hopping. Her next stop
was Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and after that, Los Angeles. But she, or
one of her colleagues, will be back in New York in January _ they
have 2,300 more flight attendants to hire next year.

LAMBRIGHT DOESN'T DESERVE ABUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Callers to a radio sports-talk show in Seattle
will sit on hold for as long as it takes to play a quarter of
college football, just to rant about the University of Washington
and coach Jim Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   Their anger is seriously misplaced. It's like screaming at the
policeman and the tow truck at the scene of a fender bender instead
of at the careless driver who caused the traffic snarl.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright and his players aren't responsible for their
screeching, swerving, braking, accident-waiting-to-happen season.
Instead of getting mad about the Huskies' 5-4 record, Washington
fans should marvel at the job Lambright and his crew have done
cleaning up the wreck former coach Don James so cavalierly walked
away from.
</P>
<P>
   James abruptly retired in August of 1993, on the same day
Pacific-10 Conference officials penalized the Huskies program for
myriad minor offenses that added up to a major lack of
institutional accountability. Lambright, James' longtime assistant,
was promoted, and in the process inherited the two-year ban on bowl
appearances and two-year reduction in scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The strangulating effects of the sanctions are starkly manifest
five years later, now that the players who entered school while the
penalties were in place are redshirt seniors or juniors. There
aren't many of them, which is the point. The loss of 20
scholarships, the lack of postseason exposure and the defections to
the NFL last spring of 10 players thinned their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright went into the season with his eyes wide open. ``When I
took this job, I knew this year would be the hardest with the
(ever-looming threat of) injuries and the type of schedule we
had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder he lobbied so hard for the multiyear contract
extension he signed in January, what with the Huskies opening with
games at Arizona State, against BYU and at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   When the Huskies beat ASU and BYU, Washington fans forgot this
was supposed to be a season of tempered expectations. They were
slapped with a stinging reminder in Week 3 when Nebraska manhandled
the Huskies 55-7.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before unbeaten UCLA's scrape with defeat at Oregon
State, the Huskies escaped with a one-point win over the Beavers
that sent some of the Washington boosters into a lather.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright was lambasted over the radio airwaves by fans that
Huskies senior Nigel Burton described with jeer and loathing as
``knee-jerkers... who want 70-0 blowouts and teams with no class
who just walk in and are brainless and stomp on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course. The truth is, the Washington squad that will
try to upend third-ranked UCLA on Saturday in Seattle might as well
be called the Generals. It has nine freshmen seeing regular duty on
defense, eight sophomores plugging spots on offense and seven
former walk-ons who are starting.
</P>
<P>
   Its leading tackler is a senior who paid his way to Washington
after the Big Sky Conference programs he had pinned his scholarship
hopes on stopped recruiting him. Imagine that, Eastern Washington's
castoff became Washington's catch.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the Pacific-10 probation, linebacker Todd Johnson and
Washington probably wouldn't have been a good fit. But Lambright
needed bodies and Johnson was happy to throw his around on special
teams. After his redshirt-freshman year, he was awarded an athletic
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the coaches) saw just that I was doing my job and was
accountable and was not in trouble as far as grades go,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   So he was a good kid. Now he can say he's also a fine football
player. Johnson has 56 tackles, 35 of them unassisted, and is tied
for the Pacific-10 lead in sacks with eight. He has more than held
his own with his more celebrated teammates, Lester Towns and
Marques Hairston. The kid who was rejected by the Big Sky schools
is making his mark in an even bigger constellation.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Lambright points to Johnson as proof that the success
of a program cannot be measured merely in the won-loss column.
</P>
<P>
   Success can't be measured in feet or inches either. Like
Johnson, jolting Joe Jarzynka was headed to a Big Sky school until
Washington's probationary status opened the door of opportunity in
Seattle a crack. Jarzynka slipped through, which isn't hard to do
when you stand 5-foot-7.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how no one comments too much on Jarzynka's size anymore.
The Huskies' smallest player is their big-play breaker. In this age
of specialization he does everything but fill the water bottles. He
plays four positions: receiver, kick returner, punt returner and
place-kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows quarterback Brock Huard is what makes Washington
tick. But it's players such as Johnson and Jarzynka who have kept
the program's heart beating, loud and strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are the more talented team. But the Huskies will be
tough to beat Saturday, just because so many of their players
already have fought far greater odds and won. &QL;

INSURER GETS U.S. CHARTER TO DEAL IN BANKING SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Further eroding legal barriers that have
discouraged insurance companies from entering the banking business,
federal savings regulators announced Thursday that they had
permitted State Farm Insurance Cos., the nation's largest
automobile and homeowners' insurer, to begin using its vast network
of agents to sell such banking products as car loans, mortgages and
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   While a few other insurers have received savings and loan
charters in the last year, officials said Thursday that none had as
wide a base of insurance agents who could offer as broad a line of
full-service consumer banking as State Farm.
</P>
<P>
   The charter will permit the company's agents to offer mortgages,
home equity loans and car loans and to solicit customers to make
federal-insured deposits that would be mailed to a new savings bank
based at the company's headquarters in Bloomington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are proposing a business strategy which nobody has really
tried before,'' said Ellen Seidman, director of the Office of
Thrift Supervision, which granted the charter Thursday after a
yearlong review. ``This is an important step in an evolution. We
are trying to maximize the possibility that this will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts noted that State Farm's proposal was
similar to the plan approved last year by regulators for Travelers
Group to convert its Delaware bank to a nationwide savings
institution. Another large insurer, Allstate, has also been awarded
a federal charter. But the activities of its banking unit are
largely limited to selling trusts, and it does not offer customers
the ability to open accounts to hold federal-insured deposits.
</P>
<P>
   For savers and borrowers, the move provides greater competition
among bankers for their business and one-stop shopping for basic
banking and insurance products. For the companies, the combination
is expected to let their agents expand offerings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is indicative of the convergence that is going on
throughout the financial services business,'' said Michael
Blumstein, an insurance-industry analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``Companies are looking to bring a broader array of
financial services to their customer base. We'll definitely see
more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   For regulators, the challenge is to keep the various lines of
business somewhat separate so that financial problems in the
insurance line do not spill over to threaten their banking
services, many of which are backed by federal insurance. Officials
emphasized Thursday that they had taken steps to discourage the
companies from forcing customers to use their banking services as a
condition of purchasing insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   With delays in Congress on repealing laws limiting the ability
of nonbanking companies to enter the banking business, regulators
have stepped in. Thursday's announcement reflected a growing trend
among companies in and out of financial services to seek nationwide
savings charters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Office of Thrift Supervision has granted
such charters to companies as diverse as Archer Daniels Midland;
Hillenbrand Industries, a leading maker of coffins, and the Ukrop's
supermarkets of Richmond. Applications for nationwide savings
charters have also been filed by Ford Motor Co., General Motors, GE
Capital and American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen insurance companies have filed applications for savings
charters, including AIG, CNA, Hartford Equitable. TransAmerica
Metropolitan Life Cigna Aetna and New York Life.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm will be able to begin its banking business once it
gets permission from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
officials said could be this month. The company initially plans to
operate in banking by using insurance agents in Illinois and
Missouri, but executives said they hoped to expand to more states.
State Farm has more than 16,000 agents in the United States. ``It
will allow us to create a branchless bank,'' said Stephen Witmer, a
State Farm spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the regulators to approve the State Farm charter
and those proposed by other traditional nonbanking companies was a
consequence of the continuing consolidation in the financial
services industry, experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more logical step toward the breaking down of archaic
regulations that have unduly restricted the activities of service
firms,'' said James Barth, a professor of finance at Auburn
University, who has written extensively on the banking industry and
worked as a consultant to regulators. ``The United States has
lagged badly behind the Europeans and as a consequence, it's
uncommon in the United States to permit insurance companies to do
these things.''

STATES WITH LAWSUITS PENDING REACH $200 DEAL WITH BIG TOBACCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Negotiators for states with lawsuits still pending
against Big Tobacco have struck a $200 billion, 30-state settlement
and say it as the best deal they can get after the collapse of a
national agreement earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona would receive a minimum of $2.67 billion over the first
25 years of the agreement, with no restrictions on the money's use.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement also would sharply restrict cigarette
advertising, help curtail youth smoking, and fund research and
countermarketing.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is expected to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The package, a draft version of which was obtained by ``The
Arizona Republic,'' is a diminished version of the $368 billion
national deal hammered out by state attorneys general in June 1997.
Gone are nicotine regulation by the Food and Drug Administration,
whistleblower protections, industry funding of classes to quit
smoking and severe penalties for failures to reduce youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's a good deal, and one that Arizona will sign, said
Attorney General Grant Woods, one of the lead negotiators of the
failed national settlement and a key figure in the recent talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we weigh our two options now _ settlement or go to trial
_ it's clear this is the way Arizona should go,'' Woods said.
``We're getting a lot of things we could never get in a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury could award only money, and probably a lot less than the
roughly $100 million per year the state will receive for the near
future under the agreement, Woods said. The advertising and
marketing restrictions, youth-smoking research, lobbying curbs,
document repository and other details of the settlement could not
be won in a trial and would be difficult to achieve in any
settlement arrived at by Arizona on its own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's lawsuit is set for trial in March.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not a done deal. Tobacco companies want a ``critical
mass'' of states to agree to the proposal, particularly the
population-heavy states of California and New York, before they'll
sign it. The states are reviewing the proposal over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said there is ``widespread consensus'' among the states in
support of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies were more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are declining to comment on any speculation or reports of
any settlement agreement,'' said Jan Smith, spokeswoman for R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House was pleased with the progress, saying
Thursday that from what it knows of the agreement, it's ``a real
step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said the administration will ``continue to push
Congress to enact comprehensive legislation to substantially reduce
youth smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the draft agreement, other provisions would:
</P>
<P>
   Create a national foundation to reduce teen smoking funded by
$25 million per year for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Create a national public education fund with $1.45 billion over
the next five years, largely to pay for counter-marketing targeting
youth smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Limit tobacco companies to one brand-name (such as Marlboro or
Winston) event sponsorship per year.
</P>
<P>
   Ban ads in stadiums and arenas, outdoor ads larger than a
poster, and cartoon figures. Human figures would be permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Ban distribution and sale of gear _ hats, shirts, etc. _
imprinted with brand logos after July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Disband the Council for Tobacco Research, the Tobacco Institute
and the Council for Indoor Air Research, but preserve their
records.
</P>
<P>
   Create a user-friendly World Wide Web site stocked with the
industry's smoking and health-related documents.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, John Rivers, head of the Arizona Hospital and
Healthcare Association, said health advocates likely will accept
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us were chagrined that some zealots in public health
community weren't satisfied and, because of that overzealousness,
we have an agreement that's not as good as the one we had last
June,'' he said.

Society said that he applauds the settlement, but that it's only a
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will monitor the Legislature to try to ensure the
money goes for public health, and he'll comb through the agreement
out of mistrust of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure there isn't something in that document
that will come back and harm us at some point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all sides seem ready to accept a smaller, narrower deal
because the alternative may be no deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   Elated attorneys general emerged from months of talks in June
1997 with a package that would have banned the industry's most
effective advertising tools, regulated nicotine as a drug, set
strict reduction targets and penalties for childrens' smoking, and
cost tobacco companies at least $15 billion a year. Arizona could
have received as much as $4 billion in the first 25 years of that
deal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, tobacco spokesman called the 1997 agreement a
``bitter pill'' the industry had to swallow to avoid decades of
messy and expensive litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, health care advocates _ particularly former
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and former FDA Director David
Kessler _ denounced the deal as soft on tobacco and inadequate in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal went to Congress for approval, and that's where the
carefully crafted agreement began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   By the time legislators were done piling on under pressure from
health care advocates on one side and tobacco farmers on the other,
the lead tobacco bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
had grown to $516 billion. The industry balked at the onerous
provisions and the bankrupting cost, and that proposal died in June
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our best to do everything we could think of regarding
tobacco, and the Congress and the president were unable to get the
job done,'' Woods said. He said he and other attorneys general will
try to get McCain and other lawmakers to pass legislation to ``fill
in the gaps'' between the new deal and the old one.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was in Asia and could not be reached, according to a
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June proposal died, the legal climate has changed. Big
Tobacco has settled with four states for nearly $40 million total:
Mississippi, the first state to sue to recover costs from treating
sick smokers, Florida, Texas and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies drew the line with Washington state, which
was in poor position to win good terms because of unfavorable
pretrial decisions, and refused to settle. Settlement talks resumed
however, when Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire joined
other state attorneys general in a renewed effort to get an
agreement. &QL;

 &HT;    Water managers vote to buy out Everglades community
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For the sake of the Everglades, a rural,
flood-prone community of farms, orchards, horses and up to 2,000
residents in western Miami-Dade County will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida water managers voted unanimously Thursday to begin
buying and flooding an enclave of more than 350 homes on Everglades
National Park's northeastern flank.
</P>
<P>
   They say the step is crucial to ending a drainage bottleneck
that often overwhelms Lake Okeechobee, the central Everglades, the
St. Lucie River and Everglades National Park. Water managers said
they'll offer a fair price for the land _ but if that doesn't work,
they're prepared to condemn it.
</P>
<P>
   The decision enraged more than 200 residents, who booed the
water managers, told them to resign and vowed to fight in court and
Congress to keep the homes where they have lived for decades. Some,
noting that the largely Hispanic community includes many Cuban
exiles, said the decision reeks of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we face the same struggle all over again,'' said Julia
Yapell, part of a caravan of two buses and at least one horse
trailer that trekked to water managers' meeting in suburban West
Palm Beach. ``Different tyranny, different false pretenses, same
desired outcome _ government amassment of private property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how much you offer for my land because my land is
not for sale,'' homeowner Maria Gonzalez vowed. ``And I will fight
with tooth and nail to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society, Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund and other
environmental groups endorsed the purchases, which could cost the
South Florida Water Management District, the U.S. Interior
Department and Miami-Dade County $55 million to $124 million.
</P>
<P>
   The groups praised the district's board for making a politically
unpopular decision. It's the first of many they'll face in the
multibillion-dollar Everglades restoration, Audubon lobbyist
Charles Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed decision,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 8-0, with Eugene Pettis of Fort Lauderdale
absent, after what officials called their first bilingual board
meeting ever. Spanish-speaking employees and board member Miriam
Singer of Miami filled in as translators after about 40 residents
complained they couldn't understand the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Everglades National Park Superintendent Richard Ring was
instrumental in pressing for buying the homes, but added, ``I
wouldn't call it a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard, hard decision that had to be made,'' said Ring,
who hoped the purchases will be finished within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists' unanimity was broken by Joette Lorion,
conservation chairwoman of Friends of the Everglades, who resigned
in tears Thursday and accused the district of treating the
residents unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect you environmentalists, the people I've worked with
for years, but I think you're off the track,'' said Lorion, drawing
a standing ovation from the crowd. ``I see Everglades restoration
and the park going down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also a consultant to the Miccosukee Indian tribe, which
opposes the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision ended a decade of indecision among the
district, National Park Service and Army Corps of Engineers on
whether to buy the community or wall it off from the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The community, known even to its residents by the awkward name
``8.5-Square-Mile Area,'' is west of the levee that separates the
Everglades from farms and suburbs. Many of the homes apparently
were built without permits but with the tacit consent of Miami-Dade
County.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, water managers say they can't restore natural
water flows into the park's northeast section without drastically
worsening the community's flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have channeled water to the west, regularly
drowning crucial habitat for the endangered Cape Sable seaside
sparrow. And when the water backs up, as it did in last winter's El
Nino-driven rainfall glut, it devastates the central Everglades,
Lake Okeechobee and waterways like the St. Lucie River.
</P>
<P>
   Congress authorized the corps a decade ago to solve the problem
by walling the homes off from the Everglades, a step that would
cost $31 million to $47 million. But environmentalists and park
officials said leaving the community intact would inevitably lead
to more dense development and flood control practices that would
drain the park dry.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Mitchell Berger of Broward County said it could
cost $4 billion to buy the community if water managers wait another
decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to avoid this decision any longer,'' he said.

$42 BILLION BRAZIL AID PACKAGE TO BE ANNOUNCED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Changes throughout.)   (htv) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of negotiations, the International
Monetary Fund and more than a dozen nations are expected to
announce loans to Brazil totaling at least $42 billion to help
stabilize the country's economy, according to officials familiar
with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. contribution to the package, said to be more than $5
billion, would be the biggest commitment of taxpayers' money to
alleviate a foreign economic crisis since the bailout of Mexico in
1995. The package for Brazil comes four months after a Russian
bailout that turned into a financial debacle, wasting $4.8 billion
in IMF funds and touching off a panic among investors who pulled
their money from other emerging markets, including Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Brazil bailout carries considerable risks for
both the IMF and the Clinton administration, which have increased
the size of the loan package by nearly 50 percent in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Final details of the deal, which the Brazilian government said
Thursday night would ``probably'' be announced Friday, were worked
out in the last few days during secret negotiations in Washington.
The loans are meant to see Brazil over the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, which has been pressing U.S. allies in
recent weeks to contribute more to the plan, refused to comment
Thursday on the details. But officials from several countries who
are familiar with the details say that the IMF will offer $18
billion in loans, much of which will be made available to Brazil
almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Another $4.5 billion will be made available by the World Bank
and a nearly equal amount from the Inter-American Development Bank.
It will be provided if Brazil needs the money and if it continues
to comply with lending conditions. Those conditions, from a letter
of intent that is about to be signed, will presumably entail
austerity steps like constraints on government spending and
privatization of industry.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is primarily responsible for anti-poverty and
economic development programs, but it has taken a larger and larger
role in containing the financial crisis that has spread around the
world; the Inter-American Development Bank plays a parallel role in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At least $15 billion more will come from the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan and several
other nations. It is unclear when that money would be delivered,
but it is expected to carry a relatively high interest rate _ as
did the $12 billion in U.S. loans to Mexico _ to encourage Brazil
to repay it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   American private banks and other major lenders to Brazil, who
will be among the biggest beneficiaries of any plan that stabilizes
the economy, will not contribute directly. Under pressure from the
United States, however, they are expected to maintain or expand
credit they had been extending to Brazil until Russia defaulted in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past bailouts of Thailand, Korea and Indonesia, this one
has taken months to arrange _ so long that the total amount has
been increased, in part so that markets are not disappointed by the
revelation of a package no larger than the one they have expected
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that we are we are finally coming out of the
financial crisis, but that the package had to exceed market
expectations,'' said Nicolas Checa, the head of the emerging
markets division of Medley Global Investors, an advisory group to
large investors. ``Everyone wanted to exceed market expectations so
they are not back in the October nightmare,'' he said, referring to
the huge selloff that occurred after it became clear that the
Russian parliament was not about to impose any of the fiscal
discipline required to get the IMF to begin delivering aid to the
country again.
</P>
<P>
   All official loans to Russia have been suspended since August,
and private lending there has dried up, forcing Russia to speed up
the printing of money to pay pensioners and even the military.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is viewed by most experts as being in fundamentally good
shape. It had relatively low interest rates and healthy economic
growth, and a good import-export balance until the Russian crisis,
when investors took flight.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the U.S. Treasury, there is concern that President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso may not have the clout necessary to push
through some of the politically painful spending cuts that the loan
package requires. Like most IMF aid, the Brazil package will be
turned over to the country in stages, as the Congress enacts the
conditions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. money will probably not be disbursed until Brazil has
met many of those conditions, according to officials familiar with
the plans. Administration officials say that while the world
economic turmoil has abated somewhat in the past three weeks,
members of Congress are sufficiently scared of the potential
effects here of an economic collapse in Brazil that they will offer
few objections. The loans are not dependent on congressional
approval. The chief critic in the Senate of the Mexican bailout,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, was defeated in last week's
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of this have changed,'' one administration
official said this week. The distraction of the showdown with Iraq,
other officials say, may also lessen the attention on the U.S.
contribution. It is still unclear what Brazil will offer for
collateral in return for the American loans.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, nervousness about the delay in settling the final
details of the agreement has been growing daily. In Sao Paulo, the
country's industrial and financial engine, the Bovespa stock market
index dropped 3.76 percent Thursday in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign reserves, which have fallen by more than $30 billion
since the crisis began in August, also continued their decline,
with another $280 million leaving the country Thursday. And though
the government announced a reduction in interest rates Wednesday,
the Central Bank's main rate remains a hefty 42.25 percent, to the
disappointment of business leaders, who are clamoring for any
relaxation of recessionary pressures. Recent economic indicators
have shown that Brazil's industrial production is falling sharply,
as companies feel the impact of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is selling the aid as a program
intended to help the country before it is forced to devalue its
currency or watch the remainder of its foreign currency reserves
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists believe that even such a large aid package
will not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger Dornbush, an MIT professor with close ties to top
officials of the IMF, warned at a conference here last week that
the country's huge debt burden and the unwillingness of its
Congress to impose fiscal discipline over the past year, leave ``no
reasons to be confident in Brazil.'' He predicted that aid for the
country may not ``last long'' and would only delay an inevitable
devaluation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's fear is that major banks might repeat what they did in
Russia and South Korea: Use the brief period of stability created
by the aid to get their investments out of the country. But Brazil
is a different case: It still has roughly $40 billion in foreign
currency reserves, and the loan program is designed to strengthen
the government's hand, so that investors have more confidence in
the country's ability to emerge from the current crisis.

DRUG DEALER DENIES ROLE IN JOURNALIST'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A 34-year-old Dublin drug dealer accused of
helping to murder a prominent Irish journalist said at his trial
Thursday that he had nothing to do with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Veronica Guerin, was shot five times in the
chest in June 1996 by two men on a motorcycle as she sat in her
car.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ward, accused by the police of being involved in planning
the killing and of getting rid of the .357 Magnum murder weapon and
the motorcycle after the crime, denied police statements that he
had confessed to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a small, tightly guarded courthouse, Ward often refused to
answer questions, citing his right not to incriminate himself.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, in its third week before a three-judge panel and no
jury, has refocused national attention on the case, giving a sharp
and unusual look into Dublin drug-dealing. It has also led to
examination of Ms. Guerin's aggressive crime reporting for The
Sunday Independent, Ireland's largest-circulation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A recent book about the crime suggests that her editors
encouraged Ms. Guerin to take risks and did not censure her for
tactics that included threatening criminals with defamatory
articles in order to persuade them to give her information on other
criminals. She had been shot in the leg by one criminal, she said,
but refused an offer of police protection.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ward is the first person to be tried for the crime. The police
have accused three other admitted drug dealers; two are in jail
here and the other is in a British prison, fighting an extradition
request. One of the men in jail here, Brian Meehan, has been
identified by the police as the one who did the actual shooting.
Meehan's sister, Vanessa, is Ward's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's chief witness, Charles Bowden, is also a
convicted drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The gang that included Bowden and Ward, the two men testified,
imported several tons of cannabis each year. Both men said they had
earned about $500,000 in one 18-month-period.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he had a $600-a-week cocaine habit and that he hid
$50,000 in his home because he had not learned how to launder it,
except for the purchase of a hairdresser's shop. He also took his
family on vacation to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, a former soldier and nightclub bouncer, spent four days
testifying that he and Ward were members of a gang that plotted the
killing. He said Ms. Guerin was killed because a gang member
thought she was about to give damaging information to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who was given immunity from prosecution to testify
against Ward, admitted loading the revolver and handing it to
another gang member.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I knew what was going to happen that morning. I knew
that Veronica Guerin was going to be shot or shot at, that
something was going to happen to her. It sounds very naive, but I
didn't know she was going to be killed. I didn't think they would
be stupid enough to kill a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had guts, I would have made a telephone call to somebody
and told them what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, he said, the police showed him photographs of
Ms. Guerin taken after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the photos of the girl lying in the car shot, I
went to pieces,'' Bowden said. ``I just couldn't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he said, he decided to become a prosecution
witness. Ward's lawyer says Bowden is lying to get favorable
treatment. Bowden is the first person to be placed in Ireland's new
witness-protection program.

$1.64 MAY BLOCK MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA IN CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga . , Alaska, Ariz., Nev., Ore., Wash.)   (jw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For want of an estimated $1.64 in this city's
perennial home-rule struggle with Congress, the Election Day result
of a ballot initiative proposing the medicinal use of marijuana is
being kept sealed as a secret from local voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, we sit and wait, wondering what Congress is going
to do to us this time,'' said Mary Jane DeFrank, executive director
of the American Civil Liberties Union of the National Capital Area.
``Now we know,'' she said, attacking Congress' 11th-hour move to
void the Nov. 3 marijuana initiative by passing an appropriations
amendment that bars the city from spending even the smallest amount
of money to tally and release the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we are not having these ballots counted, our rights
are violated,'' John Ferren, the District's corporation counsel,
told U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts at a hearing Tuesday.
Ferren made the remarks as the city joined a lawsuit by the civil
liberties group charging Congress with violating Washington voters'
First Amendment rights to vote and be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Ferren offered the court the $1.64 estimated cost of having a
clerk push a computer button to let the people know the result of
their choice. Roberts has scheduled a Dec. 18 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations amendment was sponsored by Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., who said Thursday that American taxpayers ``aren't
interested in paying for Washington, D.C.'s, folly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From a medicinal standpoint, there is no legitimate use for
marijuana,'' said Barr, who views the initiative as a ``thinly
veiled'' attempt by recreational marijuana proponents to circumvent
drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Similar initiatives were approved last week by voters in Alaska,
Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state, despite the Clinton
administration's opposition and warning that the medical
effectiveness of marijuana had not been scientifically established.
Proponents contend there is widespread evidence that marijuana
eases the pain of people with diseases like AIDS and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue's merits, city residents accuse Congress of
interfering with the most precious process of citizenship.
``Democracy Held Hostage, Day 9,'' Steve Twomey, a Washington Post
columnist, wrote Thursday in summoning images of Third World
political abuse here at the heart of the republic. Initially, the
city indicated it would unofficially inform the voters of the
tally, but election officials decided against it, citing ``pressure
and mandate'' from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about a secret ballot,'' said Wayne Turner, who organized
Initiative 59, the marijuana question in conjunction with ACT-UP,
the militant anti-AIDS group. ``Congress is prohibiting a local
government from using local tax dollars in conducting an
election,'' said Turner, who gathered 20,000 signatures over two
years to secure the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The budget route for trying to foil the initiative was doubly
galling to city officials because Congress, as overseer of the
capital, can veto most new District laws after they are approved.
Opponents in the Republican-controlled Congress inserted the
amendment, which Ferren called a ``silly'' gambit, during this
year's frenzied appropriations negotiations in the pre-election
rush to recess.
</P>
<P>
   The budget action came after the initiative was already set. A
total of 137,523 people voted, electing a mayor and council members
and finding the marijuana question on their ballots. Turner said
that professionally conducted surveys of voters leaving the polls
indicated that the initiative was approved by almost 7 in 10
voters. It would let residents use, cultivate and and distribute
marijuana as a painkiller with a doctor's written approval.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have long complained that Congress forces
unpopular choices and programs on the city. ``We're their political
plaything,'' Ms. DeFrank said. She complained that Congress had
widely prescribed details of city life best left to home rule, from
barring meters in taxicabs to voting annually to bar all money for
the city's clean needle program to protect drug addicts from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier encounter, the City Council adopted a domestic
partnership law to let gay couples register their relationships, a
law that the Congress did not veto during its review period. After
opponents realized this, they have acted annually to bar any
spending by the District to enforce the law, Ms. DeFrank noted.
``So now people send in notifications of same-sex marriages by
registered mail,'' she said. ``And they just pile up in some
forgotten office where nobody dare touch them.''

CHEMICAL ELEMENT OF VINYL TOYS CAUSES LIVER DAMAGE IN LAB RATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A chemical ingredient of vinyl, used by the toy
industry since the early 1980s because an earlier compound caused
liver damage in laboratory rats, caused essentially the same
problems in rats in tests done in the mid-'90s, a manufacturer of
the chemicals acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   With the environmental organization Greenpeace planning to
release a report Friday calling for banning the chemicals in toys,
the manufacturer, Aristech Chemical Corp. of Pittsburgh, said the
problem was not relevant to humans. Aristech said the new material,
a ``plasticizer'' used to make vinyl soft, causes the same liver
damage, but said that in the 15 years since the first substance was
eliminated, scientists have learned that the process that causes
the liver damage occurs in mice and rats, but not humans.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace, in its report, plans to say Aristech, a subsidiary
of Mitsubishi Corp., knew that the new material was as bad as the
old but kept using it. Greenpeace has been on an international
campaign against the use of vinyl in toys for more than a year, and
has been instrumental in persuading several European countries to
consider banning it.
</P>
<P>
   Both substances in question are forms of a class of chemicals
called phthalates, (pronounced THAY-lates), which bond with vinyl
molecules and make the product flexible. In 1985 a scientific panel
reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission that a type of
phthalates called di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, or DEHP, caused
cancer in animals and might do so in humans. The commission did not
ban DEHP but made an agreement with the toy companies that they
would switch to diisononyl phthalate, known as DINP, for products
like pacifiers and rattles that children might chew on.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace tested a variety of toys, including First Years
teethers and Hasbro Teletubbies, and found DINP.
</P>
<P>
   But Aristech, which conducted some studies of the new material
that showed problems in rats, said these were not relevant. It said
it had informed the government of the studies' results over the
years and had made no secret of the findings in the scientific
community.
</P>
<P>
   James Santory, a division manager with the company, said that
DEHP was replaced in the early 1980s as a precaution, ``not because
we thought it was a hazard, but because we didn't know the
science.'' And, he said, the company expected that the replacement
substance, DINP, would cause tumors in rats, and it did.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the mechanism that causes cancer is not relevant to
humans,'' Santory said. He added that DINP and DEHP are peroxisome
proliferators, meaning that they stimulate production of an enzyme
that damages the liver, but that this does not happen in higher
animals, including guinea pigs, monkeys and humans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if DINP should be replaced, he said, ``unless the science
was advanced, the decision would seem to be the same, but we
believe the science has advanced. We're talking about a 15-year
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is still considering the
issue, but a preliminary report on the subject said ``it is not
clear whether peroxisome proliferation is required'' to cause
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of vinyl in toys is complicated for several reasons,
among them that there is no standard way to determine how much
material in the vinyl a child can realistically be expected to
absorb. The standard technique is to give increasing doses to
different groups of rats, identify the largest dosage level that
does not appear to cause problems, divide that by 100 and set it as
the maximum allowable level.
</P>
<P>
   But at Greenpeace, Joe Di Gangi, a biochemist, said, ``This
one-hundredth is a made-up number, it's a standard they've
invented.''
</P>
<P>
   Di Gangi said substances that caused cancer in laboratory
animals should not be allowed in items that children could chew. He
also said DINP had been shown to cause a variety of health problems
in rats beyond liver damage that could also be relevant to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers have recently decided to stop using vinyl.
Santory said this was not because of safety, but for companies
making toys, ``you don't want to be on the front page of this
particular issue.''

DELL REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS AND REVENUES IN 3RD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. reported record third-quarter revenue and
earnings Thursday as it continued to grow at several times the rate
of the personal computer industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Dell officials credited the strength of their direct
sales model, in which the company bypasses distributors and dealers
and builds each computer to order. Because the company holds very
little inventory, it takes advantage of lower component costs, and
is always selling a fresher product, which can command a higher
profit margin. Dell said sales from its World Wide Web site
exceeded $10 million a day for the first time during the quarter,
three times the level in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors have attempted to emulate the Dell model but with
modest success so far. Nevertheless, Dell shares fell after the
announcement earlier this week from Compaq Computer Corp. that it
would sell personal computers directly to small and midsized
companies over the phone and the Internet. Dell fell $2.75, to
$69.1875, in Nasdaq trading. The company released its earnings
after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell, the company's chairman and chief executive, said
in a telephone interview that while he was paying attention to
Compaq's moves, he was not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to this movie before,'' Dell said, referring to
past attempts to copy Dell's business model. ``Their prices are
higher than ours; they don't have our cost structure; they have the
dealers in tow,'' he said. ``Dell is successful because it brought
something new and interesting to the PC business. Can you succeed
by out-Delling Dell?''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Nov. 1, Dell reported earnings of $384
million, or 28 cents a diluted share, up 55 percent from $248
million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales
rose 51 percent, to $4.82 billion from $3.19 billion. Per-share
figures reflect a reduction in the number of shares outstanding
because of stock repurchases.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Dell to earn 27 cents a share, according to
the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. Dell
said the company's average selling price had remained flat despite
falling prices across the industry and the growing popularity of
competitors' computers that cost less than $1,000. Dell has avoided
this segment of the market, starting its product line at ``$1,199
to $1,299 for what we call `real' computers, with warranties,
monitors and modems, computers you can actually use,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Dell's strength in the market is that sales grew by
49 percent in Asia and Japan despite the economic turmoil in those
regions. Sales in Europe grew by 68 percent, while sales in North
and South America grew by 46 percent. Estimates of PC industry
growth over all range from 15 percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has been gaining market share both internationally and in
high-growth sectors like servers and laptop computers. ``At some
point, probably starting with the desktop, rather than taking share
from the AST's and Packard Bells of the world, they have to turn
their sights on the other major players, who will be more intent on
fighting back,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.
``That's what you're seeing with Compaq.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard have all announced
plans to emulate portions of Dell's business model, with various
build-to-order plans, all have had difficulty in making the
transition. Most are moving to a target inventory level of four
weeks, while Dell maintains just eight days of inventory, allowing
it to turn over inventory 46 times a year.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration welcomed a statement
Thursday from a group of eight Arab nations saying that Iraq bore
responsibility for the consequences of its policies opposing arms
inspections, and said it was a sign of the growing isolation of
Saddam Hussein's government.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis remained defiant Thursday in the face of the
administration's intensifying threats and the dispatch of dozens
more fighter jets and heavy bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the additional aircraft that President Clinton
ordered to the region on Wednesday _ six B-52 bombers from Minot
Air Force Base in North Dakota _ left there Thursday and should
arrive by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other squadrons of fighters and support planes _ including F-117
``stealth'' fighters and a wing composed of fighters and B-1
bombers _ are expected to leave for the region in the next few
days, significantly increasing the power of the U.S. force in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials began to rally support in Congress,
privately briefing senators and representatives about the strategy.
A Democratic supporter said the president's national-security aides
had outlined a military campaign that could last from several days
to two weeks, long enough to exact a punishing toll on Iraqi
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, visiting a Navy base in
Norfolk, Va., said that any strikes would be significant.

`FAMILY-FRIENDLY' SCHEDULE BECOMES ISSUE IN MAJORITY LEADER RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Texas, Wash., Va., La.)   (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House work schedule _ and the effect it has on
members' lives _ has emerged as an issue in the down-to-the-wire
race for majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma said that Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the current majority leader struggling to keep his job, had
set such a hectic pace during the last four years that at least 12
members divorced their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Largent made the remarks in an interview on Wednesday with The
Washington Times. An aide said Thursday that while Largent knew
that many factors contributed to divorce, he stood by the sentiment
that Armey had not set a ``family-friendly'' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling may seem a tangential issue when Republicans are
sorting out big-picture ideas like what to stand for and how to
keep control in a House with only a six-vote majority. And it may
seem a peculiar concern to members who this year spent less time at
work than in any other Congress in modern history. But the schedule
of voting and meetings is crucial to members' lives and their
well-being, and, as Largent suggested, it can ruin relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Ornstein, an expert on Congress, said that while he was
unaware of any statistics on divorce in Congress, he ``absolutely''
believed that more had occurred in the last four years than in
previous four-year segments.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein said members of the 1994 class, to which Largent
belongs, found the House schedule particularly disruptive because
so many had vowed not to become corrupted by Washington and kept
their families back in their districts. This set off a cycle of
destructive frustration that tended to shut spouses out of members'
lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an unwise thing for Largent to say,'' Ornstein
said. ``It resonates with people. Most of those who got divorced
didn't come here to jettison their families and lead the high life.
It's a very human story of what happens when you have way too many
demands and live life in two cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent's public blame of Armey for a higher-than-normal divorce
rate raised eyebrows among Armey's supporters, but no one disagreed
that scheduling was central to members' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Armey had no comment. But Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, who
declared his support Thursday for Armey, sent a letter to other
Republicans saying Armey had run the House in a family-friendly
fashion by setting a predictable schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Armey understands the importance to members and staff of
being able to watch a child's soccer game or school play,'' Wolf
wrote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, the third
candidate in the race, who was divorced before she came to Congress
six years ago, passed up a chance to criticize Largent for blaming
Armey for the divorces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to split up because you're not home
for dinner,'' Ms. Dunn said. ``But the scheduling could be handled
more effectively. I have strengths in scheduling.''
</P>
<P>
   She likes the idea of having Congress meet for three consecutive
weeks then take off for one week. ``If we had a regular schedule
that was predictable,'' she said, ``people could plan ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what sort of schedule Largent would construct,
but any efforts at a shorter work-week could conflict with plans by
Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, the likely speaker in the next
Congress. Livingston had indicated that the House did not work hard
enough this year and that he would set a more rigorous pace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one suggests that the matter of scheduling will make
the outcome of the majority leader race itself any more
predictable. Republicans of every stripe said Thursday that no one
had a clear majority and that they expected the election, set for
Wednesday, would not be settled on the first round of voting.

<P>
   Q: I am sure I am not the only one with this question, now that
hard disks have become so inexpensive and a lot of us are replacing
the smaller drives in our computers. I have C: and D: drives on my
PC, and I want to replace one of these with a two-gigabyte disk.
Why can't I ``daisy-chain'' the two existing ones to the new drive
so I can use everything I have instead of throwing away one when I
upgrade? Also, what do I have to do if I want to replace the C:
drive with a large drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless you are using a SCSI-type drive _ which is not found
in most consumer computers _ you can't literally daisy-chain your
hard drives. However, you can put up to four hard drives in one
computer that uses Enhanced IDE drives, and more if you are willing
to add some extra cards.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other issues to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The EIDE controller found in most modern computers can support
four devices. There are two EIDE plugs on your motherboard, and
each will have a cable capable of connecting two devices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drives on each cable will be a master drive, while
the other is a slave. You may need to fiddle with the hard jumpers
or switches on each drive to set up the proper slave/master
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a traditional multimedia PC with a CD-ROM and a hard
drive, chances are both of those are EIDE devices. You said you
have a second drive, and it's likely to be EIDE, too. That means
you have room for one more EIDE device. Of course, you'll need a
free drive bay to house the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to read the directions for installation carefully to see
if there are problems installing that drive on the same controller
with other drives, or with a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the hard drive that you put on the same cable as the
CD-ROM drive will run slower than it otherwise would if it stood
alone.
</P>
<P>
   You always can buy another EIDE controller card, but even that's
not foolproof. You'll need a free slot and an available system
interrupt for the controller card. (An interrupt is how a device in
a computer talks to the main chip.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want to replace the C: drive with the new, big drive,
you'll need to back up C: to some kind of removable media _ such as
tape or disk _ then restore it onto the new disk once it's in
place. Or, you can temporarily install the new drive as a third
drive, copy the contents of C: onto the new drive, then remove the
old drive and replace it with the new one. Again, pay careful
attention to your master/slave settings when you do this.
</P>
<P>
   PowerQuest Corp. makes an excellent utility called DriveCopy
that simplifies this process. Find out more about it at
www.powerquest.com/product/dc/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been scanning family photos into my new scanner and
storing them on my hard drive. When I want to e-mail them to
friends, they take forever. Someone told me I have the resolution
on my scanner set too high, at 300 dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   A: Unless you are going to publish those on glossy paper, you
don't need to be scanning them at that resolution.
</P>
<P>
   For most e-mail situations, 75 to 100 dpi is just fine. If you
get beyond that, both the size of the image and the overall size of
the file increases. You can use a program, such as Paint, which
comes with Windows, or Paint Shop Pro from Jasc (www.jasc.com) to
shrink the image size further.
</P>
<P>
   Also, be sure to save your files as JPGs. Some Windows-based
scanners want to save by default in BMP format, which creates much
bigger files than JPG.

EDITORIAL: YARDSTICKS FOR ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 13:
</P>
<P>
   With an American strike against Iraq seemingly imminent, the
Clinton administration must clearly define its goals and the best
military tactics for achieving them. Although diplomacy now seems
exhausted, there is a faint hope that Saddam Hussein will blink at
the last minute and start honoring his international obligations.
But if Baghdad remains defiant, President Clinton would be fully
justified in ordering an attack. The world cannot leave Saddam free
to manufacture horrific germs and nerve gases and use them to
terrorize neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose of military action should be to compel the
return of U.N. weapons inspectors and assure their access to all
locations suspected of harboring evidence of biological, chemical
or nuclear weapons or missiles. Air strikes can also destroy at
least some of those weapons _ and might inflict enough damage to
jolt Saddam out of his fantasy that he can retain weapons of mass
destruction without paying a price or remaining much longer under
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve these ends, any new missile and bombing campaign must
be extensive, going far beyond the pinprick Tomahawk missile
attacks of the past. That approach failed to produce lasting
change. A new air campaign will need to be sustained, with a
regrettable risk of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign should be aimed at strictly military targets,
including weapons plants and storage facilities that can be hit
without dispersing dangerous germs and gases. Washington should
also attack bases of the Republican Guard and other forces that
Saddam relies on to maintain his grip on power. The idea is to make
the cost to Saddam so high that he would prefer letting the
inspectors back to seeing the attacks continue.
</P>
<P>
   There is an understandable temptation to take on the added goal
of politically crippling Saddam or even driving him from power.
Desirable as those results would be, the air and ground campaign
required to achieve them would inflict unacceptably high costs on
the Iraqi people, Mideast regional stability and American troops.
</P>
<P>
   Even the air campaign carries a risk that Iraq could launch Scud
missiles against Israel as it did during the Persian Gulf War,
although U.N. inspectors believe that almost all Iraqi Scuds have
now been destroyed. Should Israel come under attack, its leaders
would be wise to let Washington take responsibility for Israel's
defense. An Israeli military response would probably rupture the
emerging Arab consensus against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council, including France, Russia and China,
is now unanimous in condemning Baghdad. Thursday eight Arab
countries, including Egypt and Syria, demanded that Iraq cooperate
fully with the inspectors and warned Saddam that any military
action would be his fault. Thanks to the Clinton administration's
diplomacy and Saddam's reckless folly, most of the world is now
more willing to accept American military action than at any time in
the recent past. Saddam ignores this new reality at his own peril.

NORTHRIDGE DEEP IN TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ He is 6-foot-9 and 250 pounds of bulk who
can clear the middle with a swing of the hips, score with a soft
touch near the basket or drain 3-pointers like a tiny guard.
</P>
<P>
   By now, everyone at Cal State Northridge and throughout the Big
Sky Conference knows about Rico Harris. The junior transfer is
perhaps the best player in the Big Sky, and, without question, the
highest-profile player to choose to play at CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is his supporting cast that has made expectations so
strong this season. For the first time in coach Bobby Braswell's
three seasons, the Matadors are deep. Four integral members of last
year's team return and five players who redshirted last year are
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community knows, the school knows and the people know we
have the most talented team we've had here since coach Braswell has
been here,'' said CSUN point guard Jason Crowe, a transfer from
American University. ``We're expected to win. We believe we're
going to win, but we have to prove ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That begins Saturday afternoon at Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN hasn't had a winning season since joining Division I. But
the Matadors, picked to finish fifth by a skeptical and somewhat
uninformed group of coaches and media in the Big Sky, expect to
contend for the conference crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times it kind of scares me because I know we can fall into
these lulls and really think we don't have to play hard to be
successful,'' Braswell said. ``We're going to surprise very few
people. I think everybody we're going to play knows about Rico
Harris, they know the players we have. This is not going to be easy
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not your typical Big Sky team, which makes CSUN so
intriguing. In a league of zone defenses and shot-clock masseurs,
the Matadors want to press their opponents into the hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   And CSUN has the bodies to do it, going 10-deep if need be.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Braswell overturned the program, injecting the
Matadors with quality players. He's also preached defense as the
staple of a championship, which everyone understands.
</P>
<P>
   Practices are so competitive Braswell waited until Thursday to
give a tentative starting lineup for Long Beach State. What's more
is it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have big men, everybody can dribble the ball and everyone
can play different positions, so it's going to be hard to stop
us,'' said CSUN sixth-year guard Derrick Higgins. ``I've seen the
Big Sky.... I don't think they can stop us. It's scary all the
talent we have. Everybody's running, and in the Big Sky, they can't
run that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The players even factored in the intangible stuff to make sure
this team doesn't fail. Sophomore guard Carl Holmes has taken it
upon himself to ensure petty jealousies don't destroy an already
tight-knit team.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership was Holmes' dedication the moment the Matadors lost
to Northern Arizona in the league tournament in March. It's also
why Holmes is playing with calcium deposits and tendinitis in his
knees, making for painful practices and sleepless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cockiness or arrogance by me, but when I'm on the
court we have a lot more leadership,'' said Holmes, the nephew of
Braswell. ``I've been here, I know the system. I think that down
deep we're a good team, but there's a difference between good and
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good is going out there and winning off of talent. Great is
going out there and executing our offense, playing solid defense,
doing the little things _ diving and taking charges. We're good....
But we need to be great.''

EDITORIAL: SPEEDING AND CIVIL LIBERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will review an Iowa law this term that gives
the police what amounts to blanket authority to search an
automobile after issuing the driver a citation for speeding or any
other routine traffic violation. The case is important to anyone
who cares about civil liberties, and for that matter to anyone who
drives a car.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the court has significantly expanded
the authority of police in ``traffic stop'' situations. In doing so
it has watered down the Constitution's prohibition of unreasonable
searches and seizures and granted the police uncomfortably broad
discretion to make traffic stops as a pretext to search. The moment
has arrived for the justices to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa law authorizes police officers to issue a citation ``in
lieu of arrest or in lieu of continued custody'' for a variety of
offenses. But it also gives officers who issue such citations the
same authority to search that they would have if they had made a
formal arrest. The idea that police may conduct otherwise
unjustified searches incident to issuing a traffic ticket offends
the Fourth Amendment's basic requirement of reasonableness.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago the court validated a practice known as
``search incident to arrest'' as an exception to the ordinary rule
that a search must be supported by probable cause, or at least some
level of particularized suspicion. But the court's rationale for
carving out the exception _ to preserve evidence and to protect the
arresting officer's safety _ is inapplicable to a simple speeding
violation, for which no one has been taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   At the court's recent hearing in the Iowa case, Justice Anthony
Kennedy made an apt observation. Rather than a search incident to
arrest, he said, the state was seeking authority for ``arrest
incident to search.'' For the sake of civil liberties and
constitutional clarity, the justices should reject that backward
logic.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 13:
</P>
<P>
   A presidential task force of apparel makers, human rights groups
and consumer advocates recently agreed on how to put in place a
voluntary code of conduct for domestic and overseas factories.
Although not perfect, the accord should improve sweatshop
conditions and give American consumers information so that they can
choose not to buy goods produced in inhumane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan creates a new nonprofit Fair Labor Association of
business, labor and human rights representatives. The association
would enforce the code and oversee independent monitors who would
inspect factories for compliance. Only companies that meet the
standards would be allowed to use the association's seal on their
goods. The point is to give companies a marketing advantage if they
comply with the code.
</P>
<P>
   Under the code, factories could not use forced labor nor require
employees to work more than 60 hours a week. Apparel makers could
not employ children under the age of 15, unless the country's laws
allow 14-year-olds to work, and they would have to pay the minimum
wage or prevailing industry wage where the factories are located.
Companies would have to consult with local labor and human rights
groups about workplace standards.
</P>
<P>
   American labor unions initially agreed to the principles but
have rejected the implementation plan because it does not require
that businesses pay a ``living wage.'' They also want more frequent
monitoring of factories, and object to allowing companies to
operate in countries such as China that restrict unions. Their
concerns are legitimate, but the current agreement is a good first
step.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance with the code of conduct does not mean that the shoes
or shirts consumers buy are the product of ideal or even fair labor
conditions. But compliance would indicate that the manufacturer
abides by rules that give workers some protection from the most
exploitative practices.

A BRUINS WIN CLINCHES PAC-10 TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beyond the Bowl Championship Series confusion and
UCLA's defensive chaos is the small matter of the Pacific-10
Conference title. The Bruins clinch it with a victory Saturday at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a championship game, it's a ring game, and that's what
I told them,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``Our first goal is to
win the championship and represent UCLA in the Rose Bowl. If we do
that, we have a pretty good chance of achieving other goals.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance: the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Husky Stadium is the most feared venue in the conference, a
demolition site for visitors unprepared for the wind, rain, cold
and noise. Aside from Arizona Stadium _ where they won last month
for the first time in 10 years _ the Bruins have had more trouble
in Seattle than anywhere in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great deal more respect playing in Husky Stadium,''
tight end Ryan Neufeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins haven't won there since 1990, when Brad Daluiso's
last-minute field goal shocked second-ranked Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Their last visit ended in a 41-21 loss, as mistakes and Huskies
tailback Corey Dillon conspired to slap UCLA with the second-worst
loss of the Toledo era. (The worst, a 38-9 defeat at Michigan, had
come three weeks earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a game where we have to convince ourselves it's
important _ we feel it,'' quarterback Cade McNown said. ``It's one
of those games that keeps you up at night.''
</P>
<P>
   No umbrellas needed: Two words best describe the preliminary
weather forecast: horizontal rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins practiced passing and kicking with wet balls, and
they'll rotate dry ones each play Saturday. Unless it's a downpour,
Toledo said, ballhandling won't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo is concerned about crowd noise: 72,000 people barking
can create a frightful din. It reverberates off the roof and
settles over the field. To compensate, UCLA will whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: McNown calls the snap count in the huddle;
to audible at the line, he whispers to center Shawn Stuart, who
tells the guards, who tell the tackles. McNown communicates with
the running backs and receivers with hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't coach over the noise,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned: As usual, practice will be closed to the public
during USC week.
</P>
<P>
   Review of the Week: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris is
a film buff who wants to make movies when his career ends. He has
agreed to review a movie each week for the Daily News. This week:
``The Waterboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam Sandler's newest film is surprisingly funny. After
reading a slew of terrible reviews about this college-football
comedy, I was expecting a boring and lewd trip to the theater. I
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Waterboy' is the perfect example of how all the Siskels
and Eberts out there are not always a film's target audience.
Surely, most of the punch lines went over their heads, but the
jokes weren't written for their generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film does not have great cinematography, powerful acting
or perfect editing, but Sandler is not trying to win an Academy
Award. He's simply trying to entertain, and that makes `The
Waterboy' a definite success.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 pancakes (out of four)
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Center Stuart (ankle), linebacker Tony White
(shoulder) and linebacker Michael Wiley (ankle) are expected to
play, meaning every member of the two-deep is healthy and ready.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THEY BOUGHT SALOMON, THEN THEY KILLED IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Wall Street, the Salomon Brothers culture long
provoked admiration and dread. It was a gambling firm, quite
willing to commit large amounts of capital on risky trades.
</P>
<P>
   That culture spawned John Meriwether, whose strategies made huge
profits for Salomon while he worked there _ and then failed
spectacularly when his independent hedge fund collapsed this year
and was bailed out. It was the culture that allowed bond traders to
hatch what looked like a conspiracy to corner the market in
Treasury bonds _ a scandal that almost killed the firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Salomon also played a vital role that led many institutional
investors to cherish its presence. If you wanted to unload a lot of
securities, Salomon would buy them. Not, perhaps, at the price you
would like, but at a price you could live with.
</P>
<P>
   That willingness to take risks _ and to do it with enough
discipline that most of the time it made very good money _ made
some bosses nervous. When Warren Buffett took control of Salomon
after the 1991 Treasury bond scandal, he vowed to change things.
Salomon did pull back in stock trading, but in the end the Salomon
culture survived, particularly in bond trading. Buffett discovered
that it was in trading that Salomon made real money, while it was
at best a respectable competitor in underwriting securities.
</P>
<P>
   But now Salomon is dead. The name lives on, as part of Salomon
Smith Barney, itself a part of the giant Citigroup. But virtually
all the people who ran the risk-management operation at Salomon
Brothers have quit or been shown the door as the new management
closes or unloads the operations, such as bond arbitrage, that once
made Salomon rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's strategy appears to be to use the combination with
Citibank to make Salomon Smith Barney a power in underwriting that
it never used to be, while continuing the successful retail
brokerage operation but avoiding risky trading.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will work. But you have to wonder if the $9 billion
in stock that was paid for Salomon was worth it, given how little
of the firm's profitable operations has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup may now itself face further dismemberment. It is a
firm that was spawned by merger upon merger. Travelers, which owned
Smith Barney, took over Salomon, then merged with Citicorp last
month. Since then, there have been culture clashes and even a
physical confrontation between two senior executives. The president
was fired. Many investment bankers may jump ship early next year,
after annual bonuses are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Even if everyone can learn to get along, Citigroup may not
endure in its present structure. Unless the law is changed,
Citigroup will have to get out of either banking or insurance
underwriting within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   For a time this year it looked as if Congress would change the
law. But that move was blocked by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the new
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In an interview, Gramm
said he wanted to pass a bill, but it looked as if a bill he would
accept would be opposed by many others. Would it bother him if no
bill was passed? ``It is not the be-all and end-all of my tenure as
chairman,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be the be-all and end-all of Citigroup as it now
exists. If so, the company that killed Salomon could itself become
a victim.

 &HT;    Bob Bullock to work for public affairs firm
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock will be the last Democrat
to leave statewide office next year, but don't look for him to fade
away.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican succeeding Bullock says the Democratic Party
isn't fading away, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, the 69-year-old legend of Texas politics, on Thursday
told the Austin American-Statesman that he's going to work for
Public Strategies Inc., an Austin-based public affairs firm.
Bullock has had an office at PSI for several months, but had not
made clear he would work for the firm, which is headed by his
longtime friend Jack Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to have him,'' said PSI Managing Director Elyse
Yates. ``Bullock is an amazing, amazing man and talent. He can be
nothing but help to PSI.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates said Bullock's exact role will be defined in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who did not seek a third term as lieutenant governor,
has been in and around elected state office longer than anyone else
in Texas. He first was elected to the state House in 1957. Bullock
then worked on the Texas Historical Commission, practiced private
law, worked for the attorney general and governor and was appointed
secretary of state in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Bullock was elected comptroller. He served until 1990,
when he was elected lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to miss it,'' Bullock said. ``I'll always track
it. And there's a few things I'm still interested in that I might
come up here on _ on a free basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real enthusiastic about what I'm going to be doing,'' he
said, adding that he will help ``plan long-range strategies for the
companies that do business in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry said the sad thing about Bullock's
departure is that Texas is losing an officeholder who cares about
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Perry was among seven Republicans to win statewide offices
earlier this month, giving the GOP control of all 27 offices for
which every registered Texas voter can cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you agree with his politics or whether you think he is
good, bad or indifferent for Texas, you must agree that this man
really cares about this state. He really loves this state,'' Perry
said. ``In a sense, that is a sad day in Texas when a person who
has given 45 years of his life to the state (leaves).''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said that along with Bullock, the Texas Democratic Party
isn't fading away even though Republicans control all of the
statewide jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is still a Democrat,'' said Perry, a former Democrat
himself. ``The Democrat Party is still the majority in some places
in Texas.''

 &HT;    How many Hispanics voted for Bush? Depends whom you ask
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Election Day analyses show that Gov. George W.
Bush got 49 percent, 37 percent or 33 percent of the Hispanic vote
in coasting to a second term last week.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one knows for sure how individuals vote at the ballot
box, various groups and individuals have conducted polls or
analyzed the vote to answer the question of how Bush fared among
minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   The 49 percent figure that has been reported nationally as a
measure of Bush's surprising popularity among Hispanics came from
Election Day exit polling conducted by Voter News Service, a New
York-based consortium that includes ABC, NBC, CNN, CBS, Fox and The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The number is now under challenge from Southwest Voter
Registration and Education Project and a Dallas man who has been
analyzing minority voting patterns for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, working
with data compiled from exit interviews with 387 voters, came up
with the 37 percent figure. The poll has a margin of error of 6.8
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas statistician Dan Weiser used actual vote totals to
determine that Bush got 33 percent of the Hispanic vote. Weiser
reviewed returns from the 32 counties (out of 254) with populations
that are more than 50 percent Hispanic. That crunches to 343,000
votes, including non-Hispanics, in those counties. Statewide, 3.74
million votes were cast.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser insists his numbers are statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm challenging it,'' Weiser said of the 49 percent figure
offered by Voter News Service. ``I think it is too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Camarillo of San Antonio, executive director of Southwest
Voter Registration and Education Project, also said the 49 percent
figure is too high.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively low number of voters questioned in her
group's poll, she said she is confident in the result. Camarillo
also said the 37 percent support for Bush among Hispanics is
``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistical sniping at his numbers did not impress Murray
Edelman, editorial director at Voter News Service in New York. His
results are gleaned from interviews with 1,256 Texas voters and
have a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman said Weiser's numbers, based on vote totals in
predominantly Hispanic counties, are skewed because about half of
the state's Hispanics live outside the counties he examined.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter News Service results, according to Edelman, showed
that Bush got 37 percent of the Hispanic vote in counties where 40
percent of the vote was Hispanic. Bush got 57 percent of the
Hispanic vote in the rest of the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Houston political scientist Richard Murray, who
has conducted political polls for many years, said the truth about
Hispanic support for Bush probably lies somewhere in a combination
of polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``An educated guess would be 38 to 42 percent,'' he said, adding
that exit polling he did last week in Harris County showed that
middle-class Hispanics in urban areas backed Bush in higher
percentages than did other Hispanics.

CHILD PORNO INQUIRY PROMPTS YALE MASTER TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Calif.)  (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ The master at one of Yale University's
undergraduate residential colleges has resigned after federal
officials seized two of his office computers and told him he was
the subject of a child-pornography investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents raided the master's office last Friday after being
tipped to a possible crime by the campus police, according to Yale
and federal officials. A few hours later, Antonio Lasaga, a
professor of geochemistry, resigned the mastership of Saybrook
College and took an indefinite, paid leave of absence from his
duties as a professor, Yale officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the U.S. attorney's office in New Haven said a
child pornography investigation was continuing, but no charges had
been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Yale President Richard Levin said he knew of no previous
complaints about Lasaga. ``Tony Lasaga has been a very popular and
energetic presence on this campus,'' Levin said in an interview
Thursday. ``So naturally this news is distressing and of great
concern to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he became aware of the investigation on Nov. 4. On
Nov. 5, he arranged for a new master, citing an impending
``emergency situation,'' but did not tell the replacement which
college was involved. The next morning, agents bearing a search
warrant arrived at Lasaga's apartment, which is adjacent to his
office at Saybrook.
</P>
<P>
   Lasaga, 48, became a Yale professor in 1984 and was Saybrook's
master for the last three years. He and his wife lived in an
apartment at the college, which occupies the north end of the
university's Memorial Quadrangle. Lasaga, a well-known figure at
national conferences on geochemistry, received the Mineralogical
Society of America's award of the year in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The raid and resignation touched off a flurry of concern and
speculation among students, who talked about Lasaga in reverential
tones. And the episode has put a spotlight on Yale's system of 12
undergraduate residential colleges, which serve as dormitories,
dining halls and social centers for groups of about 425 students,
who are guided in their academic studies by a dean and in their
social lives by a master.
</P>
<P>
   Students recalled the master's teas, Friday happy hours (with
tea as the beverage) and Halloween parties thrown by Lasaga, whom
they still referred to as ``our master.'' They said they were as
concerned about him as about the possible breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to respect Master Lasaga just as I did before,''
said Daniel Fingerman, 20, an economics and political science major
from Oakland, Calif.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS TO REOPEN TOWER DECK, SITE OF 1966 SHOOTING
SPREE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Satisfied that safety can be ensured, the University of Texas
System regents voted Thursday to reopen the observation deck of the
flagship school's 28-story clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   The move caps months of debate and objections. Some students,
alumni and others have said that such a move could ignite horrors
similar to the deadly 1966 sniper attack by Charles Whitman, one of
the worst mass slayings in U.S. history, as well as more student
suicide jumps at the Austin campus.
</P>
<P>
   The open-air deck has been closed to the public since 1974, but
could reopen with a metal grillelike enclosure in time for next
spring's commencement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tower has enormous symbolic value to the students and to
the citizens of Texas,'' said UT President Larry Faulkner, a
graduate student during Whitman's melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe (the reopening) washes away the bad memories,
but the tower is the most important symbol of the university,''
Faulkner said. ``With the current situation of the tower being
closed, the main conversation point is remembrances of its negative
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Regents urged Faulkner and other UT officials to not charge
students admission to the deck, which is scheduled to reopen on
weekends at first.
</P>
<P>
   UT, the nation's largest school this year with 48,917 students,
often has been criticized for its size and not giving enough
personal attention to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't like this to be another opportunity where it looks
like we're just taking money from students,'' regent Tony Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 307-foot-tall landmark is UT's nerve center. It houses 25
floors of administration offices, a library, archives and a public
information center. Known as the Main Building, students typically
go there to pay tuition. The outside plaza is the site of rallies
as well as commencement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Built as part of the state's centennial festivities, the tower
opened in 1937. Just a few feet shorter than the nearby Texas
Capitol, it became a top tourist spot and offered a panoramic view
of Austin and the Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   The building gained notoriety across the country after Whitman
lugged a locker of ammunition to the top floor and fired rifles for
more than an hour. Whitman killed 16 people and injured 31 others
before police fatally shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, nine people also leaped to their deaths from the
top of the clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the deck's closing, students have pushed for it to be
reopened.
</P>
<P>
   William Cunningham, UT system chancellor who was UT president
from 1985-1992, said prior pleas to reopen the deck ``were not well
outlined.'' For instance, a suggestion for a plastic-glass
enclosure was rejected because of concerns about stability amid
high winds and harsh weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Annie Holand, UT student body president, called this
year's proposal more organized and detailed, with suggestions to
discourage suicides and schedule limited operating hours for small
groups. Student leaders approached Faulkner, who was hired from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, before he officially
started as UT president last April, Holand said.
</P>
<P>
   Regents approved the deck's reopening with little discussion,
but board chairman Donald Evans said he hopes the move sends a
message to current and prospective students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful statement to say we welcome you and we open
ourselves up to you by opening up the tower to you,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for a metal barrier to enclose the deck, wheelchair
access to be added, elevator modifications and renovating public
areas. Faulkner estimates that the project will cost as much as
$500,000, with annual operating costs of about $86,000.
</P>
<P>
   Admission of $5 or $6 is expected for nonstudents, to help
defray costs, with student admission about $2 or $3, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like for student admission to be as close to free as
possible, but the money has to come from somewhere, and the
original proposal to charge (admission) came from students,''
Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   No metal detectors are planned, and visitors will be allowed to
carry only small items, such as cameras and binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an important step to take in the life of the
university,'' Faulkner said.

THIS COMIC MAKES FUN OF THE PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With FLIGHT-ATTENDANT-RECRUIT) 
(bl)  
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Rene Foss' mother was a stewardess in the 1950s,
she wore white gloves and served lobster thermidor to passengers.
Today, Ms. Foss, a flight attendant herself, says, ``Some of us are
wearing rubber gloves, and we have to learn how to put handcuffs on
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foss, who describes herself as ``36 going on about 25,''
wanted to be a Broadway star; her family wanted her to have a
steady job. ``I can't say I always wanted to be a flight
attendant,'' she said. ``I just wanted to get my dad off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   And so she did, and pursued a career in entertainment at the
same time. With the free time her job offers, Ms. Foss was able to
study singing and acting, and to write a cabaret show about flight
attendants called ``Around the World in a Bad Mood.'' The show is
occasionally performed at Rose's Turn in Greenwich Village. (The
next performance is Dec. 9.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the job than just time off and good
material, she said, as she discovered during the year she managed a
theater producer's office. ``Six months into the job, I thought,
`My God, I can't stand this working every day, in the same place _
I've got to get back to flying,''' she recalled. ``I think it gets
in your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of it also sticks in your craw. As depicted in her show,
which she performs with another flight attendant and some
professional actors, being a flight attendant is rather like being
a waitress on a Greyhound bus _ with no tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to find a job where I can deal with emotionally and
physically abusive people who will blame me for everything that
goes wrong in their lives, whether it's my fault or not,'' Ms.
Foss' character says while applying for a job as a flight
attendant. ``I also like to hang around crowded airports for hours
and hours and hours with nothing to do. But most importantly, I
have a particular fondness for picking up garbage. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The skit's biggest laugh was a recitation of the questions
flight attendants are asked, all of which, Ms. Foss said, were
drawn from experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will our luggage make it? Where are the bathrooms? Will I make
my connection?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have raspberry-kiwi iced tea? Is that your natural
color hair? Has anyone ever told you that you resemble Monica
Lewinsky? What time is it? Is this your regular route? Can I borrow
your pen? Can you find out the score of the game? What river is
that? Where are we?
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I have another bag of peanuts? Doesn't the
air-conditioning work on this plane? Where do you live? Are you
married? Are you divorced? Have your ever been married? Do you have
a boyfriend? Have you ever had a boyfriend? How old are you? Can I
have another beer?'' And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The show provides passengers _ these days, almost everyone _
with some insight and inside information about flight attendants,
including what they really mean when they say, sweetly, ``I'll be
right back!''

N.Y. DAILY NEWS NAMES SUNDAY EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Kosner, a former editor of Newsweek, New York
magazine and Esquire, was named Sunday editor of The Daily News on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday edition will have a new title, The Sunday Daily News,
and in the spirit of The London Sunday Times, will have a senior
staff of editors and writers separate from the daily paper. Kosner
will report directly to The News' editorial director, Harold M.
Evans. Evans is familiar with the separate Sunday format; he was
editor of The London Sunday Times until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The move appears to represent a dilution of power for Debby
Krenek, The News' editor in chief, because the previous Sunday
editor had reported to her. Ms. Krenek, the first woman to hold the
title of editor in chief at the newspaper, has been in that job for
a little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Daily News reporters said that they were surprised by the
choice of Kosner, whom they consider an editor skilled in the ways
of the magazine world but unfamiliar with the vagaries of daily
tabloid journalism. ``I just don't know how he will fit in with the
green-visor culture around here,'' said one reporter, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, 61, joined Newsweek as a national affairs writer in
1963, and was editor from 1975 to 1979. He left to become editor of
New York magazine, and during his 13-year tenure there, the
magazine won four National Magazine Awards. He became editor of
Esquire magazine in 1993, and left the magazine in March of last
year after failing to bolster dwindling circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, an opera buff who also collects models of vintage sports
cars, said he would begin work next week. ``I'm going to work very
hard and put out a lively and useful Sunday paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday edition appears to be in need of some rejuvenation.
It is the sixth-largest Sunday newspaper in the country, but
circulation has dropped in recent years. For the six-month period
ending in September 1998, Sunday circulation had slipped to 810,295
from 979,030 for the same period in 1995, according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner and co-publisher of The Daily
News, said Thursday that the Sunday edition generated about 35
percent of the newspaper's advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the new hierarchy, the current Sunday editor, Bill Boyle,
will become managing editor for news; he will continue to report to
Ms. Krenek. Richard Rosen, who is now deputy managing editor, will
be a managing editor overseeing features, sports and business.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Browne, the current managing editor, will become senior
managing editor for investigative reporting, a move that some
reporters said they saw as a demotion. Browne is on vacation this
week.

UPSCALE OUTLET CENTER OPENING NEXT TO SUCCESSFUL COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. -- The world's largest operator of retail
outlet centers announced plans for a 220,000-square-foot upscale
project within sight of the already hugely successful Camarillo
Premium Outlets center.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore-based Prime Retail Inc., which first approached the
city this summer with plans for the village-themed center, said
Thursday that it finalized its purchase earlier this week of a
61-acre parcel at Ventura Boulevard and Las Posas Road, just east
of a 12-screen Edwards Cinemas complex.
</P>
<P>
   The center, to be called Prime Outlets at Camarillo, is expected
to have about 50 apparel, gift, accessory, housewares, electronics
and other outlets and will occupy about 31 acres, company spokesman
Brian Lewbart said. It is expected to open in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the land will be sold off in parcels, including a
sale to Newport Beach-based Edwards, which has committed to buying
about 9 acres to expand its Camarillo theater complex to 22
screens, Lewbart said.
</P>
<P>
   Several restaurants and ``at least one major hotel operator''
have expressed interest in the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Retail deliberately chose to locate close to another
outlet center, Lewbart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That location is already proven successful as an outlet
destination, and bringing in even more stores will create an even
greater critical mass,'' he said. ``When combined with the expanded
theater and restaurants, it will make that intersection that much
stronger and make it that much more of a destination point.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Camarillo Premium Outlets did not return telephone
calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   City officials initially wondered why anyone would want to build
an outlet center almost next door to another one, said City Manager
Bill Little.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Retail produced market research showing the demand for
additional outlet retail in the area. Prime Retail co-owns the
Prime Outlets at Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to cement Camarillo as the destination
point for factory-outlet shopping for this part of the metro area,
and it should enhance all our shopping opportunities in town,''
Little said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the planned hotel could turn the area into more
than just a one-day destination point -- which means that visitors
will stick around longer to spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could not only give those outlets more shoppers, but give
our existing stores an opportunity to capture that market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Little said the approximately 100 stores in the
450,000-square-foot Camarillo Premium Outlets generate some
$800,000 in sales tax revenues for the city annually.
</P>
<P>
   Camarillo is about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles in
neighboring Ventura County.

BASKETBALL COLUMN: OFF COURT, AN EVEN BIGGER GAME LOOMS FOR EWING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time is running out. And Patrick Ewing is backing
into the paint with his hands stretched out like a man about to
throttle someone. There is no mistaking this familiar stance: Ewing
wants the ball, and he wants it now.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his 13 years as the center for the New York Knicks,
that pass has been delivered to Ewing. On cue, he has plodded
through this scene without coming up with a career-defining moment
under pressure. No championship, few last-minute heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the president of the National Basketball Players
Association, he finds himself striking a similar pose as the
league's lockout approaches a date sometime in the near future that
could mean the unprecedented cancellation of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The next two or three weeks will play out like the closing
minutes of a critical game for Ewing. Although he is neither a
lawyer like Commissioner David Stern nor a skilled negotiator like
the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, Ewing is the
recognized face of the union. Fair or not, he will be identified
with the outcome of the current negotiations for a collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ewing could distinguish himself as the leader who
kept his membership unified, sacrificed a chunk of his own $18.5
million salary and stood up to the owners in order to strike a
solid deal for players. Or he could find himself walking away from
a shattered season, denying the reality of it all by proclaiming
his usual mantra: ``We'll beat them next time.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ewing has worn the title of union president like his No.
33 jersey. Although he has a very public presence, he is still
viewed as the aloof superstar who may alienate fans but has an aura
that goes unchallenged by players around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the public goes, he is not the one you want carrying
the banner,'' said one league executive, speaking privately because
of league rules that prohibit team officials from discussing
players during the lockout. ``The public sees a superstar making
millions, and they can't identify with him on any level. Why is he
complaining? But you have to say this about Patrick, he has kept
the players together. Out of respect or fear, they have not raised
their voice publicly to speak out against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Curry of the Milwaukee Bucks said: ``I think Patrick's
done a great job. He has informed everyone and kept everyone up to
speed. He's led us through a difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   If the players have perceived any flawed moves or public
missteps by Ewing since he was elected president in September 1997,
they have nevertheless supported him. They have ignored lapses,
such as the one he made last season when an arbitrator reduced the
punishment for Golden State's Latrell Sprewell, who had choked his
coach. Two days after the ruling, Ewing admitted he had not read
the arbitrator's decision.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a stance against the league's collective bargaining
proposals this summer, Ewing appeared hypocritical to some by
accepting a spot as a commentator for a WNBA game, since the
women's league is run by the NBA. And as the lockout has worn on,
fans have bristled at some of his comments as well as at the image
of Ewing dashing from a meeting with a cell phone to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the backlash is not Ewing's fault. The task of being the
president of any union made up of millionaire athletes has
historically been thankless. Player representatives in baseball
such as Atlanta's Tom Glavine found that out several years ago when
fans booed them.
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing, always reluctant to grant interviews or provide more
than token comments publicly during his Knick tenure, has made no
attempt to endear himself to the public. During a college
basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden this week, Ewing was
booed by fans as he took a seat to watch Georgetown play Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were only a few critical voices,'' Ewing said. ``I don't
put much credibility in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ewing's ability to coat himself against fan criticism is
one reason he has been able to weather the pressures of playing in
New York. But some of his comments during the lockout _ such as
``We cannot survive if we sign this contract'' _ have served only
to put another prickly layer between himself and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be booed when he comes back to the
Garden,'' said Allen Lox, an insurance consultant, who has had
Knick season tickets since 1969. ``I know I can't support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe he just continues to hurt his image by saying
things like `We're fighting for our livelihood.' It shows how out
of touch he is. I get insulted when I hear the stuff that Patrick
Ewing has said. Players making less than he does are looking up to
him, and I really believe that he's getting his guidance from David
Falk.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, his longtime agent, speaks to Ewing daily. Although no one
knows how much Falk has influenced the superstar's thinking, Ewing
has shown little desire to stray from a script that appears written
for him. Generally, when he follows Hunter at player news
conferences, his comments have begun with ``I just want to
reiterate what Billy said,'' or ``I have nothing to add to what
Billy said.''
</P>
<P>
   But this lip-synching of the party line may belie the way Ewing
is handling the inside game. By all accounts, he has been a
cohesive force within the union and has not been threatened by
dissenting voices.
</P>
<P>
   How things change. Three years ago, Ewing was part of the cry
for union decertification as an alternative to the current
collective bargaining agreement. Now he is a union man, through and
through.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ewing can emerge as a leader who preserved some semblance
of the Larry Bird exception for free agents, if he can rise as the
player who held everyone together through the adversity of the
lockout, if he can be seen as the president who did not allow a
season to be canceled, and if he can pull all this off in the
closing moments of a collective bargaining confrontation, he will
have won a very big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a learning experience for Patrick,'' said Buck
Williams, a former union president and Ewing's Knick teammate in
the last two seasons. ``He has to answer 400 questions a day and
cut a deal that's going to make everyone happy. And that's a
challenge. I think he's beginning to understand some of the
difficulties I had three years ago. He's learning on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do respect the fact that now he has jumped in and taken a
leadership role. I think he and Michael Jordan have done a good
job. But it's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing wanted the ball. As always, the players around him
delivered it by electing him president. For a superstar still
searching for his defining moment under pressure, this may be his
chance to make the elusive big play.

MOVING WEST TO SURF FOR DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is WLIW-TV, the Long Island public television
station, treading on the turf of Manhattan-based WNET-TV?
</P>
<P>
   Last week WLIW held its first fund-raising event west of the
Nassau County line. The gala, at the Puck Building in SoHo,
featured MELBA MOORE as emcee and appearances by BOB McGRATH of
``Sesame Street'' and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was time,'' said SUSAN SOBERMAN, a spokeswoman for
the station. ``We've been increasing our New York presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, the fashion designer ARNOLD SCAASI joined
the board of WLIW, whose studios are in Plainview, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our address doesn't mean anything,'' Ms. Soberman said.
``We're serving Manhattan.'' Indeed, thanks to cable systems that
carry the station's programs, half of WLIW's audience is now in the
city, she said.
</P>
<P>
   How does WNET feel about WLIW looking for dollars in its front
yard? ``The official party line is, it's not an issue for us,''
said KELLIE SPECTER, a spokeswoman for the station. ``We do
fund-raising in Long Island. It's really not a big deal.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fashion photographer and designer FABRIZIO FERRI calls it a
calendar. It has the numerals ``1999'' on the cover. Inside, it has
photographs of models body-painted in the patterns and colors of
Bulgari scarves.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes are not all that this calendar lacks. Nowhere on its 12
glossy pages, one for each month, are dates or days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tribale calendar is conceived as an artistic object with
symbolic flair, not as an item meant to show the date,'' said
FRANCESCO TRAPANI, the chief executive of Bulgari and the
great-grandson of the company's founder. ``Indeed, an interior,
private recording of time is the best way to mark days and
months.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a technicality, MARIAH CAREY has won a lawsuit filed by her
former limousine service, which maintained that she owed $1.5
million when she stopped using the company last year.
</P>
<P>
   JUSTICE CHARLES E. RAMOS of State Supreme Court in Manhattan
dismissed the suit because the car service, Showcase Limousine of
Elmwood Park, N.J., was not licensed in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said TERENCE SCHEURER, a lawyer for
the limousine company, who said that Ms. Carey had insisted that
the company buy limousines only she would use. ``She said,
`Whenever you pick me up, I want it to be my own personal limo. I
don't want the rest of your clientele to use my limousine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with Ms. Carey's peregrinations said she often
had the limousine pick up DEREK JETER, the Yankees shortstop, and
take them to Manhattan nightclubs. At the time Ms. Carey was
married to Tommy Mottola, the head of Sony Music; they have since
divorced. A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey did not return calls for
comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rock band the B-52's made its name with a campy, retro take
on such icons of the 1950s and 60s as science-fiction comic books
and twangy guitars strummed by beach-boy types.
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, the founder of the group, FRED SCHNEIDER, has emerged
as an opera lover. PAUL KELLOGG, the general and artistic director
of the New York City Opera, told the crowd at an auction for the
company's thrift shop on Wednesday that Schneider had promised to
contribute his collection of 78 pmrpm. recordings in time for next
year's auction.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Schneider donated a shirt. There weren't many
B-52's fans in the crowd, and the shirt went for only $75.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine by me, although I'm curious about where the jacket
went,'' he said. ``I donated a stage outfit and they auctioned just
the shirt.''

has been reduced to one simple fact. Casey wasn't good enough this
time around to earn his much-coveted tour card.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, however, it's a victory for the gallant iron
men of the tour, who unlike Casey have two strong legs to carry
them over a grueling daily walk of 18 holes. Yeah, the caddies have
it tough, toting around those heavy bags.
</P>
<P>
   But for some of the tour players, who lift nothing heavier than
a putter or a gin and tonic, Martin's failure will no doubt cause
great private joy.
</P>
<P>
   The unfairness of it all, this Casey Martin being allowed to
ride in a cart just be cause he suffers from a nasty circulatory
disorder known as Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome. Martin's use of
his right leg is very limited, and getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   When a court order allowed Casey to ride his cart on the pro
circuit, there were those brave PGA Tour members predicting the end
of civilization. Cart-riding, you see, could have meant a couple of
strokes, and that could extract money from some of the fat cats who
never have to finish better than 10th to earn several million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, cart-riding went totally against PGA rules and tradition.
Golf loves its tradition, except when it comes to using science to
completely alter how clubs are made. Bobby Jones' irons aren't
exactly what Tiger swings today.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was also tradition flushed when the
third round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am was played in February
and the fourth and final round in September. It was the longest
rain delay in sports history, but that's what the sponsoring
company wanted, so the PGA obliged, tradition or no tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Casey in a cart, however? No, no, no. Let's fight him in court.
And lose in court.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, we all have our problems, be it booze for John Daly,
putting for Tiger Woods, or choking for Greg Norman. But totally
unacceptable to the golf gods would be a young man with a withered
leg riding around in a cart.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, all is now well.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, tour commissioner Tim Finchem took a mighty public
relations hit, as did some tour players, by making a stink and
federal case out of Martin. The smart ones either stayed out of the
controversy or publicly backed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Martin handled the uproar extremely well, and
enjoyed tremendous public support.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, his patience also wore thin on the minor-league
Nike Tour, as did his game. Martin didn't play well, and his game
also didn't respond in the tour card qualifying school in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Martin finished 37th in a field that had the top 23 advancing to
the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment for Martin? Yes. Disappointment for those who
admire him? Yes, and that includes me.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin being good enough was always the X-factor. No one
knew that, not even Casey. What the Martin case became earlier this
year was a heavy-duty national debate over an equal opportunity
being afforded one and all, particularly if they meet certain
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's game, honed at Stanford where he was Tiger's teammate,
placed him in a select group of potential PGA Tour participants.
Beyond that, he had to go out and earn the right to carry the card.
And since he was a special case, due to a bad disease, if certain
accommodations had to be made, then to heck with the PGA. In
today's world, those accommodations are granted all the time, and
rightfully so.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the game of golf needed Casey Martin to be good, cart
and all. He is a PR dream, capable of attracting a much more
wide-based audience than the sport now has. Tiger has done that.
Martin could bring in more fans.
</P>
<P>
   It can be assumed Martin will try again on the Nike Tour. And
because he is a drawing card who has a number of sponsors, there
will be exemptions given in certain PGA events in 1999. If he so
deserves, Martin can compete at the highest level on a limited
basis and still hone his game in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But the important thing about him flunking out of qualifying
school is at least Casey Martin had a fair and square shot at it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for PGA honchos, his victory had to come in a
courtroom. And even in failure this week, Casey still scored a win
for what's right.

HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER IS CHALLENGED FROM CENTER AND RIGHT

 (bl)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Armey seemed to have a premonition of the
House leadership meltdown two years ago when, eyeing the majority
Republicans slipping a bit from their halcyon days of 1994, he
advised: ``Let's just dare to be not sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   This advice has become the Republican mantra with the removal of
Newt Gingrich as House speaker, and no one is more aware of this
than Armey. For he now must fight being purged as majority leader,
the second to the speaker in power.
</P>
<P>
   A politician who once openly yearned to succeed Gingrich, Armey
is beset from two sides in the leadership race: Rep. Jennifer Dunn
of Washington state is coming at him from the Republicans' uneasy
center, while Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma is challenging as an
unabashed purist even further right than Armey, the born-again
Christian and former economics professor who aims to scrap the
graduated income tax.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are due to meet Wednesday and settle the
competition among the three:
</P>
<P>
   ARMEY: Beyond his reputation as a doctrinaire conservative, the
seven-term Texan has a taste for flamboyance, from his cowboy boots
customized with the House seal to his raspy-edged denunciations
personalized for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Of Hillary Rodham Clinton, he has said, ``All her friends are
Marxists.'' When President Clinton angrily confronted him over this
at the White House, Armey responded, ``Perhaps it's my Western
upbringing, but I don't listen very well when someone's pointing a
finger at me.''
</P>
<P>
   After he referred to Rep. Barney Frank, a leading Democrat from
Massachusetts who is gay, as ``Barney Fag,'' Armey had to
apologize, but few critics believed his plea that it was an
innocent mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives appreciate Armey's Agnewish combativeness, as when
he criticized the International Monetary Fund's efforts to prop up
tottering nations and declared, ``I've been to Europe once; I don't
have to go again.'' But conservatives have been wary of Armey, too,
ever since their failed coup against Gingrich in 1997 when they
accused Armey of double-dealing in listening encouragingly to the
insurgents, then finally alerting Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my private moments I probably walk around the office
pretending I'm Gary Cooper,'' the 6-foot-2, 58-year-old country
music buff declared half-apologetically last year as he tried an
image makeover. ``In this position, I need to have a demeanor and
presentation of ideas that's attractive across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His policy ideas often whet the White House's political
appetite, particularly Armey's call to cut aid to education as a
way to make it possible to end the federal gasoline tax. As
majority leader, his line-in-the-sand effort to block any vote to
raise the minimum wage left Republican moderates apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like we say in Texas,'' said White House political strategist
Paul Begala, ``if goofy ideas ever go to $40 a barrel, I want the
drilling rights to Dick Armey's head.''
</P>
<P>
   But Armey's toughness among the troops has been well
demonstrated across the past four years and is rated a considerable
strength in the leadership scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, who unseated Gingrich and
is expected to replace him as speaker, had run-ins with Armey over
fiscal matters in the past. But Livingston promised neutrality in
the majority leader fight after Armey made a pilgrimage to pledge
fealty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a great many successes in this next
Congress,'' Armey vowed on election night, insisting then that
there was no reason for Republicans to panic.
</P>
<P>
   LARGENT: As a 44-year-old standout from the Contract With
America class of '94, Largent brought to Congress his fervor as
both an evangelical Christian and a professional football Hall of
Famer. Some colleagues privately wince at some of his pep-rally
political advice (``Perfect Preparation Prevents Poor
Performance!'').
</P>
<P>
   But his conservative peers look to him for the ethical edge in
politics. ``You know, people say _ and I believe it's totally false
_ that you can't legislate morality,'' he has said. ``The truth is
every piece of legislation legislates morality, whether it's a
library fine or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, is an ardent advocate of ending the graduated income
tax and replacing it with a single, flat rate. Speaking of the
unfairness of Social Security to his generation, he has said he
wants to overhaul it and eventually end it.
</P>
<P>
   On hot-button social issues, Largent opposes abortion and
insists there can be no middle ground for lawmakers. In sponsoring
the Defense of Marriage Act, he draws a distinction between
condemning the ``sin'' of homosexuality while expressing Christian
charity toward the ``sinner.'' As a child of a broken family, he
says his foremost goal in politics is to rebuild the family. Still
gridiron trim, the 5-foot-11 lawmaker holds weekly ``accountability
sessions'' with like-minded conservatives for political
soul-searching and prayer against ``all the temptations'' of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For all his spirituality and caucus lectures on team solidarity,
Largent showed a keenness for the power play known in football as
the crack-back block when he moved quickly on national television
to cut down Armey as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he called on Gingrich to step aside while the
speaker's ethics case was before the House. When Gingrich finally
exited last week, he bitterly cautioned his successor about ever
hoping to satisfy the ``perfectionist caucus'' that is Largent's
power base. ``Brief But Brilliant'' is the political epitaph
Largent once suggested for himself, and one way or another his
current sprint for the leadership seems planned with that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MS. DUNN: When it comes to sports metaphors, Ms. Dunn once
estimated that the House seemed closer to hockey than football,
considering the free-form brawling and verbal stick checking that
goes on. But she warned the men of her party that they had better
drop all allusions to sports and war in their political talk if
they ever hope to end the gender gap in which women voters give an
edge to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing speech modules that are women friendly,''
she said earlier this year at a Republican women's conference. ``We
need to stress what I call the soft edge of the conservative
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who made a show of relying on Ms. Dunn as visible
front-office proof of his gender sensitivity, now finds himself
challenged by this resilient four-term lawmaker respected more as a
vote-savvy political technician than a policy purist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm someone who has broken a lot of glass ceilings,'' she said
of her current campaign to move up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first president _ first woman president of our
student body _ in the sixth grade, and was the first woman
Republican state party chairman,'' she added, having served 12
years as the party leader in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With two money-dispensing political action committees to help
bind her to her fellow Republicans, Ms. Dunn regularly attends
House strategy sessions of both conservatives and moderates.
Conservatives complain that she receives a favorable rating of 80
percent, not 100 percent, from the anti-abortion lobby. She hopes
this imperfection leaves her well placed for the new, possibly more
compromising, Livingston team. Some moderates privately rate her as
an earnest politician painstakingly devoted to party message, but
hardly a policy innovator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we got was that there was no message,'' Ms. Dunn
complained of shortcomings that she said voters found in the last
agenda of the Gingrich era.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old lawmaker built her initial reputation as a hawk
on the deficit and crime, co-sponsoring a law allowing localities
to protect children by openly tracking ``sexual predators.'' But
her basic message now to reeling House Republicans is that if they
are wise, they will replace the cowboy-styled Armey not with
Largent, a partisan rooted in football-speak, but with her, a
sensitized mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are seen as being partisan, it's going to be hurtful to
us,'' she warned Republicans before their election drubbing. ``It's
going to push women away.''

COURTSIDE MEMORIAL FOR PRODUCER'S FAMILY  
 `HEIDI'-NFL CONTROVERSY, 30 YEARS LATER  
 MYERS TO FOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jack O'Hara, the former executive producer of ABC Sports,
and his wife, Janet, perished with their daughter, Caitlin, in the
crash of TWA Flight 800 in July 1996, friends and family tried to
grapple with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Haras were flying to Paris, where Jack O'Hara was
overseeing production of the Tour de France, his last duty at the
network. ABC informed O'Hara, 39, two days before the crash that he
was to be replaced. Caitlin, 13, had won the French prize at
Irvington Middle School in Westchester County, N.Y., and was to
visit her French pen pal.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Haras' twin sons, Matthew and Brian, did not make the trip
and stayed at home with their grandparents. Today, they are 15 and
live with Jack's younger brother, Jim, his wife, Peggy, and their
daughter, Erin, in New City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys are doing fine,'' said Jim O'Hara, also a sports
producer, at Phoenix Communications. ``We're trying to let them
live as normal a life as possible. They're very good students,
involved in a lot of sports. They fit in with a nice group of kids.
When the tragedy happened, we moved in to their house hoping it
would ease their transition. Then after the eighth grade, we moved
back to our house. But we're never going to replace their parents,
and never want to forget them.''
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends tried to find the right tribute for the
O'Haras. In Irvington, Jack and Janet coached sports, taught
religion and were mentors at Abbott House, a group home for
underprivileged children. Jack O'Hara was one of the genuinely
decent and classy people in the business, a genial executive who
rose through ABC Sports' programming ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed a lot of ideas, from planting trees to park
benches,'' Jim O'Hara said. ``But somebody said, `They were such
outgoing people, let's create a living memorial.'''
</P>
<P>
   Out of their brainstorming came the O'Hara Invitational Youth
Basketball Tournament, a 32-team round-robin event, which starts
its third season tonight at the Irvington Middle and Irvington High
Schools.
</P>
<P>
   The first two years netted $30,000 for 10 local organizations,
including Abbott House, the Little League, scholarship funds and
the public library. More money would have been raised, but a flood
on the high school gym floor last year forced all the games to the
middle school. ``We've gotten a great response from the town,'' Jim
O'Hara said.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament resumes Saturday and Sunday at both schools and
continues next weekend. Admission is $2 for adults and $1 for
children, and items like a baseball signed by David Wells and two
Super Bowl tickets will be raffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult,'' Jim O'Hara said. ``The tragedy is
something we'll always think about. But the outpouring of the
people of Irvington, and from Jack and Janet's friends, has made us
feel a little better. The fact that the money goes to all these
charities has really helped us get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   `HEIDI'-NFL CONTROVERSY, 30 YEARS LATER
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it will be 30 years since NBC switched from a New
York Jets-Oakland Raiders game, as planned, at 7 p.m. Eastern time,
to the movie ``Heidi,'' before Oakland scored two touchdowns in the
final minute to win, 43-32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything wrong,'' said Dick Cline, NBC's broadcast
operations supervisor, who made the fateful switch. ``I did what I
was supposed to do.'' He said that if he had done what was logical
and kept the game on, ``they told me I'd be fired the next day.''
As it happened, he was promoted the next week.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, three-hour games were rare, and Cline's dilemma
was unusual. But on Nov. 17, 1968, this matchup of two American
Football League titans, with 19 penalties and 31 incomplete losses,
was going dangerously long.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we got closer to 7, I was in touch with my boss, who was
trying to get permission to keep the game on, but he wasn't able to
get back to me,'' said Cline, who did not know that NBC had decided
to delay the start of ``Heidi.'' But a jammed-up switchboard
prevented word from Cline's bosses from reaching him.
</P>
<P>
   Cline, now a freelance director for CBS's National Football
League broadcasts, said that his main regret in having been central
to the infamy of the game was being described as a ``faceless
button pusher in the bowels of NBC'' by David Brinkley, the
co-anchor of NBC's evening news.
</P>
<P>
   MYERS TO FOX
</P>
<P>
   Chris Myers' move from ESPN to Fox Sports News on Thursday was
not the headline grabber that Keith Olbermann's was earlier this
week, when Olbermann announced that he was joining Fox Sports News
from MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Myers speak at length about his psychotherapy, as
Olbermann did, or trash ESPN as Olbermann did when he left ESPN for
MSNBC last year. But Myers, who will be an anchor for Fox Sports
News and the host of the Fox Sports Net's ``Goin' Deep'' magazine
show, jabbed a bit at ESPN, where he was the able host of ``Up
Close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed an attitude at ESPN that we're all replaceable,'' he
said. ``If they're not careful, they could be replaced as the
sports news leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Olbermann and Myers raises the profile for Fox Sports
News, which has labored with lesser-known anchors than ESPN's.
Still, Fox's ratings for the two-hour show _ which is broadcast
live to all of the Fox Sports Net's regional affiliates except the
MSG Network from 10 p.m. to midnight _ are up by 24 percent from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 11 p.m.-to-midnight hour, ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' is
attracting an average 956,000 households _ helped by having Sunday
night football all season _ compared with Fox's 139,000, according
to ESPN. Fox will very likely showcase Olbermann, who made his name
on ``SportsCenter,'' in that key hour.

MITCH'S DEADLY RAINS AFFECTED THE POOREST OF THE POOR 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ The people who built their makeshift homes on
the steep hills around this city always knew they would lead a
dangerous existence.
</P>
<P>
   But even after rains driven by Hurricane Mitch toppled hundreds
of houses and took the lives of 78 Guatemala City residents, many
survivors say they have no plans to leave their hillside homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nowhere else to go, so we will stay here,'' said
Andres Cabrera, 21, who lives with his family in El Incienso, a
steep canyon neighborhood in Guatemala's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch caused a landslide that killed a family of six less than
50 yards down the hill from Cabrera's home.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cabrera and his brother were reinforcing their
adobe shack with a new coat of mud in the hopes that it will
continue to stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there is fear that there could be more mudslides, but
what other option do we have?'' Cabrera asked.
</P>
<P>
   During its tour of destruction across Central America, Mitch
punished no one quite as much as the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   After killing nearly 10,000 people in Honduras and Nicaragua,
the storm moved across Guatemala and El Salvador, inflicting more
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Guatemala report that a total of 264 people died
across the country and that 13,000 were left homeless because of
the storm. In El Salvador, Mitch killed 239 and left 28,000 without
roofs of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Two major bridges over rivers in El Salvador were washed out. In
Guatemala, the capital city was isolated from the vital port of
Puerto Barrios for more than a week. As a result, prices of goods
in Guatemala City skyrocketed, prompting panicked residents to
empty grocery store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries reported severe damage to subsistence and cash
crops. In El Salvador, the eastern portion of the country near the
Honduran border suffered the most. In Guatemala, officials reported
extensive damage throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of 22 states, only one reported no damage,'' said Josue Perez,
spokesman for the Guatemalan disaster relief agency.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Guatemala's deaths, Perez said, could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deaths here were clearly related to socioeconomics,'' he
said. ``The people of humble origins build their houses on these
dangerous canyons, and there's nothing the government can do to
stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford property on flat and safe terrain, many people
throughout Central America have built makeshift homes on the slopes
of slide-prone hills and along the edges of flood-prone rivers. The
people of Guatemala City have done the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a high plain, the Guatemalan capital is surrounded by
narrow canyons carved out by ancient rivers. In recent decades, as
poor rural residents moved to the city to seek work and to escape
the country's civil war, the flat land was used up.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a place to live, many of the migrants built
squatter homes along the steep walls of the canyons. Whole
neighborhoods sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, canyon barrios exist on all sides of the city, providing
homes to thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Every rainy season, some canyon residents lose their lives in
mudslides. A family of eight perished in a landslide here Oct. 8, a
few weeks before Mitch passed through. Still, the death toll caused
by Mitch was unusual in its magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to a steep hill in the northwestern part of the city is
the neighborhood of El Incienso, a sea of homes with corrugated
metal roofs. The nicer homes are near the top of the hill, and a
sewage-filled creek runs along the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A descending order of social standing seems to have formed.
</P>
<P>
   Those lucky enough to live near the rim of the canyon reside in
dwellings of concrete block with running water and electricity. A
labyrinthine path winds among the houses, where women in
traditional Maya dress cook tortillas over wood fires.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway down the hill, Nancy Palacios, her husband and two
daughters live in a one-room house with a dirt floor. The walls are
made of plasterboard and cardboard. Plastic tarps draped under the
roof collect rain. There is electricity but no running water.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch triggered a small landslide in Palacios' tiny back yard
and took away her outdoor sink. The home is barely standing, and
the family can no longer reach the outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the hill, the concrete path turns to mud, and the
homes are little more than tents. Teen gangs terrorize the area at
night, forcing many residents to stay inside after 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With hides worn raw by infections, even the stray dogs at the
bottom of the hill look more desperate than those at the top.
</P>
<P>
   A dirt pile covered with garbage is all that marks the site of
the house where six people died in Mitch's rains.
</P>
<P>
   After the fatal mudslide, authorities told residents of the
immediate area to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo David Say, 18, and his family are now living in a shelter.
On Thursday, however, Say returned to his home to collect a few
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where he and his family will go after they leave the
shelter, Say simply shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government tells us we can't live here anymore,'' he said,
standing at the bottom of the hill. ``But they don't tell us where
we can go.''

   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   1 P.M. Sunday
</P>
<P>
   49ers (7-2) at Falcons (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: It's time to start taking these Falcons seriously. The
team is off to its best start ever and is 12-4 in the past 16 games
and have won 7 of past 8 against the NFC West. Here is the
dangerous part for the Falcons: The 49ers always dominate them. San
Francisco has won five straight and has scored 30 or more points in
11 of the past 13 games against Atlanta. Normally, this would be
just another blowout of the hapless Falcons. But the 49ers are
reeling. Their offensive line is in shambles and Young is still
aching from a groin injury. Quarterback Chris Chandler, the NFC's
fourth ranked passer, throws for 350 yards against a terrible 49ers
pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 28-23.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Bengals (2-7) at Vikings (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is one of those trap games for the Vikings. Under
Coach Bruce Coslet, the Bengals have always been strong finishers.
In 1995, they ended the year 4-2. The following season the Bengals
finished 6-2 and last year 7-2. If there was a second half of the
season championship, the Bengals would win it every year. Of
course, Vikings' Coach Dennis Green has mentioned to his players
how well Cincinnati plays late in the year. Now, it's just a matter
of whether his players will listen. Randall Cunningham gets the
start, and the Vikings squeak by.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 30-29.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins (6-3) at Panthers (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Panthers have kept games close because of
quarterback Steve Beuerlein, who is third in the NFC with a 91.7
rating. His completion rate of 65 percent leads the league. Maybe
the best thing that happened to the Panthers was Kerry Collins
getting cut. This game has upset written all over it, especially
since Kevin Greene, who leads the NFL in sacks with 13, likes going
against top teams. The Dolphins are 18-11 in first meetings against
a franchise but Carolina wins because of a steady Beuerlein and
Green will get at least two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots (5-4) at Bills (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Playing in Buffalo doesn't scare New England. The team
has won 3 of the past 4 games there and seems to relish playing in
front of the hostile Bills crowd. Basically, the loser of this game
is out of the division title race and it will come down to the
winner of the Patriots-Bills game, the Jets and the Dolphins. It's
hard to figure this Patriots team, since they got blown out last
week at home by Atlanta. But they know how vital this game is and
the league is starting to figure out Doug Flutie. New England wins
a big one on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 18-14.
</P>
<P>
   Jets (6-3) at Colts (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: After the Jets beat the Bills last week, Bill Parcells
started his campaign of disinformation with his players, saying
that the Colts are a good team, that quarterback Peyton Manning is
playing well, that this team shouldn't be taken lightly. Wrong. The
Colts are a bad team, Manning has a bright future, but he has
thrown 18 interceptions and the Colts should be taken lightly. The
Jets are clearly the better team as they demonstrated by blowing
out Indianapolis early in the season, 44-6. This time around,
Curtis Martin has one of those 28 carry, 150-yard, two-touchdown
days. Six of the past eight games have been decided by 8 points or
less, but this is a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 35-13.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles (2-7) at Redskins (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Eagles are beginning to build a little momentum.
The team has been recently propelled by defensive end Hugh Douglas,
the former Jet who was cast off to Philadelphia because he didn't
get along with Parcells. He has a career-high 11 sacks, 33 sacks in
the past 49 career games. That's impressive. There is no reason to
think he won't add a few more sacks against the Redskins. The game
is almost guaranteed to be close, with 13 of the past 14 decided by
seven points or less, including the last two in Washington by three
points or less. Player to watch: Darrell Green, who has nine
interceptions against the Eagles, tied for most against any team.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers (6-3) at Oilers (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This promises to be one of the most bruising games of
the year. These two teams met earlier this month, and running back
Eddie George embarrassed a good Pittsburgh defense by running for
153 yards and one touchdown. In the NFL, there are very few times
when one team bashes another, then two weeks later does it again.
If quarterback Kordell Stewart has finally shaken off his problems
running the offense, which it seemed like against Green Bay on
Monday night, then the Steelers will get revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 21-17
</P>
<P>
   Rams (3-6) at Saints (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Collins gets the start, and his chance to save his
career begins. He'll have more help with the Saints than he did in
Carolina. New Orleans' defense is playing well. The last time these
teams met, the Saints recorded six sacks and defensive end Joe
Johnson had a 5-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown. Quarterback
Tony Banks throws three interceptions and Collins actually has a
solid game.
</P>
<P>
   Saints, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Ravens (3-6) at Chargers (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: You know a team is in a desperate state when it
benches the franchise quarterback, Ryan Leaf, for a backup that
last year was 0-7, Craig Whelihan. The saving grace for San Diego
has been the defense. The Chargers have given up just 254 yards a
game, especially impressive since the team hasn't led the NFL in
defense since 1965. It seems like its been that long since the
Ravens got a win.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks (5-4) at Raiders (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Quietly, one of the best quarterbacks in the league
has been Donald Hallas. Donald Hallas? He replaced Jeff George
three weeks ago and his play, combined with a defense that has
allowed just two touchdowns in the last 10 quarters, means that
Oakland Coach Jon Gruden is in the running for coach of the year.
Seattle has a solid defense of its own and lead the NFL in sacks
with 37. Quarterback Warren Moon has traditionally done well
against the Raiders _ he is 3-1 in his past four starts against
Oakland _ but this Raiders defense is too good right now. Moon gets
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-15
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (6-3) at Cardinals (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Cardinals are over .500 for the first time since
the football was invented. They are talking about how they have a
chance to win the division. Next year, they will be good. This
year, the NFC East belongs to Dallas. The Cowboys are 5-0 in the
division, including 3-0 on the road. Their offensive line is
playing out of this world, allowing just 10 sacks, a league low. In
its last five games against Arizona, the Cowboys have given up just
five sacks. Arizona has done a great job of trying to shake its
recent sorry past and there is no doubt they will be a contender
next year. Just not now.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 24-17
</P>
<P>
   Packers (6-3) at Giants (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Packers are an angry team. They aren't used to
getting beat up on Monday Night Football like they were against
Pittsburgh. So they will come into the Giants game with a giant
chip on their shoulder. There is no way the Giants offensive line
can contain the Packers' front four. Defensive end Reggie White has
12 sacks in what has been a tremendous year. Plus, he's never
sacked Giants quarterback Danny Kanell and White would love to add
another trophy to the mantle. Something else to keep in mind: The
Packers are 22-7 against non-division teams since 1995 including
4-1 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 41-17.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers (4-5) at Jaguars (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Tampa Bay plays well against the AFC, winning 5 of the
past 7. But this isn't just any AFC team. The Jaguars are one of
the top five teams in the game and they've won 18 of the past 20
games at home. Their offense has been incredible, outscoring teams
66-13 in the first half of the past two games. Tampa Bay simply
does not have the offensive firepower to stay with Jacksonville.
The Buccaneers' only hope is fullback Mike Alstott. The team is 7-0
when he has at least 100 all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, 31-21.
</P>
<P>
   Bears (3-6) at Lions (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Earlier this season, the Bears held running back Barry
Sanders to just 28 yards rushing on 14 carries. Sanders will likely
improve on those numbers, but not by much. The Lions have evolved
into a bad team, a very bad team, and it wasn't lost on some
players when after Detroit's loss to Philadelphia last week, Coach
Bobby Ross was blaming the players. The cracks are becoming the
Grand Canyon. Detroit needs to get Pro Bowl wide receiver Herman
Moore back into the offense to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (9-0) at Chiefs (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The Broncos have a chance to become just the 16th team
in NFL history to start 10-0, but they have to get by the Chiefs.
It seems no matter how well the other team is playing, these
hard-hitting and intense games are always close. The last 4 at
Arrowhead Stadium have been decided by 3 points or less. Chiefs
quarterback Rich Gannon gets the start and if it isn't obvious by
now it should be _ he's better than Elvis Grbac. His scrambling
ability will give the Broncos fits and while Coach Mike Shanahan is
the best coach in the game right now, he's still not God. Not yet.
Even Shanahan loses a few and this is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 34-31.

DEMOCRAT HAS THE EDGE IN ATTORNEY GENERAL TALLY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With teams of lawyers for Republicans and Democrats
haggling over each tally and every stray pencil mark, elections
officials Thursday continued the tense and tedious process of
rechecking machines and counting paper ballots to determine the
winner of the whisker-close race for state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Democratic challenger Eliot Spitzer had
increased his narrow lead to 22,000 votes over Republican incumbent
Dennis Vacco. But with 100,000 or more votes still to be counted,
the outcome, even nine days after the election, remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   After each day of counting, the State Board of Elections
releases tabulations received from the 62 counties around the
state. The latest figures represented a sharp increase in Spitzer's
lead, which stood at 4,101 votes on Wednesday. Thursday's revised
totals gave Spitzer 2,006,834 votes, with 1,984,459 for Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Kosinski, deputy executive director of the Board of
Elections, said much remained to be done.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were about 250,000 paper ballots from last week's
election, including absentee ballots and others cast by people in
the military or whose voting machines malfunctioned. Each county is
at a different stage of counting those ballots, Kosinski said,
adding that several of the largest _ Erie, Nassau, Suffolk,
Onondaga and all of New York City's, for example _ had reported few
if any results from paper ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking me how much is counted and how much is left
to count, the simple answer is, I don't know,'' Kosinski said. ``I
don't have a handle on every piece of paper or the percentage of
paper ballots that have been counted. I am guessing a lot of paper
has not been counted. We're asking our people around the state to
give us information as soon as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Spitzer's campaign seemed to take delight in the
updated figures. ``Eliot and the Spitzer campaign have moved from
cautious optimism to just plain optimism,'' said Steven Goldstein,
campaign press secretary. ``All the numbers and the indications
seem to be pointing Eliot's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for Vacco at his attorney general's office and
campaign headquarters were not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the revision reported Thursday resulted from the
recounting of totals from the election machines in New York City.
The city's Board of Elections officials said that after the
machines were reviewed over the last week, Spitzer's totals were
22,800 votes higher than the unofficial figures released on
election night.
</P>
<P>
   Kosinski said the final tally would not be ready for several
days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Board of Elections offices in New York City were
overrun by hundreds of election lawyers, campaign professionals and
political volunteers who came to oversee and sometimes challenge
the counting of the paper ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, for example, the 100 or so campaign representatives
began gathering shortly after the doors at the board's offices at
345 Adams St. opened at 9 a.m., dividing themselves into warring
camps of Democrats and Republicans. Ballot by ballot, they began
the painstaking task of counting, reviewing and challenging the
thousands of absentee and other paper votes.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer, a Republican, sought to disqualify a ballot because
of a stray mark outside the designated box. Another, representing
the Democratic candidate, objected to a signature in the wrong
place on a ballot for the Republican candidate. It is a laborious,
highly manual and sometimes confrontational process that helps
explain why it can sometimes take so long to determine final
election results in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most elections are decided by a wide enough margin
that the intricate _ some would suggest Byzantine _ work of the
Board of Elections barely gets noticed. But the results of last
week's contest has placed the board's process on center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The paper ballots represent four different kinds of votes. Some
are cast by people away from their homes because of their service
in the military. Absentee ballots are cast by voters who plan to be
away from home on Election Day. ``Emergency'' ballots are votes
cast by hand, when the machines in a polling place malfunction. And
``affidavit'' ballots are cast by voters whose names do not appear
on the rolls when they go to the polling place.

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sang Lan was in kindergarten in China when a
recruiter from a state gymnastics school arrived to measure her
arms and legs, just as he did with the other children. In her case,
the numbers added up to the body of a potential gymnast _ and
plucked her from one life into another.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 6, she was in gymnastics school in her hometown on
China's southeast coast. By 8 she had moved four hours by car from
her parents, who visited once a month. By 10, she was receiving a
salary from the State Sports Commission. By 12, she was on the
national team in Beijing, a two-hour flight from her parents, who
by this time were visiting only twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling neglected, she was, in her culture, a young
woman of great privilege _ supported by the state and chosen for a
life of relative riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of work,'' Ms. Sang, 17, recalled this week in a
friend's apartment in New York. ``But it was a very happy life.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the rewards was a trip in July to New York for the
Goodwill Games, the mini-Olympics started by Ted Turner during the
1980s boycotts of the real thing. Ms. Sang had dreams for Sydney in
2000. But on July 21, in a routine warm-up vault at the Nassau
Coliseum, Ms. Sang landed hard on her head. The injuries to her
spine were catastrophic; she was paralyzed from the chest down. She
is not expected to recover the use of her legs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I will walk again,'' she said on Wednesday during an
hourlong interview in the apartment of a friend, Winston Sie, in a
modern high-rise on East 38th Street. ``This is all a big lesson.''
Not that there aren't dark times. ``Usually when I feel bad it's at
night,'' she said. ``But I go to sleep and everything's better in
the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang's accident was a terrible summer news story that
developed into a tale of courage. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jimmy Carter
and Jackie Chan visited her in the hospital; Celine Dion came by to
sing ``My Heart Will Go On.'' Back home, Ms. Sang has become a
media star, and has been offered a full scholarship to Qinghua
University, the MIT of China.
</P>
<P>
   But here she is a persevering New Yorker whose life centers on
rehabilitation and worries about her future. On Oct. 30, Ms. Sang
was discharged from the Mount Sinai-New York University Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   She now spends six hours a day in therapy at the Rusk Institute
of Rehabilitation Medicine in Manhattan. Then she returns to her
friend's apartment for tutoring in English, math and computer
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to think about what I'd like to do,'' Ms.
Sang said, with Sie translating. ``I'm just following the
schedule.'' Sie, 25, is a Chinese-American studying at New York
University. His mother, Gina Liu, is an official of the Chinese
Gymnastics Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang talked while lying on a gym mat in the living room,
although sometimes Sie helped her to a sitting position. Her
mother, Xiufeng Chen, who works in a leather factory in China, was
preparing dinner; her father, a government housing worker, has gone
back to China.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang has some use of her arms and wrists, and was happy to
offer a cookie from her own hand. ``I like these,'' she said in
English, amused. Ms. Sang still has the crisp body of a gymnast.
From her neck up, she is vital, fearless and perceptive.
</P>
<P>
   She cannot forget her accident. ``I remember,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Does she wonder how or why it happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to let her think why,'' Sie said, not translating
the question. ``If you start thinking why, then it's not going to
be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang spoke up in Chinese. ``Oh,'' Sie said, ``she
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang went on to reply: ``Ask the same question of
Christopher Reeve.''(She has spoken to the actor, who was paralyzed
in a fall from a horse.) ``It was an accident. There's no `why.'
Christopher Reeve told me that his horse had done the jump over and
over again. It never had problems with it. Why? It was just an
accident. The same with me. My movement was easy. I can close my
eyes and do it a million times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang added that she believes ``a lot of this is set up by
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's very unfortunate I had this accident,'' she said,
``but I wouldn't have come to know all these people. And I will
give back what I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say it is possible that future medical breakthroughs
could restore Ms. Sang's ability to walk. ``But I can't tell if
it's going to be 5 years, 10 years or decades away,'' said Dr.
Kristjan T. Ragnarsson, Mount Sinai's chief of rehabilitation, who
is treating Ms. Sang.
</P>
<P>
   For now, friends have set up a trust fund for Ms. Sang's living
costs and education in the United States; $80,000 has been raised,
mostly in small donations from Chinese-Americans. (Her medical care
and rehabilitation are so far covered by Goodwill Games' insurance,
and she still receives her gymnast's salary from China, which comes
to $78 a month.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers University, one of the leading
researchers on spinal injuries in the United States, is a trustee
of the fund. He signed on after meeting Ms. Sang. ``She's a very,
very bright girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sang said she misses China, and ``my father, my coaches, my
teammates and my gym work.''

CABLE AND WIRELESS SAID TO SEEK LINES IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to increase control over its U.S. operations, Cable and
Wireless PLC of Britain is seeking to acquire more than $300
million worth of fiber-optic communications lines from Qwest
Communications International Inc., according to executives close to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that some details remained unsettled and
that the two companies were six to eight weeks away from an
announcement. They added that the two sides appeared committed to
reaching an accord.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for both Qwest and Cable and Wireless to
seek such an agreement. A deal could provide big operating savings
to Cable and Wireless, enhance Qwest's credibility as a major
player in global telecommunications and even shake up the
mergers-and-acquisitions environment.
</P>
<P>
   A Qwest spokesman said that his company was already selling some
services to Cable and Wireless, but refused to comment further.
Cable and Wireless declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Cable and Wireless told investors and analysts that it
had asked U.S. companies to submit proposals for selling
high-capacity long-distance lines. It was unclear Thursday what the
potential implications of Cable and Wireless' discussions with
Qwest were for other carriers seeking the British company's
business. The executives close to the talks said that Qwest could
still lose out to another company.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, however, that the talks between Cable and Wireless
and Qwest highlight the union of two of the most basic financial
concepts in the telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   First, if a carrier is handling large amounts of communications
traffic and wants to serve the lucrative Fortune 100 accounts, it
almost always makes more sense for that carrier to own its network
rather than lease capacity on a competitor's systems.
</P>
<P>
   That is the reality that Cable and Wireless is facing. Over the
last few years, the company was able to grow into one of the
largest carriers of long-distance voice traffic in the United
States while leasing communications lines from others.
</P>
<P>
   But once Cable and Wireless acquired MCI Communications Corp.'s
Internet business in July for $1.75 billion, the rationale for the
British company's buying its own network strengthened greatly.
(That deal said that Cable and Wireless could lease fiber-optic
capacity from what is now MCI Worldcom.)
</P>
<P>
   Using an owned, rather than leased, network not only can reduce
operating costs but also increases a carrier's ability to win large
corporate accounts. With their demands for reliability, many big
corporations want to be sure that their communications providers
actually own the systems they use and can be held accountable for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Cable and Wireless, it can take advantage of a
second strategic imperative: Once a company spends millions or
billions building a communications pipeline, the only way for it to
recover its costs is to fill it up. An empty network only
depreciates.
</P>
<P>
   And right now there are a lot of empty networks being built in
the United States. In addition to Qwest, IXC Communications,
Williams Cos. and Level 3 Communications are each building new
national communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier Corp., which already owns a piece of the Qwest network,
also has more communications capacity than it needs. (In fact, in
recent months Cable and Wireless has been mentioned as a potential
acquirer of Frontier, though that now seems less likely.)
</P>
<P>
   All of those companies are locked in fierce competition to fill
their networks and recover their costs, in one sense putting Cable
and Wireless in the catbird seat. Cable and Wireless will likely
buy what is known in the industry as ``dark fiber'' optical lines
that the company would then outfit with its own choice of
light-emitting transmission electronics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its ability to pay cash, Cable and Wireless has
another potential bargaining chip in its negotiations with U.S.
carriers. With its far-flung global operations, Cable and Wireless
could agree to swap some of its international network capacity for
optical fiber in the United States.

SETON HALL BARS EVENT TO HONOR WHITMAN, CITING ABORTION STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Seton Hall University officials have ordered a
student-sponsored event honoring Gov. Christie Whitman at the law
school to be moved to an off-campus site because of the Governor's
support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Three student organizations from the law school had been
planning to present Whitman with the sixth annual Sandra Day
O'Connor Medal of Honor in the law school's auditorium Monday. But
after sending out dozens of invitations, the student groups were
told by university officials earlier this week to move the event to
the nearby Newark Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seton Hall has a clearly stated policy that no public
recognition is given to those espousing positions contrary to our
Catholic mission,'' Msgr. Robert Sheeran, president of the
university, said in a statement. ``This includes those publicly
supporting pro-choice views.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision surprised and offended the student groups _ the
Seton Hall Law Review, the Seton Hall Legislative Bureau and the
Seton Hall Women's Law Forum _ which spent months organizing the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders noted that the award, honoring women for their
achievements in law and public service, has been given in recent
years to women who share Whitman's position on abortion rights.
Past recipients at the law school include first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and O'Connor, an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the university officials and the student
organizations was first reported in The Star Ledger of Newark on
Thursday. In a statement, the student group leaders, Tiffany
Werner, Keri Logosso and Dominick DiRocco, said, ``Many members of
the law school community are offended that the university has
reduced the achievements of the first female governor of the state
of New Jersey to a debate on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was on vacation and unavailable for comment. A
spokeswoman, Julie Plocinik, said the governor was honored to be
receiving the award.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the student organizations had not
notified them that they were planning to honor Whitman until after
they had extended the invitation. ``Because this invitation was
extended and accepted before the university administration was
aware of it, Seton Hall has decided not to publicly rescind this
event,'' Sheeran said in his statement.

BROTHERS CHARGED WITH SCHEMING TO SELL PIECES OF FAKE MOON ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Texas)  (af) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was advertised by a Manhattan auction house in
1995 as ``the first substantial moon rock ever available for
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be more of the backyard variety, a federal
grand jury charged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In what the authorities said was a scheme to defraud
unsuspecting buyers of millions of dollars, two brothers from
Georgia were indicted Thursday on charges of conspiring to sell
pieces of a fake moon rock that they said had been given to their
late father by Sen. John Glenn, the former Apollo astronaut, who
recently returned to space.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Brian and Ronald Trochelmann of Atlanta, had been
telling people that their father was given the rock in honor of an
invention he had made for the space program, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was also untrue, federal authorities said Thursday. The
indictment charged that Ronald Trochelmann embarked on the scheme
to sell the fake moon rock with his brother after watching a
television show in 1994 about the 25th anniversary of the Apollo
moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   The Trochelmann brothers were each charged with conspiracy and
wire fraud and could receive up to five years in prison if
convicted, said federal prosecutors in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for both men denounced the charges Thursrday, saying
that their clients had each acted in the belief that the rock was
genuine, and that they had based their view on an expert's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that it is a moon rock,'' said Paul F. Callan,
the lawyer for Ronald Trochelmann. Even if that turns out not to be
true, he said, his client will still be innocent of the charges
because he ``sincerely believed that it was moon rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, this is a case with reasonable doubt written all
over it,'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Findling, who represents Brian Trochelmann, concurred. He
said his client had acted on the basis of what his late father had
told him. To say that he perpetrated fraud because he believed in
his father and did not ``hire a private investigator to find out if
his father was a truthful and believable person,'' Findling said,
``is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said Thursday that the rock, which was
composed of a combination of dark gray, grainy and white
crystalline material, was never actually sold. The fist-sized rock
was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1995 just
before it was to be offered at auction by Phillips Son &AMP; Neale,
which the government said was unaware that there were questions
about the rock.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the auction house, Deborah Seidel, said Thursday
night that it was ``committed to protecting the integrity of the
auction process, and from the beginning we have cooperated fully
with the government on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with the space program said that of the 840 pounds
of moon rock collected by astronauts, virtually all of it was still
in government control, and that private sales should be immediately
considered suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a strong collector value to them,'' said
Gary E. Lofgren, lunar curator at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As for Glenn, who never visited the moon, his spokesman, Jack
Sparks, said, ``John Glenn never owned any moon rock and has never
given away any moon rock.''

NORMAN CONFIDENT ABOUT COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ New and improved fin. Same ol' Shark.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman will play his first round of competitive golf in
seven months today, when he and fellow Australian Steve Elkington
take on 11 other two-man teams in the Franklin Templeton Shark
Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who underwent shoulder surgery after the Masters
Tournament in April, has played just six rounds since then _
including this week's pro-am competition in his tournament at
Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   But the 43-year-old Queensland native seems to have the same
confidence and zest for the game that has helped him win two
British Opens and 72 other tournaments worldwide since turning
professional in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no shadow or loss of confidence,'' Norman said. ``I
don't have any (doubt) right now and I probably won't have ever
because I'm a very confident individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's confidence is well established. It has helped him swim
with sharks in his native Australia, take the copilot's seat on a
flight from a carrier-based jet fighter and cooperate graciously
during what must have been an agonizing media grilling after he
lost a six-stroke, final-round lead and the championship to Nick
Faldo in the '96 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence makes Norman believe he can come back from
surgery made necessary after his shoulder started popping out of
joint during backswings at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Norman was further encouraged by his pro-am play this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball pretty good, actually,'' he said. ``My touch
was the one thing that never really deserted me. When I went back
to hitting balls again, I felt that my hand and eye coordination
and where I wanted the ball to land was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his own tournament has never been any source of
immediate gratification for Norman _ aside from the $1.9 million
his event has raised for the national Childhood Cancer Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his skill, Norman _ ranked No.1 in the world as
recently as last year _ has yet to win a Shark Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   He could benefit this week in teaming with Elkington, who has
won twice at Sherwood. Then again, they teamed last year and
finished ninth in a 10-team field.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, however, is viewing his comeback in the big picture.
He's hoping the Shark Shootout, Skins Game and Australian Open can
get him ready for the Dec. 7-13 Presidents Cup _ ``my No.1 priority
after the surgery,'' he said. Beyond that, Norman hopes this
four-event offseason stretch will prepare him for an 18-20
tournament schedule in 1999 _ reduced from his normal annual grind
of 20-24 competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come back next year and for the next couple of
years play a full schedule,'' he said. ``If I do well in the game,
like I have done in the past, I'll be happy. If I don't do well in
the game, which I don't think is going to happen, I'll still be
happy because I have done everything right to do this the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lietzke, who shared the Shark Shootout title last year
with Scott McCarron, believes Norman could come back as strongly as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy, stronger and mentally prepared to make a
comeback,'' Lietzke said. ``He could go on a two-to-three-year tear
now.''
</P>
<P>
   State of the tournament:!off! This is the 10th anniversary of
the Shark Shootout, which has always been held at Sherwood. Norman
said the event will return in 1999, ``then it's up to Sherwood,
because our options are open at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Norman lives in Florida and would not mind having the
tournament in that state, he said he would like to see it remain at
Sherwood, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves Sherwood Country Club,'' he said. ``It's got a
great atmosphere and it's got a great clubhouse, but that call is
going to be up to (Sherwood owner) David Murdoch.... If he wants us
to stay here, we'll definitely look at that option.''

STARS LOOK FOR WAYS TO BREAK CURSE OF `THE JOE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tickets to Red Wings games at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena are
precious commodities, so Pat Verbeek has a little string attached
to the gift he has offered to an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars winger is inviting Sister Elaine, one of his old high
school teachers, to tonight's 6:30 showdown between the Stars and
Red Wings. And all he's asking in return is one little favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need her to perform an exorcism,'' Verbeek said.
</P>
<P>
   On the curse of ``The Joe,'' that is.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the 13th of all days.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 1-17-2 in their previous 20 trips to Detroit,
including 0-6 in two playoff series. They have seen shots bounce
off posts, 3-0 leads evaporate, goalie Ed Belfour chop down Martin
Lapointe with a Jason-like slash to the groin, and former goalie
Darcy Wakaluk go one better by breaking his hand on a thick metal
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect, if we're going to go there and beat this thing
it might as well be on Friday the 13th,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek, who had a touch of the flu yesterday and missed
practice, said he expects to play. Maybe he needs the blessing of
Sister Elaine more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a better connection to the big guy than I do,'' he
said. ``I figure it shouldn't be that big of a deal, we can do it
in the tunnels down before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a small exorcism shouldn't be too tough.''
</P>
<P>
   If a nun from the past can't get it done, maybe the Stars'
litany of superstitions will. Guy Carbonneau assures he will dress
from the left side to the right, as he always does, and spit on the
center faceoff dot during the pregame skate. Defenseman Darryl
Sydor will dress from the right to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek, who once dunked his sticks in the toilet and gave them
a speech on proper offensive behavior, said he has a few
superstitions. ``But nothing I'd want to talk about,'' he assured.
</P>
<P>
   After all, talking about superstitions is bad luck, the players
warn.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the team is trying to take Ludwig's point of view into
the important meeting with the Wings, one of only two times this
season the Stars will be able to face the jinx at The Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's big,'' Ludwig said of tonight's game. ``We
haven't done anything up there for a long time and that's probably
a place we have to go through to get to where we want to go. I
think it's more the team than the building or a jinx or anything,
but either way, we need to win up there. We need to put this in the
past.''

USC A WINNER IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has dismissed
nearly all of a lawsuit brought against USC by a former tutor
supervisor, who alleged impropriety within the school's Student
Athlete Academic Services department.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five charges in the lawsuit filed by Dr. Christopher
Cairney, the former director of tutoring services, were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Cairney sued USC last May, alleging breach of contract, wrongful
termination, fraud, defamation and intentional infliction of
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   His allegations drew widespread publicity last season, and the
university's subsequent investigation often overshadowed the
Trojans' on-field performance.
</P>
<P>
   Every claim but ``breach of contract'' was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really stripped his claim,'' said Cairney's attorney,
Anthony Gordon. ``We believe the judge was wrong. He completely
emasculated the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Cairney has little hope of recovering damages under the breach
of contract claim, since punitive awards are usually minimal in
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Cairney was fired by USC last spring, after a lengthy
investigation considered his claims of impropriety regarding tutors
and athletes. Instead, USC said Cairney ``engaged in academic fraud
and lied repeatedly to the investigating committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with the judge's decision. It vindicates what
we've been saying all along,'' said USC interim general counsel
Todd Dickey. ``The allegations brought by Dr. Cairney have no basis
in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Cairney intends to appeal the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne makes the cut: Linebacker Chris Claiborne was named
one of three finalists for the Butkus Award on Thursday, which
honors the nation's top linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The other two finalists were Dat Nguyen of Texas A&AMP;M and Jevon
Kearse of Florida. Claiborne has 88 tackles, five sacks and four
interceptions this season. Kearse has 46 tackles, 7.5 sacks and one
interception. Nguyen has 101 tackles, two sacks and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out Wednesday and couldn't tell anyone. That was kind
of eating me,'' Claiborne said. ``The (No.) 55's before me have
never won the award. That definitely makes it special.''
</P>
<P>
   No USC player has ever won the award, and Claiborne was
referring to his predecessors that wore No.55 _ Willie McGinest and
Junior Seau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also makes it special to represent the Pac-10,'' Claiborne
added. ``But it's about winning games right now.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit to being a finalist is that Claiborne earns a free
trip to Orlando on Dec. 11 for the awards ceremony. There he will
visit his best friend and former teammate, Brian Kelly, who now
plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get to show what he can do, and we're going to
show what we can do in the next two games,'' said USC coach Paul
Hackett. ``He's the impetus of our defense. You figure with all the
great players to be here, the opportunity for him to be a finalist
is really fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout-team scrimmage: USC ended practice with a scrimmage
between the scout-team offense and defense. Among the stars were
former Notre Dame wide receiver Troy Garner, Alemany tailback
Miguel Fletcher and Muir tailback Sultan McCullough, who all had
long gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fun part,'' Hackett said. ``Just letting the guys
go out there (and play).''
</P>
<P>
   Two days off: USC will take Friday and Saturday off, then resume
practicing Sunday.

MANHATTAN MIRACLE: KANSAS STATE TRANSFORMED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Kansas State coach Bill Snyder has created one
of college sports' most amazing turnaround stories.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Kansas State plays the biggest game in school history
against No. 11 Nebraska, the hated Visigoths from the North. The
Wildcats (9-0) are ranked No. 2 in The Associated Press and have
won 17 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   That Kansas State is in this position, playing a November game
with conference and national-championship significance, is the
culmination of a steady building process that started 10 years ago
under Snyder's intense focus and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly amazing what Bill Snyder has accomplished with
that program,'' said Iowa coach Hayden Fry, who, when he was at
North Texas in 1976, hired Snyder as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think something like this would be possible,''
said athletic director Max Urick, who in 1993 moved from Iowa State
to Kansas State. ``Ten years ago, you looked at Kansas State on the
schedule and it was a W.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Kansas State needed an exorcist, not a football
coach. The Wildcats were Mildcats with the worst all-time winning
percentage in Division I-A. Kansas State also was in the top five
in terms of shabby facilities, shoestring budget and general
apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for a competitive football team that could win
on a given Saturday,'' Kansas State President Jon Wefald said of
those days. ``Most fans would have considered 5-6, 6-5, an
occasional 7-4 would be the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   After considerable questioning and negotiating convinced him the
school was serious about its commitment, Bill Snyder, Iowa's
offensive coordinator, agreed to take the job. The date was Nov.
30, 1988. Few considered the possibility that college football was
about to spin on its axis.
Detailed planning
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was 49 years old, a career assistant coach, when he
decided to accept Kansas State's offer. The blueprint didn't
include national-championship aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a period of time we'd get better individually, then
collectively,'' he said of his goals. ``It would be built on firm
ground and it would be a gradual ascent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Las Vegas, we didn't just rise out of the sand all
of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder agreed to take the job only if needed improvements would
be made. In the first years of the Snyder Era, about $15 million
was spent in facility improvements _ weight room, meeting rooms,
new practice facility, new press box.
</P>
<P>
   And as the construction took place, Snyder tried to change
Kansas State's self-image. Eliminate the losing mind-set, don't
accept defeat. Then what? Improve each day. Build self-esteem,
treat everyone with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He preaches all the classic values,'' Urick said. ``His
consistency permeates the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, like most coaches, works long hours. But most coaches
haven't researched the topic of ``Living Without Sleep.'' He
exercises on a treadmill that is strategically placed in his office
so that he can watch film while he sweats. He puts in 16-hour days
_ in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's daily ``To Do'' list is not limited to football
strategy and tactics. The Kansas State football program answers to
one man: Bill Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The school's ``Powercat'' logo? Commissioned and approved by
Snyder. Pregame meals? Snyder checks to make sure each place
setting has two pats of butter, not communal bowls of butter.
(Can't win with fat players, ya know.) The football media guide?
Edited and approved by Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's practices are closed (the barbed wire on the
fence around the practice field underlines the message). Media
access to the players is limited. Injury information is guarded
like the Colonel's fried-chicken recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is for the player,'' Snyder said to explain his
injury policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we explain exactly where he's hurt, say how much he's
practiced, what percent he's performing at, say we're going to tape
him up. We do that, we're just putting a target on that player for
the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to roll your eyes over Snyder's ``concern''. But
consider this tidbit. When Snyder took the job a decade ago, one of
the first meetings he had was with the departing seniors, players
who would never play a down for him. Some of those players say they
get misty-eyed when they recall that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's involved with everything because he's concerned,'' Urick
said. ``It's not a personality flaw or quirk. It's not megalomania.
It's all about helping the team succeed.''
Lifelong philosophy
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in St. Joseph, Mo., Snyder's early passion was
swimming. The stroke, stroke, stroke relentless nature of that
pursuit drilled home the lesson of dogged determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under the assumption that it's been there all my life,''
he said of his get-it-done resolve. ``I can't remember a time when
I realized that was the best way to go about things. Having the
one-day-a-time philosophy has been valuable here. I know it sounds
corny.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, after Kansas State played in the Copper Bowl,
its second bowl game ever, a book was published called ``The
Greatest Turnaround in College Sports''. Most coaches would have
been satisfied. The goal of being respectable had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing what leaders should do, try to make everyone
better, not make everyone better so he gets more accolades,'' said
Stan Weber, a Kansas State quarterback in the pre-Snyder era who is
now the team's radio analyst. ``He says work hard, get better. Most
people say that, but what they eventually want is more money, more
time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so much more idealistic than that. There's no destination
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And no desire to complete the Great American Dream with a trip
down Fame Avenue. You won't see Snyder doing commercials for Burger
King or in promotional spots for ESPN's college football coverage.
Snyder says he cherishes ``anything other than notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the few coaches who would rather not get the
attention,'' Wefald said. ``He just wants to be known as a good
football coach who accomplished something pretty incredible.''
Persistence pays off
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State supporters are a bit defensive of their new-found
football success. The criticism stings them more, the praise
doesn't seem as glowing. The $13 million, 7,000-seat stadium
expansion next summer? Word is it would be bigger, but there is
worry that the dream will end with a thud of reality.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the glory of the moment casts an intoxicating glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great story of a team right at the bottom rising from
the ashes like a phoenix,'' Wefald said. ``It's an example of hope.
If Kansas State can go from the outhouse to the top five, it proves
dreams can come true if you just work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most coaches, Snyder has a collection of inspirational
messages. For his desk at Kansas State, he chose this quote from
Calvin Coolidge:
</P>
<P>
   ``''Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.
Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with
talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.
Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.
Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan
`Press on' has solved and always will solve the problems of the
human race.''''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand what persistence is all about,'' Snyder
said. ``That was part of being at Kansas State. Persistence had to
be the order of the day. Without it I would be selling insurance
right now and I despise selling insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Bill Snyder concluded the interview and was off
to tend to his football program.

STEPHEN DUGGAN, 89, ENVIRONMENTALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Pierce Duggan, the founding chairman of the Natural
Resources Defense Council and a leader in the fight that preserved
the scenic Storm King Mountain from development, died Nov. 18 at
Cornwall Hospital in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y. A longtime Cornwall
resident, he was 89 and formerly lived in Manhattan as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Storm King, a landmark towering over the Hudson
River, was an important event in establishing modern environmental
law. Duggan's role in pulling together money and influence for that
effort eventually led him to help establish the Natural Resources
Defense Council, one of the most influential environmental advocacy
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, air-conditioning and other large home appliances
were proliferating in the New York City area. To meet the surging
demand for electricity, Consolidated Edison Co. moved to build a
power plant in Orange County, on the Hudson River and the mountain
towering over it, famous as a subject for 19th-century writers and
the painters of the Hudson River School.
</P>
<P>
   The project, announced by the utility in 1963, would have carved
trenches for pumped storage pipelines up the mountainside. Still,
most people in the area accepted the plan because it meant jobs and
an improvement in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Duggan, a litigator at the big Wall Street law firm Simpson,
Thacher &AMP; Bartlett, and his wife, Beatrice Abbott Duggan, set out
to rally those who objected to the project. At first, few
responded, even though the plant imperiled a striped-bass spawning
area and Black Rock Forest, the nature preserve atop Storm King.
</P>
<P>
   Then the power company published a drawing that exaggerated the
size of the project relative to its surroundings. The Duggans'
telephone began to ring and soon they and other irate landowners
signed on hikers' groups and conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   The objectors organized the Scenic Hudson Preservation
Conference and took their case to public hearings. In 1965, they
won a federal court ruling that was a legal landmark: For the first
time, a conservation group got the right to sue in the public
interest and to be heard on license applications from utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison continued the battle but eventually abandoned the
project years later. And Duggan emerged from the fight sure of the
need for a permanent, national environmental organization to tackle
such issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he, his wife and several others formed the Natural
Resources Defense Council to marshal the law and research for
environmental cases. As chairman for a decade, he led the council
into such diverse areas as the Alaskan wilderness, the health of
steelworkers, survival of the golden eagle, energy efficiency,
chemical pollution and public health in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he and his wife brought the council's experience to
bear on environmental work on an international scale. At his death,
he remained a trustee of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   A native of White Plains, N.Y., Stephen Duggan graduated from
Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College. He earned an M.A. at
Columbia University in 1932 and an L.L.B. from its law school in
1936, and went into practice as a litigator in New York. He joined
Simpson, Thacher &AMP; Bartlett in 1943, rose to senior partner and
retired as head of its trust and estates department in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He was a longtime director of the Institute for International
Education, which his father founded. At various times he also
served on the boards of Phillips Exeter, Storm King School, the
Collegiate School, Vassar College, the New School for Social
Research, the Walter Reade Foundation and Scenic Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1996. He is survived by three sons, Stephen P.
III of Cornwall, Peter M. of Charlotte, N.C., and Hayden A. of
Gardner, Mass.; a daughter, Marianne Bell O'Brien of Jersey City;
12 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

IN NEW YORK, DEATH RATE FROM BYPASS SURGERY REDUCED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state hospitals have achieved the lowest
death rate for coronary artery bypass surgery in the eight years
that state officials have been monitoring the procedure, a
high-risk form of open-heart surgery in which a machine temporarily
takes over the functions of the patient's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 32 hospitals statewide allowed to perform cardiac
surgery, the average death rate per 100 patients dropped to 2.44 in
1996, the latest year for which data are available, from 2.52 the
year before. Moreover, the rate has fallen from an average of 3.52
in 1989, which represents a decline of more than 30 percent since
then. Looked at another way, more than 97 percent of the patients
who underwent the 20,078 operations statewide in 1996 survived.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a year to collect, verify and evaluate hospital
information for the annual survey, said Wayne Osten, 49, the state
Department of Health official who directed the study. One of the
toughest tasks, he said, is coming up with statistical measurements
so that different hospitals, with patient populations that have
varying degrees of illness, can be compared fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Raske, a hospital administrator and president of the
Greater New York Hospital Association, said New York state's data
is by far the most comprehensive of any state's. ``What is striking
about the report,'' he said, ``is that the risk has dropped so
dramatically that this major surgery now looks almost mundane.''
</P>
<P>
   In coronary artery bypass graft surgery, arteries from the chest
or veins from the legs are removed and used to divert, or bypass,
blood around vessels too blocked to deliver blood efficiently to
the heart muscle. A heart-lung machine functions as the patient's
heart during surgery. The procedure is considered riskier than a
pacemaker insertion but less risky than a heart transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing hospital in the survey, for the third year
in a row, was St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center in Syracuse. In
812 bypass operations performed in 1996, seven people died, for a
raw death rate of 0.86 percent and an adjusted rate of 1.1 percent.
The adjusted rate assumes that St. Joseph's patient population
looked exactly like the statewide mix, which it did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do seemingly small things,'' said Dr. Mehdi Marvasti, St.
Joseph's director of cardiac surgery. For example, if a patient has
had a stroke, a stroke specialist examines him before the operation
to reduce the probability that he will have another stroke
following, or even during, surgery, Marvasti said.
</P>
<P>
   After the operation, St. Joseph's four senior cardiac surgeons
do their hospital rounds together so that all know something about
every cardiac patient, Marvasti said. ``If I miss something, then
another doctor might see it,'' he said. ``It's three additional
pairs of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst-performing hospital was Arnot Ogden Medical Center in
Elmira. Six patients out of 135 cases in 1996 died, giving the
hospital a raw death rate of 4.44 percent and an adjusted rate of
5.93 percent. ``Our small number of cases plays havoc with the
statistics,'' said Anthony Cooper, president of Arnot Ogden. ``Just
to give you one example, one patient was operated on in 1995 but
died in 1996. If he had died in 1995, our score would have improved
by 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account the different numbers of operations
performed and different patient populations, 29 of the 32 hospitals
have broadly similar death rates within a statistically significant
margin of error. Three _ St. Luke's-Roosevelt, St. Vincent's and
Lenox Hill, all in Manhattan _ were beyond that margin but not by a
large degree.

GRAF GAINS SPOT AT CHASE CHAMPIONSHIPS; AILING WILLIAMS IS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Circumstances took players in opposite directions
Thursday; Steffi Graf was jubilant about her 11th-hour
qualification for the year-ending Chase Championships next week at
Madison Square Garden in New York, while fifth-ranked Venus
Williams reluctantly withdrew from the tournament just before the
draw was unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   For the 18-year-old Williams, whose tendinitis in her left knee
has become as chronic as it is premature, the setback meant the
postponement of her Chase debut for another year. Just last week,
Williams predicted that her knee trouble would not intrude on her
plans to use the Championships as prelude to her assault on the No.
1 ranking in 1999, but Thursday she recanted her optimism on that
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have been able to play the Chase this
year,'' Williams said. ``Unfortunately, it's not possible because
I'm not in the best possible condition and I wanted to be able to
give my best to the players and the fans.'' The knee flare-up is
the same problem that nearly caused Williams to scuttle her U.S.
Open campaign two months ago, but she gave no indication that she
might need surgery to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   For the surgery-prone Graf, 29, the chance to compete in her
12th Championships was both therapeutic and redemptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to save a not-so-great year,'' she said between
singles assignments here at the Advanta Championships, a key Chase
tuneup where the field includes top-ranked Lindsay Davenport, the
U.S. Open champion, and second-ranked Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's bid to join the Chase field was enhanced once Williams
withdrew, which left vacancies in two of the 16 slots. When Monica
Seles' 6-3, 7-5 victory over Ai Sugiyama on Thursday afternoon
knocked Sugiyama from Chase contention, Graf and Irina Spirlea were
guaranteed the remaining berths.
</P>
<P>
   When Graf takes a 27-4 record against Jana Novotna, the
defending champion of the Chase Championships, into next week's
opening round, she won't be satisfied with simply getting there.
That's not in her nature. But she will be gratified. That's being
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Now ranked 17th, a long way from her former hold on No. 1, Graf
had found herself in the interesting position of plotting simply to
qualify for the event she had dominated as recently as 1996, when
she outlasted Hingis in a five-set finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I won Leipzig on Sunday, we started counting the points
I'd need to qualify for New York; well, I didn't actually count
them, but the others were,'' Graf said. Until last year, when she
missed the Championships while recuperating from knee surgery, the
event had been a year-ending rite of passage for the German for 11
consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get back to the Garden this year, and to do it in this way,
is a pretty big deal, even for me,'' she added.

GONZALEZ FOCUSES ON TSZYU (AND CHAVEZ) 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Gonzalez is in an interesting position. He has
unfinished business with Julio Cesar Chavez but first he has to get
past Kostya Tszyu in a World Boxing Council superlightweight (140
pounds) championship bout in Indio, Cal., on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The WBC has made Chavez the mandatory challenger for the winner
of the Gonzalez-Tsyzu bout. Gonzalez of Mexico City (43-1-1) could
take a championship into that rematch against Chavez, and have a
chance to usurp Chavez as Mexico's most popular boxer. The first
fight ended in a draw because the scorecards were added wrong.
Gonzalez should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the controversy from the last fight, I'm confused about
where I stand against him and he's confused as to where he stands
against me,'' Gonzalez said Thursday in a telephone conference
call.
</P>
<P>
   The way he talks of Chavez, it is no secret that Gonzalez, whose
only loss was to Oscar De La Hoya on Jan. 18, 1997, is passionate
about a rematch with Chavez. But Gonzalez is not foolish enough to
look past Tszyu (21-1-1), a Russian who immigrated to Sydney,
Australia in 1992 and became an Australian citizen four years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu hits hard enough to get Gonzalez's attention if it strays
to far away during the fight. Tszyu, a former International Boxing
Federation lightweight champion, knocked out Rafael Ruelas on Aug.
15 to put himself in position to face Gonzalez for the title. The
two were supposed to meet in October, but Tszyu injured his hand in
training and the fight was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be broadcast on HBO as part of its ``Boxing After
Dark'' series.
</P>
<P>
   From U.S. to Cuba, Live
</P>
<P>
   ESPN and Radio Marti have reached an agreement to broadcast a
boxing card from Miami into Cuba on Friday night. The card, which
will be shown on television as part of ESPN2's ``Friday Night
Fights'' at 8 p.m., features Cuban boxers who defected from the
island and now fight out of Miami as a group called ``Team
Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The card will be headlined by junior welterweight Diobelys
Hurtado (27-1) in a 10-round bout against Manuel Gomez (17-9).
Other Cuban defectors on the card are heavyweight Ellicer Castillo,
cruiserweight Ramon Garbey and welterweight Joel Casamayor.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time in the 13-year history of Radio Marti that
it will broadcast a live U.S. boxing show into Cuba. Radio Marti
has broadcast two other U.S. sporting events live back to Cuba:
Game 5 of the 1997 World Series with the Florida Marlins pitcher
Livan Hernandez, a Cuban defector, on the mound, and Game 3 of the
1998 World Series with Hernandez's brother, Orlando Hernandez,
pitching for the Yankees.

ANITA GULKIN, 59, GREENWICH HOUSE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anita Kurman Gulkin, president and chief executive of
Greenwich House Inc., a social-service and cultural community
organization based in Greenwich Village, died Nov. 8 at Beth Israel
Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59, lived in Springfield,
N.J., and also had an apartment in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack during hip surgery last Friday, and
she also had cancer, said Paul Racioppi, Greenwich House's chief
development officer. She went to work as usual the day before the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gulkin, a former specialist in programs for drug abusers,
became Greenwich House's executive director in 1976. Her title was
changed to president and chief executive in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The multifaceted organization has its headquarters at 27 Barrow
St., employs 250 people and also carries on its programs at seven
other sites in and near Greenwich Village. In her 22 years as its
senior salaried executive, its annual operating budget grew to
$13.5 million from $1 million or less, Racioppi said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since 1986, Ms. Gulkin set into motion new
Greenwich House programs for recovering alcoholics, other substance
abusers and people with HIV or AIDS, as well as for providing music
and fine-arts classes in public elementary schools, for treating
abused children and preventing child abuse and for serving hot
meals for elderly Greenwich Villagers to eat together.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Greenwich House's staff as a supervisor of its
programs for drug abusers in 1968 and was made director of its
substance abuse clinics in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she was also active in other Manhattan
social-service organizations. At her death, she was chairwoman of
Caring Community, which administers programs for the elderly,
mainly in Greenwich Village, and the West Side Association of
Community Centers. She was also a co-founder and a former member of
the board of what is now called Urban Pathways.
</P>
<P>
   She was inducted into Greenwich Village's Hall of Fame and
received the United Way's Big Apple Award.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Newark, N.J., she received a bachelor's degree from
Pennsylvania State University and later studied social work at
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Sam Gulkin; a brother, Dr.
Martin Kurman of Manhattan, and a sister, Bernice Winarsky of
Springfield.

BOBO LEWIS, 72, STAGE AND SCREEN ACTRESS  
 TIM GREATHOUSE, 48, ART DEALER AND ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., W.Va., Pa.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Bobo Lewis, a screen and stage actress who performed
with the Circle Repertory Company for 25 years, died on Friday at
New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
 &HT;    The cause was cancer, said her cousin, Susan Lera of Miami.
 &HT;    In a 1987 interview in The New York Times, Ms. Lewis, who was
born in Miami, joked that as a newborn in the delivery room she had
asked, ``Which way is New York?'' She moved to New York as a
teen-ager and changed her given name, Barbara, because Actor's
Equity had another actress by that name.
 &HT;    She took acting classes and eventually, in 1978, won a Drama
Desk Award for her performance as the teacher in the original
Broadway production of ``Working,'' which was adapted from Studs
Terkel's book. Among her other Broadway credits were ``42nd
Street,'' ``Twigs,'' a revival of ``The Women,'' ``Lorelei,'' ``On
the 20th Century'' and ``The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940'' in a
role written for her by John Bishop.
 &HT;    She toured nationally in Robert Patrick's ``Kennedy's Children''
and Neil Simon's ``God's Favorite,'' and with Ben Bagley's revue,
``The Decline and Fall of the Entire World as Seen Through the Eyes
of Cole Porter.''
 &HT;    As a member of Circle Repertory Company, she appeared in E.E.
Cummings' ``Him'' with Lanford Wilson in the title role. Her
favorite roles were in Milan Stitt's ``Runner Stumbles,'' opposite
William Hurt, and Jim Leonard's ``Diviners,'' which toured Asia.
 &HT;    Last year she was nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Award for her
performance as Stella in ``Light Up the Sky'' at Chicago's Goodman
Theater. She played a variety of Shakespearean roles at resident
theaters across the country, including the Rhode Island Shakespeare
Festival, the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival and the Seattle
Repertory.
 &HT;    Her film credits include ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World''; ``Le
Sauvage'' with Catherine Deneuve and Yves Montand; ``The Paper'';
``The Wild Party''; ``Running on Empty''; and most recently, ``One
True Thing.'' She was a frequent guest on the television series
``That Girl'' and ``Bewitched,'' in which she played Agnes
Moorehead's sister. Young viewers knew her as Midge Smoot on the
PBS children's television show ``Shining Time Station.''

   NEW YORK _ Tim Greathouse, a leading figure of the East Village
art scene of the 1980s, died on Oct. 18 at his home in Manhattan.
He was 48.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was AIDS-related complications, said Kathe Burkhart, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Greathouse first showed his own photographs, many documenting
life on the Lower East Side, at Gracie Mansion Gallery in 1982 and
soon afterward published ``Who's Who in Lower Manhattan,'' a book
of portraits of art-world personalities.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his own gallery, Oggi Domani, in a storefront on East
11th Street in 1984. In 1986 he moved to a larger space nearby,
renamed the gallery T. Greathouse and showed painting, sculpture
and conceptual art there as well as photography. Artists to whom he
gave first or early shows include Ms. Burkhart, Anne Messner,
Andrew Masullo, Zoe Leonard, Peter Hujar, Jimmy de Sana and Hope
Sandrow.
</P>
<P>
   Greathouse closed his gallery in 1988 when the East Village boom
ended, and worked as an art consultant and graphic designer.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Jay Katz of Manhattan; his
mother, Elsie Greathouse of New Manchester, W.Va., and a brother,
Mark, of Pittsburgh.

ISLES' FORGOTTEN SNIPER SUDDENLY FINDS HIS RANGE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In his first two seasons with the New York
Islanders, Mariusz Czerkawski has grossly underachieved. He
possesses the skills of an elite sniper, but hasn't showed off
those skills often enough.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, for the first and second times this season,
Czerkawski actually had something to show for his efforts. He
scored twice as the Islanders trounced the Montreal Canadiens, 4-0,
before 11,470 fans at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who have a share of the Atlantic Division lead,
improved to 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Thursday night's game, Czerkawski, who was a healthy
scratch for the first time this season in the Islanders' previous
game, had no goals and three assists in 14 games. Czerkawski scored
26 goals for the Edmonton Oilers in 1996-97, but the often-benched
right wing managed only 12 with the Islanders last season, 7 of
which came in the final 12 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawksi's fine finish to the 1997-98 season led many to
believe he would return to form this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Salo, the Islanders' goalie, earned his league-leading
fourth shutout. He was outstanding in making 21 saves. Montreal
goalie Jocelyn Thibault also made 21 stops.
</P>
<P>
   For a second straight season, the Canadiens are coping with a
multitude of injuries. Thursday night, the Habs were without Saku
Koivu (strained abdominal muscle), Scott Thornton (torn abdominal
muscle), Vladimir Malakhov (back spasms) and Craig Rivet (sprained
shoulder). Koivu, the best of the injured Montreal players, missed
his seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders dominated the first period, but scored only once.
Barry Richter, a defenseman, backhanded the puck over Thibault's
shoulder at 18 minutes 35 seconds to give the Islanders a 1-0 lead.
It was Richter's first goal of the season. Ted Donato, the newest
Islander, tallied his first point as an Islander in getting an
assist.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, just as the Islanders' need for a
top-notch scorer was becoming painfully evident, their forgotten
sniper, Czerkawski, scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawski's first goal was a beautiful display of what talent
this natural goal scorer possesses. With a burst of speed at center
ice, he left everyone behind. Czerkawski, who was playing on a line
with the rookie Mike Watt and Sergei Nemchinov, split the
Canadiens' defense, skated around Igor Ulanov, then rifled the puck
over Thibault's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawski scored his second goal on the power play at 8:56. He
jammed the puck between the post and Thibault's skate with a
backhander. Claude Lapointe set up the score with a nifty centering
pass.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening seconds of the third period, Robert Reichel
swatted the puck off the stick of the Canadiens' Patrice Brisbois
and into the Montreal goal, getting his fourth goal of the season.

 &HT;    Tower reopening to be costly
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The observation deck at the University of Texas
Tower, one of Austin's most famous but least-used attractions, will
open to the public after 24 years of being off limits, UT System
regents agreed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for people to have a positive experience with
the Tower and not have the Tower's history frozen with the negative
events of the past,'' said UT President Larry Faulkner, who,
prompted by students, asked regents to reopen it.
</P>
<P>
   Former regents closed the deck, which provides a panaroma of the
city's landscape, indefinitely Jan. 31, 1975, because of suicides.
It had been closed temporarily in the 1950s, also because of fatal
leaps, and again after the Aug. 1, 1966, sniper shootings by
Charles Whitman. He killed 14 people from his perch, 231 feet above
the ground, and wounded another 31 before police killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said he hoped to reopen the deck by graduation in May,
after iron barriers are installed to prevent suicides and
renovations are done so it is accessible to people with
disabilities. He estimated remodeling costs at $450,000 to $500,000
and annual operating costs at $86,000 .
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said he hopes to raise most of the money from donations
and recoup annual costs by charging visitors $5 or $6. Regents
asked that he keep the fees low and possibly free for current
students.
</P>
<P>
   The deck is to be open on weekends, but that could be expanded
to include late hours on week nights, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   Most students interviewed were delighted by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tower is an icon,'' said Monica Lopez, a fifth-year
English and speech major. ``To deprive students of that opportunity
isn't right. At least now I have the chance to go up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Knight, a junior majoring in government, applauded the
decision. ``The negative perception of the Tower will only continue
otherwise,'' he s

NORTHRIDGE'S BRADY HOPES TO REGAIN HIS AIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ The start to Marcus Brady's career was so
surreal there was no way it could continue without interruption
through the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, a redshirt freshman, is learning such now. Though he's
thrown 18 touchdowns, Brady also has nine interceptions and hasn't
played particularly well lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I feel the pressure a little bit, especially as the
season winds down,'' Brady said after Thursday's practice. ``We
started off winning, then we lost two games, but now we have
another shot at the conference title and the playoffs and I don't
want to mess it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, Brady's accuracy was uncanny _ whether it
was on the timing patterns, crossing routes or deep balls. But in
last week's win against Portland State, Brady underthrew two deep
balls that were intercepted and missed several reads. And prior to
a solid effort at Weber State, Brady threw three second-half
interceptions in a loss to Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be thinking too much lately,'' said Brady, who is 193
for 292 and 2,196 yards. ``I'm usually at my best when I'm
scrambling around and getting out of the pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicking game: Senior place-kicker Manny Marquez tested his sore
leg at the end of practice and was ineffective, so special teams
coach Jeff Kearin said sophomore punter Ethan Beck will handle all
the kicking duties Saturday at Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been awhile since I've done it, and what you really
notice is the timing. It's all off,'' said Beck, a product of
Highland High. ``I just want to make the extra points and I think
maybe they'll have me try field goals from 35 yards or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosting bid in: CSUN might have another home game after all.
Matadors coach Ron Ponciano said the school put in a bid to host a
first-round game in the Division I-AA playoffs _ providing the
Matadors qualify. And the chances for a home game appear
likely.``We were told by (Big Sky commissioner) Doug Fullerton that
if we win the next two games, he could almost guarantee us we'll
get to host a game,'' Ponciano said. ``I think that would be
neat.''
</P>
<P>
   A school hosting a first-round game must guarantee $30,000 to
the NCAA. CSUN would have to sell approximately 3,000 tickets to
reach that figure. The Matadors averaged 4,482 for five home games.
</P>
<P>
   Future schedules: CSUN remains optimistic it can get out of next
year's game at Southern Utah, which leaves only one open slot on
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But a change in Big Sky philosophy will also aid conference
teams readying for the playoffs. Beginning in 2000, the Big Sky
will end its conference season by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   First downs: Ponciano said he didn't hear from doctors so
linebacker Cos Abercrombie (broken jaw) won't make the trip....
Nose guard Sean Beard limps noticeably and won't travel.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Modern-age baseball has been marked by increased salaries, and with
that comes increased involvement by the people who sign the checks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things are no different in Houston, where Astros owner Drayton
McLane Jr. has taken a larger role in contract negotiations and
player acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did McLane accompany general manager Gerry Hunsicker to
Arizona two weeks ago when the Astros made their three-year, $33
million offer to Randy Johnson, the owner also has been in constant
contact with Ken Caminiti, who should be an Astro sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are a little bit higher now,'' McLane said. ``In
situations like this, I tend to get involved. I was very involved
when we signed Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio to their big
contracts, and I was involved in the negotiations with Darryl Kile
last year. These are high-profile and very complex situations with
Randy and Ken.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker triggered the Astros' initial interest in Caminiti
through the player's agent, but it has become a four-way
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going around the horn,'' McLane said. ``Gerry has
been talking to Ken's agent, and I've been talking to Ken, who
called me initially because he knew me and hadn't known Gerry. If
we could all get into one room, I believe we will work something
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been slightly out of control because we've all been in
different places. Gerry's in (Naples) Florida at the general
managers meetings, I've been out of town, and Ken's agent hasn't
been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been all out of sync logistically, but we'll get
together. Ken really wants to play for the Astros, and we'd like to
have him. The fans of Houston have always admired and appreciated
the way he plays the game, and so do we.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have offered Caminiti a deal that could net the
35-year-old third baseman $10.5 million over the next three
seasons, but Caminiti hopes to get a little more. McLane said the
two sides are not far apart and will meet _ and possibly reach an
agreement _ over the weekend or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who has said he would sign with the Astros for less
than market value, turned down a three-year, $21.5 million offer
from Detroit to concentrate on hammering out an agreement with the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to adjust our offer to reach a level that,
hopefully, he will agree to,'' McLane said. ``The Detroit offer was
totally out of line; hopefully, we can get back in line. I really
think we can get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors continue around the majors that Toronto is shopping
four-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, who has made no
secret of his interest in playing for the Astros should a trade
occur.
</P>
<P>
   McLane acknowledged the Astros' interest in Clemens, and
Hunsicker met with Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash in Naples,
although the Astros' GM declined to discuss specifics of their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 36, will be at least $3 million cheaper than Johnson,
but he won't come cheap in terms of the type of package it would
take to fetch him from Toronto in a trade. The Blue Jays are
expected to command at least three front-line players and/or
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros explored the possibility of trading for Clemens
before they acquired Johnson on July 31, but they determined the
Blue Jays' asking price to be too high. The Astros' primary focus
continues to be on re-signing Johnson, who isn't expected to decide
on one of the seven teams pursuing him until the end of the month.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Even with all the touchdowns, all the rushing yards, the
blocking, the receptions _ even the occasional tackle after a Texas
turnover _ Ricky Williams' greatest moment might have come last
week in the Longhorns' halftime locker room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing Oklahoma State's nine-man defensive front, Texas had
little choice but to rely on its passing game Saturday. The result
was a season-high 40 passing attempts for quarterback Major
Applewhite and a season-low 23 carries for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That's no way to break Tony Dorsett's career rushing record, and
it's no way to win the Heisman Trophy. And Texas coach Mack Brown
knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're sitting there at halftime and he's got 31 yards and
we haven't handed it to him many times, (the coaches) were
sensitive about it,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   So sensitive were they that assistant coach Bruce Chambers was
dispatched to talk to Williams in the locker room at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a waste of time. Williams told Chambers that
he was having fun blocking and catching passes and that ``winning
is bigger than my stats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things I've seen him do, that may be the most
impressive,'' Brown said. ``Because I don't know that I've coached
too many guys that wouldn't have pouted. And if he had pouted and
been a problem, we would have probably handed it to him in the
second half, because we were in trouble. He could have put us in a
real bind.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no such trouble from Williams. He waited patiently
until the Longhorns' final drive, when his turn finally came. He
carried the ball six times for 49 yards, more than half his total,
to help set up the game-winning field goal in a 37-34 Texas
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was time to run then,'' Williams said. ``We needed
to do it to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the real Ricky Williams _ or, to be more accurate, the
real Errick Williams. Everyone just calls him Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   By whatever name, Texas' 6-foot, rock-solid 225-pound senior
tailback is a complete football player who makes everyone around
him better as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great hands (and) he can block as well as anybody in
the country,'' Brown said. ``He's the best football player I've
ever seen because of his versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, the Longhorns' freshman quarterback, is on a
school-record pace for passing yards entering Saturday's game
against Texas Tech in large part because of Williams' presence as a
running threat.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams also is third on the team in receptions with 18
catches for 220 yards, including a season-longest 48-yard touchdown
against Oklahoma State. And this is for the top-rated pass offense
in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grades his receiving ability as A-minus, higher than he
rates his speed (B-plus), blocking (B) and elusiveness (B-minus).
The only element of his game he rates higher is his power (A-plus).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of pride in catching the ball, and I don't accept
dropping the ball,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most important factor in Applewhite's survival behind
center is Williams' ability to adapt to the variety of blitzes
Texas has seen this season. Eight defenders regularly charge the
Texas backfield, often leaving Williams as the key blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a running back to be a great running back, he has to be
able to run the ball, obviously, and help out in the passing game
with his catches, but also he needs to be a great blocker, and
Ricky is,'' Applewhite said. ``I think he's overshadowed by all the
things he does when he has the ball. People don't pay a lot of
attention it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our scheme of blocking, the offensive linemen are
responsible for the four down linemen and maybe the middle backer,
but usually we'll have somebody matched up with Ricky that he needs
to block. I'm glad to have him back there to save my tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams seems to like nothing more than going to battle without
the ball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole game is predicated on being well-rounded,'' Williams
said. ``I can do a lot of different things, and if I couldn't it
would kill me because I like to be in the mix of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not have to worry about that. He is the center of
attention _ from both teams' view _ every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal to see what Ricky's been able to accomplish
when everybody in this league is trying to kill him, every play,''
Brown said. ``He's tough or he couldn't go out there and put up
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams does more than put up with it; he thrives on it, and he
breaks a record almost every game. He has tied or set 10 NCAA and
41 school marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching history every time he touches the football,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams rushes for 204 yards this week, he would break
Dorsett's NCAA career rushing mark of 6,082 yards. With a
touchdown, Williams would break the record for games with a TD
(31).
</P>
<P>
   Williams leads the country in rushing (1,724 yards) and scoring
(26 TDs) and has gained more yards on the ground than 85 Division
I-A teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   His passing skills, however, are another matter. Williams has
not completed a pass since Nov. 1, 1997 _ a span of 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Williams covered the wounded duck he threw that fell incomplete
against Nebraska with a claim that, ``The receiver was covered, so
I was throwing it away.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is sticking to that story.
</P>
<P>
   His next offering, another imitation of a dying fowl in Texas'
win over Oklahoma State to a not-so-wide-open Derek Lewis (there
were three defenders in the vicinity), was intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   So there is something the man cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he does everything else so well, the Longhorns are
willing to let his Garo Yepremian-like throwing arm slide.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LUBBOCK _ The college football world knows him as ``the other Ricky
Williams.'' Texas Tech teammates know the fleet tailback as a
practical joker who warrants keeping an eye on.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject of this attention is a constantly talking,
smooth-running, prank-playing, humble guy who couldn't care less
that for now, at least, he isn't considered ``The Man,'' piling up
yardage in record-breaking fashion out of the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders' slashing sophomore sensation is also confident.
Listen to him explain Ricky Williams vs. Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always in the spotlight,'' Tech's leading rusher said of
his namesake at the University of Texas. ``He's a great running
back, and he's going to continue to be a great running back in the
pros, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just doing my job. I want to be the person they look at,
the Ricky Williams that's going to help out this Texas Tech team,
help them get as far as they can get. But otherwise, I don't look
at myself as `the other Ricky Williams,' anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I always try to take everything and look at it in a
positive way. He (Texas' Williams) kind of helped me make a name
for myself also. My name's Ricky Williams; his name's Ricky
Williams. The only thing I had to do was produce on the field, try
to make a name for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to compare us. It's just a situation I'm going to
have to deal with until he leaves. He'll be gone next year, and
hopefully I can just keep my name going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Ricky,'' as UT's star is called, will carry along a passel
of NCAA records when he completes his eligibility. Though ``Little
Ricky'' might not have Heisman-like numbers, he chews up a good bit
of acreage.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-7 and 182 pounds, Williams' boyish good looks give little
hint of his inner strength, drive and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know that I'm just an ordinary guy,''
Williams said. ``I'm a person most people think would just go into
the locker room, get in there, handle my business, practice, then
go home and study.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm totally the opposite. I practice. I study. But I'm
always joking around with the big guys, pulling their pants down,
unbuckling their shoulder pads, messing with them in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real active, real interactive with the players on the
team. I'm talkative. I talk with them and joke with them. That's
just the way I am.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reserve running back Rickey Hunter, no one loves a
practical joke more than Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite thing is to rest a bucket of water against
someone's door,'' Hunter said. ``Then, he'll knock on the door. And
when they open it, water goes all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a 1997 graduate of Duncanville High School, where,
in addition to football, he played basketball and ran track. As a
senior, he gained 1,669 yards on 200 carries and was one of the
most recruited running backs in the state. Part of the reason he
chose Tech was to stay near his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very close family,'' Williams said. ``I have an older
brother and my father and mother (Richard and Diane Williams). They
come to all my games. My mother hasn't missed a game since I played
pee-wee ball. I've got a real good family; they're very
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   But that often stresses Diane Williams, watching her son take
his lumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look in the stands, you'll see her standing up, or
somewhere back up there with her hands to her head, worrying about
something,'' Williams said. ``I got hurt last week; she was real
concerned. She's kind of gotten used to it, because that's the name
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has become Williams' family away from home. The two have
been inseparable since Williams was a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a younger brother who thinks he's the oldest,'' said
Hunter, a redshirt sophomore. ``He thinks he knows more than the
next guy. But he's a good fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Williams to adjust to college football.
He endeared himself to Raiders fans last year by surpassing Byron
Hanspard's school freshman single-season rushing record, carrying
201 times for 894 yards. His best day was against Kansas when he
ran for 179 yards on 33 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was the leading freshman ground-gainer in the Big 12
(sixth overall) and ranked seventh in all-purpose yardage for the
season. Through nine games this year, Williams has carried 249
times for 1,315 yards and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago in a 28-26 loss to Missouri, he sprained his
ankle. Tech had an open date last week, so he has had time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle's fine now,'' Williams said. ``I'm going to play
Saturday. I'll be there for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wouldn't mind taking a shot at the NFL eventually but
won't be heartbroken if it doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take that step by step,'' Williams, 20, said. ``I leave that
in God's hands. If he lets me find it to that next level, lets me
do my best, then I'll go on with that and the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders (6-3, 3-3 in the Big 12 South) have high hopes for a
bowl berth. But Williams isn't looking beyond Saturday, the
next-to-last game of the season, and matching talents again with
UT's Williams. Last year in Austin, Tech's Williams ran for 133
yards _ 43 more than the fellow in burnt orange _ and the Raiders
won 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they've been comparing us so much to where a
lot of people and my teammates want to see me outgain him,''
Williams said. ``I guess it is a little extra motivation. I do want
to outperform him, since it's turned into a game, a big
competition. I would like to come out on top. And I'd really like
for the team to get a win again.''

FAA ORDERS AIRLINES TO CHECK MD-11 COCKPIT SWITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday
abruptly ordered airlines that fly MD-11s to inspect two cockpit
switches because one model in wide use can give off smoke at
certain settings.
</P>
<P>
   But such switches did not cause the crash of the MD-11 being
flown as Swissair Flight 111 on Sept. 2, aviation authorities said,
because the cockpit switches in that plane had already been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Swissair crash, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, the FAA has
been reviewing trouble reports on the plane and recommendations
from the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas; its action Thursday was
to make one of those recommendations mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The switches are dimmer switches for cockpit instruments. ``The
real safety issue is not fire, it's smoke in the cockpit,'' said
FAA spokesman Les Dorr. He added that Thursday's order was
``typical of several hundred'' that are issued each year, and was
not considered a major safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said the cost to the industry would be about $60 a
plane. The order covers the 65 MD-11s registered in this country
but not the 109 others around the world _ including Swissair's
surviving models. The agency said it did not know how many airlines
had already done the work.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the order as a final rule, but said it would
accept public comment for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the
Swissair crash, which involved smoke in the cockpit and killed all
229 people aboard.

GLENN SET FOR ANOTHER TICKER-TAPE JOURNEY UP BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-six years after giving John Glenn a
ticker-tape parade as the first American to orbit the Earth, New
York City will follow up with an encore Monday to celebrate his
recent return to space at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, announcing the event Thursday, said the
procession for Glenn and his six crewmates would start at 11 a.m.
at Hanover Square in lower Manhattan and move up Broadway, the
traditional Canyon of Heroes. The parade will end at City Hall for
a ceremony honoring the astronauts, who will be given keys to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The first ticker-tape parade in New York City was held in 1886
to commemorate the dedication of the Statue of Liberty. The parades
have been rare in recent decades, with only 11 in the city since
1970. But the ticker-tape parade Monday will be the third in just
the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was jubilant in announcing the event for the
astronauts. ``This is wonderful,'' he said. ``I think the more
ticker-tape parades I can have during the time that I'm mayor, the
more great memories I'm going to have later on. These are
absolutely astounding events.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 17, a parade for Sammy Sosa, the Chicago Cubs' home-run
slugger, was sparsely attended because it was on a Saturday, when
lower Manhattan is largely deserted.
</P>
<P>
   But a parade on Friday, Oct. 23, for the world champion New York
Yankees, drew big crowds _ though probably less than the official
police estimate of 3.5 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics of the mayor said the proliferation of parades was
evidence of illegal discrimination by his administration on whom it
allows to march in the streets and to hold rallies at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
Housing Works, an AIDS advocacy group, said police had denied the
organization permission to hold a march of up to 1,000 people on
lower Broadway _ ending with a demonstration against the mayor in
front of City Hall _ on World AIDS Day, Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutionally, the mayor cannot allow events he favors
while barring events he disfavors,'' said Norman Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which represents
Housing Works.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that while the city has raised concerns over
cost and security in denying permission to Housing Works, the big
parades for the Yankees and astronauts undercut those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor declined to estimate the cost of the Glenn parade,
which is expected to involve thousands of extra police officers and
extra sanitation crews for the cleanup. When asked last month about
the cost of the Sosa parade, Giuliani said it would cost ``a lot of
money'' but would be worthwhile because of the national publicity
it would generate for the city.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Housing Works was denied a parade permit, the
mayor said that he was not involved in making those decisions but
that all requests could not be granted.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Glenn's achievement was ``quite rare'' and
deserved a parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a grand celebration of a tremendous accomplishment
of historic proportions, both John Glenn's individual
accomplishment and the accomplishment of the entire mission,''
Giuliani said. He added, ``It will be very good for the young
people of the city, because it will focus them on the importance of
space exploration.''

BROTHERS CHARGED WITH SCHEMING TO SELL PIECES OF FAKE MOON ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf for correction identifying Glenn as a Mercury
astronaut) (af) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was advertised by a Manhattan auction house in
1995 as ``the first substantial moon rock ever available for
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be more of the backyard variety, a federal
grand jury charged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In what the authorities said was a scheme to defraud
unsuspecting buyers of millions of dollars, two brothers from
Georgia were indicted Thursday on charges of conspiring to sell
pieces of a fake moon rock that they said had been given to their
late father by Sen. John Glenn, the former Mercury astronaut, who
recently returned to space.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Brian and Ronald Trochelmann of Atlanta, had been
telling people that their father was given the rock in honor of an
invention he had made for the space program, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was also untrue, federal authorities said Thursday. The
indictment charged that Ronald Trochelmann embarked on the scheme
to sell the fake moon rock with his brother after watching a
television show in 1994 about the 25th anniversary of the Apollo
moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   The Trochelmann brothers were each charged with conspiracy and
wire fraud and could receive up to five years in prison if
convicted, said federal prosecutors in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for both men denounced the charges Thursrday, saying
that their clients had each acted in the belief that the rock was
genuine, and that they had based their view on an expert's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that it is a moon rock,'' said Paul F. Callan,
the lawyer for Ronald Trochelmann. Even if that turns out not to be
true, he said, his client will still be innocent of the charges
because he ``sincerely believed that it was moon rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, this is a case with reasonable doubt written all
over it,'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Findling, who represents Brian Trochelmann, concurred. He
said his client had acted on the basis of what his late father had
told him. To say that he perpetrated fraud because he believed in
his father and did not ``hire a private investigator to find out if
his father was a truthful and believable person,'' Findling said,
``is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said Thursday that the rock, which was
composed of a combination of dark gray, grainy and white
crystalline material, was never actually sold. The fist-sized rock
was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1995 just
before it was to be offered at auction by Phillips Son &AMP; Neale,
which the government said was unaware that there were questions
about the rock.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the auction house, Deborah Seidel, said Thursday
night that it was ``committed to protecting the integrity of the
auction process, and from the beginning we have cooperated fully
with the government on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with the space program said that of the 840 pounds
of moon rock collected by astronauts, virtually all of it was still
in government control, and that private sales should be immediately
considered suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a strong collector value to them,'' said
Gary E. Lofgren, lunar curator at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   As for Glenn, who never visited the moon, his spokesman, Jack
Sparks, said, ``John Glenn never owned any moon rock and has never
given away any moon rock.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DEAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell of Penn State never did it.
Neither did Chris Gilbert and Steve Worster at Texas, or Greg Hill
and Rodney Thomas at Texas A&AMP;M.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been accomplished only 25 times in NCAA Division I-A
history and 15 times by I-AA teams. And it's been 20 years since
the feat was achieved in the Southwestern Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Southern seniors Thomas Sieh and D.J. Bradley are on the
verge of a notable feat by rushing for more than 1,000 yards _
each.
</P>
<P>
   Many teams cannot get one runner to 1,000 yards; TSU is about to
have a matched set. Sieh needs only 20 yards to reach 1,000,
Bradley 45. Texas Southern has two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent 1,000-yard duo was Nebraska's Ahman Green
(1,698) and Scott Frost (1,016) last year.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's Billy Sims (1,762) and Jack Mildren (1,140)
accomplished it in 1971; the fabled SMU tandem of Eric Dickerson
(1,428) and Craig James (1,147) did it in 1981; and Emmett King
(1,095) and Randy Love (1,019) were twin 1,000-yard gainers for
Houston in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty sure coming into the season, as a staff, that
we were going to have at least one 1,000-yard rusher,'' said TSU
running-backs coach Kevin Mack. Mack knows something about running
the football, having gained 4,547 yards with the Cleveland Browns
from 1985-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the season has transpired and we've stalled a bit in
our passing game, we ended up getting both of them (close),'' Mack
said.
</P>
<P>
   With starting quarterback James Wilhite out for the season after
suffering a knee injury in the sixth game, the offensive emphasis
has shifted to the ground game. Sieh and Bradley each have a
200-yard game this season.
</P>
<P>
   A major plus is an experienced offensive line composed of five
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   With Harvey Harper at center, Shon Brady and Jaime Ortega at
guards and David Mason and Jason Miller at tackles, TSU is
averaging 246 rushing yards per game, No. 7 among NCAA Division
I-AA teams.
</P>
<P>
   As close as Sieh and Bradley are as friends, it seems fitting
both could go over the 1,000-yard mark in the same game. They look
like good bets to get there Saturday when the Tigers (6-3) visit
Baton Rouge, La., to take on Southern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' said Sieh, who became the school's all-time
leading rusher in TSU's last game. He has 2,710 career yards and
set the school single-game mark with 299 yards in TSU's 30-7 win
over Howard University in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I are roommates; we do things together. It feels good _
both of us are getting a shot, showing what we can do and helping
the team win,'' Sieh said. ``It shows that the offensive line is
blocking, and it shows that the coach (Bill Thomas) has confidence
in us because you see other backs in the country, they have all
these yards but they're doing it by themselves and they're getting
all these carries, where D.J. and I are splitting the carries.''
</P>
<P>
   Both play tailback. Only rarely are both in the backfield at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach puts us in the game on the plays that fit us better,''
said Bradley, who has been timed at 4.28 seconds for 40 yards but
was the lesser-known of the two entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-9, 210-pound Sieh, from Staten Island, N.Y., was coming
off a 1,012-yard junior season when he was a first-team All-SWAC
pick. Bradley ran for 425 yards on 85 carries in an
injury-curtailed junior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had 1,000 yards since I was in high school,'' said
Bradley, a 5-9, 190-pounder from Lake Worth High School in Fort
Worth. ``I wanted it (last year) but I got hurt, so I had to sit
back and watch Thomas do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in together, and we wanted to do the same thing, so I
had to play catch-up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many opponents have caught Bradley, who ran for 211 yards at
Alcorn State, including a season-longest 72-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.J.'s been kind of like the quiet little secret for us,''
said Mack. ``Last year, everybody that played us knew he could run
real fast, but they didn't see all of his abilities. We didn't have
a chance to get him in there a lot, except to spell Thomas Sieh.
This year, we tried to work him in and give both of them equal
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sieh, who has been timed by NFL scouts at 4.44 in the 40, is
more of a power runner, while Bradley is a speedster. But there has
been little difference in their performances.
</P>
<P>
   Both average 6.1 yards per carry. Each has 10 rushing
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of an explosive back,'' said Bradley, who is seeking
to become the sixth back in school history to hit 1,000 yards in a
season. ``I take off fast. I hit the holes hard, and I make a quick
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more laid back. He turns his speed on. He sits back and
reads the hole, and once he sees the hole, he explodes too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sieh and Bradley are both eyeing a career in the NFL. ``They
both are definitely hungry, and they've worked hard this year,''
said Mack, who went over the 1,000-yard mark in 1985 along with
Browns teammate Earnest Byner. ``It reminds me of the partner I had
when we both ran for 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and pushed each other. It was kind of a
competition thing. It's the same with these two. Nobody's jealous
of each other.''

 &HT;    Playoff spot on line in SIAC showdown
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Columbus, Ga., expects a crowd Saturday afternoon more
than five times bigger than the national Division II average to see
a pair of 9-1 teams battle in the Fountain City Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Albany State defeated Fort Valley State 12-7 to
finish the regular season 10-0, the attendance was 18,674. The
national average the past five years has been about 3,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a lot more interest in this game because both of
us have good teams and good records, and we're both trying to make
it to the playoffs,'' said Albany State coach Hamp Smith, whose
team drew an average of 11,472 for games against Valdosta State in
Albany, and Savannah State in Macon. ``This is just a great
classic, especially for fans in middle Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvement of Fort Valley State, which drew an average of
6,984 fans for four dates at Wildcats Stadium, has heightened
interest in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two 9-1 teams in the same conference battling it out for
a spot in the playoffs,'' second-year Fort Valley State coach Kent
Schoolfield. ``This is the way a (regular) season should conclude.
I'm excited. Our fans are excited. Our team is excited. It should
be one heck of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   With a victory, Albany State, No. 9 in the NCAA Division II poll
and No. 4 in the Sheridan poll, would claim a share of the SIAC
title it has won the past five years and advance to the playoffs
for the sixth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, 5-0 in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference, cannot win the league championship outright because
Tuskegee, which did not face Albany State this season, finished
6-0. Tuskegee lost to Morris Brown in a non-conference game
</P>
<P>
   If Fort Valley State, No. 12 in the poll, wins, it would make
the Division II playoffs for the first time since future NFL
players Greg Lloyd and Eddie Anderson led the 1985 team. The
Wildcats have lost two in a row to the Rams and five of the last
last six.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for one of those games (won by Albany State 47-14 in
'94), they've all been close,'' Smith said. ``That's what I expect
it to be this time. Hard-fought, low-scoring and close. ``

 &HT;    Vols wonder how to be No. 1
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ To turn on the radio here is to discover a
city _ make that a state _ that doesn't know how to behave.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Volunteers are ranked No. 1, and the last time its
fans had to ponder how to celebrate the occasion, Dwight Eisenhower
was president.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk radio callers Tuesday were excessively optimistic.
They've already made their reservations for the Fiesta Bowl in
Tempe, Ariz., where the nation's No. 1 and No. 2 teams will meet
Jan. 4. They already are wondering about the design of the national
championship T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum were those fearful that any
acknowledgment of the moment, no matter how small, would jinx it.
To them being No. 1 is a curse, not unlike being on the cover of
Sports Illustrated. They didn't want to talk about it and chastised
those who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no time to celebrate,'' a caller warned in a desperate
voice. ``We haven't won anything yet. If the players are thinking
like you people, then we ... are ... dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Other callers fell somewhere in between, but none was entirely
comfortable with being No. 1. After all the heartaches and
disappointments, now that Tennessee is finally No. 1, what in the
heck do you do with it?
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Fla., and Lincoln, Neb., it isn't a problem.
More often than not, they expect to be No. 1 and learned long ago
how to handle it. But when you haven't been No. 1 in 42 years, you
tend to wonder about protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer has tried to strike the right
balance between celebration and caution this week, particularly
with No. 10 Arkansas coming to town for a huge SEC game Saturday
(3:30 p.m., CBS). If the Volunteers win, they take another big step
toward reaching the SEC championship game Dec. 5 in Atlanta;
regular-season games against Kentucky and Vanderbilt still remain.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal, Fulmer reminded his players more than once this
week, is to get to Atlanta. Then win. Do that and getting to Tempe
for the national championship game will take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you want to do (when you're No. 1) is jump
around and celebrate, because it's something to be proud of, and we
are,'' Fulmer said. ``But people have to remember that we haven't
even won the SEC East yet. We have to do that before any other of
this stuff can possibly come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, Fulmer did encourage Tennessee's players
to enjoy the moment, because it doesn't come around often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that if they ever had any thoughts about getting a
girlfriend, this would be the week to do it,'' he said, laughing.
``They'll never be any more popular than they are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee players insist the hoopla about being No. 1 won't
affect the team negatively. The Vols, they say, have overcome too
much to get into this position. Tennessee began the season without
Peyton Manning, the greatest quarterback in school history. Then
running back Jamal Lewis, the Vols' best offensive player, was lost
for the season with a knee injury in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is a lot different than some of our other teams,''
linebacker Al Wilson said. ``This is a blue-collar bunch that does
a good job of taking care of business. I don't see us getting
caught up in the hype. There is still too much work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That work entails taking on a similar Arkansas team. The
Razorbacks are balanced, play good defense and have won the close
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so much like us it's scary,'' said quarterback Tee
Martin, who has completed 75 percent of his passes in his last four
outings. ``They are a veteran team that's not going to be
intimidated by anything. Our team is the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee last was No. 1, it stayed there only one week.
This group of Volunteers is determined not to be one-week wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed being No. 1 on Sunday, but that was it,'' Wilson
said. ``We've got a chance to have a special team if we can stay
focused. I think we will.

 &HT;    S.F. among best in '90s against run
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since 1990, the NFL has had 826 individual 100-yard
rushing performances, but only 15 of them have come at the expense
of the San Francisco 49ers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta tailback Jamal Anderson, one of only four players to
crack the century mark against San Francisco in the past three
seasons, wasn't surprised that the 49ers have permitted the
second-fewest 100-yard games this decade. In contrast, the Falcons'
defense has surrendered 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive linemen simply don't stay blocked,'' Anderson,
who rushed for 123 yards in Atlanta's 31-20 loss at 3Com Park on
Sept. 27, said earlier this week. ``They play off blocks well and
get involved in things. They're a lot like our (defensive line) in
that regard. You know, not real big, but very active. Whew, they're
so tough and so stingy.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have been for this entire decade.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's defense, frequently lost in the brilliance of a
galaxy of offensive stars, annually ranks among the NFL's premier
units. With the exception of 1993, when the Niners skidded to No.
16 against the rush, it has been rated in the top five every year
in stuffing the run.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have surrendered an average of 88.1 rushing yards a
game in the '90s, by far the lowest in the league. In four of those
seasons, the San Francisco run defense was first or second, and it
enters Sunday's showdown at the Georgia Dome ranked No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The names, faces and coaches have changed, but the results, for
the most part, have remained the same. In the 17 games played
between the two teams this decade, the Falcons have gone over 100
yards as a team four times and been held under 60 yards in nine
games. Atlanta has averaged 75.1 yards per game and 3.8 yards per
carry against the 49ers in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do,'' 49ers All-Pro defensive tackle Bryant
Young said, ``is transfer the line of scrimmage into the
(offensive) backfield. If we get a yard of penetration, then we've
disrupted the play. Everything is predicated on stopping the run
first. When you can do that, you dictate to the offense instead of
the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the Atlanta-San Francisco meetings this decade, the
score also dictated that the Falcons abandon the run early, which
certainly has skewed the numbers. The 49ers characteristically
bolted to huge leads and forced Atlanta to pass. A telling stat is
that there have been 10 games in the '90s in which Atlanta had
fewer than 20 running plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been games where, by the second quarter, our
(linemen) were just pinning their ears back and going for the
quarterback,'' linebacker Ken Norton Jr. said. ``We could ignore
the run because it didn't really matter anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the Falcons' paltry rushing totals versus the
49ers is that, until last season, the team was operating from the
run-and-shoot offense.
</P>
<P>
   Against that four-wide-receiver alignment, the 49ers typically
played a 4-1 front with six defensive backs, and at times they
would ``walk up'' strong safety Tim McDonald to the line of
scrimmage. The Falcons had some success running on the 49ers from
the run-and-shoot, spreading the field and using draw plays and
quick traps to spring backs into the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Broussard rushed for 104 yards in 1991 and Erric Pegram
gained 192 yards, the third-highest total in franchise history, in
'93. But those high points are only blips on the running-game radar
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, much of this decade has been marked by the inability of
Atlanta's three interior blockers to cope with Young and Dana
Stubblefield. The Falcons had problems with the ``under'' tackle,
and one of the two seemed to always be in the backfield. The
departure of Stubblefield, who left as a free agent, should make
things a bit easier, but Young remains one of the league's premier
interior defenders, and fourth-year veteran Junior Bryant might be
even quicker than Stubblefield.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also brought in Winfred Tubbs as a free agent from New
Orleans to help stop the run; Tubbs arguably was the NFC's best
inside linebacker in '97.
</P>
<P>
   An advantage the Falcons should have is that San Francisco
probably won't be able to play McDonald ``in the box,'' even on
some early downs. The 49ers' cornerbacks might be too vulnerable to
expose them by committing eight defenders to the run, and that
should be a plus for Anderson. Because many teams have come out and
attacked the San Francisco secondary from the outset, it's
difficult to gauge the overall performance of the front seven
against the run.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Falcons' front four, the 49ers' linemen aren't big for
the NFL, averaging just 287 pounds. A steady pounding from Anderson
could wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, though, I won't sneak up on them like I have on
some other teams,'' Anderson said. ``They're in the division. I'm
no secret to those guys. They come for me each and every game. It
seems like they're always in your backfield and in your face.''

 &HT;    49ers cornerbacks struggling this year
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's been speculation about how the Atlanta
Falcons' pass defense, ranked 29th in the NFL, will stack up
against San Francisco's No. 1-ranked passing offense. But folks out
by the Bay aren't feeling comfortable about the 49ers secondary and
the way it will match up against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco (7-2) is ranked 25th in the NFL against the pass,
allowing 223.7 yards per game. Part of the reason that number is so
high is because teams frequently have no choice but to throw
against the Niners, who have defended against 312 passes,
fifth-most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have struggled all season at the cornerback spot,
where the starter on the left side, former Falcon Darnell Walker is
micro-sized at 5-feet-8, 167 pounds. On the right side, Marquez
Pope (5-11, 193) is questionable for Sunday's game with a back
strain, and his backup, Antonio Langham, is out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   That means rookie first-round draft choice R.W. McQuarters (5-9,
198 pounds) might start.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of going into the Falcons game with just
two healthy cornerbacks _ McQuarters and Walker _ the 49ers signed
seven-year veteran cornerback Tyrone Legette, who had worked out
Monday for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had to waive safety Curtis Buckley, who was tied
for the team lead with 10 special teams tackles. He was the NFC's
Pro Bowl alternate as a special teams player the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't play from scrimmage. His last tackle on defense
was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he played on a lot of special teams ... he didn't play
any defensive snaps,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``With the health
of our corners, we simply needed another person that had experience
playing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Legette was released prior to the season by Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who missed the past two
games with a strained medial collateral knee ligament, returned to
practice for the first time Wednesday since being injured in the
Oct. 25 game against the Jets. Bradford is questionable for
Sunday's game. Even if he plays, he will not start, as Michael
Booker remains in that spot.
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't as good for wide receiver/punt returner Tim
Dwight, who has a similar injury. He was downgraded from doubtful
to out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive tackles Travis Hall (knee) and Shane Dronett
(foot) returned to practice and both are probable.
</P>
<P>
   Hall may start for the first time since Oct. 18 against New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Chris Bayne is doubtful with a badly strained hamstring.
He did not practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris hoppin'
</P>
<P>
   The newest Falcon, wide receiver/punt returner Ronnie Harris, is
getting a crash course in the offense, often substituting in
practice for starters to get extra reps.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if coaches feel he knows enough to help Sunday and he is
activated, Harris might return punts. In Dwight's absence, wide
receiver Todd Kinchen is averaging 6.2 yards per return.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has returned 68 punts in his five-year NFL career, for an
8.5-yard average. He returned only one punt this season for Seattle
and fumbled it one day before being cut Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with wide receiver Jammi German (knee) out for the season,
Harris is a possibility as one of the outside coverage men on the
punting team. Rookie cornerback Elijah Williams probably will
replace Bayne on the other side. If Harris is not activated,
cornerback Randy Fuller is most likely to work in an outside spot.
</P>
<P>
   Niner news
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco center Chris Dalman, who missed Sunday's game
against Carolina with a knee injury, was at practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't start, Steve Gordon (6-4, 290) will get his second
NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 29, has an interesting story. He was drafted by New
England in 1992, cut, and them became a member of the Pats'
practice squad in '92 and '93.
</P>
<P>
   He was out of football in '94, got waived in the 'Niners' last
cut in '95, '96, and '97, and then got a tryout this summer in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Denver traded the former University of California
player to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   'Niner LT Dave Fiore (knee), whose return to the active roster
was considered possible this week, will not play. Derrick Deese
will start.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback kids
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have proven they have the type of offense that can
come from behind, but they're getting tired of having to prove it.
They trailed the Panthers 16-0 last week before winning 25-23 in
spite of six turnovers. They've been behind a lot this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Niners have a tendency to start slow -- the first game
against Atlanta notwithstanding. They jumped out to a 31-7 lead in
that one before winning 31-20, but that was not part of a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers fell behind 21-0 at home to Indianapolis before
winning 34-31 on a field goal on the last play.
</P>
<P>
   They fell behind the Packers 16-0, took a 22-16 lead, and lost
38-22.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed 23-0 at Buffalo, and lost 26-21.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary that we're 7-2 and we haven't played well,'' WR
Jerry Rice
</P>
<P>
   said. ''If you ask me, 'Do we have the team to go all the way?'
No, not
</P>
<P>
   right now. Not the way we're playing. We're going to have to
make some adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Derrick Deese said, ''It shows we have the ability
to come back, but I'll tell you what _ that wears real thin real
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know which team will show up in
Atlanta Sunday, but said it's the wrong one, the 49ers will be in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've shown at different times . . . we can be a
dominating-type team, but then we have shown . . . that we can be a
team that can shoot ourselves in the foot,'' he said. ''If we're
hitting on all eight cylinders, we can be a heck of a team.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't flop around in a game like this. You've got to come
out fast and play well from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have quietly snuck their way up to a No. 9 NFL
ranking for total offense, averaging 327.2 yards. Atlanta is No. 10
passing (207.1), and No. 11 rushing (120.1). . . . Meanwhile, the
49ers' run defense, which started the season poorly, is up to No.
5, allowing 91.7 yards per game. . . . . . . Reasons the Falcons
are ranked next-to-best in the NFL against the run, and
next-to-worst against the pass: They have faced fewer running plays
(206) than any team, and more passing plays (325) than all but two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Fan fodder
</P>
<P>
   Fans are encouraged to bring canned goods to Sunday's game as
part of the league-wide drive to aid local food banks for
Thanksgiving. Fans can drop cans at the pregame party at
International Boulevard.

 &HT;    '98 Falcons find selves on the road less traveled
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not since Dec. 22, 1991, when they needed a victory
over the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium to clinch just the second
division title in franchise history, have the Atlanta Falcons been
part of such a big game so late in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Falcons are playing out the string in
mid-November. On Sunday, however, they play the San Francisco 49ers
for first place in the NFC West. Suddenly the team's far-flung
Suwanee outpost has become a must-stop for anyone with a minicam
and a notebook, and scalpers outside the Georgia Dome finally will
learn the term ``triple figures'' on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what winning will do,'' defensive end Lester
Archambeau said. ``All over the city, it seems like people are
talking about the game. It's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrated Christmas Eve '95 upset of the 49ers, which
lifted the Falcons into the playoffs, can't compare to the
excitement generated by Sunday's matchup. The '95 game was played
without buildup, Atlanta's wild-card aspirations seemingly smashed
the week before in a loss at Carolina. ``It was like we found a
gift under the tree,'' wide receiver Terance Mathis, who scored the
winning touchdown, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that this game actually means something, the Dome is
sold out and neither team is from the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a crowd that's had 30-plus years to rest its vocal
cords, the Falcons will hold an emotional edge on Sunday, and they
need to feed off that. They also need to limit the number of big
plays they permit the San Francisco passing game, contain Steve
Young on the bootleg and take advantage of a shaky 49ers secondary.
</P>
<P>
   If they can do those things, Christmas will have arrived in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``bests'' on this week's schedule:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: While Atlanta is a strong bet, the best
opportunity of the weekend might be 250 miles up I-85. The Carolina
Panthers are one of the '98 season's biggest disappointments, but
they have been playing teams close in recent weeks. Because of
their new-found reliance on the run, the Dolphins seem to keep
every game close. Call it the Panthers on a late John Kasay field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: For a dozen seasons, Buffalo defensive end
Bruce Smith and New England left tackle Bruce Armstrong have staged
the league's best ``Bruce Brawls.'' It won't be any different
today. Both teams desperately need a victory to hang in the AFC
East race, and the two veterans will stage their own street fight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: Despite being contained by the Pittsburgh
secondary Monday night, Green Bay wideout Antonio Freeman is as hot
as any player in the NFL. Against a Giants secondary ravaged by
injuries, he and Brett Favre will hook up for at least two
touchdowns. We also like Tennessee tailback Eddie George to have
another big day against an inconsistent Steelers defense.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: The current Kansas City funk won't diminish the
bile in Monday night's game against division rival Denver. With
their backs to the wall, the Chiefs would like nothing more than to
dash Bronco hopes for an undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: Don't discount Dallas at Arizona as must-see
viewing. A victory for the Cowboys and they've all but claimed the
NFC East. An upset by the Cards, who have one of the coziest
December schedules in the league, will make things interesting.

GRAFFITI ARTIST MAKES GOOD _ AT $3.3 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A self-portrait by Jean Michel Basquiat that depicts
the artist at 21 holding a spear in his left hand, his masked face
drawn flat, brought a staggering $3.3 million at Christie's sale of
contemporary art on Thursday night, a record for the 1980s graffiti
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Five determined bidders fought for the painting, with its
dramatic gray and black brush strokes, driving the price to more
than five times its high estimate of $600,000. The winner, who bid
by telephone, was identified by the auction house only as a
anonymous collector.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Basquiat was the only piece that sold for more than
$1 million, the sale of works by mostly 1980s and '90s artists was
still a success, totaling $9.2 million, just shy of its high
estimate, $10 million. Of the 49 works offered, 42 found buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Christie's realigned the way it sells art, putting
only works made since 1970 in its contemporary sales and reserving
older art, dating from 1900 to 1970, for its 20th-century sale, to
be held next Thursday. The sale on Thursday of this week was only
its second contemporary-art auction in New York under the new
definition.
</P>
<P>
   When Christie's decided to form these new categories,
auction-house executives said the motive was to lure new young
buyers. But those who could be seen bidding Thursday night were the
same old familiar faces, demonstrating the aging of the
contemporary-art market.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, since some of the subjects of the works sold
would best be appreciated by the old-timers. The second-highest
price of the evening was paid for a 1971 Gerhard Richter portrait
of Brigid Polk, who was one of Andy Warhol's closest friends in the
1960s and a star of his film ``Chelsea Girls,'' and whose real name
is Brigid Berlin. (She was called Polk because of her habit of
poking herself with a hypodermic syringe full of amphetamine.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berlin was in the audience Thursday night, watching the
portrait sell to an anonymous American collector for $750,000, just
under its low estimate of $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed,'' she said after the sale. ``I took Polaroids of
myself with a self-timer when I was in Munich in 1970 and gave one
to Gerhard. He wasn't famous then. He gave me one of the portraits,
but I gave it away because I didn't want a painting of myself
hanging in my living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's worth so much, does she want it back? ``No,'' Ms.
Berlin said. ``That was the past; this is now.''
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   But even the 1990s works appealed to seasoned collectors rather
than young speculators. Many people thought the young Wall Street
set, who would have normally been seen buying at these auctions,
were cautious, knowing their Christmas bonuses this season wouldn't
be as high as they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't seem to hamper an artist like Robert Gober,
whose work has sold for strong prices at auction in the last few
years and was well represented Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Untitled (Man in Drain),'' from 1993-94, which shows the
body of a man lying at the bottom of a drain, was the image on the
cover of the sale catalog. It was being sold by Hank McNeil, a
Philadelphia collector, with an estimate of $450,000 to $650,000.
It went to Joel Mallin, a New York collector, for $552,500, a
record for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gober, ``Dollhouse'' (1978), looked more like something
you'd find in a toy store than in an auction room. Estimated at
$60,000 to $80,000, it had five serious bidders and finally sold to
an anonymous bidder for $68,500. ``Untitled (Hairy Shoe),'' from
1992, a child's shoe made of wax with human hair inside, was
estimated at $25,000 to $35,000 but brought $40,250.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers and collectors expressed fears that the high prices
fetched by 1990s artists would make prices escalate out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Auction-house experts, however, were quick to disagree. ``I
think Gober is one of the most important artists in the last 20
years,'' said Philippe Segalot, who heads Christie's
contemporary-art department worldwide. ``And `Man in Drain' was a
very smart purchase. It's major work by a major artist. This sale
showed there's a strong market for cutting-edge art.''

<P>
   Four 1982 photographs by Cindy Sherman, estimated at $80,000 to
$100,000, had three serious takers and ended up selling to a
telephone bidder for $123,500. The large-format portraits, from a
group of 10, were shown at Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany, the year
they were made and later at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile artist, Damien Hirst, fared far better than
he did in London last month. ``Diazepam'' (1993), one of his spot
paintings based on a description of drugs in a pharmaceutical
dictionary, was estimated at $40,000 to $60,000. It brought $88,300
from Hellie Nahmad, whose new Cork Street gallery opened a few
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Hatoum, the Lebanon-born sculptor who lives in London, was
represented Thursday night, her first appearance at auction, by her
1993 piece ``A Couple (of Swings),'' No. 3 of an edition of three.
The work is just what its title suggests: a pair of children's
swings, but with glass seats. Marc Blondeau, a Paris dealer, bought
it for $46,000, nicely above its $30,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Three bidders wanted to take home a work by another
much-talked-about artist, Matthew Barney. ``Envelopa: Drawing
Restraint 7 (Guillotine),'' a 1993 suite of seven still photographs
from the opening sequence of a video directed by Barney that
depicts woodland satyrs from Greek mythology, was estimated at
$60,000 to $80,000 and finally sold to an anonymous bidder for
$123,500.
</P>
<P>
   There were some casualties, but in most cases with good reasons.
Another Richter, ``Seascape With Bird'' (1970), barely attracted a
bid. The painting was expected to bring $800,000 to $1.2 million,
but nobody was willing to pay more than $600,000. In the last six
months, two other Richter seascapes have sold for more than $2
million each at auction, one at Sotheby's in London in June and one
at Christie's in New York in May. Both were of far superior
quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the happiest faces in the crowd leaving the sale Thursday
night was that of Tony Shafrazi, the SoHo dealer, who has shown the
works of Basquiat, who died in 1988, since the 1980s. ``Obviously
the market is changing,'' Shafrazi said. ``Basquiat was a
speculator. Now he's a front-runner.''

PROSECUTOR REFUSES TO ENFORCE SUBPOENA IN INS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Siding with federal immigration officials in
their effort to protect secret evidence in a sensitive deportation
case, the U.S. attorney's office here has refused an immigration
judge's request to force a witness to testify about her contacts
with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Faith Hochberg, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said
her office would modify the judge's request to limit questioning of
the witness to written interrogatories that could not explore any
discussions she had had with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has broken new ground in immigration law,
involves Hany Kiareldeen, a 31-year-old Palestinian man who has
been detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service since
March. The agency is seeking to deport him largely on the basis of
secret evidence alleging that he associated with the terrorists
involved in the New York World Trade Center bombing and uttered
threats to kill Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen denies the charges and maintains that his ex-wife,
Amal Mohamed, made the allegations contained in the secret evidence
out of vindictiveness.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer's efforts to force her to testify about her contacts
with the FBI and her refusal to do so led an immigration judge in
September to become the first such judge to ask the U.S. attorney
for help in compelling Ms. Mohamed's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In making the request, the judge, Daniel Meisner, was using a
1996 law intended to strengthen the hand of immigration courts in
adjudicating cases and to give them some independence from INS
lawyers, on whom they had previously relied for enforcement of
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   With her response to Meisner, Ms. Hochberg has also broken new
ground in asserting that she is not bound to seek information that
immigration judges request under the 1996 law. In court papers, Ms.
Hochberg's office argued that U.S. attorneys have ``discretion to
determine whether the interests of justice'' warrant enforcement of
such a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Meisner had no comment Thursday on the action taken by Ms.
Hochberg's office. But Regis Fernandez, Kiareldeen's lawyer, said
there appeared to be a conflict of interest involving the FBI, the
IS., the immigration courts and the U.S. attorney's office _ all
entities within the federal Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. attorney's office at this point is wearing too many
hats in this case,'' Fernandez said. ``They are basically saying
that the 1996 statute is meaningless and immigration judges are
powerless. The law seemed to make the erroneous assumption that the
immigration judge's interest in getting at the truth would be in
sync with the U.S. attorney's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kenny, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Immigration
Review, which supervises the judges, said the agency would have no
comment until it had talked with the U.S. attorney's office.

PRO BOWLERS TO ROLL IN NEW YORK PARK , BUT LAWNS WON'T BE LANES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Professional Bowlers of America would appreciate
just a little respect, please. They have had it with the stereotype
of the beer-guzzling, potbellied robo-athlete. And even though the
group's headquarters are in Akron, Ohio, home of Goodyear, the
famed Goodyear blimp has never deigned to show up at a bowling
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm envious of all the sports that get the blimp at their
games,'' said Mark Gerberich, the bowling league's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   All that may soon change. Friday, at a news conference in the
Chelsea Piers bowling center in Manhattan, the bowlers are to
announce that on May 1, the finals of a major tour event will be
held outdoors _ weather permitting _ in Bryant Park, normally home
to chichi fashion shows and other cosmopolitan happenings.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of bowling outside _ and under the shadow of
Gotham's skyscrapers _ may strike some as strange, in many ways the
event will bring the sport back to its American roots. Dutch
settlers, after all, brought the sport to the New World by bowling
in the open space now known as Bowling Green Park. The sport also
figured prominently in Washington Irving's Hudson River tale, ``Rip
Van Winkle.'
</P>
<P>
   But the game moved indoors in 1840, when the first indoor lanes
anywhere opened in Manhattan. Who can forget that ``the Brooklyn
side'' is a right-banded bowler's misaimed shot to the left?
</P>
<P>
   At the Bryant Park tournament finals, more than 1,000 spectators
will be admitted free to sit in bleachers lining both sides of two
lanes that will be set up in front of the park's fountain area
looking onto the Avenue of the Americas. The bowlers themselves
will battle for a first prize of $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first reaction from bowlers was positive, if understated.
``If it helps us bowl for more money, it sounds good to me,'' said
Walter Ray Williams, who has earned more than $2 million on the pro
tour, while managing to stay essentially anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an admitted bowler himself, was also
positive, if overstated, about New York's power to lend cachet to
the sport. ``This event will permanently change the way people
think about professional bowling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bryant Park finals, a tent will be available in case it
rains. Preliminaries to determine which four bowlers compete in
Manhattan will be held in Coram, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be a major sports entity, we have to be in
Manhattan,'' said Gerberich, who was captain of the St. John's
University bowling team and once bowled a 300 game at Bowlmor
Lanes, the legendary alleys in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be the first modern outdoors bowling tournament.
There was an amateur world championship held last year in the
shadow of the Egyptian pyramids, where sand was a big problem. Nor
will it be New York City's first pro bowling tournament: The tour
used to stop in the city regularly until 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The return to Manhattan after more than two decades is surely
part of a campaign to bring pro bowling a prominence its
participants think it deserves in a country where 72 million people
bowl at least once a week. ``It's just really hard to shake the
image,'' said Robert Smith, a rookie pro who is electrifying crowds
with his sweeping hook.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither the league nor the city will divulge what the bowlers
are paying the city to hold the event in Manhattan. In
negotiations, the city vetoed the bowlers' original ideas of using
the grass lawn of the park, or staging the finals in April, when
the sod is put down. It was feared that rowdy bowling enthusiasts
would damage the grass on their way to the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Biederman, president of the Bryant Park Restoration
Corp., which runs the park, said the event was in line with other
commercial functions staged there. Besides fashion shows, the park
has been host to a display of new Cadillacs and a celebration of
Kentucky Fried Chicken's introduction of chicken pot pie.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, not a bowler, emphasized that
the event was for a single day. ``I wouldn't want to turn the park
into a bowling alley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The great unknown is the effect of the great outdoors on the
game. Bowlers fret that the ball's grand slide across slick lanes
could be mysteriously affected by sunlight. Urban noises that New
Yorkers take for granted, from sirens to firecrackers, could snap a
bowler's concentration. And, tent or no tent, there is the specter
that this might somehow end up being the first bowling game in
history to be rained out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you slip and fall, it could really hurt,'' Smith said.

 &HT;    Dell Computer profits jump again
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK,Texas _ Demonstrating a consistency that defies the
turbulence in the personal computer industry, Dell Computer Corp.
Thursday reported profit of $384 million in the third quarter, up
55 percent from the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share, the most common barometer of profitability
used by stock analysts, soared 65 percent to 28 cents per share,
one penny higher than the analysts' consensus. Dell has matched or
surpassed the consensus every quarter since October 1994, according
to First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 1 was up 51 percent to $4.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``spectacular'' results have become the norm for Dell, said
Art Russell of Edward D. Jones &AMP; Co., an investment firm based in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a credit to them that we find them boring, with
the consistency we've come to expect from them,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said online sales averaged more than $10 million a day, up
66 percent from the $6 million figure of previous quarters.
Internet sales accounted for 20 percent of sales or nearly $1
billion during the quarter, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also were No. 1 in revenue and unit shipment growth among
the top 10 computer systems companies, growing at more than five
time the industry rate worldwide,'' said chief executive Michael
Dell.
</P>
<P>
   The results were announced after the stock markets closed.
Shares of Dell fell $2.75 to $69.18 3/4 in Nasdaq trading Thursday,
apparently in response to a new program by Compaq Computer Corp. to
sell PCs directly to the $40 billion market for small- and
medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been under intense pressure to fend off Dell's
challenge as the Round Rock-based company has extended its string
of quarters as the most efficient, most profitable and
fastest-growing major PC company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great they finally discovered ... that direct is
best,'' Dell's chief financial officer Tom Meredith said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   All major PC makers are trying to implement some elements of
Dell's build-to-order system, while Dell continues to become more
efficient. The company said it turns over its inventory every seven
days, compared to every 11 days at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's string of extraordinary quarters prompts analysts to look
for signs of softness in such areas as average selling price and
gross profit margins, which could signal Dell's vulnerability to
industry price pressures. Meredith said the company's average
selling price remained $2,400, the same as in the second quarter,
while gross margins stayed at 22.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's revenue in the troubled Japanese and other Asian markets
increased 49 percent to $289 million.
</P>
<P>
   The region, which has 40 percent of the world's population, is
``grossly underpenetrated in the PC environment,'' Meredith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's just, if you will, a green field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, which is the industry's second-biggest PC market
after North America, Dell's revenues increased 68 percent to nearly
$1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which will officially open its new server-manufacturing
plant in Northeast Austin today is deriving a greater portion of
revenue from servers and workstations. Those computers, which bring
higher profits, accounted for 14 percent of revenue, or $674.5
million in the third quarter. A year ago, they accounted for 11
percent of revenue, or $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Portable computers accounted for 22 percent of revenue, or $1
billion, compared to 17 percent, or about $542 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Desktops, which have been Dell's workhorse, accounted for 64
percent, or $3 billion, in the third quarter. Last year, desktops
accounted for 72 percent or revenue, or $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, Dell expects to capitalize on holiday
sales during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically our best quarter,'' said Meredith. ``We're very
well positioned to take advantage of seasonal demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell had 23,300 employees worldwide at the end of the quarter,
up 56 percent. The company employs about 15,000 workers in Central
Texas.

GERALD LONG, 75, WHO TRANSFORMED REUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gerald Long, who as general manager of the Reuters news
agency in the 1960s presided over its transformation from a
hand-to-mouth wire service to a profitable, computer-age news
organization, died in Paris on Sunday, Reuters said. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   When Long took over at Reuters in 1963 after the unexpected
death of Walton Cole, the previous general manager, the agency was
just breaking even, barely paying its bills year to year. Long soon
determined that if it were to compete in the increasingly cutthroat
marketplace, the company would have to turn a profit and make
itself truly international.
</P>
<P>
   Long was born in York, the son of a literary-minded mail carrier
who encouraged him to pursue his education. After graduating from
Cambridge in 1943, Long joined the army, where he was assigned to
the intelligence division, and he was eventually sent to Germany to
help set up German newspapers after World War II. He joined Reuters
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He rose quickly up the ranks in the company, working as a
correspondent and editor in Frankfurt, Germany; Paris; and Ankara,
Turkey. He returned to London in 1960, where he became the
assistant general manager. He was promoted to the top job three
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Reuters signed a contract with Ultronics Corp. of
New Jersey under which the company would provide computers and
Reuters would provide information about stock and money markets to
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The venture was wildly successful and made Reuters a significant
force in the dissemination of financial information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, the company made another bold move, setting up an
independent reporting arm and severing its cooperative ties with
The Associated Press and Dow Jones, which it had depended on in the
past for news and financial information. Six years later, Long was
made the managing director of Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Long left the company in 1981 and took a job with Rupert Murdoch
as managing director of The Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years at a wire service, he did not take to
newspaper life, and Long, a gastronome of the first order, angered
Murdoch after entering into an acrimonious correspondence with
Albert Roux, a superstar chef, about cheeses he had eaten and not
enjoyed at Le Gavroche, Roux's restaurant. The correspondence was
printed in The Times just as Murdoch was about to eliminate 600
union jobs, and he feared Long's notoriety could complicate the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Long was removed from his post soon afterward. He stayed on as
vice chairman of The Times until 1984, when he retired to France,
living in Paris, Provence and Normandy, where he kept a bust of
Julius Reuter, the founder of Reuters, in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Anne, three daughters and two sons.

NO NBA TALKS ARE PLANNED SOON

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A month after the National Basketball Association
canceled regular-season games for the first time, the parties in
the labor dispute have shown no inclination to get back to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   With no negotiations planned Friday, owners and players have
gone a week without meeting. The stalemate increases the
possibility that the season will not start before 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, announced on
Oct. 13 the first games to be canceled because of a work stoppage
in the league's 52-year history, the league and the union have
spent only 8 of the last 30 days in negotiation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   With perhaps less than a month to reach a settlement and sign a
new collective-bargaining agreement, both sides have been more
preoccupied with public posturing.
</P>
<P>
   The union's executive director Billy Hunter said he planned to
speak with league officials Thursday about setting up a possible
bargaining session. But neither the league nor the union said the
sides had talked.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a group of 27 of the locked-out players _
representing the union's negotiating committee and several player
representatives _ met in Manhattan to reaffirm unity and discuss
strategy. But the players shot down the possibility of submitting
an altered proposal to the owners.

BASEBALL, like accounting, always has been a game of numbers, and
the just-completed 1998 season was enough to make a CPA choke on
his calculator.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, of course, led the charge with those powerful
biceps, that quicker-than-lightning swing and those magnificent
home runs he launched over the walls, into the record books and so
beyond anything we might have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac was strong and humble, and he was the larger-than-life
hero who kept us glued to our TVs as he chased Babe Ruth and Roger
Maris and his fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a number. Seventy. It was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   There also was Slammin' Sammy Sosa with his own sensational
efforts. He belted practically a homer a day in June to engage
McGwire in a race for the ages, turning a special season into a
magical one. He was Smilin' Sammy, the slugger with a salsa beat,
who touched his heart, blew kisses and brought a bit of his native
Dominican Republic to the most American of games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, too, sailed past Ruth and Maris and finished with a
home-run total that had been unheard of, and yet he wound up in
second place.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a number. Sixty-six. It was fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   There were the New York Yankees and their relentless pursuit of
excellence in a record-setting march to yet another World Series
championship. These were not the Bronx Zoo-variety Yankees, filled
with so many wild soap-opera subplots for the back pages of the New
York tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees _ with the exception of David Wells _ were a solid
group of professionals who acted accordingly. Bernie Williams and
Paul O'Neill and Derek Jeter and Scott Brosius and David Cone and
the rest were the gold standard all season long, winning more games
than any team in history.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a number. One hundred twenty-five. It was overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   But now, nearly three weeks after the World Series, comes a
different kind of player who blows everything else right out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a number. Eleven million. It is the most amazing number in
an incredible baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the dollars Ken Caminiti left on the table because he
wants to play for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Don't just read over that lightly, because it happens about as
often as a 77-year-old U.S. senator and former Marine is shot up
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti turned down a guaranteed three-year, $21.5 million
offer from the Detroit Tigers because he wants to come home. The
transplanted Californian who lives in Richmond wants to be closer
to his wife, Nancy, and their three daughters, Kendall, Lindsey and
Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the past four seasons with the San Diego Padres,
winning the Most Valuable Player Award in 1996 along with three
Gold Gloves, he wants to return to the franchise that gave him his
start and maybe take care of some unfinished business with his old
friends.
</P>
<P>
   He is older now, slower, beaten physically. But if you've tried
to put your finger on what has been missing from the Astros the
past two years in the playoffs, maybe it is this kind of passion.
Commitment is passing up $11 million _ no matter how much you have
in the bank. In that regard, Caminiti is demonstrating he has no
equal in baseball or maybe in all of sports today.
</P>
<P>
   They won't hold any clothing drives or pot-luck dinners for the
Caminiti family if he signs a contract with the Astros in the
neighborhood of $10.5 million. But that is not the point.
</P>
<P>
   Can you see Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, the NBA labor
leaders, giving up that kind of jack? Puh-leeze.
</P>
<P>
   These are times when so many athletes are out of touch and have
no regard for the value of money. Craig Biggio sees the Astros
offer free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson $33 million and comes off
sounding like a spoiled brat when he sniffs, ``If we can't get
Randy, we'd better get Kevin Brown or Roger Clemens ... to be the
No. 1 horse who anchors the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a timely hit in the playoffs, Bidge?
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, long regarded as a blue-collar player, is simply
taking a down-to-earth approach to the money, doing what many of us
like to think we would do. After you've amassed a certain amount of
millions to be comfortable for life, the rest is all ego. Caminiti
could have said he deserves more money than Yankees third baseman
Brosius, who parlayed one good season into a new jackpot contract.
Caminiti could have taken the money and run. Instead, he's
sprinting home.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a number. Eleven million. In the year of the homer, Cammy
hits the grandest slam.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to have another parade?

TEEN-AGERS TURN AGENTS TO FIGHT SALE OF CIGARETTES TO MINORS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She is an unlikely undercover agent. But for six
months this year, Alexa Martinez, who is 16 and looks it, went
around with inspectors from New York City's Consumer Affairs
Department as backups, and asked to buy cigarettes at newsstands,
candy stores, delicatessens, supermarkets, drug stores and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   City law prohibits the sale of tobacco to anyone under 18, and
sellers are required to request photo identity cards from anyone
who seems younger than 25. But the law is widely flouted, as Alexa
learned, strolling away again and again with cigarettes, no
questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd sell to me, I'd pay for them and walk out to the
vehicle,'' Alexa, a nonsmoker who is an 11th grader at Adlai E.
Stevenson High School in the Bronx, said Thursday. ``Then, one of
the inspectors would go back in to give them a summons, and I would
fill out an affidavit.''
</P>
<P>
   From April through September, in what officials called the
nation's most ambitious crackdown on merchants who illegally sold
tobacco to minors, Alexa and 30 other teen-agers, most of them 14
to 16, put the test to nearly 8,200 of the 15,000 retailers in New
York that sold cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the city said the crackdown, called Smoke Out '98,
had led to a 66 percent decline in cigarette sales to minors in the
stores being tested, apparently as word of the undercover
operations spread and merchants were hit with fines and tobacco
license suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the pressure on, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has
toughened laws against selling the box cutters that young thugs use
as weapons and cans of spray paint used for graffiti, Thursday
proposed a law that would triple fines and increase license
suspensions for anyone selling tobacco to minors and would step up
and streamline enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new legislation should sound a clarion call to merchants
that if they sell cigarettes to kids, they will lose their license
to sell tobacco,'' said Jules Polonetsky, commissioner of consumer
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would raise the fine for a first offense to $1,000 from
$300 and for a second offense to $2,000 from $500. It would also
provide for automatic suspension of tobacco licenses on the second
offense within two years, instead of the third offense, and would
consolidate licensing and enforcement in the Consumer Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under present laws, two-year licenses to sell tobacco are issued
for $10 by the City Finance Department. The Consumer Affairs
licenses, also good for two years, would supplant them and cost
$110.
</P>
<P>
   And to tighten a loophole in which merchants facing license
suspensions or heavy fines have escaped penalties by fictitiously
``selling'' their businesses to relatives or friends, then
reincorporating under new names, the new law would have licenses
issued to business premises, rather than names. It would strip an
offender of its license for two years, regardless of a change in
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many minors buy cigarettes in the city. A
national survey by the Department of Health and Human Services
suggests that more than 48 percent of male minors and 36 percent of
female minors have tried smoking, and experts say most adults
addicted to nicotine started smoking as minors.
</P>
<P>
   To gather information for a new anti-smoking law, the city last
spring hired 30 minors under a summer jobs program, using a
$740,000 grant from the State Health Department. For $6.25 an hour,
Alexa and the others worked five to six hours a day, on weekends
during the school year and on alternate weekdays in the summer,
accompanying inspectors on 8,154 visits to tobacco sellers.

SVETLANA BERIOSOVA, 66, BALLERINA WITH ROYAL BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Svetlana Beriosova, an incandescent leading ballerina with the
Royal Ballet of England for two decades, died Nov. 10 at the
hospice at St. Charles' Hospital in London. She was 66 and lived in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Patricia Daly of the British journal
Dancing Times.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of caviar in the sumptuous banquet of English ballet
dancing of the 1950s and '60s, Ms. Beriosova embodied pure
classicism shot through with quietly shimmering mystery. A dancer
of almost subliminal contradictions, she was a regal ballerina who
projected a warmth that was poignant in its unexpectedness. She was
an introverted dancer who could be funny, though she was seldom
called upon to be. She was reticent yet eloquent, moving with a
Russian ballet amplitude but none of the typical Russian fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   In her greatest roles, among them Odette, the swan queen in
``Swan Lake,'' Aurora in ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' the title role in
``Giselle'' and the wife of Edward Elgar in Frederick Ashton's 1968
``Enigma Variations,'' Ms. Beriosova was exquisitely lyrical yet
possessed of an innate grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The English dance writer Katherine Sorley Walker, writing this
year in Dance Now, praised Ms. Beriosova for her ``poise and
serenity, her unhurried perfection of line.'' Early in Ms.
Beriosova's career, the dance writer Annabel Farjeon described the
ballerina as ``one of those rare beings _ the natural dancer,''
adding that ``no amount of training can give this inborn beauty to
every pose.'' A.H. Franks wrote of Ms. Beriosova's fluency, of
arabesques and attitudes that ``became movement in suspension
rather than a cessation of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beriosova was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, where her father,
the dancer and ballet master Nicholas Beriozoff, worked at the
Lithuanian State Opera. Ms. Beriosova was a very young witness to
the development of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where her
father danced in the 1930s and where she saw the work of some of
the great emigre Russian dancers and choreographers of the time.
She trained in ballet first with her mother, who died when she was
10, and then with the noted Russian teachers Anatole Vilzak and
Ludmila Shollar in New York City, where the family moved in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beriosova performed in children's roles with the Ballet
Russe and at 15 became an apprentice with the Marquis de Cuevas'
Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo. She joined the Metropolitan Ballet in
London in 1947, at 15, and despite her inexperience quickly
impressed the director, Cecilia Blatch. ``Well, she isn't quite
what we need at the moment,'' the director is said to have
commented, ``but in a few months she'll be what everyone needs.''
</P>
<P>
   While still a teen-ager, Ms. Beriosova was given major roles in
classical and contemporary ballets. She joined the second company
of the Sadler's Wells Ballet (later Royal Ballet) in 1950, moving
on to the first company two years later. She danced with the troupe
until 1975, when she retired from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beriosova never quite became the star that many expected her
to be. She lacked self-confidence and had the misfortune to be
cast, into the early 1960s, in a string of unpopular second-rate
works by leading choreographers. ``She seemed to lack the toughness
that can allow an artist to express herself to the full in spite of
unhelpful circumstances and depressing setbacks,'' Ms. Walker wrote
in Dance Now.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Beriosova seldom failed to make a strong impression in
Europe and abroad particularly in the United States, sometimes in
small roles that she quietly made her own, like the Tsarevna in
``The Firebird.'' In 1961, she charmed audiences in the title role
of Ashton's unsuccessful ``Persephone.'' Her other notable roles
included the Bride in Bronislava Nijinska's version of ``Les
Noces,'' the Tsarina in Kenneth MacMillan's ``Anastasia,'' the lead
female characters in ``Coppelia'' and ``Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beriosova also danced the title roles in Ashton's
``Cinderella'' and ``Ondine'' and lead roles in Ashton's ``Birthday
Offering'' and a wide range of other ballets by Ashton and
MacMillan and by choreographers including Andree Howard, John
Cranko and George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by illness and injuries, Ms. Beriosova performed very
little in the 1970s. On her retirement from dancing, she became a
popular teacher and dancers' coach, working in public onstage in
Maina Gielgud's ``Steps, Notes and Squeaks'' in 1978 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beriosova's marriage to Mohammed Masud Khan ended in divorce
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her stepmother, Doris Beriozoff of Zurich.

FRANKIE BRIMSEK, 85, HALL OF FAME GOALIE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Minn., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frankie ( Zero) Brimsek, the Boston Bruins' Hall of Fame
goaltender who was renowned for a remarkable string of shutouts
during his first weeks in the National Hockey League, died Nov. 11
at his home in Virginia, Minn. He was 85 and one of the first
American-born players to star in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   When Brimsek was signed by the Bruins' organization in 1937, his
chances of seeing Boston Garden anytime soon seemed remote. A
native of Eveleth, Minn., he was a rare American in a game
controlled by Canadians. And the Bruins' goalie, Cecil (Tiny)
Thompson, was a long-established star.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the 1938-39 season, the Bruins sold Thompson, a
future Hall of Famer, to the Detroit Red Wings for $15,000 and
staked their future on Brimsek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid had the fastest hands I ever saw _ like lightning,''
said Art Ross, the Bruins' general manager and coach.
</P>
<P>
   After playing two games early in the season and then going to
the minors, Brimsek returned when Thompson was sold.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game back, he lost to the Canadiens at Montreal.
But then he stopped the Blackhawks in Chicago, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   He made his debut in Boston Garden against the Blackhawks before
fans stunned by the departure of Thompson. ``That crowd was so
quiet that first night that I could hear them breathe and feel
their cold eyes on my back,'' Brimsek would recall. ``Tiny was such
a great goaltender, I had to be good or they would have chased me
right out of Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Brimsek also seemed out of place fashion-wise since he liked to
wear red pants, although the Bruins' colors then were gold, brown
and white.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruin fans would hardly be looking to chase Brimsek out of
town. He beat Chicago, 2-0, and then made it three straight
shutouts with a 3-0 blanking of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was scored on in his next game, he had put
together a stretch of 231 minutes 54 seconds without yielding a
goal, besting the record of 224:47 set by Thompson. After that, he
reeled off three more shutouts _ one against Thompson and the Red
Wings _ giving him six in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, he was known as Mr. Zero.
</P>
<P>
   Brimsek won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalie and the
Calder Trophy as the best rookie in leading the Bruins to the 1939
Stanley Cup championship. He took the Bruins to another title in
1941 and won the Vezina again in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-time All-Star in his 10-year NHL career, he was
inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto in 1966 and the
U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth in 1973, the year it opened.
</P>
<P>
   Brimsek played goalie at Eveleth High School and the college now
known as St. Cloud State, then was signed by the Bruins'
organization after playing amateur hockey.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged as a star when the Bruins were an NHL power featuring
the famous Kraut Line of Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody
Dumart. Seldom leaving his crease, Brimsek was adept at playing the
angles. Decades later, he took a dim view of many modern goalies,
saying: ``They have no business roaming. They get caught so badly,
it's pathetic. They'd be wise to fine the guy $500 for every goal
that got by.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Brimsek played goal for the U.S. Coast
Guard Cutters team out of Curtis Bay, Md. Featuring several NHL
players, the team faced top amateur clubs and appeared before large
crowds in Boston and New York, accompanied by a 30-piece military
band. Later in the war, Brimsek served with the Coast Guard in the
South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Bruins in 1945, Brimsek was an All-Star three
times in the next four seasons. He was sent to the Blackhawks in
1949, then retired after one season in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Minnesota and worked as a railroad engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Brimsek is survived by his wife, Marguerite; two daughters,
Chris Mucci of Virginia, Minn., and Karen Carlson of Eveleth, and
five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mucci said that her father retained a keen interest in
hockey in his later years and was still remembered for his rookie
feat of the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three or four letters a week,'' his daughter said,
``and it's always to Mr. Zero.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Ohio Air Force delivers aid to Mitch victims
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In this charitable season of the year, it's not
unusual for good people to deliver good things to the needy. It's
just a bit more complicated when the needy are thousands of miles
away in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Reserve, including the 445th Airlift Wing at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, is flying more 750 tons of relief
supplies to areas of Central America hit by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning they loaded 21 tons of antibiotics and other
medicines aboard a looming, gray-green C-141 transport plane at
Wright -Pat, allowed 13 news media folks to hitch a ride and took
off for a nine-hour trip to Managua, Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   That particular effort was part of an ongoing friendly
relationship between U.S. Sen. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, and Wendell
Mettey, an American Baptist preacher from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Mettey founded a relief organization, Matthew 25: Ministries,
following a trip to Nicaragua in 1990. (The verse is the one where
Jesus urges his disciples to feed the hungry, clothe the naked,
care for the sick and visit the lonely in prison.)
</P>
<P>
   DeWine can't praise Mettey's group enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a grass roots organization who obtain discounted or
seconds goods, warehouse them in Ohio, then ship them,'' the
senator said. ``The key thing is that they have an infrastructure
set up in Nicaragua, to make sure the goods get distributed
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWine, who has been to Central America many times, came to the
base Thursday to stand on the cold runway and help promote his
preacher friend's relief effort. He said it's crucial in three
ways:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nicaraguans can see no future, they're going to be coming
(illegally) to the United states,,'' DeWine said. ``The second
aspect is drugs. Nicaragua does not produce (illegal) drugs but it
can be a transshipment point. The third element is trade. If they
can develop a better middle class, they'll be better trade partners
with the U.S. ``
</P>
<P>
   In short, DeWine said he believes Central America ``is in our
back yard,'' and must be encouraged to continue its democratic
trend despite wars and natural disasters like the recent hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cargo planes were to leave Wright-Pat this week on the
same mission.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane left an estimated 4,000 dead, 2,000 missing and
420,000 people homeless in Nicaragua, according to news reports.
Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize and Costa Rica also
suffered damage.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve units from 14 air bases are participating in the relief
effort that began Nov. 7, according to the service. A law called
the Denton amendment, named in 1985 for a former prisoner of war in
Vietnam, Jeremiah Denton, permits the U.S. military to transport
humanitarian cargo overseas, on a space-available basis, at no cost
to the donor.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew:25 Ministries can be reached at P.O. Box 526, Milford OH
45150 or (513) 961-7472.

FOR ALL THAT, WOODSIDE A RUNNER-UP
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sean Woodside must have a pretty good idea what it
feels like to be Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a fine season on the NASCAR Winston West circuit in
which he won two races, two poles and finished 271 points ahead of
his nearest pursuer, the Valencia-based driver wound up the series
runner-up for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside, who also lead the most laps on the tour this season,
finished 99 points behind Palmdale's Kevin Harvick, who won the
title with five wins and five poles.
</P>
<P>
   Harvick finished third in last Saturday's Sam's Town 125in Las
Vegas. Andy Houston was the winner and Woodside was 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest finale: Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke came on hard in
Saturday's NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour season-ending Sam's
Town 90, winning the race after taking the pole.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough to move him past Steve Portenga, who won
his second season title by finishing fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Portenga, who overtook Kanke for the points lead midway through
the 16-race series, wound up with 2,315 series points to Kanke's
2,286.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke's win was his fourth of the season and his qualifying
speed, 145.177 mph, was a track record _ more than 2 mph faster
than second-place Doug McCoun.
</P>
<P>
   Shootout '99: The field is set for the NASCAR Winston Cup Bud
Shootout races that annually precede the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 25-lap races feature 1998's pole winners _ Jeff
Gordon, Mark Martin, Todd Bodine, Derrike Cope, Ricky Craven, Bobby
Hamilton, Ernie Irvan, Kenny Irwin, Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte,
Rick Mast, Jeremy Mayfield, Ken Schrader and Rusty Wallace _ and
the winner of the other 25-lap dash, contested by the fastest of
1998's second-round qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Running in the second event will be Gary Bradberry, Jeff Green,
Dave Marcis, Jerry Nadeau, Joe Nemechek, Dan Pardus, Steve Park,
Robert Pressley, Dennis Setzer, Morgan Shepherd, Mike Skinner,
Jimmy Spencer, Dick Trickle and Kenny Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Both events will be run Sunday, Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Calling all cars: Owners of classic pre-1970 sprint cars,
midgets and roadsters will meet at Rosamond's Willow Springs
International Motor Sports Park Thanksgiving weekend for the sixth
annual Walt James Vintage Race Car Gathering.
</P>
