ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Goran Ivanisevic lost to Spanish
opponent Francisco Clavet in the first round of the Italian Open
tennis tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two-time Winbledon finalist from Croatia lost the match 6-4,
3-6, 7-5, in line with his poor performance which cost him winning
chances in any tournament since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Port Said Becomes Gateway for Sino-Egyptian Maritime Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT SAID, Egypt, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese ship "Empress
Phoenix" arrived here on Monday afternoon after the signing in the
previous day of a Sino-Egyptian maritime cooperation agreement
allowing Chinese container ships to directly load and unload cargo
at Egypt's Mediterranean port of Said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement and the coming of the Chinese
container ship indicated that the maritime transportation
cooperation between the two countries has entered a new phase,
which will certainly boost bilateral cooperation in other fields,
said Mustafa Kamel, the governor of Port Said, who addressed the
welcoming ceremony at the pier.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt signed an agreement in Cairo on Sunday, which
made Port Said a distribution center for Chinese containers in the
Middle East. Egyptian Transportation Minister Ibrahim el-Demiri and
Public Business Sector Minister Mokhtar Khatab attended the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Khatab praised the agreement as one of the most important steps
to promote transit trade and attract international maritime lines.
</P>
<P>
The captain of the "Empress Phoenix" told Xinhua on Monday at
Port Said that before the signing of the agreement, Chinese
container ships had to load and unload cargo for Egypt at the
Israeli port of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
"Now, things have changed," he said, adding that there exists
great potential for further cooperation between China and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"My ship unloaded 369 containers and take up 266 containers
today at Port Said," he said, adding that the maximum loading
capacity of his ship is 3500 containers.
</P>
<P>
From now on, there will be at least one container ship from his
company, the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company, arriving at Port Said
every week, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Consul General of China Liu Rucai told Xinhua that during
the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria, Egypt last month, both
leaders called for closer economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have made one step forward," he noted.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Avoid Zimbabwe-Type Land Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will enforce
legislation permitting the appropriation of land before the
situation could deteriorate into a Zimbabwe-type crisis, the
African National Congress (ANC) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg, ANC spokesman
Smuts Ngonyama said strong progress has been made in releasing
land to black owners since a black majority government took over
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, he accused white farm owners of hiking the price of
the land to make it prohibitively expensive for black owners to
move onto the land.
</P>
<P>
Should the land handover process not be speeded up, he said,
the government would utilize land appropriation legislation to
secure the handover of land to prospective black owners.
</P>
<P>
The land issue in South Africa has been highlighted by the
crisis affecting Zimbabwe where despite more than two decades of
independence, the Harare government has failed to resolve its land
redistribution process.
</P>
<P>
The ANC said it will seek to prevent the situation in South
Africa from deteriorating to the point Zimbabwe has now reached.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to reach a point where people become totally
frustrated," Ngonyama said.
</P>
<P>
The government's land redistribution process, which means the
return of land to those from whom it had been forcibly removed
under apartheid, has struggled to get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
But the process has been slow, with 80 percent of South
Africa's land still said to be controlled or owned by whites,
Ngonyama said.

CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian authorities began on
Tuesday to question 75 students from Al-Azhar University to
investigate the protests staged on the university campus.
</P>
<P>
A team from the state security prosecution went to hospitals
earlier Tuesday to interrogate 15 students about the case, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students demonstrated on Sunday and Monday in Al-
Azhar University to protest against "Feast of the Sea Algae." They
denounced the novel, written by Syrian writer Haider Haider, as
blaspheming Islam.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators and detained
scores of students.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged the students with riots, resistance to
authorities and vandalism.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Extends no Support to Culture Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's embattled reformist Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani is the only
minister who is not supported by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, a senior conservative official stated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The leader (Khamenei) supports the person of Mr. Khatami and
his government, except (Mohajerani's) Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance," said Mohsen Rezaie, secretary of the powerful
advisory State Expediency Council (SEC), in an interview with the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The leader has been putting his weight behind Khatami's
government, he said, and if he feels the government is being
undermined, he will undoubtedly back the president and his
government, excluding Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
Rezaie's remarks hinted that the powerful conservatives intend
to remove Mohajerani who has come under intensified pressure as he
vowed to support the reformist papers, most of which were closed
down last month by the conservative judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Rezaie blamed Mohajerani for the closure of reformist papers,
saying that Mohajerani could have prevented the closure of even a
single daily in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"He should have acted earlier and bridged the gap between the
media and the system so that the press would go on with their job
while keeping in mind the sensitivity of the system," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 dailies and journals were shut down days after
Mohajerani said that he would prefer to resign to close down a
single daily in the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, conservative dailies accused the minister of
attending an alleged secret political dinner with western
diplomats. However, Mohajerani refuted the accusation by saying
that he only attended a private dinner also attended by ambassadors
of Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Oman and the representative of Egyptian
interests.
</P>
<P>
Rezaie, the former commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, also warned that opponents of the country are trying
to reverse the course of reforms in the country even at the expense
of weakening President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's oppositions in the intellectual circles both within
and outside the country would step up their attacks from now on, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the reformists, who won overwhelming victory in the
February parliamentary elections and the recent runoffs, to
distance themselves from those opposing the late supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini, the constitution, the leader and the
original principles of the revolution.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday denied a
French newspaper report that he and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat discussed a framework agreement on final-status issues at
their summit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel Radio, Barak joked that the report, which
was published in La Monde on Monday, sounds "creative and
interesting," while some of the suggestions in the story could be
examined by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
He maintained, however, that such a draft never came up on the
table when he met with Arafat, as the negotiations between them had
not yet reached such an advanced stage. (Israel-Palestinians-

<P>
In a statement issued here on Tuesday, Benjamin said that he
will organize another flight from Paris to Baghdad by taking a
Boeing passenger plane with some 300 people on board, including
politicians, parliamentary and humanitarian organization members,
as well as journalists, to protest the decade-long U.N. embargo on
Iraq. (Iraq-Flight-Embargo)

place, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a speech, Aziz stressed that the U.N. resolution has no clear
and specific program that might lead to a specific result, and
presents no solution for the sanctions imposed against the Iraqi
people ever since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no U.N. resolution prohibiting flights to
or out of Iraq, stressing that the imposition of the two so-called
no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq is "a unilateral act
perpetrated by the U.S. and Britain." (Iraq-UN Resolution)

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Immediate End to Hostilities in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday called for "an immediate cease of hostilities" between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo (
DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the 15-
nation Council, Wang Yingfan of China, said, "Members of the
Council were concerned at the reports of resumed fighting between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangali and called for an
immediate cease of the hostilities."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed their support to the
agreement of the 7th of May, between Uganda and Rwanda to withdraw
their troops from Kisangali, as a result of the mission of the
Council to the region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council welcomed the plan of reinforcement of
the U.N. presence in Kisangali in this regard," said the statement,
issued at the end of the closed-door meeting, at which the Council
was briefed on the situation of the hostilities between Uganda and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Ugandan artillery pounded the main
airport in Kisangali, one day after a U.N. Security Council
mission said Uganda and Rwanda had agreed to pull out their troops.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council mission Monday brokered a deal between
Uganda and Rwanda to hand control of DRC's third-largest city to a
U.N. force. Some 5,500 U.N. peacekeepers are expected to deploy in
DRC as part of the peace process to end the 22-month conflicts in
which five foreign armies are entangled.
</P>

Uganda and Rwanda backed rebels opposed to President Laurent
Kabila, supported by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Peru, China Bilateral Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China and Peru is up 500
percent during the last ten years, Peru's Foreign Ministry
Economic Promotion Office said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade with China, considered among the main powers of the
new century, has increased from over 70.664 million U.S. dollars
in 1990 to 416.959 million dollars in 1999," said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Promotion Office, during this period
the trade balance between both countries tilted in favor of Peru,
despite this country's ascending curve decrease during the last
two years, as a result of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Of last year's figures, about 215.495 millions are exports, and
nearly 20.464 millions of imports for Peru..
</P>
<P>
The most important products exported to China are fish meal,
copper, iron, lead, molibenum and many other sea products.
</P>
<P>
Given commercial opportunities in China, the Economic Promotion
Office pointed out the importance of the enormous Asian market.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the government organization offers information
to many different trade organizations and representatives of the
public sector from both countries with the aim of fostering the
Sino-Peruvian commercial exchange.
</P>
<P>
Peru's Foreign Ministry also forecasts that a consulate will be
set up in the very important commercial zone of Shanghai, with the
aim of entering the gigantic Asian market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pentagon Official on Next NMD Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I'm increasingly confident that we will be able to do this on
the next flight test, Ronald Kadish, who heads the Pentagon's
National Missile Defense Organization (NMDO), told reporters of
the plan to try again to hit a dummy warhead with a projectile
weapon in space over the Pacific Ocean on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The previous test, on January 18, performed as expected until
the final few seconds of flight. Heat-seeking devices aboard the
interceptor rocket, which enable the rocket to "see" its target,
malfunctioned because of a plumbing problem.
</P>
<P>
"That particular problem, I think -- barring a real stupid
mistake -- is under control," Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
If the schedule does not slip, President Bill Clinton is
expected to use the results of the June test along with January's
failure and a successful shot last October to make a decision late
this year on whether to begin immediately building the defense
system in Alaska State.
</P>
<P>
In the event the June test fails, there will be another attempt
this fall -- probably in October, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
The NMD is designed to provide protection for all U.S. states
against ballistic missile attacks from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said U.S. decision to set up the NMD would
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and aggravate the
arms race, thus affecting world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Preparing New Environment Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced Tuesday
that it is preparing a new environment strategy aimed at
integrating environmental concerns into its mainstream poverty
alleviation and economic development efforts.
</P>
<P>
The draft strategy was presented to the Council of the Global
Environment Facility on Monday. Over the next six months, there
will be consultations with client country governments, non-
governmental organizations and other partners around the world,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The bank has moved away from `do-no-harm' policies towards an
approach to environment that places poverty alleviation front and
center," said Ian Johnson, vice president of the World Bank's
Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network.
</P>
<P>
The proposed strategy emphasizes the importance of taking a
comprehensive approach, one based on strong local ownership and a
wide range of partnerships. It also calls for a fresh look at the
bank's policies on environmental safeguards, guidelines, regional
environmental strategies, environmental sector work, and sector
strategies such as the forest and water sectors.
</P>
<P>
The central thrust of the proposed strategy is that poverty
reduction is possible only if the environment is able to provide
the services people depend on, and if natural resources are used
in a manner that does not undermine long-term development, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to finalize the strategy by December 2000.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Uganda Sign Investment Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Uganda Tuesday
signed an agreement on promotion and protection of investments
following a treaty to avoid double taxation two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here by South African Public
Enterprise Minister Jeff Radebe and Ugandan Minister of State for
Finance Gabriel Opio.
</P>
<P>
Opio, speaking at the Uganda Investment Conference held here on
Tuesday, said the agreement aims to enhance trade and investment
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries are expected to sign a bilateral trade
agreement in July, " he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Opio, Uganda continues to be a "front-runner" in
Africa for inward investment. The flow of investment to Africa
during 1993-1997 increased by about 54 percent and Uganda was one
of the beneficiaries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as one of the few African countries that have no
restrictions on capital transfers, Uganda allows foreign investors
100 percent foreign ownership of investment and provides them the
freedom to bring in and take their capital out of the country.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Radebe said the signing of the agreement is seen
by South Africa as setting the basis and framework within which
exports and investments can take off.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa would also like to take part in investment
ventures that will come about as a result of the privatization
program and investment in infrastructure development projects in
Uganda," he said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Improve Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Southern African tourism operators
and international buyers attending an African Tourism Exchange in
Victoria Falls last week said that the political and social
problems facing the region should be resolved to improve tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released here on Tuesday by the
African Tourism Exchange (AFTEX), more than 250 people attended
the tourism exchange which was created to provide a showcase for
the tourism products and the potential of southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
If problems besieging the region could be solved in the
short-term, this would help improve the damage caused to tourism
and turn around the downward trend in tourist arrivals, the
delegates said.
</P>
<P>
"No one is underestimating the severity of the situation
resulting from international coverage given to the civil unrest
in Zimbabwe, the floods in Mozambique, the crime in South Africa
and the security problems in northern Namibia," they said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors from Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, South
Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe attended the five-day exchange
and held discussions on tourism issues, mainly the decline in
tourist arrivals being experienced in Zimbabwe and other countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to deal with factors causing the
negative portrayal of the region and thereby deterring foreign
visitors, the delegates said, urging for regional cooperation to
source markets and information on the status of tourism in each
country.
</P>
<P>
"There was a general feeling that cooperation between all the
tourism authorities and industries of southern Africa would
result in an improved promotional opportunity for the whole
region," they said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Gov't Not Benefit from Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government said
the recent debt cancellation by international lenders, though
relieved some debt payment, failed to bring additional income to
the government's coffer.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released Tuesday by the Tanzanian
Ministry of Finance, the amount collected through revenue for
external debt servicing will now be directed towards social
services which includes infrastructure, education, health,
agriculture, water and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
It further clarified that the debt release is granted in stages
and the actual relief comes when part of the debt cancelled
matures for payment. The relief is to be directed towards war
against poverty and other development activities aimed at bringing
sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The statement also revealed that Tanzania will continue to
serve several categories of debt, which includes an average of
21.9 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 27.4 million U.S. dollars)
annually for the World Bank in a period of twenty years.
</P>
<P>
Besides, on an annual basis, some 10.7 billion shillings (about
13.4 million dollars) will be paid to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in ten years, while 26 billion shillings (about 32.5
million dollars) will be allocated to serve debts owed to Paris
Club. The government will use an additional average of 70 billion
shillings (about 87.5 million dollars) annually for internal debt
servicing, read the statement. A recent joint analysis done by the
government in collaboration with international financial
institutions has discovered that by June 1999, Tanzania had an
outstanding external debt amounting to 6.38 billion dollars.
Early last month, the World Bank and the IMF reached a joint
decision to grant Tanzania a debt relief totaling 2 billion U.S.
dollars under an enhanced version of the international community's
Highly Indebted Poor Countries' initiative, which is designed for
debtor nations with a strong track record of economic reforms.

<P>
LUANDA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 2 million people, mainly women
and children in the central and eastern parts of Angola, are
suffering from the endemic goitre, an official source said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Luanda, the provinces of Bie, Lunda-norte,
Lunda-sul and Cuando Cubango are the most seriously affected
regions.
</P>
<P>
The insufficient use of the iodized salt, the restricted flow
of goods and the poor development of the Angolan commercial
network were listed as the main causes of the prevalence of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, the suggestion of adding iodine to salt
produced in Angola has already been accepted by some private
companies located in the central Benguela province, where 40
percent of the locally produced salt comes from.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has provided some iodizing and packing machines, bags
and iodine potassium to salt plants in the capital city Luanda and
the Benguela province.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Angola adopted a bill to advise for the addition of
potassium iodine to salt for the human and animal consumption.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has pledged
to support the continuing efforts of Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba in mediating for peace in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) .
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering to mark Europe Day here on Tuesday, EU
delegation leader Jochen Krebs said the peace process has become
even more important today, when the Southern African Development
Community is again being reminded of the need to implement urgent
reforms in order to finally overcome the scars of history.
</P>
<P>
The EU is ready to assist the region in this process to prevent
 instability which would result in a withdrawal of international
confidence and damage the Southern African economies, Krebs said.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU is pleased to note the determination of the
Zambian government towards a Free Trade Area to be sealed by the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) summit
later this year in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Krebs expressed the hope that the friendship between the EU and
Zambia would continue to have fruits for the mutual benefit of the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of President Chiluba, Agriculture Minister
Suresh Desai said Zambia has made great progress in the Economic
Adjustment program and the only problem now is the high poverty
levels that exist in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government is doing everything possible to reduce poverty
levels, he said. According to Desai, Zambia has placed 90
percent of its economy in the hands of the private sector. He
thanked the EU for all the support it offered to the country.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Views Egypt as Leading Mideast, African Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Denmark views Egypt as the most
important country in the Middle East and Africa, said a visiting
Danish minister here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt holds a unique position in the world arena and plays a key
role in Arab politics and in mediating the Arab-Israeli peace
talks, Danish International Cooperation Minister Jan Troejborg said
after meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the leading country in the Middle East and Africa,
considering its political, economic and military weight in helping
safeguard regional peace and stability, Troejborg told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that Denmark encourages partnership between the
European Union (EU) and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU are close to reaching a partnership agreement
on further developing cooperation in the political, economic, trade
and security fields.
</P>
<P>
Troejborg, who arrived in Egypt on Saturday, said that his
meeting with Obeid addressed a number of proposals on developing
cooperation in various areas. But he did not give the details.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed means of increasing the bilateral
trade volume and Denmark's aid to Egypt for social development and
environmental protection, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and International
Cooperation Ahmed el-Darsh, who also attended the meeting, said
that Denmark has offered Egypt 180 million Egyptian pounds (52.17
million U.S. dollars) in grants so far this year for environmental
protection projects and the el Zafarana wind power plant on the Rea
Sea coast.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the only Arab and Middle East country that gets
development aid from Denmark. Since 1989, the Northern European
kingdom has granted Egypt 1 billion pounds (about 290 million
dollars) for its water, sanitary, energy and environmental
protection projects.

<HEADLINE> Another European Plane to be in Baghdad to Protest U.N. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Benjamin, the French
priest who broke the embargo on Iraq last month by taking a direct
flight from Amman, capital of Jordan, to Baghdad, has declared that
he will organize another flight to Baghdad with much more people on
board.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Tuesday, Benjamin said that he
will organize another flight from Paris to Baghdad by taking a
Boeing passenger plane with some 300 people on board, including
politicians, parliamentary and humanitarian organization members,
as well as journalists, to protest the decade-long U.N. embargo on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, along with other three people from Italy, arrived in
Baghdad on April 3, becoming the first group flying to Baghdad
without getting U.N. permission after the U.N. imposed embargo on
Iraq since the latter's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, also a film maker, said that he has been working for
three years to produce a number of films depicting the sweeping
impacts of the decade-long sanctions, the plight of the Iraqi
people and the almost-daily aggressions on Iraq by the U.S. and
British warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that as many as 1.2 million people, mostly
children and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The French priest, who is a resident in Italy, said that some
pro-Iraq Italian figures have called for an investigation about the
use of depleted uranium bombs by the U.S. and Britain against Iraq
during the 1991 Gulf War, terming it "a crime committed against the
Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that the radioactivity from the depleted
uranium bombs used by the U.S. and British forces in the Gulf War
was the main cause for the increase of Iraq's cancer patients, the
number of which reached 4,341 in 1991 and 6,158 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebels to Boycott Negotiations with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The major rebel group in southern Sudan
will boycott the next round of negotiations with the government,
the group leader said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) would not take
part in the new round of talks with the Sudanese government,
sponsored by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development, or IGAD, SPLM leader John Garang told reporters after
meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Garang, who is currently on a visit in Cairo, said his movement
took the decision to protest government's bombing of civilian
targets in the SPLM-controlled areas in southern and eastern Sudan
and Nuba mountains.
</P>
<P>
The SPLM and some other factions have been fighting since 1983
for greater autonomy from the Islamic government in Khartoum for
the mostly Christian and animist south. IGAD has been mediating
between the two sides but made little progress.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the five-point peace plan proposed jointly by
Egypt and Libya last year, Garang said that his movement backs the
initiative aimed at helping realize national reconciliation in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Sudanese National Democratic Alliance, of which
SPLM is a member, has endorsed the initiative's goal of achieving
peace and stability in Sudan, the rebel leader said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on helping make peace in Sudan and maintain the
territorial integrity of its southern neighbor as a possible
disintegration of the African largest country would endanger its
major water source, the Nile.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Hopes for Security in Lebanon following Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Tuesday expressed hope that security will prevail in Lebanon
following the planned Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
Khatami said the Iranian nation and government are proud of the
Lebanese resistance against the Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Terming Lebanon as a center of the Islamic and Arab culture, he
said that the Iranian nation and government are always with the
Lebanese nation and the Islamic resistance against Israel, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami underlined that as long as the Israeli regime continues
its aggression against Lebanon and the Palestinian people have not
been repatriated, the nations in the Middle East cannot have peace
of mind.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Tehran-Beirut ties, he said the recent visit of
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud to Tehran is a turning point in the
bilateral relations and the positive effects of the visit will
emerge in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that "in case of peace, we will face numerous
problems with the Israeli regime because Israel seeks to exercise
influence in the region and interfere in the internal affairs of
the Arab and Muslim nations."
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the support of the Muslim nations to Lebanon,
saying that the honor of driving the Israeli forces from Lebanon
lies with those who dedicated their blood for the cause.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in Cairo for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Cairo Tuesday evening for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to meet with Arafat Wednesday morning,
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdi al Qedra said earlier
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Mubarak on his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday in the West Bank town of Ramallah, al
Qedra was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak failed in the meeting to find means of breaking
the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks on the
thorniest issues, including Jerusalem, final borders, settlements
and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will also keep Mubarak posted on his recent visits to
France and Portugal and his talks with leaders of the two
countries, said the Palestinian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Portugal holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.
The 15-nation European bloc and its member states, especially
France, sympathize with Arab countries' stances in their peace
negotiations with Israel and have been exerting efforts to help
push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Egypt comes within the context of his constant
coordination and consultations with Mubarak in a bid to remove
difficulties and exchange views on problems facing the peace march,
al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Cairo to seek advice on the peace talks
from Mubarak, who, as the leader of the first Arab country to sign
a peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284 "Bad": Iraqi Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz on Tuesday dismissed the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284
as "bad" and "a diplomatic maneuver" aimed at keeping the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq in place, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a speech, Aziz stressed that the U.N. resolution has no clear
and specific program that might lead to a specific result, and
presents no solution for the sanctions imposed against the Iraqi
people ever since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no U.N. resolution prohibiting flights to
or out of Iraq, stressing that the imposition of the two so-called
no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq is "a unilateral act
perpetrated by the U.S. and Britain."
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Britain imposed the two air exclusion zones after the
1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the Kurds and
Shiite Muslims from the forces of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also called upon the countries incurring losses due to the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq to take advantage of the U.N. Charter
Article 50 and develop trade relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 50, the countries suffering losses from
sanctions on Iraq can get compensation from maintaining trade ties
with Iraq, as an exemption from the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly voiced its rejection to the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 1284, which created the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission to resume the U.N. arms
inspection on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The inspection has been suspended since December 1998 when the
U.S. and Britain launched the Desert Fox Operation air strikes
against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> One Injured in U.S., British Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- One civilian was injured in bombings
by U.S. and British warplanes in northern Iraq on Tuesday,
announced an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:50 local time (0650 GMT), nine
formations of U.S. and British warplanes made 16 sorties over the
northern provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil, bombing civilian
and service facilities and injuring one person.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defense artillery opened fire at the enemy planes and
forced them to flee back to their bases in Turkey, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a total of
20,961 armed sorties over the two so-called no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes patrol the no-fly zones in the north and
south of Iraq in what they maintain as an effort to protect the
Kurdish population in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
The zones have been the site of almost-daily skirmishes since
the airstrikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the zones, imposed on Iraq after the
1991 Gulf War, which was triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. However, the zones are not directly covered by any U.N.
resolution.

<HEADLINE> UN Refugee Agency Calls for More Donor Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) has warned that it will be forced to freeze
aid implementation agreements with partner agencies as its cash
availability has fallen to the lowest in almost ten years.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to its main donors, the UN refugee agency said on
Monday that it expected a shortfall this year of nearly 150
million U.S. dollars. It warned that its current cash problems
would inevitably lead to interruptions in the agency's programs
world-wide which will then be difficult to re-start, once the flow
of contributions has resumed.
</P>
<P>
This year began very well, UNHCR said. By January 19 the agency
received an unusually high 19 percent of its annual budget of 965
million dollars which had been approved by UNHCR's Executive
Committee, the agency's governing body.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that the level of contributions subsequently
fell sharply. By April 1, only 24 percent of the agency's
requirements had been met, as opposed to over 30 percent the year
before.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has long argued that early and flexible funding pledges
and cash contributions are vital to ensure the continuity of the
agency's work and to maintain its stand-by capacity to respond
quickly to fresh crises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary Confident in Approval of PNTR with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We feel confident that we can get 218 votes" needed for the
passage of the Congress bill though there are still "a lot of work
to do", Daley told a press conference held by the American Council
of Life Insurers (AClI).
</P>
<P>
He said PNTR with China is not only an economic and commercial
issue, but also a large issue concerning U.S. future relationship
with China and Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a "negative statement" if the U.S. sends a
wrong message to the rest of world on the PNTR issue.
</P>
<P>
House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, speaking on the
same occasion, also expressed his confidence in the passage of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will win," he said, adding that PNTR
with China "is the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
Dreier, who is also House PNTR Task Force Chairman, said it is
a "win-win-win" situation for "fairness", for U.S. business and
workers if Congress passes the bill.
</P>
<P>
Both Delay and Dreier refused to give figures of the House
representatives who support the PNTR bill.
</P>
<P>
"The Republican Party is solidly behind the move," Dreier said,
adding that they are encouraging those undecided members to join
their effort.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Carroll A. Cambell, President and CEO of American
Council of Life Insurers, and Sy Sternberg, President of New York
Life Insurance Co., also called for approval of PNTR with China.
</P>
<P>
Cambell said at the press conference that with trade
liberalization, China will emerge as the world's biggest single
market.
</P>
<P>
"If America wants to remain a major player in an increasingly
global marketplace, it simply cannot afford to shut itself out of
that market -- especially when our competitors overseas are ready
and eager to enter that market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sternberg said that for almost a quarter of a century, Congress
has been granting normal trade relations status to China annually -
- the same status it has given to 135 nations on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
"Under normal circumstances, it would simply be a matter of
common sense to end this yearly debate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Insists on Adding Rapid Reaction Force to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday insisted on having a rapid reaction force in Sierra
Leone to back up U.N. peacekeeping force, which is not up to the
strength authorized by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan, speaking to the press upon his arrival in the U.N.
Headquarters in New York, said, "At this stage we have a U.N.
force which is not up to strength. The ideal is to get it up to
strength and the Rapid Reaction Force would have backed up the
force on the ground."
</P>
<P>
Annan appealed to the international community to have the
rapid reaction force, but the Wester countries, which have the
sophisticated means to transport well-trained and well-equipped
troops into Sierra Leone from a long distance, failed to respond
positively to such an appeal.
</P>
<P>
The United States said that it would offer logistic help to
ship U.N. peacekeepers into the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown, British
paratroops began arriving to evacuate British and European Union
citizens. The United Nations, the United States and international
relief organizations, such as the World Food Program, were
withdrawing most of their employees as the situation grew
increasingly unstable in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least four people were killed and dozens wounded Monday in
Freetown when troops loyal to rebel leader Foday Sankoh fired into
a group of demonstrators who were calling for an end to the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, the British forces are now on the ground, even
though the primary objective is to lift British nationals out,"
Annan said. "I think their presence is going to be helpful."
</P>
<P>
"They are coordinating very effectively and closely with our
people and I think that cooperation is going to be helpful," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
Central at issue is the safety of the U.N. peacekeepers held
by the Revolutionary United Front and the peace agreement signed
by Sankoh and the Sierra Leonean Government in July last year.
</P>
<P>
"Basically our concern over the last few days has been to get
our people to safety and these bigger issues of where do we go
from here, whom are we dealing with, who are our interlocutors,
what is status of the peace agreement, all that is something we
are looking at," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Annan said he has been in contact with West African
leaders, including the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who
is convening a summit in the Nigerian capital of Abuja Tuesday to
discuss the latest situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I am waiting to see what comes out from Abuja," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> UK's Phoenix Takes Over Rover From BMW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The German car giant has said it will shut the plant in
Birmingham by the end of this month, with the potential loss of
more than 20000 jobs, if a suitable buyer is not found.
</P>
<P>
Initially, BMW rejected an approach by Phoenix because it did
not believe the consortium had enough financial backing.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix led by former Rover chief executive John Towers, will
pay a symbolic 10 pounds for Rover. However, BMW will give it 500
million pounds (767 million US dollars) in repayable credits to
cover the costs of restructuring.
</P>

<HEADLINE> McCain Endorses Bush For Presidential Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Arizona Senator John McCain
Tuesday endorsed his rival George W. Bush for his presidential
campaign two months after their bitter primary battle.
</P>
<P>
McCain said he looked forward to "enthusiastically campaigning"
for the likely Republican presidential nominee, but asked not to
be considered as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
"I endorse Governor Bush,'' McCain, who once competed bitterly
for Republican presidential nominee with Bush, announced at a
press conference after a 90-minute private meeting with Bush in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to enthusiastically campaigning for Governor
Bush for the next six months," McCain said, calling the Texas
governor the most qualified candidate to be president.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is very important that we restore integrity to
the White House," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
"By the way, I enthusiastically accept," said Bush, who
desperately needs McCain's help to court independent-minded voters
and unite the Republican Party for a tough race against Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
But the two acknowledged they still have differences. They
reportedly agree on a need for reforms in education, Social
Security and campaign finance laws, but clash on tax cut and
campaign finance reform.

UNITED NATIONS, May 9(Xinhua) -- The Special Rapporteur of the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Kamal Hossain, on
Tuesday appealed to Afghan sides not to resume armed conflict and
to avoid violations.
</P>

"I am extremely concerned that, despite repeated calls for a

reports are being received that preparations are underway for a
military offensive by both sides involved in the armed conflict in
Afghanistan," Hossain said.

<P>
"Armed conflicts inevitably lead to grave violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law and inflict enormous
suffering on civilians, in particular women and children," Hossain
said.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to both sides in Afghanistan to be aware of the
above concerns and to refrain from resumption of armed conflict
and in all events to avoid the types of violations that have
characterized past offensives,' Hossain added.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Hears Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lockerbie trial
on Tuesday heard of police officers testifying on wreckage
fragments that led to the finding of a suitcase appeared to have
been blown by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector Duncan McInnes told the court when asked by
the prosecution that the fragments in plastic bags were fragments
of a suitcase appeared to have been blown in an explosion.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that evidence collection and labeling could not
cope well with the vast quantity of aircraft wreckage and debris
brought in by helicopters and trucks after the December 21,1988,
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the amount of wreckage, it was not feasible to log
everything as it came in," said the police inspector.
</P>
<P>
McInnes was testifying in the trial of two Libyans Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah who were accused with
bombing the New York-bound airliner, killing 259 people aboard and
11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The police inspector told the court that the fragments of the
suitcase were found during an eight-men line search in a
Newcastleton forest a few kilometers away from Lockerbie between
March and May 1989.
</P>
<P>
McInnes recognized a label he himself wrote at the time that
read "possibly from the bomb case". The piece is a bronze-colored
rubber rim.
</P>
<P>
But the defense counsel asserted that it is difficult for an
investigator to make sure where and when a piece of evidence was
found and who found it.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers were questioning the reliability of
evidence brought in by the prosecution in an attempt to carefully
build its case on the two Libyan accused.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that went underway last Wednesday, is expected to
last at least a year. It is being held at a special Scottish
court under the Scots Law. The court is situated in a former
United States air force base in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the two accused would be sentenced to life
imprisonment and serve their jail terms in Scotland. If not
guilty or the case could not be proved against them, the accused
would go free.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Presidents Join Clinton in Urging Congress to Approve PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton asked the former government officials, academics and
business leaders to tell the congressmen they know to vote for the
PNTR, stressing that it is in the political, economic and security
interests of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"What I would like to ask all of you to do when you leave here
is to pick somebody you know in the Congress and call them and
tell them what we're all saying to one another today," Clinton
told the event in the East Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we want the voice of this meeting to echo across the
country and to embrace the Congress. I wish it weren't a fight,
but it is," he added.
</P>
<P>
The distinguished guests include former secretaries of state,
Henry Kissinger, James Baker, Alexander Haig and Warren
Christopher and former defense secretaries, Robert McNamara, James
Schlesinger and other senior former officials.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other members of the cabinet also attended the event.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that a negative vote of Congress for the PNTR
legislation will cause severe immediate consequences for the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"If the Congress votes against it, they'll be kicking
themselves in the rear 10 years from now because America will be
paying the price, and I believe the price will start to be paid
not 10 years from now, not even 10 months from now, but
immediately," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We all know it's the right decision, and virtually 100 percent
of the people at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue know it's
the right decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his support for the legislation, Ford said
bipartisan "comparable cooperation" is "absolutely mandatory" in
case of the PNTR legislation.
</P>
<P>
"I am highly honored to join President Clinton, Carter and
other distinguished individuals urging very strongly affirmative
action in the Congress on PNTR," Ford said.
</P>
<P>
"The facts are, a negative vote in the House and or the Senate
would be catastrophic, disastrous, to American agriculture, in
electronics, telecommunications, autos and countless other
products and services," Ford noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. national security and foreign policy interests are
enhanced by "increased interaction" with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Carter, under whose administration the United States and China
established official diplomatic relationship in 1979, also urged
congressmen who care about the human rights in China to vote for
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this issue
in the Congress will be a serious setback and impediment for the
further democratization, freedom and human rights in China,"
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing the meeting, Kissinger stressed that "
cooperative relations with China are in the American national
interests." "Every president for 30 years has come to that
conclusion."

<HEADLINE> Georgian Parliament Boycott Ends With Lawmakers' Repentance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A boycott that broke out Monday in
Georgian parliament ended with collective repentance by mass
lawmakers from the parliamentary majority to President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Shevardnadze on Monday evening, virtually all
parliamentary majority deputies said they had been misled and had
not meant the start of an impeachment procedure by suggesting the
creation of a special parliamentary commission to inquire the
causes of failure to implement the country's budget for last year.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze accepted the lawmakers' apologies and instructed
Parliament Chairman Zurab Zhvaniya to settle the extraordinary
situation.
</P>
<P>
"A different kind of behavior could be expected from
parliamentary majority representatives," said the president, cited
by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Monday at a meeting of the legislature, chairpersons of nine
committees of Georgian parliament announced collective resignation
due to confrontation between parliament leader Zurab Zhvaniya and
them.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers began collecting signatures last week, demanding
that a criminal case be opened against government members guilty
of the failure of the implementation of last year's budget.
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya on Sunday scolded the parliament members for what he
called activities inconsistent with the line of the leading party
in parliament, Union of Georgia's Citizens party. He wanted the
collection of signatures stopped but the parliament members
rejected his order.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary majority leader Mikhail Saakashvili suggested
that a group of national oligarchs provoked the scandal in a bid
to prevent Georgy Arsenishvili from being appointed to the post of
state minister.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says Palestine Refugees "Special Cause" for U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Tuesday that Palestine refugees have been a special
cause for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the an exhibition of 75
photos vividly portraying the lives of Palestine refugees and the
work of the special United Nations agencies established 50 years
ago to assist them, Annan urged the international community to
ensure adequate funding for the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which
began its humanitarian operations in May 1, 1950.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief paid tribute to the refugees themselves and to
the men and women of UNRWA, especially its Palestinian staff, "for
the magnificent work they have done under trying circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"I call on the international community to ensure that UNRWA has
the resources it needs to keep up with the growth and rising needs
of the refugees community," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the agency relied entirely on voluntary funding
and had been beset by an almost constant financial crisis in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"These are uncertain times in the Middle East, and no people
feel this uncertainty more acutely than do the Palestine refugees,
who today number more than three million," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is my fervent hope that the refugee issue, which is on the
agency of the 'final status'talks that are now under way, can be
resolved as soon as possible. The United Nations stand ready to
play its part in that process," the U.N. chief added.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA was set up by the United Nations General Assembly to
assist about three-quarters of a million Palestinians who
displaced from their homes and land during the first Arab-Israeli
war in 1948-49.
</P>
<P>
Today, UNRWA provides basic education, health care, relief and
social services for more than 3.7 million registered refugees
living in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA also supports community-based poverty alleviation, income
generation and microcredit lending program to encourage refugee
self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman on National and Traditional Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua)-- The view that difference between
cultures of different nationalities is the source of conflict is
totally wrong, a senior Chinese leader said here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is also absolutely wrong to discriminate against instead of
respecting the difference between cultures of different
nationalities," said Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference who is now here for a six-day friendly official visit.
</P>
<P>
"Just because that culture of each nationality has different
characteristics, the human society has thus become varied and
colorful, which leads to the requirement of exchange and
cooperation between cultures of different nationalities," said Li
while meeting with Andrienne Clarkson, governor general of Canada.
</P>
<P>
It has been an important issue for Chinese government to study
how to treat the culture of each nationality and traditional
culture properly. For China, Li said, culture of a nationality is
an important form of existence of the nationality and also a
component and valuable treasure of the whole culture of the
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Li urged that people must adopt a scientific attitude toward
the traditional culture of their own nationality. They should not
be pedantic and cherish the outmoded and preserve the outworn nor
be ignorant of the history of their own country and reject all of
it.
</P>
<P>
The current world is changing rapidly, he said. It has been
only possible for traditional culture to be boosted up to a new
glory after it has been entertwined together with the contemporary
world and broken through boldly the out of dated thoughts so that
it can absorb nutrition from vivid social practices, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation of the governor general for her long
time efforts in developing cultural cause and said that Canada is
a country comprised with various nationalities and has good
experience in the harmonious co-existence between different
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to strengthen cultural exchange with Canada
so that to make common effort to push forward the progress of the
civilization of the mankind, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Clarkson told her guest that Canada respects Chinese culture
and it has fostered great interest in the historic culture of
China.

JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
announced on Tuesday that it will launch investigation into the
chlorine gas leak at the Polifin factory south of Durban last
week.
</P>
<P>
At least 130 people, including schoolchildren, have been sent
to hospital to receive medical treatment after the chlorine gas
leak last Friday. The factory has been closed so far.

internal probe was complete.
</P>
<P>
Children and teachers from two secondary schools nearby were

<HEADLINE> S. African Health Officials Link HIV with AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Two senior South African health
 officials said on Tuesday that they believed the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS, defying President Thabo
Mbeki's suspicion on their links.
</P>
<P>
The director-general of the Health Department, Ayanda Ntsaluba,
and the head of the department's AIDS directorate, Nono Similela,
both said there is a link between HIV and AIDS, a theory that
caused a controversy at a recent meeting of international AIDS
experts.
</P>
<P>
South African President Mbeki earlier opened questioned the
links between HIV and AIDS, and has aroused worldwide dispute
about this issue.
</P>
<P>
The officials' statements came on the first day of the
parliamentary health committee's hearings on HIV/AIDS, and
followed the first meeting at the weekend of a
government-appointed advisory panel of international scientists
that discussed the cause of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Some dissidents at the panel denied any connection between HIV
and AIDS, or even that HIV exists -- an approach which orthodox
scientists say holds disastrous implications for any AIDS
prevention campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ntsaluba said one had to "begin to blur" the line between
dissident and orthodox views, and bring to bear all expertise,
regardless of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Challenged by New National Party health spokesman Kobus Gous on
whether he believed HIV caused AIDS, Ntsaluba said he had been
taught this and believed it.
</P>
<P>
However, he also believed the impact of the disease on the
African continent was such that "we need to better understand what
is going on".
</P>
<P>
He said that he also believed there were many other
complicating factors in immune deficiency on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Similela, in her reply to Gous, did not directly answer the
question, saying only that she had been taught there was a virus
which caused AIDS, but that what worried her about the epidemic
was that it was "definitely different" in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Questioned after the hearing on whether she believed there was
a link, she replied "of course I do".
</P>
<P>
She told the committee that since the AIDS panel was initiated,
she had not had any directive from her seniors to change the
strategies followed by her unit.
</P>
<P>
Scientific debate and discussion did not undermine these
interventions, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ntsaluba said the media had followed a "very simplistic"
approach to the dissidents, and nothing could be further from the
truth than to suggest the only thing that bound them was doubt on
the link between HIV and AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Hydroelectric Workers Threat to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 900 workers at the Cahora Bassa
dam and hydroelectric complex (HCB) in the western Mozambican
province of Tete are threatening to go on strike as from Wednesday
to demand the same rights for Mozambican workers as those granted
to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Radio Mozambique Tuesday cited sources from the largest
hydroelectric plant in Africa as saying that if the strike goes
ahead, there will be a risk of flooding in the Zambezi Valley, and
neighboring Zimbabwe may be deprived of Cahora Bassa electricity.
</P>
<P>
Trying to find a solution to their differences, the HCB board
of directors met with the company's Trade Union Committee on
Monday and Tuesday, but no progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the employers pleaded with the workers to
ensure that at least 150 of them stay on duty if the strike is to
go ahead so as to ensure the basic services for the functioning of
the company.
</P>
<P>
The workers also demanded to sack the chairman of the company's
board of directors, Hermenegildo Gamito, who is a member of
parliament for the ruling Frelimo (Mozambique Liberation Front).
</P>
<P>
HCB, located on Rio Zambeze, was built in early 1970s. It
supplies electricity not only to Mozambique, but also to Zimbabwe
and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the shares in HCB is owned by the Portuguese
 government while the remainder is owned by the Mozambican
government.

JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
called on Tuesday all the Israelis to make every effort to find a
way to achieve security and peace.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to bereaved families in remembrance of fallen
soldiers on Memorial Day, Barak said "it is our duty to do our
utmost to find any way to put an end of the bloody and terrible
conflict, to bring home our boys from Lebanon and to promise them
and the next generations peace and security."
</P>
<P>
From Tuesday morning, tens of thousands of Israelis filled 42
military cemeteries across the country to attend official
ceremonies remembering the 19,109 soldiers and officers who have
been killed in duties since Israel's independence in May 1948.
</P>
<P>
Motorists stopped their cars and pedestrians halted where they
stood for two minutes across Israel in the morning as sirens wailed
in remembrance of the fallen soldiers and officers.
</P>
<P>
Barak and President Ezer Weizman attended a ceremony at
Jerusalem's Mount Herzl.
</P>
<P>
Barak, also Defense Minister, has vowed to pull the Israeli
troops out from south Lebanon by July 7, with or without a peace
agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"When we have been forced to defend our land and people we did
not hesitate. Now we won't spare any efforts to reach peace and
security for the sake of the memories of our dear ones who are not
able to be with us as new hope unfolds," Barak said in the letter.

the West Bank and Gaza Strip for security reasons during the

He said the two countries signed an agreement on visa exemption
for holders of ordinary passports, which is expected to make
travels between the two peoples easier and relations between them
closer.

The agreement, expected to boost tourism, allows citizens of
the two countries to travel for a month in the other country
without a visa.
</P>

They agreed that any cooperation, be it on the governmental
level or even between exporters themselves, should be carried out
in a way that will benefit rice growers of both countries.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to strengthen law enforcement on the fight
against drugs and narcotics.
</P>
<P>

HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean war veterans' leader
Chenjerai Hunzvi Tuesday called on the government to speed up the

Dunn is the third white commercial farmer to be killed since
last month and at least 18 other people have been killed in

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Government

<HEADLINE> HK Unveils New Plan to Tackle Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government Tuesday
unveiled a new action plan to tackle air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The plan, finalized after a series of top-level meetings last
week chaired by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, was endorsed by the
Executive Council at its meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The package includes new measures that will significantly
reduce air pollution caused by diesel vehicle emissions, and
financial incentives that encourage the introduction of
environmentally-friendly hybrid fuel vehicles or those powered by
natural gas or fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, all government diesel vehicles are required to
use ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD), which reduces particulate
emissions by 10-30 percent per vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The package encourages the use of ULSD by all diesel vehicles
through a competitive pump price.
</P>
<P>
Other new initiatives include incentive for replacing older
vehicles with more environmentally friendly vehicles and incentive
scheme for the introduction of hybrid, natural gas or fuel cell
powered vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The package also requires petrol stations to install fuel pump
vapor recovery systems to prevent the escape of hydrocarbon vapors
into the atmosphere and reinforce vapor recovery measures
introduced last year for underground storage tanks.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the initiatives over the next two to
three years will reduce vehicle particulate emissions in the main
urban area by 70 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by more than
19 percent, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
"It marks the government's determination to clean up Hong Kong'
s air," said Secretary for Environment and Food Lily Yam of the
new plan.
</P>
<P>
Government officials will attend a Legislative Council Joint
Panel meeting on Friday to explain the new measures and answer
questions on details and implementation of the new plan.

<HEADLINE> China's Petroleum Industry to Maintain Growth in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Intensified exploration and use of
new technology will ensure sustainable growth of China's petroleum
industry in the next century, an industry expert predicted today.
</P>
<P>
At an ongoing seminar on development strategy for China's oil
and gas industry in the 21st century, Zhai Guangming, an
academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that China's
petroleum industry will maintain its growth momentum in the new
century, thanks to new discoveries in veteran oilfields,
intensified exploitation in underdeveloped areas, massive
utilization of natural gas resources and other conventional
resources.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while refuting a prevailing assertion that
China's oil resources will be used up after the year 2039.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhai, China has abundant oil resources, with
onshore oil resources mainly in Songliao basin, Bohai Gulf basin
and the central and western areas. Yet most oil-bearing areas are
underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China's cumulative proven onshore oil
reserves added up to 19.31 billion tons, amounting to 27.8 percent
of the total geological reserves. The corresponding proven gas
reserves totaled 1.74 trillion cubic meters, representing a mere 5.
7 percent of the national total reserves. Geological complexity
decides that growth in proven reserves can only come about
gradually, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhai noted that China's ultimate recoverable oil reserves total
16 billion tons, which is calculated on the basis of the economic
and technological level of the 1990s. However, he said, with the
enhancement of recovery rate and better understanding of
geological conditions, the figure will surely rise by a large
margin.
</P>
<P>
After more than thirty years of industrial development, China
now produces over 160 million tons of crude oil a year, ranking
the fifth largest in the world for 13 years running.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Step Up Oil Exploration Overseas - Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- While making oil imports to meet
rising domestic demand, China should enhance its oil exploration
overseas and build up a national petroleum reserve, a senior
official suggested here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an ongoing seminar on development strategy for China
's oil and gas industry in the 21st century, vice minister of Land
and Natural Resources Jiang Chengsong pointed out that China
should take into consideration both insufficient domestic energy
resources and the national economic security when formulating an
energy development strategy for the new century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that while relying on petroleum imports to make up
for the domestic shortage in energy supply, China's oil industry
should step up its efforts in oil-oriented venture explorations in
neighboring countries to diversify supply sources. Russia and
central Asian countries are all possible choices, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has been conducting oil and gas exploration overseas
since the early 1990s, but so far no significant progress has been
reported.
</P>
<P>
China became a net oil importer in 1993, when its net imports
reached 9.93 million tons. In 1999, the imports soared to 43.81
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the oil and gas sector is at the core of
China's energy strategy, which is key to its economic development.
China's current coal-dependent energy mix directly affects
sustainable growth of the national economy. Yet to rationalize the
energy mix in a short period of time has proved to be too
difficult to achieve and exerted heavy pressure on domestic oil-
gas exploration activities.
</P>
<P>
Coal now accounts for 71 percent of China's energy consumption,
whereas the share of oil and gas is only 22 percent. In contrast,
in developed countries, coal's share averages 26 percent and that
of oil and gas is over 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Mubarak on Palestinian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is to
brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, the Palestinian
ambassador in Cairo said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is expected to arrive here later Tuesday, will keep
Mubarak posted on the results of his meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday in the West Bank town of Ramallah,
Ambassador Zohdi al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak failed in the meeting to find means of breaking
the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli final-status peace talks
on the thorniest issues, including Jerusalem, final borders,
settlements and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will also be updated on the outcome of Arafat's recent
visits to France and Portugal and his talks with leaders of the two
countries, the Palestinian diplomat was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Portugal holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.
The 15-nation European bloc and its member states, especially
France, sympathize with Arab countries' stances in their peace
negotiations with Israel and have been exerting efforts to help
push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Egypt comes within the context of his constant
coordination and consultations with Mubarak in a bid to remove
difficulties and exchange views on problems facing the peace march,
al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Cairo to seek advice on the peace talks
from Mubarak, who, as the leader of the first Arab country to sign
a peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reassures to Put Premium on Hostages' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
reassured Tuesday the international community that the Philippine
government is putting a premium on the safety of 21 tourists held
captive in Jolo since last month.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) security and foreign policy adviser Javier
Solana told reporters in the Presidential Palace that the
president extended this guarantee during their meeting Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Solana relayed to the president the EU's
continued trust and confidence in the way the Philippine
government is handling the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We trust the way that the government is facing the problem,
and we hope in the coming hours, in the coming days, we may have
positive news," Solana said after the meeting also attended by
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora and Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here at noon, said he and Estrada
discussed the possibility of having additional channels for
humanitarian aid for the hostages, especially those in bad
physical condition.
</P>
<P>
Solana stressed that he came here not to negotiate, but to
tell the president how pleased the EU is with the way the
government is handling the situation.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo Zamora, for his part, said the Abu Sayyaf which
abducted the hostages have reportedly sent feelers for the release
of ailing German hostage Renate Wallert.
</P>
<P>
He also believed reports that he has replaced Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao Governor Nur Misuari as government
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
"We are not doing anything to try to undercut directly or
indirectly the role of Chairman Misuari. Chairman Misuari is as a
matter of fact on a plane right now proceeding to Jolo where he
will take personal charge of the negotiations that he is doing
through two emissaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages were kidnapped on April 23 from a beach resort
in Sipadan Island, Malaysia and were brought to Talipao, Sulu
which is one hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
They include 10 Malaysians, three Germans, a French couple,
two Finnish, a South African couple, one Lebanese woman and one
Filipino.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Adopts Tough Approach toward Immigration  Offender Problem: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for Home
Affairs Wong Kan Seng has reiterated that the Singapore government
adopts a tough approach toward the immigration offender problem
and those who contribute to the problem by providing job and
shelter to immigration offenders would be severely dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Making the point at a debate in the parliament Tuesday on
punishment for harboring immigration offenders, the minister said
that the immigration offender problem remains a serious one in
Singapore and "it is necessary to come down hard on all the
parties who contribute to the problem, namely the trafficker who
smuggles in the illegal immigrants, the illegal immigrant himself
or the overstayers, the person who employs him and the person who
gives him shelter."
</P>
<P>
"It has to be clear to all that the employment or harboring of
immigration offenders are serious offenses, and those who flout
the law would be severely dealt with," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister made these points in response to inquiries by
some MPs who asked the government to have flexibility and a
different set of punishment for offenders who have broken the
immigration law unwittingly or due to negligence and suggested to
punish them with fines instead of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Last week a houseowner was put for a seven-month term in jail
for providing shelter to two immigration offenders and some
reports said he broke the law unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the nature and the magnitude of the country's
illegal offenders' problem justifies a tough stance against
harboring immigration offenders, noting the number of immigration
offenders arrested has increased steadily over the years from
about 6,000 in 1992 to 23,000 in 1998 and the number of
immigration offenders arrested last year remained at a high of 17,
000 despite rigorous enforcement.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of employers and harborers arrested
for breaking the immigration law have also been increasing over
the years to reach a high of 338 for employers and 306 for
harborers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister said immigration offenders pose a serious threat
to Singapore's safety and security as they would not hesitate to
break laws and they are likely to resort to crime if they can not
find a job in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, he cited that only 11 out of every 10,000
foreign work-permit holders commit crimes compared to 91 out of
every 10,000 Singapore citizens.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the mandatory jail penalty for employers and
harbors of immigration offenders is necessary as it serve as a
deterrent.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Govt Not to Appoint Renamo Governors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has no
intention of appointing provincial governors from the ranks of the
leading opposition party Renamo, Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said in an earlier interview with
 Portuguese newspaper "Jornal de Noticias" that it was
"fundamental" that the ruling Frelimo Party should accept the
appointment of opposition governors in those provinces where
Renamo won a majority of votes in the general elections last
December.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi regarded this proposal as quite unrealistic, saying, "A
 government can never function with governors who are going to act
against the program of the government itself."
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi warned if Renamo continued to opt for "constant
obstruction", that would lead it nowhere and "will end up just by
discrediting Renamo in the eyes of its own voters".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the political violence in the run up to the
parliamentary election and occupation of white-owned commercial
farms by war veterans in Zimbabwe, Mocumbi said this was a matter
of concern for all the countries of Southern African Development
Community, "because any sign of instability within a member state
affects the credibility of the region".
</P>
<P>
"We have to act together to help find a solution to the core
problem, that of land, and in the search for peace and stability.
That's what the people of Zimbabwe need. It's what the whole
southern African region needs".
</P>
<P>
As for the possibility of Zimbabwean commercial farmers
investing in Mozambique, given the climate of uncertainty in their
own country, Mocumbi said "some are already investing, because
contacts began a long time ago. If more of them request space to
invest, they will be well received".

<P>
SOFIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- During the past four months, Bulgarian
customs have seized 576 kilograms of heroin, four times the total
amount seized last year, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 vehicles were found carrying heroin, including
four investigated by customs officers last week.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, 51 kilograms of highly purified heroin worth
5.5 million marks (2.5 million U.S. dollars) was found in a Benz
microbus heading for Albania from Turkey. It was the largest drug
trafficking case this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said two-thirds of the heroin seized this year was
smuggled and transported by Turkish and Albanian gangs to Western
European countries.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Navy warplanes resumed training on the Atlantic Fleet
bombing range in Vieques Monday using dummy bombs. The training --
involving aircraft based at the nearby naval station of Roosevelt
Roads -- came just four days after armed federal agents removed
216 protesters from the range in a predawn raid on May 4.
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine authorities Monday arrested a reclusive bank
employee who lives in a gritty Manila public housing apartment
from which investigators believe the "love Bug" computer virus was
unleashed on the world.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Britain agreed Monday to provide
limited help to a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra
Leone that appears to be dazed and overwhelmed, with rebels
killing civilians there and continuing to hold more than 500 U.N.
soldiers hostage.
</P>
<P>
-- After a spate of border violence late last week, Israel is
speeding up its preparations to withdraw troops from southern
Lebanon in case Prime Minister Ehud Barak decides to do so before
his self-imposed deadline of July 7.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The 11 finance ministers of the euro zone and the European
Central Bank made their strongest statement of concern so far
about the euro's 16-month slide, but their attempt to talk up the
currency did little to convince foreign exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. government will propose a plan to encourage
financial companies to offer low-cost bank accounts to millions of
low-income people.

TIRANA, May 9 (Xinhua) - Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
Tuesday praised all Albanians engaged in the anti-fascist war on
the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the victory over Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"As general commander of the Albanian armed forces, and as
Albania's president and an Albanian citizen, it is an honor,
privilege and special pleasure to greet today all those who were
engaged in the great anti-fascist war which brought the liberation
of our precious motherland and the victory of Allied Forces over
the forces of the Fascist Axis," Mejdani was quoted as saying by
the ATA news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said this date is for Albanians to commemorate, because in
the war Albania sacrificed over 28,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
"May 9 is an appeal addressed to us to allow no one to bring
back instability to Albania and to the region, to bring back the
law of force, violence, regional and religious dissension, and
ideological persecution," said Mejdani.

ATHENS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Having being complained by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) of delays ahead of the
Athens Games, Greece replaced the president of its organizing
committee for the 2004 Olympics on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Yianna Angelopoulos was appointed by Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis to replace Panagiotis Thomopoulos after a
ministerial meeting to discuss measures to speed up the
preparation work for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Last month, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch issued an
unusually sharp warning to Greece before Simitis responded by
saying that the Olympics would be the country's top priority. The
IOC has been concerned with delays in areas such as hotel bookings,
transportation and TV rights, mostly due to the notorious Greek
bureaucracy and the numerous ministries and committees involved.

<P>
KUNMING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to buy three million
kwh of electricity from neighboring Yunnan Province in southwest
China in 2013 and 2014.
</P>
<P>
In line with a memorandum signed during a recent visit to
Thailand by a Chinese power delegation, Thailand will buy 1.5
million kwh of electricity from the Jinghong Hydropower Station in
Yunnan in 2013.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will purchase another 1.5 million kwh of electricity
from Yunnan in 2014.
</P>
<P>
The Jinghong Hydropower Station is one of the eight stations to
be built on the Lancang River. It will have an installed capacity
of 1.5 million kw. Construction on the station will start in 2006.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, Yunnan will construct the 5.5-million-kw Ruzhadu
Hydropower Station on the river to export another 1.5 million kwh
to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Serious Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on Tuesday
stressed the need for a serious campaign against narcotics, saying
smuggling and distribution of drugs is one of the gravest social
problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
All countries should assist Iran in fighting drugs, head of the
judiciary Seyed Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi told an international
seminar on anti-drug policies.
</P>
<P>
Iran's geographical location and its neighborhood with Pakistan
and Afghanistan has exposed the country to the problem of smuggling
and distribution of narcotics, Shahroudi said at the opening of the
three-day seminar attended by officials and experts on anti-drug
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Iranian government and people are paying for stopping the
transit of drugs to other countries via Iran, he said, stressing
that all countries should assist Iran in the great task of drug
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 300,000 hectares of land are under poppy
cultivation around the world, 90,000 of which are in Afghanistan
neighboring Iran. About 4,600 tons of opium were produced in
Afghanistan last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 185 soldiers of Iranian security forces lost their
lives in fighting with drug smugglers last year, Shahroudi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that 910 traffickers were killed in 1,736 operations
and 1,551 drug gangs were busted during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, some 60 to 70 percent of the inmates are dug
traffickers and addicts, which shows that the drug problem is a
major threat to the security and calm of the society.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the research institute of the United Nations
Drug Control Program set up a secretariat in Tehran to follow up
anti-drug efforts.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: COMESA at Doorway of Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Wang Nengbiao
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) will usher in its Free Trade Area (FTA)
on this October 31, after years of unremitting and arduous
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The FTA is expected to further promote trade among the 21
member countries of the regional group and take it closer to its
ultimate objective of creating a regional economic community as
part of the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Once the FTA is established, tariffs and non-tariff barriers
will be eliminated between the member states. As of July 1, 1999
four member countries have reduced their tariffs by 90 percent,
six by 80 percent, one by 70 percent and three by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland and Namibia are members of the Southern African
Customs Union and as such, have a derogation not to reduce
intra-COMESA tariffs until this year. The remaining five countries
have yet to make any reduction in tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Although most member countries have not met the targets for
tariff reductions by agreed dates, all of them last year
reiterated at the summit held in Nairobi, Kenya their commitment
to achieving the target of 100 percent reduction by October 2000.
</P>
<P>
Steady progress has been made in elimination of the non-tariff
barriers through liberalization of import licensing, removal of
foreign exchange restrictions, removal of taxes on foreign
exchange, removal of import and export quotas, removal of road
blocks and easing of customs formalities.
</P>
<P>
There are, however, still a number of improvements have to be
done in making intra- regional trade easier, such as improving the
transport and communications structures, ease visa requirements,
improve information and access to information on trade
opportunities, further reduce customs and bureaucratic procedures
at border crossing.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of FTA is a prelude to a Customs Union. The
FTA is planned to operate for about four years, during which all
administrative, legal, institutional and logistical preparations
for the operation of the Customs Union are to be completed.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was established in 1994, replacing the Preferential
Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA), which was set up
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In pursuit of the goals of the FTA, a customs union and a
regional economic community, COMESA is also implementing a wide
range of programs, which include implementation of a Common
External Tariff (CET) by 2004, installation of the Automated
System of Customs Data Administration (ASYCUDA) in national
customs departments, and introduction of Eurotrace to national
statistical offices for computerization of foreign trade
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The CET will provide the business community with a level
playing ground in the COMESA market for competition.
</P>
<P>
ASYCUDA will make the customs process more efficient, promoting
the trade by reducing the time taken to clear goods and thus save
importers and exporters money. ASYCUDA will also make tariff
collection procedure more efficient.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has established a website on the internet which is
up-dated on a regular basis to provide information on a country as
well as a sector basis.
</P>
<P>
Rules of origin have been simplified and the Trade information
network (TINET) has been established with some 47 computerized
focal points set up in 20 member countries. These focal points
provide information on all export and import opportunities in each
country.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has successfully introduced a number of trade
facilitation measures including harmonized road transit charges
and Advance Cargo Information System. As a result, transit
transport cost has been reduced by 25 percent and movement of
goods within the region has been made easier and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Total annual Intra-COMESA trade was estimated at 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars in 1998 compared with 1.642 billion dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The regional integration grouping is working to remove air
traffic controls to increase competition within regional routes to
reduce the cost of air travel and transport to encourage regional
trade.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is gradually removing visa and enhancing movement of
skilled labor to facilitate particularly the movement of business
persons within COMESA.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has established the PTA Trade and Development Bank to
mobilize financial and technical resources for investors and for
trade financing.
</P>
<P>
A court of justice was formally brought into being in 1998 to
adjudicate and arbitrate on unfair trade practices, interpretation
of treaty provisions and ensure that member countries uniformly
implement and comply with agreed decisions.
</P>
<P>
Although the trade within COMESA is increasing gradually in
recent years the trade volume is still very small compared with
COMESA's total trade, which stood at 62.8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Investment shortage, foreign debt burden, conflicts and
HIV/AIDs are the main challenges facing the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
More than half of COMESA member countries have been engulfed by
 conflicts. As COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha pointed
out last month that there can not be full economic and
socio-integration without resolving the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said poverty, hunger, diseases and under-development
that prevail in the region are directly linked to armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining peace and security within the region is expected to
be one of the first priorities on the forthcoming COMESA summit to
be held in Mauritius this month.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Plans to Withdraw Troops From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) said
on Tuesday it has drafted plans to pull out of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
ZNA spokesman Charles Mugari told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
the phased withdrawal would depend on the assessment of the
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Plans to pull out are already there. We are waiting for the
U.N. observer mission to inform us on when we will start pulling
out. The pulling out will depend on the situation," said Mugari.
</P>
<P>
About 100 U.N. peacekeepers are expected in the DRC next week
to begin setting up three of four bases for the 5,500 U.N. troops
due to be deployed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The three bases are to be established in Mbandaka in the
northwest, Kisangani in the northeast and Katanga in the south.
</P>
<P>
The fourth base will be established in the southeast of the
country.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. Security Council delegation touring the countries
involved in the DRC conflict signed the Stationing of Foreign
Troops Agreement over the weekend to allow the immediate
deployment of troops and observers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia intervened in the DRC civil war in
August 1998 to help DRC President Laurent Kabila's army fight
rebels aided by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been blamed for dragging its feet on the planned
deployment of 5,500 peacekeeping force in the third largest
African country to monitor the ceasefire agreement signed last
year in Lusaka by all warring parties.

<HEADLINE> Australia Govt Unveils 2000/01 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government scrapped
the Timor tax on middle- and high-income earners and poured more
money into health services in remote areas in its 2000/01 budget,
Treasurer Peter Costello said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Costello also unveiled a better than expected surplus of 2.8
billion Australian dollars (1.65 billion U.S. dollars) for 2000/01
on the back of a stronger than expected economic growth and an
expected 2.6 billion Australian dollar (1.53 billion U.S. dollars)
windfall from the sale of mobile phone spectrum licenses.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech, Costello told the parliament that
unemployment would continue to fall in the coming year, from the
current 6.9 percent to 6.25 percent by June next year.
</P>
<P>
But inflation is forecast to rise to 5.25 percent over the
coming year, due mainly to the initial impact of a 10-percent
goods and services tax (GST), which will come into effect on July
1.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the GST package would add about 2.75 percent to
the consumer price index, with the main impact to hit the
Australian economy in the first three months of the new tax from
July 1.
</P>
<P>
But the main focus of the budget is the abolition of the East
Timor levy on middle- and high-income earners, scrapped two months
before it was set to come in, and a new 562 million Australian
dollar (332 million U.S. dollars) rural health package.
</P>
<P>
The Timor tax, a 0.5-percent levy on those earning more than 50,
000 Australian dollars (29,500 U.S. dollars), was due to start on
July 1 to raise more than 900 million Australian dollars (531
million U.S. dollars) to pay for Australia's lead role in the
multinational force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the tax was announced to ensure the budget
remained in surplus, but it should now be scrapped to keep faith
with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
"I actually think it is a matter of keeping faith with the
Australian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To bag the levy and spend it elsewhere would have been a real
breach of faith," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the smooth transition in East Timor to the U.N.
peacekeeping force in January this year led to a major saving,
with the cost of Australia's defense commitment to East Timor
expected to fall to 831 million Australian dollars (490 million U.
S. dollars) in 2000/01.
</P>
<P>
Australia sent about 6,500 troops to East Timor at the height
of the crisis, but now has only 2,000 personnel deployed as part
of a wider U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four-year health package is designed to
encourage more general practitioners (GPs) to work in the bush.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the government will boost the number of GP
registrars by at least 75 in the coming 12 months and by at least
225 by 2002/03.
</P>
<P>
The package includes 32 million Australian dollars (19 million
U.S. dollars) for 100 medical scholarships for students who commit
to working in the bush and almost 100 million Australian dollars (
59 million U.S. dollars) to encourage specialists, nurses,
psychologists and podiatrists to work in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In another boost for the bush, the government will spend 300
million Australian dollars (177 million U.S. dollars) to help
farmers improve their skills and improve market access for their
goods.
</P>
<P>
Other budget measures include 32 million Australian dollars (19
million U.S. dollars) to combat health problems for Vietnam War
veterans and 128 million Australian dollars (76 million U.S.
dollars) to upgrade the troubled Collins class submarines.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the government has done the hard work to restore
the budget to surplus, cut Commonwealth debt by 50 billion
Australian dollars (29.5 billion U.S. dollars) since 1996 and
lowered unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the new century, Australia's economic prospects
are strong," he said. "This budget lays a strong economic and
social foundation to secure the future for Australia."
</P>
<P>
"We have strong prospects, and if the economy continues to grow
at current rates historically low unemployment is within our reach,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"This budget brings together our economic and our social goals:
lower taxes, more jobs, better health care, stronger families,"
Costello said.

Hernando Iriberri, Philippine Army spokesman, told reporters in
Manila that troops from the 1st Infantry Battalion were on patrol
when they chanced upon about 50 heavily armed NPA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The patrol immediately called for air support while heavy
exchange of fire was raging, said Iriberri.
</P>

</P>
<P>
According to Iriberri, the NPA retreated towards a forested

</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the MILF and the leftist NPA have entered
into a tactical alliance to fight against the Philippine

<HEADLINE> East China City Mourns Journalists Killed in NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The hometown of two Chinese
journalists killed in last year's NATO bombing paid tribute to
them on Monday at a memorial hall in the city of Danyang in east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in the city attended the
gathering, expressing their strong indignation at the brutality of
the U.S.-led NATO, while commemorating Xu Xinghu and his wife Zhu
Ying, both Guangming Daily corespondents based in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The couple, along with Shao Yunhuan, a woman correspondent with
China's Xinhua News Agency, were killed in the U.S.-led NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Xu's parents have been plunged into deep grief ever since they
lost their son last year, and we still feel angry with the United
States for their failure to give us a satisfactory explanation,"
Wu Rongjin, Xu's brother-in-law, said at the event.
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall was set up late last year, and over 10,000
people from all over the country have gone there to pay their

<HEADLINE> Forum for Chinese Journalist Killed in NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held Monday morning in
memory of Shao Yunhuan, a woman correspondent for China's Xinhua
News Agency who was killed in Belgrade along with two other
Chinese journalists in a NATO bombing a year ago. The forum took
place in Shao's hometown of Jiamusi in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
On May 8, 1999, the U.S.-led NATO attacked the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia, killing three people including Shao and completely
destroying the embassy building. The Chinese government lodged the
strongest possible protest against the barbarous act.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, which was attended by representatives from all
walks of life, Shao Bingkui, younger brother of Shao Yunhuan, said
his parents weep whenever they think of his elder sister. "My
family and the rest of the country will forever remember the day
when the U.S.-led NATO killed my sister and two other Chinese with
missiles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum pledged they will learn from Shao
Yunhuan, and turn grief into strength, and study and work hard to
better serve the country.
</P>
<P>
While cherishing the memory of the martyr, participants also
slammed the hegemonic act of the U.S. "The U.S. is still lying,
saying that the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia was a
mistake," said Shao Bingkui.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO's barbarous act and the investigation report
have made us see clearly the hypocrisy and fraudulence of
democracy and human rights advocated by the United States. Who
else will believe in the so-called democracy and human rights hung
onto the missiles?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
The participants also pledged to value the current hard-won
stability in the country and to accelerate economic development to
make China stronger.
</P>
<P>
After the forum, participants also attended a ceremony to
unveil a 5.8-meter-high monument in memory of Martyr Shao Yunhuan
and to bury her ashes inside the Jiamusi Cemetery for the Martyrs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao met
with visiting Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab at the Great
Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China and Indonesia are close neighbors, and there is a
traditional friendship between the two peoples. Since the
normalization of bilateral ties, cooperation in various fields
have produced fruitful results through the efforts of both sides,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, President Jiang Zemin and President Wahid reached a
common understanding to establish and develop a long-term and
stable relationship of good-neighborliness, mutual trust, and all-
round cooperation, which has defined the future direction of
bilateral ties, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
During Shihab's current visit, the two countries signed a joint
statement on the future direction of bilateral cooperation and set
up a cooperative committee, further promoting bilateral
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that there is broad potential for bilateral
cooperation, expressing the hope that both countries will seize
the opportunity and push forward cooperation in economic, trade,
agricultural, and other sectors so as to stimulate the healthy
development of relations.
</P>
<P>
Hu highly evaluated the emphasis that President Wahid and the
Indonesian government put on relations with China. He also
expressed appreciation for Indonesia's pursuit of the one-China
policy, its position of not having any official contact with
Taiwan, and its support of China on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will, as always, support Indonesia's
efforts to safeguard national unification and territorial
integrity, and to promote national unity and economic development,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said this year marks the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between Indonesia and China, and
bilateral ties are at a historic high at present. Indonesia highly
emphasizes its good-neighborliness with China, and hopes to expand
cooperation with China in political, trade, investment and other
fields, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated that Indonesia steadfastly follows the one-
China policy.

<HEADLINE> State Councilor Hails Prospects for High-tech Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua)-- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi
stressed here today that China should boost its foreign trade by
stepping up scientific research and developing more technology-
intensive export commodities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference organized by the ministries of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, Science and Technology,
Information Industry, and the State Economic and Trade Commission,
Wu stressed that China should seize the opportunity amid global
and national economic re-adjustment and place its priority on
updating research and development, replacing resource-intensive
and labor-intensive products with high-tech commodities as the
major portion of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
High-tech machinery and electronic products will become the
fastest-growing category among China's exports, Wu predicted.
</P>
<P>
Export products embodying high and new technology were valued
at 24.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, or 13 percent of the year's
volume, she said, suggesting that China's strategy of boosting
foreign trade through science and technology has paid off. However,
high- and new-technology products are still the weakest link in
China's exports, and they need strong support, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the government should extend more support
to high-tech-related enterprises and products, particularly those
products with Chinese-owned intellectual property rights. High-
tech industrial zones and trade fairs should also play a more
important role in promoting the research and development of high-
tech products.

<P>
In 1998, women employees in China reached 340.67 million,
making up 46.7 percent of the total, a 1.1 percentage points
increase over 1995, and some 3.32 million women workers were re-
employed.
</P>
<P>
Most enterprises put the regulations for labor protection of
women workers into effect and the coverage for childbearing
insurance through social pooling has been increased.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the level of women's education was raised
and the gap between men and women narrowed. In 1998, the average
number of school years for women was 6.5, an increase of 0.4
percentage points over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The difference in enrollment rates between boys and girls
decreased from 1.3 points to 0.14 during this period.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1998, more than 10 million illiterate young and
adult women were educated, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Women are also accounting for a greater proportion of the
people engaged in higher education. There are 62 women
academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese
Academy of Engineering, making up six percent of the total, which
is higher than that in many other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Program for the Development of Chinese Women (1995-2000)
was worked out in 1995 to protect the legal rights of women,
promote women's overall development, and guide women's course in
China.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Conditions for the subsistence,
protection, and development of Chinese women have been greatly
improved, while the overall competence of women has been promoted,
according to a report released by the State Council today.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 Monitoring and Evaluation Report of the
Program for the Development of Chinese Women published by the
Working Committee for Children and Women of the State Council, the
political and social status of Chinese women has been further
improved during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Women deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and women
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC) have increased respectively by 0.8, 2.0, and 1.1
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The objective to have women holding posts in the leading bodies
of the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities has
been realized, and the number of woman cadres at provincial level
has grown by 46.5 percent compared with five years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, China has been faced with the
difficulties of the reform of state-owned enterprises, the
increasing number of laid-off workers, and the rising of
employment pressure.
</P>
<P>
Labor departments, however, have taken various policy measures
to promote employment and re-employment, open up more channels,
and create more opportunities for the employment of laid-off women
workers.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Warns Not to Underestimate Cults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, today published a story about how Falun Gong
members organized subversive activities in the national capital on
the eve of the Spring Festival, along with a commentary warning
not to treat Falun Gong lightly.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, titled "Never Underestimate," tells people that
Falun Gong has not diminished despite months of a nationwide
campaign against the cult.
</P>
<P>
The fight against the Galun Gong cult is a long-term,
complicated, and arduous one, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The "New Year's Eve Preaching Program" proves that despite
strenuous, painstaking efforts to educate and persuade the cult
followers by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government,
a handful of die-hard Falun Gong elements are still trying to
launch long-term resistance against the authorities, the
commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
According to the story, which was simultaneously published in
the overseas edition of the newspaper, a small number of hard-core
Falun Gong members failed to hold an illegal gathering in southern
Guangzhou City last November after local police launched a
successful crack-down.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, Mi Xiaoping, organizer of the illegal gathering,
escaped from police custody and returned to her hometown of Wuhan,
the capital of Hubei Province, and started plotting a large-scale
gathering on the eve of the Spring Festival, the traditional
Chinese Lunar New Year's Day which was on February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
Between January 19 and February 2, Mi and dozens of Falun Gong
members held secret meetings in downtown Beijing to prepare for
the Spring Festival summoning. The Tian'anmen area was made the
site for the gathering as it was said by the organizers to be "the
very place where the root of the demon is seated" and "the '
preaching' must be held in the area so as to uproot the demon."
</P>
<P>
A dozen such meetings were held and were attended by more than
200 Falun Gong followers. The participants were told to spread the
information to other believers. Those who masterminded the plot,
including Mi of course, decided not to show up at Tian'anmen
Square on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
On February 4, a number of local and overseas Falun Gong
members gathered on Tian'anmen Square, but they failed to hold the
planned "preaching program" due to timely and determined police
action, the People's Daily said.
</P>
<P>
All the hard-core members were arrested, including Mi, who was
captured by the police in Beijing on February 11.

headquarters.

Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also a vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission (CMC), made the call at today's opening of a national
conference on the allocation of demobilized army officers.
</P>
<P>
To relocate these former army officers is an important

the armed forces and the whole country's modernization drive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged CPC organizations and governments of all levels to be
aware of the importance of the work and set up a resettlement

characteristics.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and
the CMC, Hu thanked those who have contributed to the cutting down
PLA personnel by 500,000 in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the important role played by the demobilized
officers in the country's modernization drive and ethic and
cultural progress. Army officers are the treasure of the Party and
the state.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged to reform the old system for resettling demobilized
officers, as well as the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo, and
CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Wannian.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wang Zhongyu presided over the meeting, while

<HEADLINE> Barak Denies French Paper Report on Framework Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Tuesday denied a French newspaper report that he and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat discussed a framework agreement on final-
status issues at their summit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel Radio, Barak joked that the report, which
was published in La Monde on Monday, sounds "creative and
interesting," while some of the suggestions in the story could be
examined by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
He maintained, however, that such a draft never came up on the
table when he met with Arafat, as the negotiations between them
have not yet reached such an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Israeli Communications Minister Binyamin Ben
Eliezer, one of Barak's confidants and a major participant in the
peace process with the Palestinians, also categorically denied that
he ever heard of such a plan.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who was sent by Barak to meet Arafat in the West
Bank city of Ramallah on Monday, said that during their long
meeting, the existence of such a document was never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde, one of the most influential French print media, Monday
published the full text of a draft, which it claimed had been
submitted to Barak and Arafat at their summit Sunday evening for
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to previous thought, the report stated, the talks
between the two negotiation teams had pushed forward to an advanced
stage and they had resolved many difficulties between them.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, Israel agrees to transfer 80 to 90 percent land
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, while the
Jewish settlers that currently in the areas will live in the other
10 to 20 percent leased to them by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On the Jerusalem issue, the Palestinians would control several
Arab neighborhoods on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and establish
their future parliament in Abu Dis. An "access corridor" will also
be paved to their holy cites in East Jerusalem, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a fervent guard
trying to keep the whole Jerusalem under Israeli control as its "
eternal and undivided capital", told Israel Radio that the plan did
not sound like anything he had heard from the Prime Minister about
the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for an access corridor," Olmert claimed. "
Everyone has free access to the holy sites in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who are expected to announce an independent
Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East
Jerusalem as its capital by the end of this year, also called the
Le Monde report "baseless and incorrect."
</P>
<P>
The two sides had engaged in intensive talks in Israel's Red Sea
resort of Eilat last week to reach a framework on issues such as
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised timetable they both agreed in March,
they should finalize a framework accord by May 13 to prepare for
sealing a permanent peace deal on September 13, the seventh
anniversary of the birth of Oslo accords which officially opened
the Israeli-Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Due to the indolent peace talks atmosphere, many observers,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, believed that the two sides
will miss the May 13 deadline again and might reach a framework
deal in June or even in July.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said on Monday that he was confident that the
sides would reach a final accord by September.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators, in recess for Israel's Remembrance Day for
Fallen Soldiers and Independence Day from Monday evening to
Wednesday night, will begin a further round of talks at an
undisclosed location on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Export to Reach 44 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The value of Indonesia's exports
this year is expected to reach 44 billion U.S. dollars as the
government is to establish a consortium in its effort to boost
export growth, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The value of exports has to keep increasing. This year the
export value is expected to reach 44 billion U.S. dollars. We will
carry on in order to meet the target," Minister of Trade and
Industry Luhut Binsar Panjaitan said when addressing a meeting of
the country's Chamber of Commerce here.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of Statistic, the export value
in March went up by 3.67 percent to 4.94 billion dollars, compared
with the previous month when the value was 4.765 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the first three month of the current year,
total export value reached 14.099 billion dollars or increased by
38.7 percent from 10.165 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Panjaitan said that within the next months growth of the export
value is expected to reach 3.8 billion dollars per month on
average.
</P>
<P>
"The value of Indonesia's export is still lower than expected
because our products are not competitive in international market,"
Panjaitan said.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is facing problems in increasing its export value,
because many companies have no working capital to activate or
maximize its production capacity," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to deal with such problems, the government
has been making preparations for forming a consortium, which will
consist of seven overseas and local banks to provide working
capital to selected export-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed that and it is expected that within this
week there will be progress in this aspect," Panjaitan said.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Welcomes Indonesian Leader's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard has expressed his welcome to a visit by Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Howard has written to the Indonesian leader,
encouraging him to visit Australia. "He also said he welcomed his
visit to Australia."
</P>
<P>
Howard has told Wahid that Australia is impressed with his new
government's efforts on a number of fronts, the spokesman said
after a ruling coalition meeting.
</P>
<P>
Howard told government MPs and senators Tuesday that the
troubled relationship between the two nations was improving.
</P>
<P>
He also softened his earlier stance on Wahid's proposed
tripartite meeting with East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao, saying
it was appropriate but not urgent, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Last month Howard reacted cautiously to Wahid's call for such a
meeting after the Indonesian leader postponed indefinitely an
intended visit to Australia this month.
</P>
<P>
"It was appropriate to have a three-way meeting at some stage
but he also thought it was important there was, at the appropriate
time, a meeting between himself as prime minister of Australia and
Mr. Wahid as president of Indonesia," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Concerned Over Security for Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputeri said here Tuesday that the government is really
concerned about the security of both domestic and foreign
investors and will pay more attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Leadership Meeting of the Indonesian Chamber of
Commerce (Kadin), the vice president said, "I understand that we
are still not able to give a full security guarantee (for
investors) and create political stability needed for the safety of
business activities. But, steady, safe and political stability
also depends much upon enthusiastic economic activities."
</P>
<P>
She urged Indonesian businessmen to bring back their capital
deposited in overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing home domestic capital, which has been 'parked'
overseas,is clearly an important breakthrough to lift the country
out of the crisis," Megawati said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kadin General Chairman Aburizal Bakrie said
investors both domestic and foreign are still taking a wait-and-
see attitude due to the lack of security guarantees and political
stability in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He further urged the government to be more consistent in
implementing the policies it has made.
</P>
<P>
"The Kadin urges the government to pay more attention to two
main points for economic recovery, namely creating political
stability and maintaining law and order," Bakrie said.
</P>
<P>
He further said Indonesian businesspeople are well prepared to
carry out corporate restructuring to boost the on-going economic
recovery process.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Help Cambodia in Land Mines Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is to
conduct a nationwide survey of Cambodia's land mine-affected areas,
the Cambodia Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum of understanding signed by the two
governments Monday,Canada will contribute 2 million Canadian
dollars this year to the Cambodian Mine Action Center, the country
's largest de-mining agency.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide survey will provide Cambodia with a clear
overview of the problem of land mines and unexploded ordnance
affecting the country and the means to establish long-term
objectives and plan the use of resources in a better way.
</P>
<P>
The survey will start shortly and is expected to take between
14 and 18 months, according to Canadian Ambassador to Cambodia
Normand Mailhot.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of Canada will consist of funding,management
and appropriate equipment for the execution of the project and of
monitoring and evaluating the project.
</P>
<P>
More than two decades of civil war and lingering unrest have
turned Cambodia into one of the most heavily-mined countries in
the world.There are an estimated 4 million to 6 million land mines
littered in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Land mines have already killed more than 13,000 people and
disabled 100,000 in the country. The lack of fund, technology and
equipment has hindered progress in the de-mining effort.

NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday rejected the demand
of nuclear states to rollback its nuclear program and asserted
that it cannot join the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-
nuclear weapon state.
</P>
<P>
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh told the parliament
that the role of India's nuclear weapons is defensive and India
shall maintain a minimum credible deterrence and not engage in the
arms race.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the statements by NPT states at the sixth review
meeting on NPT held currently in New York, which asked India to
rollback its nuclear program, the minister said the statements
were "mere diversions to prevent focused attention on the basic
goals of the NPT."
</P>
<P>
He said India, which is not attending the review conference,
had taken new nuclear initiatives calling for "de-alerting" of
nuclear weapons as a means of reducing the risk of accidental or
unauthorized launch.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, he said, India has already announced a policy
of no-first use and a policy of non-use against non-nuclear weapon
states.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Urges to Increase Coffee Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has called on stakeholders in the coffee growing
sector to revamp the industry by adopting feasible and sustainable
development plans to enable coffee farmers increase production,
newspapers here reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Monday at the 5th annual coffee conference for
stakeholders in the northern town of Moshi, the prime minister
urged the participants to boost coffee production per unit area by
using expertise, inputs and planting new seedlings to attain the
projected 70,000 tons of annual output by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that increased coffee production was crucial in the
fight against poverty, adding that a strong agricultural sector
can help driving growth in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye told the stakeholders in coffee business, government
policy makers and financial institution officials that the
liberalization of coffee marketing did not mean compromising on
the quality of the crop.
</P>
<P>
There was need to improve Tanzania's coffee quality to the
highest degree so as to face stiff competition in international
markets, Sumaye noted, because most of produced coffee was
marketed abroad.
</P>
<P>
Coffee has been the major export in Tanzania's foreign trade
for the last two to three decades with an annual earning of 400
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently standing at 50,000 tons, the annual coffee output in
Tanzania has slumped in recent years because of bad weather
conditions and mostly, economic factors.

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists said here
today at the Forum on Satellite Application that they had used
satellite remote sensing technology to search for and find many

These historic sites date back from the Neolithic Age to the
Spring and Autumn Period (770 BC-- 476 BC), showing that the
Yangtze River basin was also the birthplace of Chinese
civilization, Liu said.

<P>
Some 40,000 ruins are expected to be discovered in the area
thanks to satellite remote sensing technology.

<HEADLINE> China Discloses Ranking of Securities Firms in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Securities Association of China
today issued a ranking of securities companies' net assets,
profits, trading value, and the number and value of stocks
underwritten in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The merger of the former Guotai and Jun'an companies in 1999
produced Guotai-Jun'an, the largest securities firm in China in
all the four indices, except profit.
</P>
<P>
The company has a net worth of 3.99 billion yuan, and reported
a trading value of 400.9 billion yuan, underwriting 21 stocks
worth of 9.88 billion yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Shenyin-Wanguo Securities Co., also based in Shanghai, leads in
profits with 850 million yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the association, the top 20 firms on
the chart of net assets boasted net assets worth of 36.3 billion
yuan in 1999, rising 40 percent over that for the top 20 firms in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The trading value of the top 20 firms rose 47 percent over that
for 1998 to reach 2.82 trillion yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the profits of the leading 20 firms in 1999 totaled
6.6 billion yuan, up 10 percent from the 1998 level.
</P>
<P>
The association said this reflects the increased strength and
better performance of securities firms in 1999, as well as the
bullish market for the year.
</P>
<P>
The rankings are based on performance reports submitted to the
association by its 120 member companies.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman Meets Japanese Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Handling relations between Taiwan
and Japan in a proper way constitutes the important political
foundation for the development of Sino-Japanese ties, said Wang
Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, here today.
</P>
<P>
Japan has made solemn commitments to China on the Taiwan issue
in the Sino-Japanese Joint Communique, the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship between China and Japan, and the China-Japan Joint
Statement on Building Friendly Cooperative Partnership, said Wang
at a meeting with Ito Eisei, member of the Democratic Party of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Japanese government, parties, and
statesmen will honor their commitments and properly handle the
Taiwan issue in order to maintain the healthy and stable
advancement of Sino-Japanese relations, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
Ito, who is in charge of the foreign affairs and security
policy of his party, said that the Democratic Party of Japan will
honor the spirit of the joint communiques by adhering to the one
China policy and opposing Taiwan Independence.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the Taiwan issue will be solved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Ito is here at the invitation of the International Department
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
In towns and cities, three security systems have been gradually
established which include the minimum living standard for citizens,
the basic living security for laid-off workers, and the insurance
fund for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 1,702 cities or counties had set up the
security system of minimum living standard, and 1.84 million
citizens including women had been provided with relief.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the development of Chinese women is still
faced with many problems and difficulties, in which poverty makes
up the biggest obstacle of restricting the realization of the
objectives set in the Program. The implementation of the Program
in poor regions falls markedly behind the national average speed.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of relevant departments, the
mortality rates of children, pregnant and lying-in women in the
rural areas of west China are much higher than those in east China.
About 60 to 70 percent of women illiterates live in the poverty-
stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is taking positive measures to solve
those problems. During this year and next year, for example, the
central government and local governments will allocate 100 million
yuan (about 12 million US dollars), respectively, to carry out
projects of reducing the mortality rate of pregnant and lying-in
women and eliminating tetanus of newly-born babies in 378 counties
of 12 provinces in middle and west China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state is formulating Program for the Development
of Chinese Women 2000-2010, and working out new national plans for
action to further solve the existing problems and promote the
development of women in the new century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The health care and social security
of women has improved in China during the past few years,
according to a report on women's development released by the State
Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Monitoring and Evaluation Report on the Program for
the Development of Chinese Women (1995-2000) was issued by the
Working Committee for Children and Women of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average life expectancy of women was
73.2 years in 1997, an increase of 2.7 years over that in 1990.
Broad masses of women are enjoying good reproductive health care
service, and 85 percent of pregnant and lying-in women were well
cared for in the national health care institutions.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the rate of lying-in delivery was 66.8 percent, and
the rate of practicing new midwifery in rural areas reached 94.5
percent. The mortality rate of pregnant and lying-in women dropped
to 56.2 persons per 100 thousand.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the country has helped eliminate
women's poverty through practical skills training, micro-credit
schemes, and by organizing the transit of woman labor forces to
the coastal areas, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the rural poor population declined to 34 million, and
the number of poor women dropped from 70 percent of the total in
1995 to 60 percent.

<P>
TIRANA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia and Greece struck a
cooperation deal Monday in which the latter promises to provide
half a million U.S. dollars to help the former implement 16 small
scale projects in the border area, a report from Skopje said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Gevgelija Nikola Kurkciev and Head of the European
Commission's Delegation to Macedonia, Ambassador Jose Manuel Pinto
Teixeira, signed the agreement in Gevegelija as part of the Trans-
border Cooperation Program between Macedonia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Teixeira underlined the importance of the Program, saying that
"Greece is Macedonia's door to the European Union."
</P>
<P>
"Although the fund is not large, it constitutes a cornerstone
for the future cooperation," Teixeira stated.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Gevgelija Kurkciev, who sealed the deal for Macedonia,
said the project "will improve Macedonian citizens' living
standard" and promote its socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Agreement was signed at a time
when the negotiations for Macedonia's association in the EU were
being intensified.

<HEADLINE> ITU Gives Final Approval to IMT-2000 Radio Interface Specifications  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The approval of the technical specifications of IMT-2000 opens
the way to a whole new world of multimedia mobile communications,
the Geneva-based ITU said in a press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With speeds nearly three times faster than today's basic rate
ISDN for fast-moving mobile terminals and even higher speeds for
users who are stationary or moving at a walking speed, IMT-2000
systems "will definitely change the way we communicate, access
information, work or even carry out social or personal activities",
the release said.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is the result of over 10 years of considerable
intellectual and engineering efforts by an entire industry
determined to leapfrog the fragmentation which prevailed until now
in the wireless world," said Yoshio Utsumi, Secretary-General of
the ITU in the release.
</P>
<P>
The next critical area that must be resolved is global spectrum
availability, particularly in view of the expected demand for
mobile multimedia services worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because it is preferable from an operational and performance
viewpoint to target frequency bands that be contiguous to those
already identified for IMT-2000, and since these bands are heavily
used by a wide range of satellite and terrestrial services,
spectrum experts at the World Radio Communication Conference which
opened Tuesday or today, will have to use all their talents and
spirit of cooperation to come to grips with finding further
spectrum for IMT-2000.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that the 3G market is expected to grow from 1.5
billion U.S. dollars in 2001 to 9.2 billion dollars in 2005, with
investment in infrastructure to support 3G services reaching some
one billion dollars in 2001 and peak in 2003 at over five billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
With such high stakes and with the licensing process for third
generation systems picking up strong momentum worldwide, many
delegations will be working hard to find ways of increasing
spectrum availability for 3G services.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police mounted 393 operations
against organized crime rings in the country and detained 2,420
suspects in 1999, the Turkish Security General Directorate said in
a report published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It added that a total of 464 pistols, 17 rifles and over 12,000
ammunition cartridges were seized during the period.
</P>
<P>
With technology advance and economic growth, organized crimes
including kidnapping, money laundering and arms smuggling have
increased in the country in recent years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the crime rings, found predominantly in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, and other developing cities, try to win
public support by distributing a proportion of their illegal
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The directorate, in charge of fighting crimes in the country,
listed common characteristics of organized crime rings in Turkey,
stressing the need to cut off mob bosses' ties to their
organizations when they are behind bars.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, captive chieftains of mob rings can often command
from the prisons their underlings at large.
</P>
<P>
The authority has found out the leaders of 92 crime rings so
far, but leaders of another 301 rings have yet to be determined,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Threaten to Boycott Conference in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries have threatened to
boycott an international archives conference due to be convened in
Jerusalem in 2001, an Egyptian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries decided on Monday at a meeting held in Cairo to
inform the International Council on Archives (ICA) about their
intention and ask the council to cancel the Jerusalem conference,
Al Akhbar daily said.
</P>
<P>
Should the Paris-based ICA not respond to the request
positively, the Arab countries will quit membership in ICA's
regional branch for West Asia, the Arabic-language newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab members of ICA will hold their own symposium on
archives in Algeria on the day when the Jerusalem conference opens,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper expected that all Arab and Islamic countries will take
part in the proposed Algeria symposium.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is one of Islam's holiest sites. Israel occupied the
whole of Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and claimed it
its "undivided and eternal" capital in 1980. The Palestinians want
the traditional Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of their future
independent state.

<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran earned some 412,105 dollars by exporting about 1,
756 tons of flowers during the past Iranian calendar year that
ended on March 19.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Iran's Exports Promotion Center, the
flower exports showed a 51-percent increase in weight and a 15-
percent increase in terms of value.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Iran accounts for about 1.5 percent of flower
production in the world.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Commerce Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari said
on Monday that the country would allow the exports of most products
without any restrictions in the third five-year development plan
(2000-2005).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Non-oil Export Bank in
Hamedan, western Iran, Shariatmadari added that the authorities
would not allow the exports of cultural and antique articles,
genetic materials that are detrimental to the environment and their
subsidized goods.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is to support both exporters and
importers during the coming five years through providing them with
special "trade facilities."
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Acting Turkish Prime Minister Gavenescu Vincentiu,
leading a Romanian delegation to probe cooperation opportunities in
the quake-hit northwestern Turkish province of Sakarya on Monday,

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Troops Repulse Rebel Attacks in Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops Tuesday
repulsed two fresh attacks by Tamil Tiger rebels on the army's
defense lines in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Troops (manning defenses north of Pallai) fought back
valiantly repulsing both assaults of the terrorists. Terrorists
were compelled to withdraw southward with their casualties," a
government statement said.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, launched after a five-day lull in fighting,
followed the government's rejection on Monday of a cease-fire
offer from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, said earlier on
Monday that they are willing to call a temporary cease-fire if the
government agrees to withdraw troops from Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Media Mangala Samaraweera called the rebel offer "
ludicrous," saying it was part of the rebels' psychological war
against the government.
</P>
<P>
In her televised speech to the nation Monday evening, President
Chandrika Kumaratunga promised to defeat the advancing forces of
the LTTE in the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We shall leave no room for the LTTE to again fasten its grip
on the 500,000 Tamil people in Jaffna," Kumaratunga said.
</P>
<P>
Some 28,000 Sri Lankan troops are battling to retain Jaffna and
ensure that the rebels do not push their artillery forward to
bring the key Palaly airport within firing range.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Releases Suspect of Virus Creator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police released Tuesday
afternoon a man who may have some connection to the spreading of
the "Love Bug" computer virus that caused huge damage to computers
around the world, a local TV report said.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN television said the police released Rommel Lamores,
whom they arrested Monday afternoon, for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Lamores was detained for further investigation Monday when
agents from the National Bureau of Investigation searching for the
creator of last week's "Love Bug" computer virus raided his home
in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TV report said the government has tagged 10 more
suspects connected with the creating of the virus.
</P>
<P>
The virus has caused a flood of e-mails with the alluring
subject line "I Love You" to course through computer systems in
more than 20 countries from last Thursday, resulting in losses
amounting to billions of U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Starts Building Emergency Network in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has started putting in place an
emergency network to cover countries within the Great Lakes Region
and the Horn of Africa, the Guardian newspaper reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the network was further enhanced on Monday
through the opening of a five-day regional emergency management
training workshop held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's capital.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, the Head of UNHCR's Regional Service
Center in Nairobi, Kenya, Shelly Pitterman, said the regional
emergency network would equip the humanitarian agencies in the
region with the necessary tools to manage emergencies in a region
which has witnessed numerous mass influxes of refugees as well as
massive repatriations.
</P>
<P>
He said in case of a disaster, the regional network would form
a "bridge" , pending the intervention of an emergency management
team from the Geneva- based UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by UNHCR officials from Tanzania
and Rwanda, United Nations agencies in the region, Tanzanian
government officials, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) in Kenya and non-governmental organizations in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 36 participants in the workshop will make the first
roster of regional emergency officers to be deployed in case of an
emergency in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Pitterman, a former UNHCR Representative in Burundi, said that
the refugee situation in the region was unpredictable and complex,
calling on humanitarian agencies represented at the workshop to be
well prepared.
</P>
<P>
Among the subjects to be covered by the workshop are early
warning and contingency planning, protection of refugees,
emergency responses and co- ordination during emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which is designed for UNHCR staff, government
officials and representatives of various partners working with
UNHCR, is an on-going component of UNHCR's overall emergency
preparedness training program, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam regional workshop will be followed by two
similar workshops to be held in Nairobi, one for the other
English-speaking countries in the region and another for
Francophone countries, it added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build First Private Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation has recently signed an agreement to invest up to 41
million U.S. dollars as part of the fund needed in the Kiperu II
power project in Mombasa, an Indian Ocean port city in
southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
This is the first private power project in Kenya to be financed
on a non- recourse project finance basis, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 86-million-dollar project will build a 74-megawatt diesel
generation plant and sell electricity to the Kenya Power and
Lighting Company through a 20-year power purchase contract.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is in an acute power shortage with power rationing in the
country at present. Due to long-spell drought, the water levels
are down in the main reservoirs which affect the hydro-power
generation.
</P>
<P>
The country is also to diversify its power sources and
encourages foreign and domestic investors to build their
independent power projects to provide a much needed stable source
of electricity.

<HEADLINE> British Paratroops Start Evacuating Foreigners from Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The 700-strong British paratroopers
begun airlifting British and other foreigners from Sierra Leone's
capital Freetown late Monday as the situation there continued to
deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers were deployed in the capital's Lungi
Airport and adjacent areas to secure an evacuating corridor for
foreigners in the city, according to reports reaching here from
Freetown. There are about 500 British nationals in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation followed a day of violence in Freetown where at
least four people were killed as former rebel leader Foday
Sankoh's bodyguards opened fire at demonstrators in front of
Sankoh's residence in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence occurred after the United Nations accused
Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels of kidnapping
about 500 U.N. peacekeepers, who are in the country to oversee
disarmament of ex- combatants in accordance with the Lome peace
accord signed last July. However Sankoh had kept denying the
charges.

<HEADLINE> Russia Holds Military Parade on Victory Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia held a grand military parade
Tuesday morning in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate the 55th
anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazism in the Great
Patriotic War of 1941-1945.
</P>
<P>
Newly inaugurated Russian President Vladimir Putin and his
predecessor Boris Yeltsin inspected the military parade, which was
staged at 10:00 a.m. Moscow time (0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the troops participating in the military parade,
Putin congratulated all Russian citizens, particularly servicemen
and veteran soldiers, on the victory of the 55th anniversary of
the war over Nazism during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"Years will pass, but the memory of the Great Patriotic War
will continue to inspire all those living, and give a warning to
those who have chosen terror and violence as their main weapon,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He told the war veterans that "the habit of being winners is
in our blood." "It guarantees military victories and will help us
in the peace time, assist our generation in building a strong and
prosperous country, and raise high the Russian banner of democracy
and freedom."
</P>
<P>
"Our people have gone through many wars. We therefore know the
price of peace. We know that peace means -- above all, a strong
economy and well-being of the people -- the basic components of
Russia's internal and external strength, and of its defense
capability and security. We shall pass this main military secret
over to our children," the Russian president said.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the Victory Day is also being celebrated in the
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), calling
World War II veterans from CIS countries as "brothers and sisters.
".
</P>
<P>
"We all have the same memories of the battles which led to
victory, and the joy of victory. Together we defended peace,
foiled attempts to redraw history, saved our vast Soviet
Motherland, preserved our country's independence and made the
decisive contribution to the victory over fascism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our army has always been and will forever remain an army of
the people. Our soldiers are forging victories not only by their
weapons, but also by their spirit which help overcome all trials,
preserve conscience and honor, and pride for our past and future,
and for the national dignity of the great power. That was, is and
will be so," Putin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The event is also being attended by State Duma Chairman
Gennady Seleznyov, chief of presidential staff Alexander Voloshin,
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and other officials, including former
president of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev reviewed the parade,
with chief of the Moscow military district Col. Gen. Puzanov as
the parade commander. By tradition, the two military leaders
congratulated the troops which stand in blocks in the Red Square.
</P>
<P>
About 6, 000 servicemen and veterans of the Great Patriotic
War, including veterans from CIS countries and the Baltic
republics, took part in the Victory Parade. Ahead of each marching
column, the banners of the fronts, used during the Victory Parade
in the Red Square in 1945, were carried.
</P>
<P>
The march of the veterans and servicemen, the president's
speech and the playing of the national anthem lasted for about 60
minutes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Reiterates One-China Principle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said here
today that improvement of relations across the Taiwan Straits
depends entirely on whether the Taiwan authorities recognize the
One-China Principle and the fact that Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), made the remark
at the Forum on Cross-Straits Relations which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"The One-China Principle is the foundation for the peaceful
reunification of the country and the precondition for the
stability and development of cross-Straits relations," Tang said,
stressing that only if the Taiwan authorities definitely recognize
the principle and the fact that Taiwan is part of China can there
be broad space for the stability and development of cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS official pointed out that the "two states" statement
by Lee Teng-hui in July 1999 has resulted in tension and conflict
in cross-Straits relations, and that new complicated factors have
appeared since the local election in Taiwan this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, some people in Taiwan are still reluctant to
recognize the One-China Principle and the fact that Taiwan is part
of China, although they have used a few "moderate" and "well-
meaning" words.
</P>
<P>
Some separatist forces have been openly advocating "Taiwan
Independence," Tang added.
</P>
<P>
"All this cannot but cause severe concern among compatriots
both in Taiwan and on the mainland," Tang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Adherence to the One-China Principle concerns China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the Chinese government
and people will make no concession on this matter of principle,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tang went on to say that both sides of the Straits have adhered
to the One-China Principle since 1949 when the People's Republic
of China was founded, though the two sides were separated for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
"We now welcome any effort toward definitely accepting the
principle and resolutely oppose any word or deed against it," Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
The official reiterated the central government position on
cross-Straits negotiations, saying that such negotiations are not
those between the central government and local authorities, but
talks on an equal footing to be held under the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
Tang denied that the principle means "degrading Taiwan" and "
the surrender of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear," Tang said. "The Taiwan authorities
should not have misinterpreted it."
</P>
<P>
Tang called on all compatriots on both sides of the Straits to
unite in fighting "Taiwan Independence" and safeguard the One-
China Principle.

<HEADLINE> China to Shut Down Money-Losing Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China will focus its efforts to
close down loss-making enterprises on six industries this year --
iron and steel, sugar, coal, non-ferrous metals, armaments, and
textiles.
</P>
<P>
This will help eliminate the money-losing sources of these
industries, according to officials from the State Economic and
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, the money-losing enterprises will not be
annexed, annexation will be used only for a small number of
businesses, and the process will be very strict.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, will
kick off pilot efforts on debt management in some selected
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Out-moded equipment should be demolished, rather than leased,
sold, or used in other places, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should help resettle employees from closed
enterprises, they said, adding that the enterprises should be shut
down in accordance with law in order to ensure social stability.

<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has expressed
its deep regrets over the human casualties arising from the recent
Lebanon-Israel tense situation and hopes that relevant parties
will soon take measures to calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the
remarks at today's regular press conference when commenting on the
situation in the border areas between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government has always been concerned
that the border situation between Lebanon and Israel has once
again become tense.
</P>
<P>
She noted that it is the consistent position of China that the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon should be

<HEADLINE> China Opposed to Linking PNTR with Human Rights, FM Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang
Qiyue today urged the United States to grant China permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR) without any preconditions and
expressed China's opposition to interference in its internal
affairs in any form.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks at today's press conference in response
to a question concerning a U.S. Congress proposal for setting up a
watchdog committee on the PNTR issue in relation to China's human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. agreement concerning China's accession to the
World Trade Organization is a win-win deal based on equality,
mutual benefit and mutual understanding, but not a U.S. charity to
China, Zhang stressed, urging the U.S. government and relevant
sides to honor the U.S. commitments to China, grant China PNTR
timely and without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has made solemn commitments to China on
PNTR, and the Sino-U.S. agreement was based on the implementation
of these commitments, Zhang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Should the agreement not be carried out, the interests of U.S
companies in China would be hurt, and the U.S. competitiveness
against other WTO members in China would be negatively affected,"
Zhang warned.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China is firmly opposed to any U.S.
interference in its internal affairs in any form, reiterated the
spokeswoman.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel had held secret talks with Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas in the past few months that ultimately were derailed by
the Syrians, European One radio station is to reveal Tuesday based
on sources close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Israel asked for a seven-day ceasefire
in south Lebanon for the release of 20 Lebanese detainees from
Israeli prisons and the bodies of seven Hezbollah fighters held by
Israel, under the mediation by the International Red Cross
organization in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The secret talks coincided with the failed summit between United
States President Bill Clinton and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-
Assad in Geneva in March, and, according to the sources, were going
on with tacit Syrian agreement until after the summit.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's population on its 52nd Independence Day is 6.3
million, compared to 6.076 million last year and 806,000 when the
state was founded in 1948. Some 4.9 million citizens are Jews, and
1.1 million are Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Some 63 percent of the Jewish population were born in Israel,
while 95 percent of them were born after the state was founded,
according to data published Monday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
About 3 million citizens are immigrants, 1 million of whom came
in the 1990s from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Following a minute of silence as a mournful siren wailed,
President Ezer Weizman and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of
General Staff Shaul Mofaz addressed soldiers and a crowd of
hundreds at the Western Wall Monday night, in a ceremony officially
beginning Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel's Wars.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by members of the bereaved families, Weizman lit a
memorial flame in memory of the 19,105 soldiers, who have fallen
since the United Nations partition resolution of November 29, 1947
leading to the establishment of the state.
</P>
<P>
A two-minute commemoration siren will be sounded throughout the
country Tuesday morning as memorial services begin.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli officials called a report carried by the French
newspaper Le Monde "absurd," while Palestinian officials also
dismissed the report.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde reported Monday that most of the final-status issues
have been resolved between Israelis and Palestinians. According to
the paper, a draft of the framework agreement was presented to
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at their summit on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed framework agreement, Le Monde said, the
Palestinian state would sit on 80-90 percent of the West Bank land.
Some Jewish settlements will be evacuated, while others, which
would occupy up to 20 percent of the land, would fall under
Palestinian sovereignty but would be leased to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem would remain in Israeli hands, while the Palestinians
would get administrative authority over parts of east Jerusalem and
an access corridor to their holy sites, the paper said.

<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The powerful Turkish military recommended to the Prime
Ministry that more civilians may be included as members in the
National Security Board (MGK), the highest policy-making institute
of Turkey, in which the military plays a major role.
</P>
<P>
This move is seen as a response by the military to Copenhagen
criterion required for Turkey to be admitted by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The outgoing President Suleyman Demirel gave an address at
the eighth Middle East Technical University Energy Congress on

energy projects.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Glum Over Peace Prospects, Internal Relations: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israelis overall are
pessimistic over the prospects for peace with the Syrians and
Palestinians and the relations within the Jewish community as well
as between the Jewish and Arab citizens, a recent poll showed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli Arabs are more optimistic over the issues
than their Jewish compatriots, said the poll conducted for the
English-language The Jerusalem Post, published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted on May 3-4 among a representative sample
of 500 Israelis. The margin of error is 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects for the peace process with the Syrians
and Palestinians, 35 percent of the respondents thought there would
be a move toward more confrontation while 29 percent said there
would be no change. Only 28 percent expected a move toward peace
and 8 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Jews, nearly half of the Israeli Arabs polled
were optimistic about moving towards peace, with less than 30
percent anticipating more confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the intra-Jewish relations, 77 percent of the
interviewed saw no improvement and nearly half predicting a
deterioration in the relationship between different sectors of the
Jewish population. Only 19 percent saw Israelis moving toward unity
and agreement.
</P>
<P>
Young people were more pessimistic regarding this issue while
the Israeli Arabs were more optimistic that Jews would move towards
unity.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between the Israeli Arabs and Jews in the
coming year, only 17 percent of all the respondents said the two
communities would move towards agreement, while 46 percent
anticipated a move towards more confrontation, 30 percent thought
there would be no change in the situation, and 7 percent had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
Again, the Israeli Arabs were much more optimistic. A majority
of Arabs (38 percent) felt that agreement between Israeli Arabs and
Jews was more likely than confrontation (33 percent).
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of those polled felt there would be no change
regarding any of the above questions.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies French Paper Report on Framework Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli officials Tuesday
categorically denied a report in a French newspaper that Israel and
the Palestinians had already drafted a framework agreement on final
status issues between them.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters about the reliability of the story emerged on
Monday, Israeli Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer said
Tuesday morning that he never heard of such a plan.
</P>
<P>
The minister, one of Prime Minister's confidant and major
participator in the peace process with the Palestinians, just came
back from talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the West
Bank city of Ramallah on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde, one of the most influential French print media, Monday
published the full text of a draft, which it claimed had been
submitted to Barak and Arafat at their summit Sunday evening for
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to previous thought, the report stated, the talks
between the two negotiation teams had pushed forward to an advanced
stage and they had resolved many difficulties between them.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, Israel agrees to transfer 80 to 90 percent land
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, while the
Jewish settlers that currently in the areas will live in the other
10 to 20 percent leased to them by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On the Jerusalem issue, the Palestinians would control several
Arab neighborhoods on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and establish
their future parliament in Abu Dis. An "access corridor" will also
be paved to their holy cites in East Jerusalem, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a fervent guard
trying to keep the whole Jerusalem under Israeli control as its "
eternal and undivided capital", told Israel Radio that the plan did
not sound like anything he had heard from the Prime Minister about
the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for an access corridor," Olmert claimed. "
Everyone has free access to the holy sites in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who are expected to announce an independent
Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East
Jerusalem as its capital by the end of this year, also called the
Le Monde report "baseless and incorrect."
</P>
<P>
The two sides had engaged in intensive talks in Israel's Red Sea
resort of Eilat last week to reach a framework on issues such as
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border,
security and water.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised timetable they both agreed in March,
they should finalize a framework accord by May 13 to prepare for
sealing a permanent peace deal on September 13, the seventh
anniversary of the birth of Oslo accords which officially opened
the Israeli-Palestinian peace track.
</P>
<P>
Due to the indolent peace talks atmosphere, many observers,
including U.S. President Bill Clinton, believed that the two sides
will miss the May 13 deadline again and might reach a framework
deal in June or even in July.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said on Monday that he was confident that the
sides would reach a final accord by September.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Urged to Pass Anti-Cyber Crime Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government asked the
congress Tuesday to pass a law that would impose stiff penalties
on cyber crimes following a delay in the arrest of the suspected
creators of the "love bug" computer virus.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora underscored this need in a
radio interview as he pointed out that the "Iloveyou" virus, which
was allegedly launched in the Philippines, caused much damage not
just here but around the world.
</P>
<P>
Zamora quoted reports as saying the computer virus, which was
allegedly created by a Philippine couple using Internet access
cards,has caused up to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in damage to
computer systems in more than 20 countries in Asia, America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the virus caused much damage. We were not
affected that much, but the Philippines was used as the base to
launch the virus," said Zamora.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has acted swiftly on
the case, and with the cooperation of Internet service providers,
was able to pinpoint the suspected origin of the virus.
</P>
<P>
However, the authorities had to dig up a legal basis for the
arrest of the suspects and finally came up with the 1988 Access
Device Act,which aims to protect consumers from scams involving
the use of credit cards or personal identification numbers.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said it is urgent that the congress comes up with an
anti-cyber crime measure to shield the business community from
hackers who may attempt to cripple the country's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
On his part, NBI Director Federico Opinion said it is not clear
whether the Philippines will allow foreign governments whose
computers were damaged by the virus to pursue civil liabilities
against the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"The crime was committed here. We have no law for this
particular offense. We have to examine all facts pertaining to the
case," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine couple, Rommel Lamores and Irene de Guzman, who
were allegedly responsible for the spread of the virus, have not
been charged yet.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, employees of two separate banks in Manila, were
nabbed one after the other in NBI operations Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Likely to Get Loan: World Bank Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The prospects for resumption of
lending from international financial institutions to Kenya are
high, the World Bank's resident representative to Kenya Harold
Wackman has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted Wackman as saying
that the only outstanding problems between international lenders
and the Kenyan government are the downsizing of the civil service
and the privatization of the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Wackman said on Monday that Kenya had initiated drastic reforms
in the past six months and was involved in negotiations on the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which was a condition set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for resuming lending.
</P>
<P>
"We are discussing the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper now
because we hope to use it as the basis of our lending operations,"
said Wackman.
</P>
<P>
Wackman also noted that the Kenyan government would have to
provide adequate facts and figures to show that all reforms were
adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday an IMF team arrived in Kenya for a two-week
negotiation on a possible new loan deal.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is hoping to settle the loan issue by
July, saying that a new loan deal would boost foreign investment
and help reinvigorate the economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan to Kenya in
1997 in protest at corruption and poor governance, resulting in a
slowdown in economic growth of the country in recent years.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea production is expected
to increase to 260,000 tons this year from 248,000 tons in 1999, a
senior official at the Tea Board of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
The People daily newspaper Tuesday quoted the board's chief

in the tea sector in the first three months of the year despite
drought and freak frosts hit the key growing areas in January and
February.
</P>
<P>
Nkanata said the so far crop level is better than last year,
adding that the output in the first quarter of this year stood
53,870 tons compared with 50,250 tons in the 1999 same period.
</P>
<P>
Africa Tea Brokers said on Monday that last week tea growth
improved as the key growing areas in the east of the country
received decent rains, but the weather was mixed in the west.
</P>
<P>
A weekly report by the Africa Tea Brokers said that Kericho and
Nandi districts in southwestern Kenya had received some rainfall,
leading to a patchy recovery form January frosts and temperatures
there were higher than expected for the time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Kenya Tea Development Authority is to build two
new tea factories in Maragua District in central Kenya to expand
the country's tea processing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of the world's major black tea producers and
exports its tea products to some 40 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Amassing Troops Along Border With Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda denied on Tuesday Rwanda's
claims that the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) have amassed
along their common border.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true. So far as I know, we have not amassed the
forces at those areas," Ugandan army spokesman Shaban Bantariza
told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan deputy Army Commander Joram Mugume also said that he
was not aware of any troop deployment in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor daily, a Ugandan newspaper, Tuesday quoted Emmanuel
Ndahiro, spokesman of Rwanda Patriotic Army, as saying that
Ugandan troops had been deployed at Mirama Hill in Ntungamo
District and Kamwezi sub-county in Rukiga County.
</P>
<P>
"We have received information that UPDF soldiers have been
deployed at Mirama Hill and in Kamwezi," Ndahiro said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unusual development especially considering that it
is coming in the wake of the Kisangani clashes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda agreed on Monday to withdraw their forces
from Kisangani in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) where they clashed last Friday, leaving 10 civilians
dead and 100 more injured.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been close allies for years, but
divisions emerged after they backed rival rebel factions in the
war against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Workers End Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian workers Tuesday ended a
six-day nationwide strike after the Norwegian Confederation of
Trade Unions (NCTU) struck a pay deal with the Norwegian
Confederation of Business and Industry (NHO).
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was organized by the NCTU on May 3 and
described as the biggest since 1986, has crippled businesses
including hotels, construction yard and ferries, and has brought
an indirect economic loss of 900 million Norwegian Krone (about
120 million U.S. dollars), seriously affecting the country's oil
export.
</P>
<P>
The deal would give a general pay rise of 1.5 kroner (one
dollar equals to 7.8 krone) an hour this year and one krone next

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Cross-Straits Relations Held in Xiamen (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 noted figures from the
Chinese mainland and Taiwan gathered today in this coastal city of
east China's Fujian province to discuss cross-straits relations
and related issues.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Zhang Kehui, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), noted that the course of cross-straits
relations have a bearing on the fundamental interests of the
Chinese nation and the happiness of people on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities hope for a relaxation of tensions in
cross-straits relations and for more room for development, they
must have a clear-cut stand on the One China principle and rescind
all forms of "Taiwan independence," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the mainland has taken note of some positive
gestures made by the newly elected Taiwan leader on some specific
issues. However, he said, "We have also noticed that he has shown
no change on whether to recognize the One China principle."
</P>
<P>
People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are Chinese, Zhang
said, and they all hope for peace and don't want to see the peace
across the straits undermined by certain forces, including the
foreign anti-China forces.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time to end the separation of the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits," Zhang stressed. He also called on people on both
sides of the Straits to unite and make joint efforts for the peace,
stability and development in Taiwan, the reunification of the
motherland, and the revitalization of the entire Chinese nation. (

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Cross-Straits Relations Held in Xiamen (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guo Junci, vice-chairman of the Taiwan-based China Council for
the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, noted that cross-straits
relations have entered a new phase of development, and that all
people in Taiwan have the responsibility and obligation to care
for and support the growth of these relations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Guo put forward five points concerning cross-
Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
First, the peace and development on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits are the common need and aspiration of people on both sides,
and opposing "Taiwan independence" and safeguarding peace
constitute the mainstream of public opinion in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Second, accepting, recognizing, and upholding the One China
principle represents the major basis and condition of peace and
development across the Taiwan Straits, as well as the watershed of
peace and war.
</P>
<P>
Third, the development of cross-Straits relations is the
internal affairs of the Chinese compatriots on both sides of the
Straits, and they have the wisdom and ability to properly handle
the relations, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, there is only one China in the world. The sovereignty
and territorial integrity of China should not be separated.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, China will ultimately realize its reunification, and the

<HEADLINE> "General History of CPC" Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The five-volume "General History of
the Communist Party of China," which was published recently by the
Hunan Education Publishing House, depicts the historical process
of combining Marxism with China's reality, several China's
historians here today.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium held today at Beijing University, participants
said that the 304-million-word work vividly reflects the history
of the Communist Party of China during the 1921-1949 period.
</P>
<P>
The book records the struggles in the history of the CPC in an
all-round way. It not only records the activities of the CPC
Central Committee and its leaders, but also that of the CPC local
organizations, non-Communist parties and people without party
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
"The General History of the Communist Party of China" stresses
not only the political and military struggles led by the Party,
but also enriches the weak areas in the research of the CPC
history. It also improves the expositions on the Party building
and its lessons and the Party's foreign policies and international
strategies, and its work on ethnic groups and overseas Chinese
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The five-volume book is regarded as "one of the elite CPC
historical works published in recent years."

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Concern over Israeli Raids on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has voiced Tehran's grave concern over the recent Israeli
raids on Lebanese residential areas, economic centers and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Lebanese Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Salim Hoss on Monday, Kharrazi said the Israeli attacks on
Lebanon in recent days was "an obvious violation" of the ceasefire
accord signed in April 1996 between Israel, Lebanon and Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Stating Iran's support for the stance of the Lebanese
government, he said Israel's planned withdrawal from south Lebanon
was the result of the Lebanese resistance against Israeli
occupation, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hoss in reply appreciated Iran's support for the Lebanese people
and government and said the Lebanese people would reconstruct the
area damaged by the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed two Lebanese power stations and an arms
depot of the resistance group Hezbollah last week, in retaliation
for the guerrilla's revenging rocket attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi discussed the situation in south Lebanon
with visiting former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. He
underlined the need for strengthening solidarity among the regional
states and within the Lebanese communities.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which Iran has refused to recognize and termed as a
threat in the region, has announced it will withdraw by July from
south Lebanon where it has been occupying for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the relations between Iran and Lebanon are supported
by the people of the two countries, calling for expansion of
economic and trade ties.

<HEADLINE> Biopsy Reveals Cancerous Cells on Cyprus President's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Biopsy on a polyp removed from Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides' large intestine have showed cancerous
cells, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But doctors treating the 81-year-old president said the growth
had been completely removed and the president required no further
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the growth was situated in the intestine alone,
that it was completely removed and that the glands and other organs
were untouched make the prognosis excellent," said a statement,
issued by the doctors Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Clerides underwent surgery at a private clinic in Nicosia on
Friday morning. The doctors reiterated that they would not permit
the president to travel to New York for talks with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible he will be in a position to travel for a month
yet," they said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern part of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash have had two round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks to pave the way for substantive talks which may
lead to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
A third round of talks is due to start on May 23 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michail Papapetrou Monday said that the
third round of talks would now be postponed for "a few weeks."

</P>
<P>
This exercise is the 19th of the "Cobra Gold" series.
</P>
<P>
Richard E. Hecklinger, U.S. ambassador to Thailand, said at the

all the previous "Cobra Gold" exercises, which is to "improve
combat readiness and interoperability between the forces of the
participating three nations."

<P>
However, he said, this year's exercise "will for the first time
focus on peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, and will
include the planning and execution of a noncombatant evacuation
operation."
</P>
<P>
"Cobra Gold'00 " is one of the largest exercises involving U.S.
forces in the Pacific region this year. About 13,000 U.S. army,
marine, air and other forces are participating in the operation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Commercial E-Mail Market Expands in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The commercial e-mail market
will reach an estimated 7.3 billion U.S. dollars in the United
States in 2005, cannibalizing direct mail revenues by 13 percent,
according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumers will see an estimated 40-fold increase in e-mail
volume because e-mail is a cost-effective and high-response rate
vehicle by which to acquire and retain consumers, sell and promote
products, drive loyalty and reinforce branding efforts, said the
report from U.S. research firm Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the report said, many Internet commerce and content
ventures have made e-mail the must-have communications vehicle.
Because of the swift time-to-market and the strong return on
investment of e-mail, Jupiter estimates that commercial e-mail
spending will grow from 166 million dollars in 1999 to 7.3 billion
dollars in 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to Jupiter, the expected increase in the volume of e-
mail will strain consumers' attention span. The average number of
commercial e-mail messages that U.S. online consumers receive per
year will increase from 40 in 1999 to more than 1,600 in 2005.
</P>
<P>
"As competition for consumers' attention rises," the report
said, "companies face two challenges: maintaining a high response
rate and maintaining a high-quality dialogue with consumers."
</P>
<P>
Jupiter's research found that businesses can increase the value
of their e-mail marketing to consumers by integration across media,
channels and data. The report also advised that companies maintain
message consistency across all media. The tone and message of e-
mail should reflect the look and feel of print, banner and
broadcast campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Cuts Business PC Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Computer maker Hewlett-Packard
Co. (HP) Monday announced it is cutting prices immediately on its
leading business PC lines by up to 21 percent, according to a news
release issued by the company.
</P>
<P>
HP said the discounts apply to the small-business Brio line,
the Vectra line of corporate PCs and high-end Kayak workstations,
all of which run on Intel chips. Market analysts say the move
could help solidify HP's momentum in the PC market.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by International Data Corp. concluded that
while Compaq and Dell still lead in overall PC sales worldwide, HP
is gaining ground at a fast clip. Among large manufacturers, HP
overtook Dell as the fastest-growing big PC maker, with shipments
for the first quarter of 2000 growing by 67 percent domestically
and by 56 percent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
February figures from PC Data showed HP was claiming 42 percent
of the U.S. retail PC market, compared with 32.6 percent for
Compaq Computer, once the perennial leader in retail.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts, which vary according to configuration, break
down as follows: Prices for Kayak workstations, currently priced
from 1,579 dollars to 3,795 dollars, will drop as much as 21
percent. Vectra corporate PCs, currently priced between 799
dollars and 2,579 dollars, will be reduced by as much as 15
percent. Brio small-business PCs, currently priced between 549
dollars and 1,385 dollars, will drop as much as 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
HP's price cuts follow discounts on processors from Intel and
AMD. Although both chipmakers continue to cut prices, market
analysts say, they are not lowering prices as much as they did
last year due to an ongoing processor shortage.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Leads 2-0 over Philadelphia in Semi-final Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The top-seeded Indiana Pacers
overwhelmed the Philadelphia 76ers 103-97 to open a 2-0 lead in
their Eastern Conference semi-final series in Indianapolis,
Indiana, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of mismatches and using crisp passing, the
Pacers have edged the 76ers and again are threatening to make this
a very short series.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller scored 19 points, including 11 in the first
quarter as the Pacers got off to another quick start. He shot 7-of-
16 from the field.
</P>
<P>
Jalen Rose, coming off his NBA career high, collected 13 of his
30 points in the third quarter, when Indiana put away Philadelphia.
He made 9-of-19 shots.
</P>
<P>
Austin Croshere, a third-year reserve forward, made all four of
his 3-pointers and scored a playoff career-high 20 points,
including 12 in the decisive second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers led by 26 points late in the third quarter and tried
to coast home. After being outplayed for three quarters,the Sixers
cut the deficit to 95-88 with 2:44 remaining. But Allen Iverson
and George Lynch missed open 3-pointers and Indiana stabilised
behind Rose, who sank six free throws in the final 75 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Iverson gained 28 points and a playoff career-high 10 assists
for the Sixers, who are losing players and games.
</P>
<P>
Point guard Eric Snow aggravated the chip fracture in his right
ankle in the third quarter, did not return and appears to be done
for the series.
</P>
<P>
Game Three will be played on Wednesday in Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Direct Shipping Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Direct shipping across the Taiwan
straits, which is being carried out on a trial basis, has been
successful over the past three years, port officials said.
</P>
<P>
A ship started direct cargo linking from the port of Fujian's
Xiamen to Kaohsiung in Taiwan on April 19, 1997 after a hiatus of
forty-eight years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, ships had directly sailed
between Fujian and Taiwan 4,504 times, transporting 812,400 TEUs,
according to local official statistics.
</P>
<P>
There are nine vessels including five from the mainland and
four from Taiwan engaged in the direct shipping services.
</P>
<P>
Profits of all these companies has been growing steadily. Most
of them have changed their small vessels into large ones to meet
the growing demand of transportation. But in the beginning, many
feared that these companies might suffer economic losses.
</P>
<P>
People across the straits have appealed to the Taiwan authority
to open more direct shipping routes across the straits.
</P>
<P>
At present, only one port in Taiwan, Kaohsiung, is allowed to
have direct shipping routes with the ports of Fuzhou and Xiamen in
Fujian Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
Across the straits, large quantity of goods are still
transported via a third port such as Hong Kong, Macao or Singapore,
making shipping companies pay hundreds of millions of dollars of
unnecessary charges each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here today
that China will strengthen cooperation with the Republic of Korea
(ROK) on maritime safety.
</P>
<P>
At the second Sino-Korean Sea Safety Cooperation Meeting held
here today, the China Maritime Safety Administration and the
Ministry of Maritime and Fishery of the ROK reached an agreement
on mutual visits by their maritime officials.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will exchange visits by
four to five officials in charge of harbor inspection every year.
</P>
<P>
The participants also discussed the issue of "non-treaty" ships,
or ships that are not subject to the regulations of the Safety of
Lives at Sea Treaty promulgated by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO).
</P>
<P>
A large number of non-treaty ships carry goods for trade
between China and the ROK every year, and some of these ships have
been stranded in the harbors of both countries because of
differences in safety rules.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Safety Administration official said that the two
countries will deepen their understanding of each other's safety
rules through exchanges of visits by maritime officials, and will
formulate uniform safety inspection rules to reduce shipment
delays and facilitate bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The next Sino-Korean Sea Safety Cooperation Meeting will be
held in the ROK next year.

<HEADLINE> "Love Bug" Finds Way to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The dreadful "Love Bug" computer virus
which had plagued millions of computers worldwide has cast its way
into Jordan, but only hit dozens of private computers as
institutions have taken necessary measures.
</P>
<P>
Most affected computers were in Internet cafes, which were
frequented by customers who were using the Internet to send and
receive e-mails. Dozens of Internet cafes have been forced to close
after their computers were stung by the "Love Bug."
</P>
<P>
The new but fastest-spreading computer virus is carried by e-
mails with a subject name of "I LOVE YOU." When opened, the virus
can destroy graphics and other saved files on the hard disk and
send hundreds of copies through the Internet. Several variations of
the virus have been found.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian experts said the "Love Bug" only hit private
users so far in the kingdom, and no damage was reported so far in
computer systems in banks and financial institutions, electricity
and communications companies and other key factors.
</P>
<P>
The damage is inevitable but it was quite limited compared to
other countries such as the United States and European countries,
which used sophisticated e-mail systems, said a computer expert who
asked not to be named.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hasina's Offer for Talks Left in Cold  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic political development in
Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Monday night wrote a
letter to the Opposition Leader, Begum Khaleda Zia, inviting her
to a discussion Tuesday on the appointing a new Chief Election
Commissioner (CEC) as CEC Abu Hena suddenly resigned Monday,
creating a political vacuum in the country.
</P>
<P>
Before sending her letter to the Chairperson of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), Sheikh Hasina held an emergency meeting
with her senior ministers and close aides at her official
residence in the capital to discuss the situation following the
resignation of Abu Hena.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the prime minister once again sought
cooperation from all, irrespective of party and ideological
affiliation, in promoting peace, welfare, democracy and
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the inaugural function of a two-day program
organized in observance of the 139th birth anniversary of Nobel
Laureate Poet Rabindranath Tagore in the capital, Sheikh Hasina
appealed to all to support the government's efforts to build a
nation free from hunger and poverty as cherished by Rabindranath
Tagore.
</P>
<P>
While the prime minister reportedly expected a positive
response from the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament to accept
her formal invitation for consultation on the appointment of a new
CEC, BNP sources said that Khaleda Zia has decided not to sit with
Hasina for discussing appointment of a new CEC.
</P>
<P>
Rather, Khaleda Zia prefers to meet with the president and
request him to appoint a new CEC on the basis of consensus to
succeed Abu Hena, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hena resigned on Monday citing health grounds. The
resignation letter of the CEC has been submitted to President
Shahabuddin Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
A career bureaucrat, Abu Hena was appointed CEC by the then
caretaker government's Chief Justice Habibur Rahman on April 9,
1996 on the consensus of all political parties. He conducted the
general election on June 12 the same year, which brought Sheikh
Hasina's Awami League to power and Khaleda Zia's BNP emerged as
the main opposition in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hena said Monday that he took the decision absolutely on
health grounds since he has been badly ill for the last few months.
"It was in no way linked to the politics of the country or any
other issues," he stressed, despite the fact that the opposition
parties have launched a movement for the past two years pressing
for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said Monday that the
resignation of Abu Hena is a "victory of the people and the
opposition's movement."
</P>
<P>
Describing Abu Hena as a "controversial personality," the
senior BNP official said that all political parties raised
objection on every election under him, "as people could not
exercise their voting right."
</P>
<P>
Bhuiyan said except the ruling Awami League, all political
parties in the country have been demanding his resignation. Many
lives could be saved and the democratic process could be smooth
had Abu Hena quit when the political parties demanded his
resignation, Bhuiyan claimed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped a new CEC would take appropriate steps to reform the
electoral code of conduct and polls-related rules through
discussion with all parties and others concerned to ensure free,
fair and neutral polls in future.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance will hold a mass procession
on May 16 in the capital to press for the resignation of the
government and an earlier general election in the country.

NAKON SI THAMMARAT, Thailand, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The armed
forces from the United States, Thailand and Singapore kicked off

</P>
<P>

exercise.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 8 (Xinhua) -- American workplaces, and not
homes, were hit hard by the "ILOVEYOU" e-mail virus that spread
like wildfire last week through computer systems, and it resulted
in a significant loss of productivity, a U.S. market research and
public opinion polling firm reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The virus affected at least 600,000 computers, causing more
than 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in damage, said Angus Reid Group,
which conducted a weekend poll among 1,000 Americans. More than
one-quarter of those with Internet access at work reported that
their companies were exposed to the virus, and of that group,
nearly half said that their employers' computer systems were
damaged as a result.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, another one-in-ten said that while damage was
controlled, systems were shut down to eliminate the bug's
potential for destruction, cutting into productivity.
</P>
<P>
All told, nearly half of all workplaces with Internet access "
got sick" from the virus, the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, only three percent of Americans with Internet access
at home were attacked, suggesting that the virus was a workplace
epidemic and concern, the group said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Threatens U.S. Nuclear Lab In New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A forest fire Monday forced a
leading U.S. nuclear weapons laboratory to be closed in the State
of New Mexico and hundreds of people evacuated from nearby homes,
local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Los Alamos National Laboratory Director John Browne said that
by Monday afternoon the fire was just 200 yards from the edge of
the laboratory's huge grounds but still several miles from the
laboratory's plutonium facility.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear research lab's explosive materials are secured in
nonflammable concrete and metal buildings surrounded by earthen
berms about a half-mile from the fire, lab spokesman John
Gustafson said. The closest radioactive materials were about three
miles from the fire, spokesman Kevin Roark said.
</P>
<P>
Only essential personnel reported for work Monday at the lab,
according to local officials, who added public schools were closed
and Los Alamos County told most of its workers to stay home.
</P>
<P>
Officials said some 500 people drawn from local, state and
federal agencies were battling the blaze with the aid of fire
trucks, bulldozers and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Governor Gary Johnson has declared a state of emergency, making
the area eligible for extra resources to fight the fire.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory, located among forests in the Jemez mountains of
northern New Mexico, was set up in 1943 as part of the Manhattan
project to create the first atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
Officials say this fire season could rival the one in 1996,
when intense fires threatened communities in wooded areas and
almost 17,000 acres burned near Los Alamos.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Shuttlers Must Not Lose Awareness, Says Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian shuttlers must not lose
their heads in their opening match against Sweden in the Thomas
and Uber Cup Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on May 11.
</P>
<P>
"Sweden's first singles player Thomas Johansson could be very
dangerous for us. While its first doubles pairing of Par-Gunnar
Jonsson and Peter Axelsson are very experienced in team events,"
said Indonesia's head coach Christian Hadinata in his hotel room
in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
"In their position as underdogs they will play with nothing to
lose against defending champions Indonesia," Hadinata was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the shuttlers were not allowed to underestimate Sweden
and England, which are also in the Thomas Cup's yellow group
alongside with Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn from our experience in the 1984 Thomas Cup
Championships, where we were almost lost to England before winning
3-2. It taught us to be aware of our opponents. There is no reason
for us to underestimate them because they have just returned from
the European Championships. It's very dangerous for us to feel on
top," he said.
</P>
<P>
The head coach said he would evaluate all the shuttlers'
performances in the matches against Sweden and England before
deciding which of them would play against China.
</P>
<P>
As the defending champion, Indonesia aims to retain the Thomas
Cup for the 12th time and the fourth time in a row. On paper at
least, the country looks likely to reach the semi-finals along
with China.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian psychologist Juanita Nasution said the shuttlers
were in perfect condition and they had shown better teamwork
compared to 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I see our Uber Cup team is really integrated this time. Two
years ago we really dependent on Susi Susanti and Mia Audina but
now our shuttlers have equal skills and positions in the team,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Juanita said she could see no gap between the senior and junior
members of the team.
</P>
<P>
"In the Thomas Cup, only Taufik is new but he is already
mingling with others. There's no awkwardness at all," she added.

<HEADLINE> Dazhai Village Returns Terraced Fields to Woods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Dazhai Village, once a major crop-
raising center in north China's Shanxi Province singled out for
praise by Chairman Mao Zedong in the 1960s, has turned its
terraced fields into woodlands.
</P>
<P>
On the hills surrounding Dazhai Village, cypress, pines, peach,
date and apricot trees now are seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Cuiping, a 40-year-old woman busying herself watering the
trees, said, "Crop raising is no longer very important to us, and
has given way to planting trees."
</P>
<P>
Everyday more than 50 villagers voluntarily go up to the hills
to plant trees. "Trees not only benefit us by their fruits, but
also improve our environment," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Fenglian, Party secretary of Dazhai Village, said, "
Pursuing grain output is no longer popular with folks in our
village nowadays, and we have had to give up our traditional
concept of farming."
</P>
<P>
She said, "We have no other choice, as ecological conditions
have forced us to regulate products by turning terraced fields
into woodlands and orchids."
</P>
<P>
Dazhai is a small village with 500 people in the Taihang
Mountains. In the 1960s and 70s, it blazed a way in the building
of terrace fields on rock mountains through hard work.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Mao Zedong began a campaign with the admonition "Learn
from Dazhai," and the Dazhai spirit had been promoted in China for
a decade.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Dazhai Village has annually invested 100,000 yuan
in tree planting and farmland transformation.
</P>
<P>
Now, about 30 percent of its 50 hectares of arable land has
been turned into trees and flowers.
</P>
<P>
This year, the village will invest 300,000 yuan into tree
planting programs.
</P>
<P>
"Now the agricultural output value of our village accounts for
less than 10 percent," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the coal, cement, garment, wine-making
and tourism industries, Dazhai has become the number one village
in Xiyang County, with annual per capita income reaching more than
3,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Police Arrest Former Foot-cult Leader, Nine Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police on Tuesday arrested
Hogen Fukunaga, the former leader of foot-reading Ho-no-Hana
Sampogyo religious group and its nine other senior members on
suspicion of swindling former followers out of a huge sum of money
in "training fees."
</P>
<P>
Fukunaga, 55, and other cult leaders are suspected of swindling
three women out of a total of 22 million yen (203,700 U.S. dollars)
in 1994 and 1995 in fees ostensibly for helping to cure members of
the women's families.
</P>
<P>
The cult is also suspected of swindling large amounts from
other followers by diagnosing them as potential cancer victims and
sending them to a five-day training session for a cure,
investigative sources said, adding that the cult also persuaded
followers to purchase expensive items such as hanging scrolls.
</P>
<P>
The group, based in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture, is believed to
have garnered over 80 billion yen (741 million U.S. dollars)
through what it calls "foot-sole diagnosis," or the reading of the
soles of its followers' feet, and through "training," from about
30,000 followers since it was officially designated a religious
corporation in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Japanese police raided the cult's facilities on
suspicion of fraudulent activities, confiscated documents and
questioned members of the group.
</P>
<P>
On December 7, five former Ho-no-Hana followers filed a fraud
complaint against Fukunaga and 12 senior cult members with the
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.
</P>
<P>
In the first ruling involving the cult, the Fukuoka District
Court in southwestern Japan on April 28 ordered Ho-no-Hana and
Fukunaga to pay 27 people 227.2 million yen (2.1 million U.S
dollars) in damages for swindling them out of money for ascetic
practice fees.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,100 people across Japan have filed similar suits against
Ho-no-Hana in seven district courts, seeking a total of 5.2
billion yen (48 million U.S. dollars) in damages.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Crack Motive Behind Love Bug Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- One day after arresting two suspects
in spreading the "I Love You" computer virus, the Philippine
government said Tuesday that the motive for the act that affected
fiber memories in many parts of the world is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Federico Opinion, director of the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) said the suspects in the dispatch of the bug
will be subjected to tactical interrogation Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The suspects are Rommel Lamores, 27, and his live-in lover,
Irene de Guzman, 23. The two were employees of two separate banks
and they were nabbed one after the other in NBI operations Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opinion said his men secured warrant from the Manila Regional
Trial Court for the arrest of the suspects. However, he said the
couple have refused to give statements to investigators.
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary Artemio Toquero said Tuesday morning over
radio that he was still waiting for the NBI report on the arrest
of Lamores and De Guzman.
</P>
<P>
He said his staff were still conducting researches on what
charges to file against the couple.
</P>
<P>
The two, he said, could be detained only up to a maximum of 36
hours but this would still depend on the gravity of case to be
lodged against them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, undersecretary Ramon Seneres of the Department of
Science and Technology did not discount the possibility that the
virus may not have originated from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The virus has caused a flood of e-mails with the alluring
subject line "I Love You" to course through computer systems in
more than 20 countries from last Thursday, resulting in losses
amounted to billions of U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Vows to Win War Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, MAY 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has vowed to win the ongoing war against Tamil Tiger
rebels as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In her address to the nation over state television Monday
evening, Kumaratunga promised to defeat the advancing forces of
the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the
northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The president also tried in her 15-minute address to bolster
the confidence of a stunned nation which has seen serious military
advances by the LTTE rebels in the peninsula in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, said earlier on
Monday they are willing to call a temporary cease-fire if the
government agrees to withdraw troops from Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Though no reference was made to the LTTE offer, President
Kumaratunga said, "We will not allow half a million Tamil people
in Jaffna to fall into the hands of the fascist rule of the LTTE."
</P>
<P>
Charging that the LTTE was "against giving Tamils their rights,
" Kumaratunga said the aim of the rebel group is "to use the tool
of terror against the people for whom they claim to fight."
</P>
<P>
The Tamil people were clearly opposed to the terrorist and
fascist policies of the LTTE, Kumaratunga said, reiterating her
government's resolve to protect all ethnic and religious groupings.
</P>
<P>
While promising the recently-promulgated Public Security
Ordinance would be used "only in the extreme cases" and would not
remain for a moment longer than required, the president called
upon the "brave youth" of the nation to take an "active role" in
the crisis situation.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila Tries to Solve Hostage Crisis in Its Own Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Manila has obviously been trying to
resolve the two hostage crisises in Mindanao in its own way from
the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
In Basilan, government troops are continuing their military
operations to rescue at least eight hostages who are still in the
hands of the Abu Sayyaf group, a Muslim extremist group in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Daily Tribune said that the rebel group sent
feelers Monday to Basilan Governor Wahab Akbar, expressing its
desire to negotiate the release of the eight mostly school
children hostages it still holds.
</P>
<P>
But Akbar reportedly said that the group is no longer in a
position to negotiate since it is now about to be captured by the
government army.
</P>
<P>
If the story could be confirmed, Manila's strategy to rescue
the hostages by force would prove successful, though at a high
price, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, government forces rescued 15 hostages in an
encounter with Abu Sayyaf rebels, but found that four hostages,
including a priest, were killed, and many of the 15 hostages were
wounded. Three days later, another two headless hostages were
recovered near an Abu Sayyaf camp.
</P>
<P>
But in Sulu, negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf for the release
of 21 hostages has yet to start, as the hostage crisis has entered
its 16th day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada, who rejected ransom for the release,
appealed to the rebels Monday to let humanitarian organizations
help ease the sufferings of the captives, mostly foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking them to allow volunteer medical groups to enter the
area of conflict in Mindanao and deliver water, food and medical
assistance to the innocent civilians now in their captivity," he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Despite the plea, Estrada has not responded positively to
requests by some of his countrymen to withdraw government troops
surrounding the rebels' hideout in Talipao, Jolo Island in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Some people expressed their fear that putting a cordon round
the rebels' hideout might endanger the lives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
However, government troops did not withdraw. On the contrary,
they prepared to send 3,000 members of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF a former rebel group which signed peace
agreement with the government in 1996, to reinforce a cordon
around the Abu Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF fighters, part of a regional militia, will join a 2,
000-strong military force already surrounding the Abu Sayyaf
members who are holding the 21 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, one Filipino, one Lebanese, three German, two
South Africans, two Finns, two French and 10 Malaysians, were
abducted by the rebels from a Malaysian diving resort off Borneo
on April 23 and were taken by boat to the Philippines' Jolo Island.
</P>
<P>
Until now, no one knows what next step Manila will take to
solve the crisis in Sulu, although it promised to exhaust all its
peace efforts to ensure the safety of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts said, Manila seems not happy with any
foreign interference in the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the government rejected the rebel group's demand for
involving ambassadors from all the captives' nations in
negotiations, saying only government negotiators will talk with
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Manila does not want the hostage crisis to become an
international issue, saying that the kidnapping is a domestic
issue.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said Sunday that the
planned visit of Javier Solana, European Union's top security
adviser, to the Philippines Tuesday, may encourage the Abu Sayyaf
extremists.
</P>
<P>
"The more we give a lot of publicity to this particular problem,
the more these people might exploit the situation to get publicity
in the media," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Solana's presence underscores the great
concern of the international community over the hostage crisis and
Manila may feel the pressure.
</P>
<P>
But they are not aware what Manila will do next in resolving
the Sulu hostage crisis.

Monday that German woman Renate Wallert was apparently ill, and
the government had sought to have Abu Sayyaf guerrillas release
her.
</P>
<P>
"So we don't want to be too optimistic but it looks like the
early signs are positive to this direction," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many arrangements to be made before the
rebels, who seized the hostages at a Malaysian diving resort on
April 23, could free the woman, who suffers from high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
"But the initial indications are that there will be some
movement in that direction very soon," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
A doctor who examined Wallert at the weekend said she was "very
weak" and had to be fed intravenously.
</P>
<P>
Istino Jairi Ayyobe, a member of a government panel trying to
negotiate the release of the hostages, said an emissary met a
rebel leader earlier Monday and appealed for the release of
Wallert on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
"They are still considering but they gave no specific date,"
Ayyobe said.
</P>
<P>
The hostages abducted from Malaysia and taken to the southern
Philippines include 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two
South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Cancels Plan to Rent Out Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Maritime Exploration and
Fisheries Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmadja has denied that his
office is planning to rent out small islands.
</P>
<P>
"Such reports are untrue. What we are doing right now is
formulating regulations on the management of the islands," the
minister was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono acknowledged that his ministry has been debating
whether islands should be leased out to foreigners. He said the
country's islands should be used as sources of income, although
some must be protected as conservation areas.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Director General of Coastal Areas, Beaches and
Small Islands Rohmin Dahuri said the government hoped to rent 10,
000 small uninhabited islands to local and foreign investors to
bring in foreign exchange revenue.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 17,508 islands, of which around 10,000 were
uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
Reports on the government's plan to rent out certain islands to
investors have drawn mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
Dahuri said foreign investors from Japan, Hong Kong of China,
Singapore and Australia had expressed interest in renting islands,
particularly for tourism purpose.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Riau province protested against any plan to lease
islands to foreigners, arguing that such a policy could lead to
local fishermen being driven away from waters near the rented
islands.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests have been aired in East Nusa Tenggara province,
which has many small islands that would suit developers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Cardoso Monday criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for imposing credit limitations that affect its social, economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said in Sao Paulo that indebtedness should be reckoned
with in a gradual way, not all at once, as done nowadays, which
ends up by blocking intakes of new loans.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the way in which the country's indebtedness
is treated, stating it's unfair for a 30 year loan to weigh with
the same strength as one of a year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, money lent by creditors is immediately discounted
from the credit chart. Therefore, the country cannot go beyond an
already established limit, even though it hasn't yet received the
total sum of long- and short-term loans.

TIANJIN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- "Flying Pigeon", a bicycle made in

60-year history as a State-owned enterprise (SOE).
</P>
<P>
"To adjust the State capital in the current industrial system,
'Flying Pigeon' will withdraw from competitive trade," explained
Yang Dongliang, director of the Economic and Trade Commission of
Tianjin. "State capital will be used for high-tech industries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, one of China's traditional industrial bases, has
decided to form in three to five years a new modernized State-
owned industry system with high-technology, supported by pillar
industries, and supplemented by urban industries.
</P>
<P>
State capital will be used in electronics information, bio-
technology, modern pharmaceutical and new energy. Tianjin will
also strengthen its automobile, machinery equipment, metallurgy,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Honor Int'l Business Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid reasserted that the government remained committed to
honoring its international business deals, but said contracts
acquired through corruption in the past would have to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever comes out of the regional autonomy plan, we should
not break our international commitments, but we ask the companies
to renegotiate their contracts because (some) contracts were
acquired in the past through corruption, cronyism and nepotism,"
the president was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that foreign investors have raised concerns
about the country's volatile security climate and the uncertainty
over the implementation of the new law on regional autonomy which
is expected to take effect on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be steadfast to this principle (of honoring
international contracts), otherwise we will not be respected and
nobody would want to invest here," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the Military
have agreed to work together to create a conducive and safe
environment for businesses operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI (Indonesian Military) commander has agreed and will
launch measures at his disposal, together with the Indonesian
Police, to help ensure security to boost our exports," Minister of
Industry and Trade Luhut Pandjaitan was quoted by the Jakarta Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Social unrest and rioting have gripped several parts of
Indonesia since the country plunged into its deepest economic
crisis in three decades in 1997, and as Indonesia transforms into
a more democratic society.
</P>
<P>
Many companies have complained of rampant lootings, and the
taking over of land by local people, particularly after the
downfall of the former regime of Soeharto in May 1998 and his hand-
picked successor B.J. Habibie last year.
</P>
<P>
This problem has deterred businesses, including exporters, from
making new investments. Mining companies and oil and gas
operations have also faced similar problems.
</P>
<P>
Luhut stressed that the government's efforts to provide
security for investment could not be effective without the active
participation of the people.
</P>
<P>
"If we all want this nation to be better, we need to work
together to create a conducive environment to recover the economy.
Please don't ruin the good steps already taken by the reform
movement," he was quoted as saying.

NANCHANG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Many local people in Nanchang, east
China's Jiangxi Province, have visited the Nanchang Zoo during the
seven-day Labor Day holiday to greet two popular new-comers: a
white tiger and a white rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
Both rare species are under top state protection.
</P>
<P>
Zoo-goers report that the 3-plus-year-old tiger frequently
circles his cage, occasionally favoring the crowd of onlookers
with a roar.
</P>
<P>
The rhino is more placid about his notoriety, spending most of
his time lying in the sun.
</P>
<P>
The young tiger came to China from Sweden. The male rhinoceros
recently arrived from Changchun, in northeast China's Jilin
Province, where he has lived for ten years.
</P>
<P>
Only 103 white tigers are alive today, ten of them in China.
The white rhinoceros, which originated in Africa, has a world
population of only about 1,000, with 20 in China.

<HEADLINE> Japan Hints to Change Flag-bearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC)
hinted Monday that it is backing away from plans to allow Seibu
Lions pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka to carry the flag for the Japanese
Olympic delegation at the opening ceremony of this year's Sydney
Games, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to force him to carry the flag if there are
fears that he will lose his fitness. Top priority has to be given
to the competition," said JOC President Yushiro Yagi, who revealed
plans to make Matsuzaka the flag-bearer late last year.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Matsuzaka, the 1999 Pacific League rookie of
the year, has been named to Japan's squad along with five other PL
players for the Sydney Games, where professionals are allowed to
take part in an Olympic baseball tournament for the fist time.
</P>
<P>
"Matsuzaka has had a great impact on Japanese youth and that's
the reason why we came up with the idea. But we don't need to
necessarily hold onto it because our main objective is to win
medals," Yagi said.
</P>
<P>
The JOC's latest move is apparently in response to the concerns
of Japanese amateur baseball officials, who consider Matsuzaka the
key to Japan's bid to bring the country its third straight Olympic
baseball medal since the sport became an official event at the
1992 Barcelona Games.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a heavy burden for Matsuzaka if he's the flag-
bearer in Sydney. I say 'yes' if you ask me if he should remain
focused on the baseball games," said Kiro Osafune, director
general of the Japan Amateur Baseball Association.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which took bronze in Barcelona and won silver at the
1996 Atlanta Games, will open its campaign in the eight-nation
baseball competition against the United States on September 17,
two days after the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Taipei, China Split Singles Titles of Asian Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The six-day Asian Table Tennis
Championships ended here Monday after Chinese Taipei and China
took the men's and women's singles respectively.
</P>
<P>
The women's single final, which took place ahead of the men's
singles match Monday evening, was an all-Chinese battle as Lin
Ling and Li Nan eliminated South Korea's Suk Eun Mi and Kim Moo
Kyo respectively in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ling beat her teammate Li Nan 3-0 to take the women's
singles, the fourth gold the Chinese team won in the championships.
</P>
<P>
China had before women's single final won both the men's and
women's team events, and the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
Suk and Kim were tied for the third place of the women's
singles.
</P>
<P>
But China's Wang Liqin, the best male player at last
championships in Osaka, Japan, and Ma Lin, world No. 5, were
forced out of the men's singles finals after their losses to Kim
Taek Soo of South Korea and Chiang Peng-lung of Chinese Taipei in
the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Chiang, ranked 10th in the world, overcame Kim in a five-set
tough battle to win the men's single. Chiang and his teammate
Chang Yuan-Su got the men's doubles crown on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 180 players from 25 Asian countries and regions
participated in the Asian Table Tennis Championships, which
started from 1972 and is held every two years.
</P>
<P>
But according to the latest decision adopted at a meeting of
the Asian Table Tennis Union (ATTU) here, the next Asian Table
Tennis Championships will be held in Bangkok, Thailand in 2003, an
odd year, mainly to make way for bigger world sports events, such
as Summer Olympic Games, which usually falls in even years.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Equestrian Team Confident of Olympics Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand equestrian team
can win the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics if all the horses
are fit, New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Tuesday quoted New
Zealand riders Mark Todd and Andrew Nicholson as saying.
</P>
<P>
Todd said New Zealanders have the ability to improve on their
bronze medal effort in Atlanta, the United States, four years ago
to be serious gold medal contenders at the Sydney Games in
September.
</P>
<P>
"We will be aiming to get there in the best shape we can, and
hopefully we can produce better results than in Atlanta. We have
some very good horses and we have quite a strong squad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said New Zealand has a great opportunity to win gold
at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good bunch of riders and horses and if they are all
fit we'll be right in there.
</P>
<P>
"We would go to Sydney with a good chance of winning it if all
our horses get there. We've got great team spirit," Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's equestrian Olympics preparations are well under
way, according to NZPA.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand selectors will name their Olympics team on July
3.

<HEADLINE> Campbell to Stay in Spurs Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sol Campbell will definitely start
next season at White Hart Lane, according to Tottenham Hotspur's
director of football David Pleat on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pleat has dismissed the prospect of the England central
defender moving to Manchester United, and claimed Spurs were in
talks over a new contract, with his current deal expiring in a
year's time.
</P>
<P>
"Sol has said that he won't be going anywhere this summer,"
Pleat insisted. "Whatever happens, he will stay and see out his
contract. He is staying here."
</P>
<P>
Rumors had been rife at the end of last month that Spurs would
seek a part-swap deal with United to bring in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer,
or even to bring Teddy Sheringham back to north London.
</P>
<P>
But following the collapse of United's move for PSV Eindhoven's
Ruud van Nistelrooy, that chance appears to have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
Pleat said Spurs were currently locked in contract talks with
Campbell with a view to ending talk of a transfer.
</P>
<P>
"I am fed up of people asking me about Sol. Sol has stated
quite clearly that he will only talk about contracts in the summer.
The sun is now shining, it is summer, and we are talking with Sol
literally now," Pleat told BBC Radio Five Live.
</P>
<P>
If Campbell does not agree a new deal, Spurs face the prospect
of losing the 25-year-old defender on a free transfer under the
Bosman ruling next season.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Hands Le Saux Euro Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- English soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan has virtually guaranteed Graeme Le Saux a place in his Euro
2000 squad if the Chelsea defender can prove his fitness before
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
The England boss will keep a close eye on the progress of the
left-back and his bid to be fit for the FA Cup final in two weeks'
time.
</P>
<P>
An ankle injury has sidelined Le Saux since October, but he has
an outside chance of featuring in Chelsea's final game of the
season- six days before the Wembley showpiece against Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "I'll be absolutely delighted if he is considered
fit enough to play in the cup final or in one league game and then
the cup final. If he was fit then, there's no doubt about it, he
would be in the squad."
</P>
<P>
"The door is still open for Graeme Le Saux. He's a left-sided
player, and we haven't got an abundance of them. I would say if he
proves his fitness then I can make a judgment on that, just like I
will with Robbie Fowler," he said. "We must remember England have
three games as well before Euro 2000. Anybody only playing one
game before the end of the season will actually have four games
before the tournament if I decide to pick them."
</P>
<P>
The news will be welcomed by Le Saux, who has been plagued by
injury for most of the season as Keegan tried to find an answer to
the puzzle of England's left-hand side.
</P>
<P>
Le Saux, England first-choice left-back at France 98, has made
rapid progress towards fitness in the final weeks of the season,
and his availability would offer Keegan a vital option.
</P>
<P>
England have Euro 2000 warm-up friendlies against Brazil and
Ukraine after the FA Cup final before Keegan names the 22-man
squad who will travel to Belgium and Holland for the tournament,
which starts on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Before England's first game, against Portugal on June 12,
Keegan's men travel to Malta for a final preparation international
against the island nation.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- People in two towns in
northeastern Oklahoma State of the United States were evacuated as
heavy rain flooded roads and bridges, and shut down schools in
three districts, said reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Craig County Sheriff George Vaughn as saying
that boats and volunteers were being brought in to rescue people
trapped by flood water in Vinita and to remove elderly residents
in anticipation of further flooding as rivers fed by rain in
Kansas continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 centimeters of rain fell in parts of northeastern
Oklahoma overnight and about three centimeters of rain was
expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest flooding came as residents of Sapulpa, just west of
Tulsa, continued the cleanup from a weekend storm that dumped 20
centimeters of rain on the region in about two hours. The
floodwaters damaged more than 400 homes and killed one woman in
Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
Flooding in Oklahoma and Missouri states over the weekend
killed at least three people and damaged hundreds of homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating declared seven counties
disaster areas, clearing the way for federal assistance.

The minister will be head of the ministry temporarily after
Virgilio Galvis resigned as minister of health at the request of
the conservative ruler.
</P>
<P>
Galvis' resignation came when the Colombian Senate Committee
was preparing a debate against him, whose presence had been
solicited in the Congress to explain his relationship with family
companies. He was accused of improper personal enrichment over
contracts according to which his wife's family has selling police
uniforms to the state.
</P>
<P>
Galvis' departure from the ministerial cabinet was known a day
after the Presidency's secretary general, Juan Hernandez, appeared
before the Congress for a debate fro which he presented himself
with the announcement that he quit.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez had to appear before the deputies to talk about his
links with a family firm with which the government had a very
large contract to purchase military uniforms.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana accepted Monday Hernandez's resignation and
named as new secretary-general the chairman of the Colombian
Telecommunications Company (TELECOM), Eduardo Pizano de Narvaez.
</P>
<P>
This measure coincided with the resignation of Nestor Martinez
as interior minister.  Martines stepped down Monday just
minutes before the opposition-controlled Congress was to debate
forcing him out through censure.
</P>
<P>
Martinez was replaced by Humberto de la Calle, a former London
ambassador and vice president under former President Ernesto
Samper.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Close N.Irish Security Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced on Tuesday that it
will close a number of army installations in Northern Ireland as
the peace process regains lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
Sir Ronnie Flanagan, head of the province's police force,
announced that one army base in Londonderry and another in
Cookstown, County Tyrone were to be closed, along with the
observation posts in north and west Belfast and in south Armagh.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said a sixth post, in the frontier town of Crossmaglen
and deep in what used to be known as "bandit country", would also
close in three months.
</P>
<P>
He said the scaling down of the army presence was as a result
of a security assessment which indicated the threat of
paramilitary violence had been reduced.
</P>
<P>
The police chief added that a further review of possible
normalization steps will then be conducted in three months in
light of the security threat prevailing at the time and the
circumstances on the ground.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Irish Republican Army said it was ready to
begin a process that would "completely and verifiably" put its
weapons beyond use. In response the government began steps to
restore a locally elected power-sharing administration by May 22.
</P>
<P>
The latest security reductions came at a time when the pro-
agreement parties were considering proposals put forward by the
British and Irish governments to inject momentum into the stalled
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson welcomed the
announcement, saying it paved the way for further reductions as
the threat to security reduced.
</P>
<P>
Britain has said it will restore a Protestant-Roman Catholic
partnership government, suspended in February over the IRA's
refusal to disarm, by May 22.
</P>
<P>
Britain has some 14,000 troops in Northern Ireland. The army
first rushed units to the province when it was in the grip of
republican unrest as well as attacks by pro-British loyalist
extremists who targeted Roman Catholics at random. All the main
guerrilla groups are maintaining ceasefires.

<HEADLINE> Over 140 U.S. Democratic Statewide, Local Officials Urge Approval of PNTR with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They also released the Democratic Leadership Council(DLC)'s
national petition of more than 140 additional statewide and local
leaders urging Congress to pass the pending trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
Representing the more than 140 Democratic elected officials at
the White House were California State Senator Jim Consta,
President-Elect of the National Conference of State Legislatures,
Stamford Mayor of Connecticut Dan Malloy, Chairman of the
Democratic Municipal Officials Organization, Washington State Lt.
Governor Brad Owen, Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to Washington, because we believe it is imperative
that we show our support for our President and his successful
economic policies," said Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk.
</P>
<P>
"Opening China's market is critical to continuing our economic
growth. As leaders in the communities being affected by the PNTR
vote, it is our hope that our perspective will have some influence
in Congress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As state and local officials, we understand that today's
strong and stable economy depends on expanding markets around the
world for the goods and services our communities produce," the
petition reads.
</P>
<P>
"Expanded trade has been a critical component of the
unprecedented economic prosperity of the past six years... We call
on Democrats to put aside past conflicts over trade and come
together on a dual strategy of expanding markets," the petition
said.
</P>
<P>
The release of the petition capped a full day of activities on
Tuesday for the local elected officials, which included a morning
White House event of distinguished leaders who support PNTR with
China, lobbying Democratic members of Congress in support of the
legislation, and meeting with media to discuss the upcoming vote.
</P>
<P>
The petition released Tuesday is one of many DLC initiatives

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Indigenous People Reject Neoliberalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Indian leader Ricardo
Urcuango warned Tuesday that the insistence of multilateral
organisms to apply neoliberal economic policies in Latin America
will provoke social outbursts in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If in this region neoliberal economic policies go ahead and
there is no ratifying by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank (WB), there will be a tendency for social outbursts
to come about not only in Ecuador, but in the whole region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Urcuango, vice-president of the Confederation of Indigenous
Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), warned at a meeting with
foreign correspondents that this perspective should lead these
organisms to "rethink" the region's future.
</P>
<P>
They should think it over so that "countries' leaders aren't
held as unskilled workmen" for applying their policies, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CONAIE, Ecuador's largest indigenous organization, and
other popular movements are opposed to neoliberalism's economic
model and in recent months have emphasized their rejection of
adjustments and dollarization of the economy as forwarded by
President Gustvo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
Urcuango asked if the IMF "has heart and sense" and insisted
that if this organism and the World Bank don't reverse their
strategies for taking care of the population, "a serious problem
will tend to burst forth."
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's indigenous movement asked the IMF for a meeting that
could take place in Quito or in Washington to expose their
alternatives to the economic model put forward by this organism
and by Noboa's government.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S. Officials Again Call for Approval of PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers and Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky Tuesday
called on Congress again to grant permanent normal trade relations
(PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
"The vote on normal trade relations with China will be one of
the most historic votes cast during the eight years of the Clinton
administration," Summers said in a testimony at an hearing of the
Senate Committee on Banking.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will gain "enormous commercial advantage" by admitting
China into the WTO and granting PNTR to China, Summers said,
adding that it is also in the national security interests of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, in her testimony at the same hearing, said that
regardless of the Congressional debate on PNTR, China will enter
the WTO and continue to export to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"The only question before the Congress is whether we will
benefit from China's accession -- whether we will benefit from the
historic agreement that we negotiated." she said. "Or whether, by
rejecting PNTR, our farmers and our workers and our financial
services providers cede the China market to our competitors in
Europe and Asia and Latin America."
</P>
<P>
She said that it is "vitally important," in terms of U.S. trade
and economic interests, that the country moves forward to grant
PNTR to China.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Consider U.N. Request for Reinforcing In S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking Nigerian military
officer has said that the West African power would consider
sending additional troops to Sierra Leone only "if the request by
the United Nations was formally sent to President Olusegun
Obasanjo''.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff Ibrahim Ogohi was quoted by
the News Agency of Nigeria as saying on Tuesday that the United
Nations had earlier asked Nigeria to contribute two battalions to
strengthen its peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogohi, Nigeria has already sent a "tank company''
to the crises-ridden west African country to ensure the
"effectiveness'' of the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,500 Nigerian soldiers currently stationed in
Sierra Leone, forming the largest soldier group from an individual
country under the flag of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's troops had until last week formed the backbone of the
West Africa Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) in Sierra Leone to help
keep President Tejan Kabbah's government in power since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria finished the withdrawal of its troops under the ECOMOG
last month, mainly on economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian officials, the country is willing to sent
back the withdrawn troops if the United Nations agrees to pay the
bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National Land
Committee (NLC) on Tuesday welcomed the government's plan to make
state land available for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The land committee, a non-governmental organization dealing
with land reform and rural development, said it agreed with the
ruling African National Congress (ANC) that white farmers were
partly to blame for the slow progress of land reform in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
It blamed the land owners for refusing to place their land on
the market for land reform. The committee added that the state is
not able to afford the highly priced land by the farmers.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama warned that if the
willing seller, willing buyer option did not work, the government
could acquire land at prices determined by the courts.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has announced on Monday that it
plans to resettle about 70,000 black commercial farmers on nearly
two million hectares of state land over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
An annual amount of about 300 million rand (about 43 million
dollars) for the 15-year period has been budgeted for the
program.

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs Namibia Support to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Junior Foreign
Minister for Africa Peter Hain Tuesday expressed support for the
Namibian government to offer aid to the Angolan government in
fighting against rebels.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after a meeting with President Sam Nujoma
that Namibia was justified in defending itself against "murderous
raids" by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"Namibia is justified in fighting off groups of UNITA soldiers
that are coming across the border and killing people," Hain said.
</P>
<P>
Since last December, Namibia has allowed the Angolan armed
forces to launch an offensive against UNITA from within Namibian
territory and offered them logistic support.
</P>
<P>
Hain, who is on a two-day visit to Namibia, repeated the
British government's position that a negotiated settlement to the
Angolan conflict is out of the question while UNITA is led by
Jonas Savimbi, who Hain said had repeatedly broken
internationally-brokered peace agreements for Angola.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think it is possible to negotiate a peaceful solution
while he (Savimbi) leads UNITA. He is the author of the war," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 people have been killed in armed raids this year along
Namibia's northeastern border with Angola. The Namibian government
has blamed the attacks on UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Joblessness Reaches Lowest Level in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment reached in
April the lowest level in four years according to the German Labor
Office in Nuremberg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In April there were altogether less than 4 million persons
without jobs in Germany. The Labor Office said that the decline
came both in unadjusted and seasonally adjusted figures. In April
3,986,400 people had no jobs, down 154,600 from March. The jobless
rate is reduced to 9.8 percent, and in March it was 10.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
President of the Labor Office Bernhard Jagoda said that demand
for jobs was rising with the increasing capacity utilization in
the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
But there are big differences in the unemployment rate between
eastern and western Germany. Unemployment in western Germany was
reduced from March to April by 104,900 to 2,585,800 for a rate of
7.9 pert. In eastern Germany, unemployment dropped by 49,800 to 1,
400,500 for a rate of 17.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
German Labor Minister Walter Riester was satisfied with the
latest data, but he pointed out that that the "upswing on the
labor market cannot be overlooked." The German government will
continue its clear policy for improving employment.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Unions Federation DGB said that unemployment should
be less than 3 million despite the latest improvement.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Organ Condemns Renewal of Maneuvers in Vieques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Solidarity with
Peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America (OSPAAAL) condemned
Tuesday in Havana the reinitiating of military exercises in the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques by the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
A communique from this entity stressed the energetic rejection
of restarting maneuvers in Vieques, occupied since the 1940s by
the United States, which uses it "as a training polygon."
</P>
<P>
The OSPAAAL, with it headquarters in Havana, backed up the
Puerto Rican civilian society's claim for the U.S. Navy's
withdrawal from Vieques and the halting of exercises on this
municipal island.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes Monday resumed bombing practice at the Navy
target range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, four days
after U.S. agents ended a year-long occupation of the base with a
roundup of more than 200 protesters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military bombing practice on the 33,000-acre island
off the east coast of Puerto Rico was halted a year ago when
protesters occupied the target range following the death of
civilian security guard David Sanes Rodriguez, killed by a wayward
bomb on April 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The protesters set up 14 comps on the base and another at its
front gate, demanding the Navy end war games on Vieques
permanently and return the two-thirds of the island it owns to
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Puerto Rico is a self-governing U.S. commonwealth with about 3.
8 million people. Vieques has about 9,300 residents.
</P>
<P>
The Navy says the Vieques range is critical for maintaining the
battle readiness of the Atlantic Fleet, while Vieques residents
say the bombing has discouraged tourism, damaged fishing and coral
reefs and is responsible for a high cancer rate on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy has used the island for war games since 1941.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Desires To Broaden Mercosur Horizons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil wants to expand Southern
Common Market (Mercosur) horizons through the conclusion of free
trade agreements related with servicing in the bosom of this
economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia, inside Mercosur's Economic Forum, which ended Tuesday
in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The minister considered it necessary that there is in the bloc
a progressive approximation to common competition policies,
substituting trade defense mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia said that Mercosur has already overcome its worst
crisis and must incorporate Chile and afterward Bolivia as full
associates of the bloc. He recognized, nevertheless, that the
inclusion of both countries won't be easy because of the
difference in taxation and industrial policies between Mercosur
and these nations.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S. Officials Again Call for Approval of PNTR with China (repeat with correction) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers and Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky Tuesday
called on Congress again to grant permanent normal trade relations
(PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will gain "enormous commercial advantage" by admitting
China into the WTO and granting PNTR to China, Summers said in a
testimony at an hearing of the Senate Committee on Banking.
</P>
<P>
It is also in the national security interests of the United
States, he said. "To forgo that opportunity would be a great
mistake."
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, in her testimony at the same hearing, said that
regardless of the Congressional debate on PNTR, China will enter
the WTO and continue to export to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"The only question before the Congress is whether we will
benefit from China's accession -- whether we will benefit from the
historic agreement that we negotiated." she said. "Or whether, by
rejecting PNTR, our farmers and our workers and our financial
services providers cede the China market to our competitors in
Europe and Asia and Latin America."
</P>
<P>
She said that it is "vitally important," in terms of U.S. trade
and economic interests, that the country moves forward to grant
PNTR to China.
</P>
<P>
Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate Committee of Banking,
described the vote on normal trade relations with China as "one of
the most historic votes cast during the eight years of the Clinton
administration."
