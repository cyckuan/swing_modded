<HEADLINE> Steps Recommended for Improving HK Tour Coordinators's Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A study commissioned by a
Hong Kong-based organization for tour coordinators recommended a
series of steps to improve service professionalism of their trade
so as to maintain high-level service standard.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Association of Registered Tour Coordinators
(HARTCO) said here Monday that it commissioned the study, which
was conducted by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, financed by
the Services Support Fund managed by the Industry Department of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government.
</P>
<P>
The study was to evaluate the current professional status of
Hong Kong's tour coordinators and examine the need to upgrade the
industry's service standards by improving skill proficiency and
raising the level of recognition of the industry within the
community.
</P>
<P>
All new entrants to the industry should undergo comprehensive
basic training, pass a basic examination and be formally
registered or licensed, the study recommended.
</P>
<P>
A practical and enforceable monitoring and control system was
recommended to be adopted, including the issuance of photo
identity cards to all registered tour coordinators, random
on-the-spot checks of these cards and the establishment of a
schedule of penalties to punish card holders for unprofessional or
criminal conducts.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations included setting up a code of
conduct/ethics, based on international standards and practices,
banning of under-cost pricing by tour operators, setting up a task
force to review tour coordinators' heavy reliance on shopping
commissions and raising the overall language proficiency of tour
coordinators, especially in English and Putonghua.

<HEADLINE> China Holds Central Conference on Rural Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Conference on
Rural Work, which will decide the major tasks and goal for the
development of China's rural economy in the next year, opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the opening ceremony of the
conference, Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said that the fundamental task
for China's rural work in the next year and for the coming period
is to seriously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenum of
the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The Plenum, which was held in mid-October, passed a "Decision
on Certain Major Issues Concerning Agriculture and Work in the
Rural Areas".
</P>
<P>
"This Decision provides us with the guiding principles for
building socialist new rural areas in China," said Wen, who is
also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past year China has scored remarkable
progress in the field of agriculture, achieving good harvests
despite the negative impact of a series of major natural
disasters. The country's grain production is almost the same as
last year's level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, township enterprises in the rural areas
continued to develop despite the influence of global economic
problems, while new progress has been made in promoting democracy
and building the legal system throughout the vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, he noted, the participants need to make
a careful analysis of the current situation in the Chinese
countryside, find solutions to major problems that now exist, and
make good arrangement for the rural work of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Heads of relevant departments of the State Council, China's
cabinet, and of the CPC Central Committee, as well as leaders in
charge of agricultural development and rural work in all
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across the nation
attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> Africans Called on to Meet Challenges Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 28 (xinhua) -- The OAU Secretary General
Monday Called on Africans to "draw lessons from the unfortunate
experiences of the past and mobilize the necessary energy and
commitment to meet the challenges ahead".
</P>
<P>
In his New Year Message issued here, Salim Ahmed Salim, chief
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) describeed the year
1998 as "yet another very difficult year."
</P>
<P>
He said in 1998, millions of African people continued to live
an unenviable life as refugees and displaced persons and millions
more have been suffering from various diseases and that the
overwhelming majority continued to experience the agony of
poverty, with its attendant repercussions of unemployment,
inadequate shelter, lack of education and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
"The sad and revolting images of the bombings in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam, and in other parts of the continent are still
vivid in our memories," the OAU Chief recalled.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "furthermore, a large segment of our people,
mainly women and children, have been caught up as victims of the
many conflicts afflicting our continent."
</P>
<P>
After listing conflict situation in Somali, Burundi, Angola,
Western Sahara, Southern Sudan, Comoros, Ethiopia and Eritrea,
Guinea Bissau, Lesotho, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Sierra Leone, Salim pointed out that "in sum this has been a very
difficult and turbulent year for our continent in so far as our
quest for peace, stability and security is concerned."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "in addressing the scourge of conflict, African
leaders and other concerned Africans have spared no effort in
promoting peaceful solutions to the various crisis in the
continent."
</P>
<P>
"At the core of these efforts has been our continental
organization, which worked hand in hand with African regional
organizations, the United Nations, and the larger international
community to ensure that the necessary attention and focus is
given to the primary issue of peace, security and stability,"
Salim said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "1998 has not been only a year of problems
and calamities," adding, "it also has been a year of modest
achievements and progress."
</P>
<P>
"On the economic front, and despite an unfavorable
international economic environment, many of our countries have
registered positive results, including encouraging improvements
in GDP growth and in per capita incomes," Salim said, adding that
"in the area of economic cooperation and integration, significant
efforts have been made, particularly in some of the African
regions, toward policy harmonization and coordination."
</P>
<P>
Salim hoped in his message that Africans "should draw
inspiration from the achievements made, despite the many
difficulties encountered," concluding that "let us endeavor to
make 1999 a better year for our people" and "let us strive to
take bolder and more imaginative steps toward attaining the much
needed peace in the continent."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says to Continue to Enforce No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Monday that The United States would continue to enforce
no-fly zones in northern and southern parts of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said a U.S. warplane's firing at an Iraqi target was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
"Our pilots have the authority to protect themselves if they
are attacked. They took appropriate action today in responding to
Iraq's actions," he said in a statement. "We will continue to
enforce the no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came after he was briefed by a senior
official of the National Security Council that a U.S. fighter
attacked an Iraqi missile battery at the no-fly zone in northern
Iraq in response to "an act of aggression" against U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said the
incident happened while patrolling U.S. fighter planes met with
Iraqi "hostile action," "an act of aggression, against U.S.
aircraft flying as part of Operation Northern Watch", in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 1 p.m. local time, just north of
Mosul, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the U.S. warplane returned fire after being
attacked by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles. He was happy that the
plane returned safely to its base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the no-fly zones, established in 1991 after the
Gulf War, "have been and will remain an important part of our
containment policy".
</P>
<P>
"Because we effectively control the skies over Iraq, Saddam
(Hussein) has been unable to use air power against his own
people or lash out again at his neighbors," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Baghdad said Western warplanes fired missiles at
an air defense site, killing four Iraqi soldiers and injuring
seven others. Iraqi air defenses fired back in response, forcing
the warplanes to fire, the Information Ministry reported in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Arab Ministerial Meeting Put off to Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- An Arab foreign ministerial
meeting slated for Wednesday has been put off to next month due to
the rifts among the Gulf states, Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that after intensive contacts and
consultations over the past 24 hours, the Arab countries have
agreed to convene the meeting in Cairo on January 24.
</P>
<P>
He said the postponement came at the request of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, a regional alliance comprising Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said the league is ready to host the meeting
at any time agreed on by all the Arab states concerned.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, Yemen proposed to hold an emergency Arab summit
to discuss the latest developments in the Arab world, especially
the recent U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq, and seek ways of
restoring Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched missile attacks on Iraq on
December 16-19 with a declared aim of retaliating Iraq's defiance
of the U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The inspections began in 1991 after the Gulf War, triggered by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, to ensure Iraq clears off all
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministerial meeting is designed to discuss the
Yemen's call.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and other Gulf Arab countries have said they have no
objection to any envisaged summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait boycotted a meeting of the Arab Parliamentary
Union held Sunday in Amman to discuss the Iraqi crisis following
the U.S.-British attack.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes in Turkey Fire at Iraqi Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A fleet of U.S. warplanes took
off from southern Turkey and fired at an Iraqi target at the
no-fly zone in northern Iraq, Turkish sources told Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that "eight F-16 fighter planes took off from
the Incirlik Airbase in Adana, southern Turkey at noon and
attacked at an Iraqi target in the no-fly zone."
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomat, who asked not to be named, said that "Iraq
launched missiles against the U.S. warplanes patrolling in the
no-fly zone in northern Iraq and the U.S. warplanes launched
counter-attacks against the Iraqi target."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Baghdad said U.S. warplanes flying from Turkey
violated Iraqi airspace in the so-called no-fly zone in northern
Iraq and fired missiles at an air defense site, killing four Iraqi
soldiers and wounding seven others.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers fought back courageously, forcing the warplanes
to flee, the Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman as
saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Foreign Ministry issued no statement on
whether the U.S. warplanes took off from the Incirlik Airbase to
fire at the Iraqi target.
</P>
<P>
Multinational troops led by the U.S. used the Incirlik Airbase
to bombard northern Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sends Reinforcements to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has sent 600 more
soldiers to Sierra Leone to reinforce defense against rebels who
threatened to march on the capital Freetown, a spokesman for the
west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report from the capital of the west African country said the
reinforcements, who arrived on Sunday evening, increased the size
of the Nigerian-led troops to around 12,000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as Sierra Leone's neighbors are holding talks in Cote
d'Ivoire on the conflict, the spokesman said more reinforcements
and equipment would arrive during the week ahead.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that Revolutionary United Front rebels
and renegade soldiers, who ousted elected President Ahmed Kabbah
from May 1997 to March 1998, had attacked Makeni, a northern town
some 100 km northeast of the capital Freetown and taken control
of it.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG spokesmen in Freetown declined comment on the state of
the battle for the town, which began on December 23. Rebels
entered the town over Christmas. But ECOMOG said Saturday that it
had expelled them again.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took up arms in 1991. They agreed on a peace deal
with Kabbah after his 1996 election but it unravelled and they
rallied to the 1997 coup.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG restored Kabbah to power in March 1997 but the rebels
and their allies in the ousted military junta regrouped
up-country. They have intensified their raids in the east and
stepped up attacks in the country since RUF leader Foday Sankoh
was sentenced to death for treason last October.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have around 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers, including
youngsters reportedly press-ganged into fighting for them.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah can count on the support of a traditional hunters'
militia, the Kamajors, who number 25,000 to 30,000, apart from
the ECOMOG troops.

<HEADLINE> Job Cuts Planned by German Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Half of Germany's industrial and
business sectors plan to cut jobs in 1999, according to a survey
published Monday by the Institute for German Economic Research
(IW).
</P>
<P>
The survey of 42 industrial and business sectors revealed that
only four planned to create new jobs in Germany next year. These
were the tourism, skilled crafts, rubber and moving sectors.
</P>
<P>
But executives in 21 sectors said they planned to cut their
workforces in 1999. Among those pledging cuts were such key
branches as banking, insurance, construction, food processing,
oil, electricity and steel.
</P>
<P>
Companies in the remaining branches said they planned no
changes in employment levels. These included the important
chemicals, aerospace, automobile, ship-building, machinery, optics
and electronics sectors.
</P>
<P>
German unemployment hit a post-World War II record of 12.6
percent - 4.8 million unemployed - earlier this year. The rate has
since sunk to 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IW said uncertainty over Chancellor Gerhard Schoreder's
policies and tougher competition from abroad were reflected in
corporate investment plans.
</P>
<P>
"Many concerns have temporarily suspended previously planned
investment and, above all, are keeping open the option of more
foreign investment," said the IW in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new center-left government has said it will not cut
corporate taxes until 2002. Following sharp protests from business
leaders Schroeder backed down and said if enough revenue was
available the cuts might go ahead in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Europe Divided over Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Plans by Germany's new
center-left government to close nuclear power stations have put
Bonn at odds with other European countries, a German government
publication admitted Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The use of nuclear power divides Europe," said Germany's
Federal Press Office in its Europa Interview monthly.
</P>
<P>
France is the leading nuclear nation in Europe and generates 78
percent of its electricity from 58 nuclear stations, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Belgium was the second biggest nuclear user, producing 60
percent of its electricity from seven stations, followed by Sweden
which draws 46 percent of its power from 12 stations.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which is fourth ranked, produces 32 percent of its
electricity from 19 nuclear stations.
</P>
<P>
But nuclear station closure means German electricity will have
to come from other sources, said the report.
</P>
<P>
With the liberalization of European energy markets in 1999,
electricity can be imported. Although the report does not spell it
out, this means electricity from French nuclear stations could
wind up being exported to Germany to make up for shortfalls caused
by German nuclear closures.
</P>
<P>
The heavy use of nuclear power by some E.U. states contrasts
with Italy and Denmark which have no nuclear power plants.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Clashes Erupt over House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes broke out at
a Palestinian village in the West Bank Monday as Israeli soldiers
tore down two Palestinian houses as "illegal buildings."
</P>
<P>
Israeli TV Channel One showed a middle-aged Palestinian man, a
child in his arms, was at the door of his house trying to block
the soldiers. He fell to the ground when the soldiers forcefully
evicted him.
</P>
<P>
A bulldozer soon leveled the house and a shack. Angered, dozens
of villagers threw stones at the soldiers, who responded with tear
gas and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
With his wife crying besides the ruins, the Palestinian man
shouted in rage, vowing he will revenge and will teach his
children the way of Hamas, the resistance movement that has staged
a series of deadly attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said an Israeli soldier and a border policeman
were injured in the clashes. At least one Palestinian youth was
seen bleeding on his forehead on the TV.
</P>
<P>
Israel has stepped up its campaign to demolish Palestinian
houses in the occupied territories over the past year as a way to
tighten control there.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that the houses it demolished were illegal ones
because the Palestinians had not got permits before they were
constructed. The Palestinians argue that it was almost impossible
for them to get a permit at any time.
</P>
<P>
The demolition of houses and the confiscation of Palestinian
lands for building by-pass roads for Jewish settlers in the West
Bank have triggered sporadic clashes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the military wing of Hamas vowed in a
statement Monday to go on with "armed struggle" against Israel,
threatening to conduct more attacks if Israel continues to arrest
Palestinians and confiscate their lands.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a petrol bomb was thrown outside a religious
school in the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, but caused no
damage.

<P>
Russia will also facilitate the settlement of crises in the
Middle East, in the Gulf area and other regions in order to find
political solutions through concerted international efforts
respectful of the supremacy of international law, said Ivanov.

<HEADLINE> W. African States Meet to Discuss S. Leone Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- West African states met in
Abidjan Monday for emergency talks on renewed civil war in Sierra
Leone, stressing the need for dialog between the warring sides, a
report reaching here from the Ivorian commercial capital said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held by the special committee of the economic
community of west African states (ECOWAS) after Nigeria rushed
600 more troops to Sierra Leone over the weekend to reinforce the
west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG following the alleged
seizure of a northeastern town of Makeni by rebels.
</P>
<P>
Togo's Foreign Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, chairing the
talks, said national reconciliation was the key to peace in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We must insist on the necessity to organize a true dialog --
a frank and sincere dialog between Sierra Leone's feuding
brothers," Koffigoh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Previous meetings of the committee had concentrated on
protecting elected President Ahmad Kabbah, who was restored to
power last March after a military junta kept him in exile for 10
months.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian-led troops evicted the junta and its Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) allies from Freetown, clearing the way for
Kabbah's return.
</P>
<P>
But regrouped junta loyalists and RUF rebels have renewed
their campaign against Kabbah's government recently and
threatened to march on the capital of Freetown after taking
Makeni, a town 100 km northeast of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the new stress on dialog reflected concern over
the future role of regional superpower Nigeria in Sierra Leone
peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing fear in the region that a new civilian
government taking over in Nigeria in May next year may not want
to shoulder the burden of peace-keeping in Sierra Leone," a west
African diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Secretary-General Lansana Kouyate said Nigeria demanded
the emergency meeting after rebels attacked close to Freetown
last week, sparking panic in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The latest Nigerian reinforcement boosted ECOMOG to around
12,000 troops as against about 15,000 to 20,000 rebel soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Former colonial ruler Britain and the United States, which
were also represented at the meeting, evacuated their citizens
from Freetown last week.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda will meet in Arusha town in northern Tanzania
next month to review progress of the two-year-old East African
Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
The summit, second of its kind, will discuss among other
things, the suggestion of signing a treaty for the cooperation
and a request by Rwanda to join the regional grouping which
currently comprises only three countries.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the East African Secretariat in Arusha said
Monday that the meeting is scheduled between January 18 and 21.
The last summit was held in mid 1997 when the leaders met to
revive the the cooperation of east African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the meeting next week will
also review decisions endorsed by the Permanent Tripartite
Commission, the highest decision making body of EAC, whose
chairman is Tanzania's Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the EAC is broad, covering regional cooperation
in political, economic, social, cultural, security and legal
affairs. In the short run, EAC member countries will give
priority to economic cooperation, which is crucial to political
cooperation in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the three member states have held not less
than 40 sectoral meeting aimed at harmonizing policies for the
establishment of a single market and investment area over the
past months.
</P>
<P>
The meetings have covered harmonization of fiscal and monetary
policies, movement of people and vehicles across borders within
the region, development of regional economic infrastructure,
telecommunications, energy, roads, railways, civil aviation and
shipping.
</P>
<P>
Other important sectoral meetings discussed security as well
as legal and judicial affairs.
</P>
<P>
EAC's predecessor, the defunct East African Community,
collapsed in 1977 due to the divergence of economic policies then
pursued by the member states, the continued perception of
disproportionate sharing of benefits accrued form economic
integration and other factors.

<HEADLINE> Pangalos: Conditions Created to Reassess Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- New conditions had been created
in light of which the Russian-made S-300 missile issue must be
reassessed, Greece's Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said in
an interview with a local daily newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conditions referred to by Pangalos were the two resolutions
on Cyprus adopted last week by the U.N. Security Council and a
statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions demanded lowering tension and resuming
inter-communal negotiations in Cyprus while Clinton pledged to
take all necessary steps to support the resolutions with an aim to
end the tragic division of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos added that the final decision concerning the S-300
missiles would be taken by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
the country's National Council but also seriously taking into
consideration Greece's views.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greece's Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Monday that the issue of whether the missiles
would eventually be deployed in Cyprus or the southern Greek
island of Crete was a technical matter which would be dealt with
the governments of Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an army post on the Greek-Turkish border,
Tsohatzopoulos said that the responsibility of Cyprus and Greece
in Tuesday's talks would reflect the steadfast choice of
strengthening the joint defense of both countries, the
strengthening of their apability to stand firmly and defend the
prospects for Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Clerides arrives in Athens later Monday to
discuss with Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis the planned
installation by Nicosia of the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Clerides will agree to deploy the missiles
in Crete instead of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus announced last year plans to purchase and deploy the
missiles from Russia with an aim to bolster its defense, but
Turkey has threatened to use force to prevent the missile
installation.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Lift Travel Ban to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan will lift a travel ban
Tuesday and allow its citizens to visit Egypt, a senior Japanese
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Muneo Suzuki said that he
has informed Moussa about his country's decision.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "very constructive," Suzuki said that
he discussed with Moussa means to enhance bilateral relations in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight foreign tourists, including a newly-married
Japanese couple, were killed by terrorists in November 1997 in
Luxor, a resort 520 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
After the tragedy, Japan banned its citizens from traveling to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Luxor massacre dealt a heavy blow to Egypt's tourism. The
latest issue of the London-based Middle East Economic Digest
weekly said Egypt's tourism receipts fell to 449 million
U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 1998 from 1,177 million
dollars in the third quarter of 1997 before the killing.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter of the year began to see a modest recovery
to 564 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's decision is believed to be able to stimulate Egypt's
tourism, one of its four major foreign currency earners, since a
large number of Japanese tourists visited the country each year
before the Luxor incident.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan-Ugandan Army Clashes in Congo (K) Denied. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan army spokesman Major
Emmanuel Ndahiro has dismissed a report by a Ugandan paper saying
that there was an exchange of fires between Rwandan and Ugandan
soldiers stationed in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
An Independent Ugandan paper, The Monitor, reported that 30
Rwandan Patriotic Army soldiers died in a fire exchange with the
Ugandans deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a special
story reaching here Monday from Rwandan News Agency (RNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor Sunday quoted a Ugandan army officer, whose name
was withheld, as saying that eight Ugandan soldiers were also
killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
"It a mere fabrication, and we cannot understand the rationale
behind it," Ndahiro was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now there has been no physical fight, let alone a fire
exchange," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan army spokesman said that the reported incident
could not have taken place since Rwandan troops are not present
in northeastern Congo, where the Ugandan People's Defense Force
soldiers are based.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan paper had alleged that the row between Rwandan and
Ugandan soldiers stemmed from the fact that the two armies
backing different factions of Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan officer, quoted by The Monitor, claimed that while
Uganda is favorable to the newly-born Congolese Liberation
Movement (MLC) led by Jean Pierre Bemba, Rwanda allegedly
supports the main rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) chaired by professor Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandans are said to accuse the RCD of being unpopular,
while MLC is said to be dynamic and has proven it can raise the
Congolese people against president Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Ndahiro dismissed any disagreement between Rwanda and Uganda
concerning the on-going conflict in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
"We have officially agreed not to support any faction,"
Ndahiro said.
</P>
<P>
The RCD Deputy-Chairman, Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma also blasted The
Monitor's report saying that there is no antagonism whatsoever
between their main allies, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Ngoma indicated that allegations that RCD is unpopular is
groundless, "since we have been enjoying warm welcome in towns
and localities which fell under our control".

MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni returned home Monday afternoon from his three-day Libya
visit where he held talks with Muammar Gaddafi on issues
involving the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Museveni, who
was accompanied by State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama
Mbabazi and State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma, was met at
Entebbe Airport by Vice President Specioza Kazibwe.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two leaders discussed issues on
bilateral relations, the four-month-old conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other issues in the
region, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not say whether Museveni held talks with
Congolese President Laurent Kabila who was on a visit to Libya
from Christmas day.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused by President Laurent Kabila of backing
the rebellion in his country, a charge Kampala has denied.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has held that Kabila hold direct talks with the rebels
and that all foreign troops withdraw out of Congo (K),the third
largest African country.
</P>
<P>
But Kabila has refused this suggestion and the fighting in the
eastern part of Congo (K) is now at stalemate.

<HEADLINE> Likud, Labor Agree upon Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's two main parties,
the Likud and the Labor, reached a compromise Monday on the date
for early elections, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
After hours of talks in the evening, representatives from the
two parties agreed to hold the elections on May 17, and a second
round, if needed, on June 1, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Likud had favored a date as close as
possible to May 4, the deadline of the five-year interim period
set in the Oslo accords between Israel and the Palestinians and
when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said he will declare an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly wanted to use
what he called the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state
as a card to strengthen his position in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Labor Party had demanded that the elections
be held as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
But recent reports said Labor leader Ehud Barak also wanted
the elections to be held in a later date in hopes that the
reputation of another challenger, the popular former Chief of
Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, would ebb as time drags on. Barak
denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
Israeli parliament passed the first reading of a bill calling
for early elections on December 21. If the date agreed upon by the
two largest parties is approved by the law committee of the
parliament, the bill will be presented for its second and third
reading in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Watchful of Latest Strike in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is closely watching the
latest developments of the Iraqi crisis after the United States
fired missiles at an Iraqi target in northern Iraq early Monday,
local media reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military and Foreign Ministry have been
maintaining constant contacts and keeping each other informed on
the development of the confrontation between the U.S. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said that the U.S. warplanes
patrolling in the no-fly zone in northern Iraq fired back at Iraqi
air defense sites after being exposed to surface-to-air missile
attacks from the Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
They added that the U.S. aircraft, taking off from Turkey, were
conducting the "Operation Northern Watch," an ongoing operation in
which U.S. and British warplanes stationed at the Incirlik Air
Base in Adana, southern Turkey, monitor the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led allies set up the no-fly zone in northern Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War allegedly to protect the Kurds there.
</P>
<P>
Multinational troops led by the U.S. used the Incirlik air
base in Adana in bombarding northern Iraq during the Gulf War
triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that four Iraqi soldiers were killed and seven
others wounded during Monday's attack, the first casualties
officially reported by Iraq after the U.S. and Britain concluded
on December 19 their four nights of air strikes against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> New Law for Healthy Development of Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's first Securities Law,
which was promulgated here today, is a great achievement of the
nation's reforms and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The law, adopted by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, the country's top legislative body, will play
an important role in forming a sound socialist market economy,
establishing a socialist legislative system, and protecting the
healthy development of China's securities market.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the law will promote the pooling of funds,
protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors, and
prevent and resolve financial risks.
</P>
<P>
In creating the law, legislators drew lessons from the Asian
financial crisis and China's experiences during the development of
its financial sector.
</P>
<P>
With three fundamental principles governing the issuance of
stocks -- openness, equity and fairness -- the new law will help
standardize, supervise and regulate the immature securities market
in China. The law will also strictly prohibit fraud, insider
trading and market manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The new Securities Law will become effective on July 1, 1999,
and the next thing for the Chinese people to do is to study and
understand it, and use it as a weapon to protect their legitimate
rights.

<HEADLINE> Defected KR Leaders Say Sorry to Cambodian people </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Defecting Khmer Rouge
leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea said Tuesday they were very
very sorry to Cambodian people.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea said at a press conference held in
the Royal Phnom Penh Hotel that they were very very sorry to the
Cambodian people for their misery and suffering.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I am very regrettable not only for the lives of the
people but also lives of the animals. We are very regrettable,"
Nuon Chea said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are also the hostages and victims of the civil war just
like Cambodian people. So we should, as Prime Minister Hun Sen had
put forward, dig a hole and bury the past and look ahead into the
21st century," Khieu Samphan said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what their reaction to set up an international
tribunal to prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu said Cambodia's
issues should be resolved with Cambodia's way and in accordance
with the Paris Peace Accords signed by all factions on October 23,
1991. "Please, let our people and nation resolve our own
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To let bygones be bygones is the best solution for our country
because it is the only way to reach national reconciliation. We
will do our best to end the war and maintain the national
reconciliation," added Khieu.
</P>
<P>
The nominal KR leader Khieu Samphan, 67, was in good health but
top ideologue Nuon Chea, 71, looked very weak.
</P>
<P>
They arrived here Tuesday morning with their families and met
with Prime Minister Hun Sen and President of the National Assembly
Prince Ranariddh separately who gave them warm welcome and praised
their defection to the royal government.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan told the reporters at the Royal Phnom Penh Hotel
after the meeting that he was very happy to return to the capital,
saying it reflected the national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
It was Khieu's first time returning to the capital since early
1994 when the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the royal government.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Chea has not been in Phnom Penh since the toppling of the
Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 when Vietnamese forces invaded and sent
the movement to jungle bases.
</P>
<P>
The two defected to the royal government on Friday after talked
to Prime Minister Hun Sen through telephone.

<HEADLINE> China's Natural Conservation Land Up to Average World Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The ratio of legally conserved
natural land to the total land area of China has reached 7.64
percent, up the average world level of 7 percent, said a Chinese
wildlife-protection official today -- International Day
for Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongfan, deputy director of the Department of Wildlife
Protection under the State Administration of Forestry, said that
the establishment of nature reserves is still the primary method
of maintaining bio-diversity worldwide, and the number of nature
reserves has a significant meaning for global efforts to protect
bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
China now has 926 nature reserves, while only twenty years
ago, when China began its reform and opening-up drive, there were
but 34 such reserves in the country, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"About 100 new reserves will be set up every year for the next
several years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said he was also very proud of China's
international cooperation in bio-diversity protection. For
example, the Global Environment Facility's first bio-diversity
project in China -- the China Nature Reserve Management Project --
has achieved good results since it was launched in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"In our nature reserves we have largely improved field
patrolling and have established good partnership relations with
neighboring villagers; and we have also successfully transformed a
large stretch of forest with rich bio-diversity resources from a
logging area into a new national nature reserve," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Susan Chen, a senior ecologist with the World Bank, expressed
her satisfaction with the cooperative spirit shown by the Chinese
bio-diversity protection officials. "They are among the best
counterparts I have ever met in the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
The International Day for Biological Diversity was started in
1994 by the United Nations to mark the International Convention on
Bio-Diversity that went into effect on December 29, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Worst Part of Pak Economic Crisis Over: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Ishaq Dar said Tuesday that the worst part of the economic crisis
faced by Pakistan is over and key economic indicators are
improving.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully managed to take the economy out of the
wood. Inshallah (by the wish of God), in the coming months, the
economy would move towards growth and stability," Dar said at a
press briefing here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Considering the economic difficulties faced by Pakistan as a
result of economic sanctions, "we have managed to maintain growth
and macro-stability on the one hand and have met our commitments
to preferred creditors on debt servicing liabilities on the
other," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Dar expressed the hope that Pakistan will continue to meet its
commitments on debt servicing in coming months.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that despite difficulties it has been
possible for Pakistan to maintain industrial growth of three
percent during the first four months (July-October) of the current
fiscal year as against a decline of 1.3 percent in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of industrial sector is fairly broad-based.
Items belonging to consumer, manufactured and electronic goods
registered substantial growth," Dar added.
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side, Dar said, gross revenue collection by the
Central Board of Revenue from July to November amounted to 123.7
billion rupees (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) which is almost five
percent higher than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said that monetary expansion has been kept in
check. Money supply during July-November period increased by 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation continues to be low. The Consumer Price
Index (CPI) during July-November period increased by 6.6 percent
as compared to 10.2 percent in the corresponding period of last
year, said Dar.
</P>
<P>
Trade imbalance during the period has improved by 46 percent
from 1.021 billion dollars to 554 million dollars, said Dar,
adding that in fact, the trade deficit is lowest in the last six
years.

As required by contract, letters of credit were to be posted
last week for the remainder of the fighters' purses: nine million
U.S. dollars for Foreman and 3.6 million U.S. dollars for Holmes.

400,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The non-title fight is planned for January 23 at the Astrodome

licensing hearing for medical clearance in Austin, Texas, but was
a no-show. When contacted about the remainder of his purse, he
said, "No commend."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Suffers Heavy Losses by Soeharto Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian state suffered
financial losses totaling 2,850 billion rupiah (one U.S. dollar
equals 8,000 rupiah) by corrupt, collusive and nepotistic (KKN)
practices involving former president Soeharto, high-ranking
officials of his government and his cronies, a senior cabinet
minister announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The abuses were committed at five ministries and three
non-ministerial state agencies, Coordinating Minister for
Development Supervision/State Reform Hartarto said at a press
conference after meeting with President B.J. Habibie at Merdeka
Palace.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said the finding was the result of the second phase of
a government effort to eradicate the abuses.
</P>
<P>
Both the attorney general and the head of Agency for the
Financial Auditing of National Development (BPKP) had begun to
take concrete and intensive measures to end the irregularities, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The KKN practices mainly consisted of the granting of special
facilities and privileges by the ministers and state enterprises
concerned private economic units or limited liability companies
owned or controlled by members of Soeharto's family or his close
associates, Hartarto said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister for State Enterprises Tanri Abeng said the
government had canceled 79 KKN-tainted projects.
</P>
<P>
The 79 had been part of a total of 167 projects his office had
previously suspended of having been created through KKN.
</P>
<P>
Mine and Energy Minister Kuntoro Mangkusubroto said on the same
occasion, his ministry had identified 152 projects run by
state-owned petroleum and natural gas company Pertamina as having
come about through KKN practices.
</P>
<P>
The KKN-tainted projects had caused Pertamina financial losses
totaling 64.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Public Works Minister Rachmadi Bambang
Sumadhijo said his ministry had investigated 107 tollway
construction packages suspected of having been drawn up through
KKN.
</P>
<P>
"Some 24 feasibility studies and toll road investment packages
worth a total of 15.83 trillion rupiah have been revoked," he
said.
</P>
<P>
BPKP Head Sudarjono reported that in the period 1993-1998, his
office passed on 102 corruption cases to the Attorney General's
Office for further prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The cases had caused the government financial losses totaling
over 668.98 billion rupiah. Most of the cases had occurred at the
Home Affairs Ministry, the Education and Culture Ministry, the
Cooperatives Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib said that until November 30,
1998, his office had handled 1,604 cases related with KKN
practices.
</P>
<P>
The cases had caused the government to incur financial losses
amounting to 1.5 trillion rupiah but his office's action had
prevented the loss of 46.6 billion rupiah, Ghalib added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stock Investors Welcome Securities Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Promulgation of China's first
Securities Law was today's hot topic among stock investors in
Shanghai, China's biggest stock-trading center.
</P>
<P>
China's top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, passed the Securities Law today in Beijing. It
will take effect on July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Securities Law will help standardize stock market
activities including stock floatation and trading, and makes us
confident in the future of China's stock market," said Jing
Zhaodi, an employee of a Shanghai listed company.
</P>
<P>
Mangers of listed companies agree that with further regulation
of the stock market, they can compete more responsibly and provide
better services for their investors.
</P>
<P>
For stockbrokers, adoption of the Securities Law will also have
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoming, deputy general manager of the China Securities
Co. Ltd. Shanghai branch, noted that China's stock market has
experienced many vicissitudes since it first came into being at
the start of the 1990's. "The promulgation of the Securities Law will
rectify the shortcoming that China had no real fundmental law for
regulating the stock market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The impending Securities Law did not seem to affect trading on
the Shanghai Stock Exchange today, as the composite stock index
closed at 1155.878, down only four points from yesterday.

<P>
Mogadishu, December 29 (Xinhua)-- A large muscle-flexing
demonstration sponsored by the faction leaders of the Somali
capital was held Tuesday to show the power of the newly announced
administration of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration coincided with the festive arrangement which
marks the conclusion of training for the first 2,100 police force
encamped for the restoration of law and order in the chaotic
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Colonel Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdid, police
commander for Mugadishu, the police forces have been given all
necessary professional tactics plus what he called a training for
the special circumstances of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"The activities of the police will start from securing the
stability of Mogadishu and work toward the reopening of the air
and seaports as their first priorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people of Mogadishu to collaborate and
help the policemen for their own interests.
</P>
<P>
"Today is the beginning of a new era for Mogadishu's people,"
said faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, adding the policemen of
the capital are now capable of making a peaceful environment for
the people of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said the aim of the administration include the
reconciliation among the people in Mogadishu who after eight
years are still suffering from the closure of the air and
seaports.
</P>
<P>
"We are working for the re-establishment of the law and order
so that our people can live in peace. We welcome our opposition
elements if they have any better ideas. It is now time to forgive
each other and forget about the past," said Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration is the first such parade since the collapse
of the late regime in 1991. The former regime used to conduct
such activity once every year on 21 October which was the day
when Major General Mohamed Siad Barre came into power in a
bloodless coup.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology announced here today that China has exported to the
United States, Canada and several other countries its
self-developed portable mobile office automation
telecommunications (OAT) system terminals.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry said at a news conference here
that the export of the high-tech telecommunications product, listed
among the country's major high-tech projects, indicates a major
breakthrough for the nation's telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest orders for the systems are valued at 68
million U.S. dollars. This is the first group of China's high-tech
products to enter into the U.S. and European markets.
</P>
<P>
The system, weighing 1.2 kilograms and about the size of a
dictionary, can copy, scan, fax, store and print documents
anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
The universal telecommunications packet system was jointly
developed by the Hebei-based Hengda Wireless Communications Group
and the Datang Telecom Technology Corporation. The joint venture
of the two companies has signed contracts with Motorola and
several other well known telecommunications giants that includes
supplying parts for the OAT system.
</P>
<P>
The Hengda Group, a high-tech venture in the Shijiazhuang
High-Tech Development Zone in northern China's Hebei Province, has
built production bases in the U.S., Canada, Singapore and Japan,
while the Datang Company is a listed high-tech venture.

<HEADLINE> Pak Foreign Exchange Reserves Cross 1B Dollar Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves have increased to 1.021 billion U.S. dollars after
receiving 324.6 million dollars from the U.S. on account of F-16
aircraft, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves is "a very
positive development," Dar said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said that since May this year when Pakistan conducted its
nuclear blasts, this is for the first time that the country's
foreign exchange reserves have crossed the "psychological
barriers" of one billion dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, the government has been able to
manage the macro-economic situation in a reasonably good way
despite a world-wide recession, Southeast Asian turmoil and
contraction of the Japanese economy," said Dar.
</P>
<P>
Dar categorically denied the assertion that the government had
purchased the foreign exchange from the market at very high rates.
</P>
<P>
"The buoyancy in foreign exchange reserves is due to
repatriation of exports proceeds, increased remittances and the
routine exercises we are following since November 7 to improve the
reserves level," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Dar said that 324.6 million dollars
Pakistan received from the U.S. on account of F-16 aircraft would
be used for balance of payments support and not for the immediate
defense purchases.
</P>
<P>
To another question, Dar said Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves would be around 900 million dollars by the end of
December this year despite making payments of 60 million dollars
to the International Monetary Fund and the World bank.

<HEADLINE> China's Rare-Earth Exports Not Affected by Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts said today
that the Asian financial crisis will not decrease China's
rare-earth exports, on the contrary, the strong yuan will maintain
world rare-earth prices.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Europe and Japan are the three biggest
buyers of China's rare-earth products, and experts point out that
the U.S. and Europe are expected to maintain their imports since
their economies have not been affected by the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which is still in economic recession, will not reduce
its import because rare earth is one of its most important
industrial material, and only takes a small share in its total
imported products, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Japanese Customs Office indicates that
the country bought 2,208 tons of rare earth from China in the first
two months of 1998, an increase of 30 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
China is the world largest rare-earth producer and exporter. It
is expected that China will produce 53,000 tons of rare earth in
1998, 31,400 of which is for the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
China produces 60 to 70 percent of all the world's rare-earth
products, enough to basically meet both domestic and overseas
demands and help maintain rare-earth prices at a rational level.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Takes up Judicial Capacity Building Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken up a judicial and legal capacity building project involving
60 million U.S. dollars for increasing efficiency of the judicial
and legal system, the official BSS news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank (WB) will provide 45 million dollars for the
project, while the government will provide the rest of the amount,
and the Ministry of Law and Justice will implement the project.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Bans Cars Lacking Emissions Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will spare
no efforts to control air pollution caused by automobiles which
lack emission-control devices, since exhaust fumes have become a
major threat to the health of Beijingers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi, executive vice-mayor of Beijing, said the city will not
allow cars whose emissions do not meet state environmental
protection standards.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at an event during which more than 3,600
discarded automobiles were destroyed, a small portion of the
city's estimated 33,000 cars abandoned just this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that about 1.35 million automobiles
are now on the streets of Beijing. The nitrogen oxide in the
automobile fumes has long been engandering the health of the
local population because up to now few precautions were taken to
prevent gas pollution.

<HEADLINE> "Very High" Roadside API Recorded in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Environmental Protection
Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Tuesday recorded a roadside Air Pollution Index (API) of 104 at
the Causeway Bay air quality monitoring station on Hong Kong
Island.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the highest API figures so far recorded since
the APIs were first recorded earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Another roadside station at Mong Kok, Kowloon, recorded an API
of 77. For the general ambient stations, the API ranged from 59
to 76.
</P>
<P>
Causeway Bay, one of Hong Kong's busiest commercial areas, is
notorious for its poor air quality due to very heavy traffic and
the fact that the area is surrounded by numerous high-rise
buildings.
</P>
<P>
When the roadside API exceeds 100 and reaches the "very high"
band, people with heart or respiratory illnesses should avoid
prolonged stay in roads and streets with heavy traffic, Principal
Environmental Protection Officer Leung Pak-ming said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is necessary to stay in such places, they should reduce
physical exertion as far as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Leung said there was no need for the general public to
take any special measure.
</P>
<P>
He said that air pollution reached the "very high" band since
the nitrogen dioxide in vehicle emissions, particularly from
diesel vehicles, was not dispersing sufficiently under the very
still wind conditions due to the special environmental conditions
in the area.
</P>
<P>
But the situation was expected to improve Wednesday, Leung
said.
</P>
<P>
"The weather forecast has expected the wind to become fresh
overnight. This would help nitrogen dioxide to disperse more
readily and we hope air quality would be better tomorrow. The API
forecast for tomorrow is 60 to 80 for the general air quality
stations and 75 to 95 for the roadside air quality stations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has decided to take measures to battle the
deteriorating air quality, including gradually replacing all the
existing diesel engine-powered taxis with ones powered by
liquefied petroleum gas.
</P>
<P>
The API is a simple way of describing air pollution levels to
provide timely information about air pollution to the public and
to enhance awareness. The EPD has been reporting since June 1995
the daily API and making a forecast for the following day. In
Hong Kong the API converts air pollution data from several types
of pollutants into a value ranging from 0 to 500.
</P>
<P>
The API forecast serves also as an alert to the public before
the onset of serious air pollution episodes. It helps the general
public, especially susceptible groups such as those with heart or
respiratory illnesses, to consider taking precautionary measures
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Starting from early 1998, the EPD is also reporting the urban
roadside APIs. The levels of air pollution at busy urban
roadsides are represented by the urban roadside air quality
monitoring stations in Mong Kok, Central and Causeway Bay.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Expelled from Party for Corruption (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A former vice-governor of
central China's Hubei Province has been expelled from the
Communist Party of China (CPC) for corruption and serious
violation of Party disciplines and laws, the CPC Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee approved the decision to deprive
Meng Qingping, who had already been arrested according to law by
procuratorial organs, of Party membership, said the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that from 1989 to the end of 1996, Meng and
his wife Guo Xiuying took bribes worth some 225,000 yuan (about
28,000 U.S. dollars) and 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (about 14,000
U.S. dollars) from several businessmen in the southernmost island
province of Hainan. In return, Meng used his power to help these
businessmen obtain huge profits through illegal land deals.
</P>
<P>
Meng, who once served as vice-governor of Hainan before being
transferred to Hubei in April 1993, was also accused of leading an
extremely corrupt life and having sexual relations with many
women.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Deferment of AL Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday expressed astonishment at and condemnation of deferment of
a ministerial meeting by the secretary-general of the Arab League
(AL).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman said there are two aspects in this
resolution arousing astonishment and denunciation.
</P>
<P>
"First, this resolution contradicted the traditions and rules
of the AL's action," said the spokesman. He added the ministerial
meeting should be held in the scheduled venue and date at the
approval of the simple majority and with the attendance of those
who wish to attend.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that AL Secretary-General Esmat Abdul Mejuid
has announced that the AL decided to postpone the foreign
ministerial consultative meeting till February 24. It was due to
be held on December 30.
</P>
<P>
Mejuid attributed the postponement to a demand put forward by
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)'s countries. GCC groups Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said this is the first time that AL
defers a meeting because of the unwillingness of minority to
attend it.
</P>
<P>
"This constitutes a serious precedent by the secretary-general
of the AL," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the second aspect is that the
secretary-general justified his decision with the desire of the
GCC.
</P>
<P>
He said the secretary-general himself declared that 17 Arab
countries had agreed to attend the meeting, and among those
who did not give their opinion regarding the meeting were only
three countries.
</P>
<P>
UAE has reportedly criticized the postponement of the meeting,
and has reiterated support to hold an Arab summit with the aim of
discussing the recent U.S.-British aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the U.S. and Britain launched four nights of air
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The thing that has astonished us is that those who asked for
deferring the meeting will meet in Riyadh tomorrow to discuss the
situation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It was not Iraq but the secretary-general himself called
for holding this meeting, said the spokesman, adding that Iraq
will attend it and see what will result from the meeting
and accordingly it will outline its position.
</P>
<P>
He said this postponement is due to a demand by Saudi
Arabia whose foreign minister recently visited Cairo and met
Egyptian officials and the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"Thus the secretary-general has subjected to the will of
one country for its obedience to the American influence and
this country is ready to implement what America asks for at
the expense of sovereignty and dignity," said the spokesman.

<P>
According to an investigative report from the CPC Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection, Meng was born to a poor
family and was a cowherd in his childhood. "It was the Party that
provided him with the chance to receive a college education," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
After his graduation, according to the report, Meng voluntarily
applied for a job in Hainan, at that time a remote and backward
frontier region, and worked in an iron mine under harsh conditions
for many years.
</P>
<P>
"However, with the gradual rise of his official rank, he
loosened the moral demands on himself and became very enthusiastic
about making friends with rich business people, thus degrading
from a leading senior official to a thoroughgoing corrupt
element," the report added.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the fundamental reason for Meng's degeneration
lies in the fact that he never attached importance to study and
self improvement, had no political awareness, coveted the
comforts and luxuries of life, and cherished no ideal or lofty
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
"All Party and government officials must draw a bitter lesson
from the case of Meng, and treasure the power granted them by the
Party and the people," the report concluded.

<HEADLINE> Pak Government's Bank Borrowing Exceeds Annual Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The total borrowing by the
Pakistani government in the first five months (July-November) of
the current fiscal year reached 75 billion rupees (1.63 billion
U.S. dollars) as against the annual budget target of 43 billion
rupees (934 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Tuesday
after its Central Board meeting held here in the morning.
</P>
<P>
"Drying up of foreign inflows and inadequate revenue
performance were the two main factors responsible for excessive
government borrowing for budgetary support," said a statement by
the SBP.
</P>
<P>
However, the monetary impact of the borrowing was much less
because nearly 34 billion rupees (739 million dollars) of the
borrowing was kept as deposits with the SBP, representing rupee
counterpart of foreign public debt that could not be paid due to
foreign exchange constraint, it said.
</P>
<P>
The SBP said that the monetary impact of borrowing for
budgetary support of the accumulated deposits for debt payments,
was of 41 billion rupees (891 million dollars) only, which was
within the target for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In context of anticipated normalization of relations with
international financial organizations and inflow of external
resources, the Board approved a revised Credit Plan for 1998-99
fiscal year that envisages monetary expansion of only 9.2 percent
as compared with the original target of 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that the lowering of the target for monetary
expansion is entirely due to the anticipated contractionary impact
of the government sector.
</P>
<P>
Credit to the private sector will remain protected as
originally approved and in addition foreign sector is expected to
become expansionary due to anticipated accumulation of net foreign
assets.
</P>
<P>
The Board, however, underscored the importance of prudence in
lending to the private sector by the financial institutions to
protect the depositors' interest and health of the banking
institutions and in this regard hoped that the lending process
will continue to remain "depoliticized".

<HEADLINE> China Banks Ready for Euro-Related Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's major
commercial banks have declared themselves ready for euro-related
banking services, with only two days left before the final
launching of the new unified currency for the 11 European Union
nations -- the euro.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China (BOC), the nation's leading foreign exchange
bank, said its five branches in relevant EU countries will be
capable of providing all euro-related services beginning next
year, just the same as any large European bank.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt branch of the BOC will be the sole settlement
center for the bank itself, as well as for all the other banks in
China, since it is the only Chinese bank which has networked its
settlement system with TARGET, the transnational settlement system
of the European central bank.
</P>
<P>
The BOC will start euro-related services such as deposits,
remittance, foreign exchange buying and selling, and selling and
acceptance of traveler's check in euros for individual clients in
China. And companies in China will have access to all
euro-related services including the opening of euro accounts,
settlements, deposits, loans, foreign exchange buying and selling,
traveler's checks, and hedge services against exchange-rate risks.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also expected to give daily exchange rates for the
yuan against the euro, interest rates for deposits and loans in
the euro, and the rate of the euro against the currencies of the
11 EU nations.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank, one of the big four state-owned
commercial banks, said it will start to accept deposits in euros
as well as in the currencies of the 11 EU nations beginning on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China also pledged to
provide euro-related services including the opening of euro
accounts, foreign exchange remittance in euros, buying and selling
of euros, and traveler's checks.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Tuesday approved May 17, 1999 as the date for the early elections
of a new Knesset and a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that a second round of voting for prime
minister will take place on June 1, if no candidate gets 50
percent votes in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The date for the early elections was agreed upon by both
ruling Likud Party and opposition Labor Party Monday after
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With the date for the early elections having been approved by
the Knesset, the bill calling for dissolution of the existing
Knesset for early elections will be subjected to a second and a
third reading in the Knesset plenum next week.
</P>
<P>
Since some Knesset members of the Likud also joined the
opposition to vote for the bill in the first reading early this
month, the bill is expected to become legislation without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has kicked
off his campaign for reelection.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Netanyahu visited and prayed at the Western Wall
in Jerusalem, a remnant of the Second Temple and Judaism's
holiest site. According to the Jewish calendar, Tuesday is the
first day to memorize the destruction of the temple by the Roman
legion.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Netanyahu reiterated that Jerusalem is the
indivisible capital of Israel. But the Palestinians have claimed
that they will set up their future independent state with
east Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that Netanyahu will use his insistence on
Jerusalem affair to get more support in the pending elections.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Industry Output Down in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Weak market and economic
slowdown pulled down the volume of industry production of the
Philippines by 15.9 percent in October from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Office of the Philippines said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Value of industry production decreased year-on-year by 8.0
percent in October this year while industry sales volume and value
dropped by 12.8 percent and 5.0 percent respectively, the office
said in its monthly survey on selected industries.
</P>
<P>
The drop in production was largely attributed to the declines
in petroleum products, basic metals and transport equipment during
the period, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products posted year-on-year decreases of 18.7
percent in volume and 20.5 percent in value of production.
</P>
<P>
Due to prevalent weak demand, the basic metal sector declined
by 46.0 percent in volume and 44.8 percent in value of production
in October from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Transport equipment fell year-on-year by 38.5 percent in volume
and 26.2 percent in value of production, which could be attributed
to the economic slowdown during the period.
</P>
<P>
Gainers in both volume and value of production were the paper
and paper products and wood and wood products in October this
year, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the office also showed that 41.8 percent of the
surveyed plants operated below 70 percent of capacity, ratio of
output to the maximum capacity of a plant, in October 1998
compared with the 31.5 percent in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 15.0 percent of the sample firms operated at full
capacity, 90 percent to 100 percent of the maximum capacity, in
October this year, compared with the 18.1 percent the same period
last year.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updated with Reports from Shanghai China Adopts First Securities Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body,
adopted the nation's first Securities Law today with 135 approvals,
three abstentions and no objections.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed a presidential
proclamation which lists the effective date of the law as July 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The law outlines fundamental principles for codes of conduct
governing the country's securities market," according to Li Peng,
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It will play an important role in pooling construction funds,
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors,
preventing and resolving financial risk and guaranteeing the
healthy development of China's fledgling securities market," said
Li.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that legislators formulating the law drew
lessons from the Asian financial crisis and China's experiences
during development of the speculative industry.
</P>
<P>
"The diligent work has effectively enhanced the capacity of the
law to prevent a market crisis and guaranteed the feasibility of
China's market operations," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Passing the law was far from an easy task," according to Li
Yining, a renowned Chinese economist and chief author of the law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li acknowledged the five-week slide on China's major
stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen and said the fact that the
promulgation of "the Securities Law will standardize and regulate
the immature market will be 'good news' for investors."
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that promulgation of the law has forced
speculators engaged in activities strictly prohibited by the
rigorous stipulations in the new law to withdraw funds. They also
pointed the withdrawal of funds as one reason for the prolonged
drop in market indexes.
</P>
<P>
The law will help promote sound and healthy markets and overall
economic prosperity which will in turn benefit the stock market,
said Li. He also urged investors to exhibit greater confidence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Has Full Work Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese law makers are
expected to have a full work schedule during the next four years,
with nearly 90 laws waiting to be drafted.
</P>
<P>
According to the legislation plan of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress, the committee will finish drafting
63 laws and regulations and complete research work on another 26
before the committee's term of office expires in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Laws of primary importance that require imminent drafting
include legislative and supervision laws, the law on the
organization of the State Council, a dozen business laws
concerning contracts and administration, and laws related to civil
servants and air-pollution prevention.
</P>
<P>
Major economic laws dealing with telecommunications, taxation
and individual income will also be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Most sensitive and prominent may be the draft of laws
concerning the press, publications and association, which require
a depth of research, according to Li Peng, chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The chairman urged lawmakers to conduct extensive
investigations and research before working on the new draft laws.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts First Securities Law (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xinhua correspondents in Shanghai reported that investors there
have generally greeted the new legislation with positive comments,
and many brokers said the law is "good news for the long run."
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the law brought little fluctuation to the
Shanghai stock market, whose A-share index finished at 1,142.72
points today, down 18.57 points. Analysts said that this drop is
within the normal scope, and that market factors affected by the
new law have already been cushioned.
</P>
<P>
The law, which includes 214 articles in 12 chapters, covers all
aspects of the securities industry, ranging from the issuance and
trading of stocks to acquisition of listed companies, stock
exchanges, securities brokerages, registration and account
settlements agencies, trading service agencies, self-disciplinary
associations, government regulatory bodies and penalties for
violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law clearly defines the three fundamental principles
governing the issuance of stocks as "openness, equity and
fairness." It also strictly prohibits fraud, insider trading and
market manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Law establishes a two-tiered system for the
securities industry. The system requires securities companies to
separate internal accounts from client accounts. Securities
transactions must also be clearly separated from banking, trust
and insurance operations, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The State Council securities regulatory commission is
empowered to exercise "unified" control over the securities market
and is held responsible for verifying the qualifications of listed
companies and approving stock issues.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the law outlines detailed work procedures for
government regulatory bodies in order to curb corruption and
unfairness.
</P>
<P>
The new law eliminates sources for manipulating funds by
banning state-owned enterprises trading listed stocks and strictly
prohibiting bank funds from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
It also prohibits foreign capital from entering the A-share
market in order to protect domestic investors from the effects of
manipulation resulting from the actions of foreign money brokers.
</P>
<P>
"Investors must present legal documents proving their identity
and Chinese citizenship opening a stock account," according to the
law.
</P>
<P>
The State Council is currently deliberating regulations
governing Chinese stocks available to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Liabilities for violations of the law range from fines to the
closure of businesses and criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Peng, the formulation of the securities law
reflects China's process in understanding rules governing the
securities market.
</P>
<P>
"Standards governing the market will continue to improve along
with the development of China's securities industry," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange,
China's only two bourses available, opened in 1990. Up to the end
of June 1998, total market capitalization of stocks listed on the
two exchanges stood at 2,141.2 billion yuan. The markets offer 811
listed companies and serve 37 million registered investors.

<HEADLINE> FAO/WFP Report Predicts Near-Record Crops in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A joint report issued
here Tuesday by the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) predicts that
Ethiopia will harvest 11.69 million tons of cereal and pulse this
year.
</P>
<P>
The predicted harvest will be a 36-percent increase than that
of last year, but slightly less than the record crops of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply
Assessment Mission to Ethiopia as attributing the better crop
yields this year to a favorable rainy season, increased use of
fertilizers, improved seeds and few occurrences of crop diseases
or pests.
</P>
<P>
However, said the mission, in some parts of the country,
excessive rains cut short the planting season, flooded fields,
damaged the barley and pulse crops and increased weed
infestation.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will have surplus crops available for export, said
the mission, adding that grain could be exported to Somalia,
which suffered an estimated 125,000 tons deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the expected excellent harvest in the
country, the mission said some two million people will still
require 180,000 tons of food aid in 1999.
</P>
<P>
While the FAO/WFP mission estimated that only some four
percent of the rural population will require food aid in 1999,
approximately 26 million Ethiopians, or more than 40 percent of
the farming population, do not produce enough food or income to
meet their families' basic nutritional requirements.
</P>
<P>
About half the population of Ethiopia lives below the poverty
line, said the press release.

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Falls by 7 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The expenditure-based gross
domestic product (GDP) of Hong Kong for the third quarter of 1998
is estimated to have fallen by 7.1 percent in real terms from a
year ago, following a decline of 5.1 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Tuesday by the Census and
Statistics Department of Hong Kong, the preliminary GDP estimate
for the third quarter matches closely with the crude initial
assessment made by the government in late November, which
indicated a decline of around 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall inflation in the economy, however, in terms of the
implicit price deflator of GDP, moderated distinctly further, to
only a 0.4-percent rise in the third quarter over a year earlier,
from increases of 4.5 percent in the first quarter and 1.9 percent
in the second.
</P>
<P>
The large decline in GDP in the third quarter of this year was
mainly due to the continued slackening in local consumer demand, a
significant decline in investment spending and a further setback
in export performance.
</P>
<P>
Putting the major GDP components on a year-on-year comparison,
private consumption expenditure continued to contract, by 10
percent in real terms in the third quarter, following a
5.1-percent drop in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Local consumer spending during the quarter was depressed by the
continued rise in unemployment and a further dip in asset prices.
But also relevant was the particularly high base of comparison in
the third quarter of last year, when private consumption
expenditure grew by 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government consumption expenditure in national account terms
increased by 3.7 percent in real terms in the third quarter,
having dropped by 5.3 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic fixed capital formation decreased by 9.1 percent
in real terms in the third quarter of 1998, after an increase of
5.6 percent in the second quarter. This significant downturn was
mainly attributable to a marked decline of 10.8 percent in real
terms in overall expenditure on building and construction in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
On visible trade, total exports of goods fell by 7 percent in
real terms in the third quarter, further down from the 0.5-percent
decrease in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods fell even more markedly, by 10.5 percent in
real terms in the third quarter, on account of the setback in
domestic demand and further decline in re-exports. This followed a
1.8-percent decline in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
On invisible trade, exports of services recorded a more
moderate decline of 3.7 percent in real terms in the third
quarter. The improvement from the 11-percent decline in the second
quarter was mainly due to the pick-up in inbound tourism in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, imports of services slackened to a
1.2-percent decline in real terms in the third quarter, mainly due
to the setback in imports of transport and financial services and
slower growth in spending by Hong Kong residents in outbound
trips.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the marked
downturn in exports of goods depressed overall economic
performance in the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Also equally relevant was the fact that the sharp volatilities
and price falls in the financial markets during the quarter,
continued credit stringency, high interest cost and uncertain
economic outlook all severely hit domestic demand, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet the spokesman observed that there were certain positive
signs emerging more recently, including improved liquidity from
the earlier tight situation, successive cuts in local interest
rates and a rebound in share prices and housing prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China has listed the increase
of farmers' income and rural stability as high priorities on next
year's rural work agenda, according to Minister of Agriculture
Chen Yaobang.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing working conference on agriculture today,
Chen said the slowdown in the increase of farmers income has
become a problem hindering rural economic development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the per capita net income for farmers this
year is expected to increase by 3.3 percent, 1.3 percentage points
lower than last year's.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the slowdown to the oversupply of certain farm
products, ailing rural enterprises, and last summer's devastating
floods.
</P>
<P>
Chen also noted that rural stability is of great importance for
the social stability in China, and urged agricultural departments
to spare no effort in helping farmers solve problems and putting
government policies into effect, especially those on extending the
terms of farmland contracts and eliminating irrational burdens on
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Interview: SAARC Lays Solid Foundation for Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has made considerable progress in
many areas in the past 13 years, laying a solid foundation for
ongoing and future cooperation, outgoing SAARC Secretary-General
Naeem U. Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
He said the seven-nation regional grouping, formed in December
1985 to promote economic and social development in the region, has
made very significant achievements in three sectors - social
welfare, poverty alleviation and people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
SARRC has a very strong program in the social sector for
women's development, child issues and health and nutrition, Hasan
told Xinhua Monday in an interview at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
SARRC has made a major contribution not only regionally but
also globally in this field because it has been cooperating very
closely with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other
United Nations agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation in the area of poverty alleviation has
succeeded in increasing the life expectancy and decreasing the
female and child mortality in the region, as shown by the social
indicators of the member states.
</P>
<P>
"We're having better quality of life, not only in the urban
areas but also in the rural areas," said Hasan, whose three-year
term expires at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
He said this is to some extent the result of the cooperation
among the group's member states through common programs as well as
their national development efforts.
</P>
<P>
SAARC has succeeded as well in having more people-to-people
contact in the region, through which it is able to promote
understanding and goodwill among the peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are three very significant achievements of SAARC," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
In the international arena, SAARC has established contact and
cooperation with U.N. agencies and other like-minded regional
groupings like the European Union and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have started adopting common positions on important
economic and social issues including WTO (World Trade
Organization) negotiations in Geneva," he said. "I think this is a
very important development because it strengthens our hands to
deal with the rest of the regional groupings."
</P>
<P>
"I think these have laid a very solid foundation for our
ongoing and future cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He identified more direct involvement of the private sector and
non- governmental organizations, growing interactions with other
regional groupings, increasing coordination of positions on
important issues and increased economic cooperation as the major
features of the grouping during his three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate to come at a time when SAARC was moving from
symbolic and general cooperation to specific areas of activities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, the agreement on the SAARC Preferential
Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) went into operation and negotiations
under the SAPTA started.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of trade negotiations have been completed under
the SAPTA operational since December 1995, offering over 5,700
items of products for preferential entry among the SAARC member
states -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"So I would say increased economic and trade contact and
cooperation have been one of the major features of the last three
years," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has not got the latest figure about the
intra-SAARC trade which, one year ago, accounted for a meager 3
percent of the region's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"But certainly, whatever information we're receiving, there is
no doubt that trade among the member countries is definitely
increasing," he said. "In some cases it is almost doubled in the
last two years, for example between Bangladesh and India, between
Sri Lanka and India."
</P>
<P>
"Definitely all our efforts are having effect on increasing
trade. But of course, we have to do more because we want to raise
the volume by up to 10-15 percent in the next 5-10 years," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the fourth round of trade talks under the
SAPTA will start early next year after the meeting of SAARC
commerce ministers in early February in Dhaka of Bangladesh and
that of the foreign ministers later that month in Colombo, Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been no decision on a deadline for the
realization of a South Asian Free Trade Area. Even at the summit
in Male, the Maldives, in May 1997, there was no definite decision
but only a feeling that SAARC should try to set up a free trade
area as early as possible and preferably by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 10th SAARC summit held in Colombo in July this year agreed
that a comprehensive treaty regime for creating a free trade area
should be drafted by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said that a group has been set up for drafting the treaty
and it will start work early next year.
</P>
<P>
On the challenges facing the grouping in the next century, he
said that based on past experience, a greater interaction among
the member states is needed in the economic and trade field
because it is a global trend.
</P>
<P>
"We have to prepare ourselves for dealing with other trade
blocs as a group," he said. "This is what we're trying to
achieve."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, I think we'll have to respond to the globalization
which is overtaking the whole world very rapidly," he observed.
"It also means we'll have to develop information technology
because the information revolution has totally changed our lives."
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll have to increasingly coordinate our positions as
we're starting doing on global issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that SAARC would also have to focus on environment
issues because the environment in the region is deteriorating
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in
May this year have had any impact on the SAARC process, Hasan said
the tests were taken just before the 10th SAARC summit and there
was a lot of speculation.
</P>
<P>
But the summit took place on time and made some major
initiatives and some very substantial decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the SAARC process will continue and continue to
expand and strengthen, I hope, in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that bilateral relations between the
member states will develop further.

<HEADLINE> Bank Robber Sentenced to Death in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Guo Hui, a 20-year-old bank
robber who killed a female bank assistant in November 1998, was
sentenced to death by the First Intermediate People's Court of
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Guo, a former employee of the Postal Administration Bureau of
Daxing County in the southern suburbs of Beijing, was dismissed by
his employer because of incompetency in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
After being dismissed, Guo planned to rob the postal savings
bank on Longhe Road in Daxing County as revenge.
</P>
<P>
He broke into the bank at noon on November 14, 1998 and killed
Zhang Li, the only bank assistant on duty at the time.
</P>
<P>
Guo came away from the robbery with only about 5,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guo's girlfriend, 18-year-old Ruan Fang, was also sentenced to
three years in jail because of giving false testimony and covering
up for her boyfriend.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Ban Tobacco Advertisements From New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao will ban tobacco
advertisements beginning January 1 next year, sources from the
Macao Municipal Council said.
</P>
<P>
The ban will be implemented in accordance with a government
decree on smoking prevention and restriction. According to the
decree issued in 1997, tobacco publicity includes tobacco
advertisements and tobacco business promotion.
</P>
<P>
The former is aimed at attracting people to buy and consume
certain tobacco products while the latter displays the trademark,
symbol, price, origin and relevant materials of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
The decree stipulates that all tobacco advertisements are to be
banned while tobacco business promotion will be restricted within
a range of five meters from the site where tobacco products are
sold, and promotion boards cannot exceed three meters in length or
width.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Introduces Reforms in 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
introduce innovations in the 1999 national budget to ensure
disbursement efficiency and improve monitoring, Benjamin Diokno,
secretary of budget and management, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Diokno told reporters that with the reforms, his department
will allow agencies to spend directly based on the 1999 General
Appropriations Act instead of having to obtain a General Allotment
Release Order.
</P>
<P>
With the simplification of the budget release procedure, the
department will be able to improve its capacity to monitor
agencies performances, he added.
</P>
<P>
The department will release funds in cash on a quarterly basis
instead of releasing funds on a monthly basis, to speed up the
implementation of projects.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was approved by Congress this month, will be
signed into law by Philippine President Joseph Estrada Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Estrada administration expects to limit the
budget deficit to 68 billion pesos (1.7 billion U.S. dollars),
about 2.2 percent of the projected Gross National Product (GNP)
for 1999, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Introduces New Kidney Transplant Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian transplant
specialists have been successful in the past few months using a
new procedure to remove a kidney from its donor, which cuts down
on pain, scarring and recovery time.
</P>
<P>
Mohan Rao, a kidney transplant surgeon at Queen Elizabeth
Hospital in the south Australian port city of Adelaide, said
Tuesday that kidney donors in Australia would increasingly demand
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
Rao told the Australian Associated Press (AAP) that using
smaller incisions and removing the kidney from the donor's
abdominal cavity rather than the side of the body, was less
painful and allowed quicker recovery.
</P>
<P>
Rao said donors who had a kidney removed by the newer method
could leave hospital within three days instead of having to stay
for at least six days and could return to work sooner.
</P>
<P>
And the technique is cosmetically better, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are the only center that is offering it in this country,"
he told AAP.
</P>
<P>
Under the old way of performing kidney transplants, surgeons
made a longer cut through the muscle wall along the side of the
body.
</P>
<P>
Now, the operation is performed through small "keyhole"
incisions in the abdomen and a smaller, five-centimeter-long cut
is made at the front low on the left side of the abdomen through
which the kidney is removed.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally we cut through the muscle wall to get to the
kidney. It's a long incision, it cuts through all muscles anywhere
up to 12 centimeters long," Rao said.
</P>
<P>
The hospital began using the technique in May last year and had
performed 30 transplants, all of which were successful, Rao said.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was this week recognized for the work as joint
winners of the south Australia state award for health.
</P>
<P>
Rao said surgeons in the United States began using the
technique first, six to 12 months before the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, and he expected it to spread worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Defecting Khmer Rouge Leaders Meet Cambodian Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Defecting Khmer Rouge
leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea arrived here Tuesday with
their families, and met with Prime Minister Hun Sen in his Takhmau
residence.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan told reporters at the Royal Phnom Penh Hotel
after the meeting that he is very happy to return to the capital.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Khieu has returned to the capital
since 1994, when the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the royal
government.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Chea has not been in Phnom Penh since the toppling of the
Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, when Vietnamese forces invaded and
drove the movement into its jungle bases.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their return to the society, Khieu said, "Our
return is for the peace and stability of the country. It is for
the national reconciliation and the unity of the nation."
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Hun Sen told us we should forget the past. Only
peace can build our country," Khieu added.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that their return marked the end of the Khmer Rouge
and not the beginning of a new Khmer Rouge as someone has
suspected.
</P>
<P>
The two Khmer Rouge leaders and their families will be tightly
protected by government security forces during their stay in Phnom
Penh. Accompanying them is Ieng Sary, who defected to the
government in 1996 and now controls a semi-autonomous zone in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen approved Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea's defection to the
government on Friday, which was also supported by King Norodom
Sihanouk.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Bans Cement Joint Ventures in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has issued a ban on
cement joint ventures, according to the latest issue of the
Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
The ban was announced in a five-year moratorium on new
Vietnamese/ foreign joint ventures in the cement industry by the
Vietnam Cement Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following warnings from the domestic
cement industry that a locally-produced glut, combined with cheap
illegal imports, could force hundreds of Vietnamese cement firms
out of business.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies have invested over a billion U.S. dollars in
cement joint ventures in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures now produce 5.4 million tons of cement
annually and Vietnam's domestic demand for cement stands at 11.6
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by domestic companies and foreign-backed companies to
meet this demand are being thwarted by unlawful imports, priced as
low as 30 dollars per ton, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam-based plants' price usually hover around 60 dollars
per ton.

<HEADLINE> Cut Proposed in Excise on Cars in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- India's Industry Ministry is
likely to recommend a steep cut in excise duty on passenger cars
from 40 percent to 25 percent in a bid to boost the sagging demand
for cars in the country, a government official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the government's proposed "bold fiscal
initiatives" to fight the deceleration in the economy by
generating more demand.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently announced some fiscal incentives by
allowing a 40-percent depreciation for commercial vehicles
purchased in the current fiscal year after October 1, 1998,
irrespective of the number of days for which the vehicles have
been used.
</P>
<P>
The increase in car sales is expected to compensate the
reduction in excise duty collection, Industry Ministry officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian domestic car industry has a capacity of 1 million
vehicles per annum, but it is operating at only half of its
capacity. The steady fall in sales is expected to further push
down capacity utilization. Several car manufacturers have already
effected steep cuts in their daily production, the same officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: HK to Remember Old Airport With New Garden (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- If the year 1997 was
remembered by Hong Kong for the return of the territory to China
after some 150 years of colonial rule, the year 1998 can be easily
remembered for just one name -- Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people crowded the vicinity of the 73-year-old
Hong Kong International Airport at Kai Tak, Kowloon, to bid
farewell to their "old friend" prior to its closure in early July.
The scene was described by some as next only to the sensation
brought about by the British band Beatles in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Shooting pictures by all kinds of tools -- from snapshot camera
to digital equipment -- not only became a free entertainment for
Hong Kong residents but produced some retrospective exhibitions at
downtown shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak is now making new friends -- Pop diva Celine Dion is to
perform at Kai Tak on January 23, 1999, with "My Heart Will Go On"
and other top-chart tunes, marking the first-ever Asia tour of the
French Canadian singer.
</P>
<P>
And Kai Tak is no longer all about aviation. It will be given
new meanings and will take off into the new century with a brand
new look.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been drawn up to build a Garden City at the Kai Tak
airport site and adjacent areas to house more than 320,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious program, known as the South East Kowloon
Development (SEKD), is being speeded up to allow for the intake of
population to start in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The new city will be fully self-contained with world-class
amenities, schools and transport links to other urban districts.
It will involve 579 hectares of land of which 280 hectares will
come from the existing airport site and the rest from reclaimed
land.
</P>
<P>
The Garden City will have a 50-hectare Metro Park, a
world-class international sports stadium with a retractable roof,
an Aviation Academy and Museum, 45 schools, a hospital and office
buildings and malls, according to the plans announced in early
September.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the park will become the leisure and
recreational node for the whole area, attracting not just people
from all over Hong Kong, but international tourists and athletes.
</P>
<P>
More than 14,000 jobs will be created during the reclamation
and construction period which is expected to span more than 10
years. Site formation will start at the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People's Rights, Interests Fully Protected(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains free and
open and its residents' legitimate rights and interests are fully
protected under the Basic Law after its return to China on July 1
last year.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion has been proven by a public opinion survey
conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong in December this
year.
</P>
<P>
Among 788 respondents aged between 18 and 40, about 80 percent
said they were satisfied with a high degree of freedom in Hong
Kong and 60 percent expressed satisfaction with the present Hong
Kong's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
About 72 percent of respondents held that freedom of speech
that the Hong Kong people enjoy has been well ensured and 88
percent agreed that freedom of traveling to and from Hong Kong has
been fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent said that the Hong Kong people enjoy freedom
of association, of assembly, and of precession and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
As Elsie Leung, secretary for Justice, has said that after Hong
Kong's return to China, the SAR government has been doing all it
can under the Basic Law, through administrative and legal means,
to further enhance the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that provisions of the six significant human rights
conventions as applied to Hong Kong continue to have force in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
These cover a wide range of subjects such as guaranteeing civil
and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights, the
rights of child, and eliminating all forms of racial
discrimination and all forms of discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
During the May Legislative Council election, the first of its
kind since the HKSAR was established on July 1 last year, a record
number of 1.49 million Hong Kong residents, or 53.3 percent of the
2.8 million registered voters, turned out to vote against heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
Their broad and active participation in the election was
unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. During the 1995 Legislative
Council election under the rule of the British Hong Kong
government, the overall turnout rate was only 35.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is a demonstration of Hong Kong people's enthusiasm to
exercise their civic rights and of their determination and
confidence in "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, said David
Lan, secretary for Home Affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Garden City is just one of the many major infrastructure
projects the SAR government has planned for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Public works at the site are estimated to cost the government
some 36 billion HK dollars (4.6 billion U.S. dollars), but sales
of the land at the site is expected to total 160 billion HK
dollars (20.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Like the state-of-the-art new airport at Chek Lap Kok, the SAR
government is fully committed to the implementation of the program
as it is vital for the continued economic growth of the territory,
says Donald Tong, director of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade
Office.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the new city, the Executive Council of the SAR has
just given approval for the planning and construction of the
territory's second railway linking west Kowloon to northwest New
Territories.
</P>
<P>
The new railway, known as the West Rail, will complement the
current line running from urban Kowloon to the Hong Kong-mainland
border at Lo Wu.
</P>
<P>
The 30.5-kilometer, electrified and double-track West Rail will
create 13,000 jobs in the next few years, with 14 main civil
contracts being awarded by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Other projects include a 12.5-kilometer extension of the Mass
Transit Railway System, new port development, highways, bridges
and public housing estates.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s Hong Kong has built several huge new towns but
never so close to an existing urban area. The city needs new towns
because its current population of 6.7 million will have grown to
over 8 million by the year 2011.
</P>
<P>
The SEKD is a very important project for Hong Kong's
development in the 21st century, transforming the previous Kai Tak
Airport and the nearby Kowloon Bay area into a comprehensively
designed "city within a city," a government spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
This proposed project is the result of careful consideration
and thorough studies on engineering, economic and environmental
impacts and land uses, the spokesman says.

From July 1, 1997 to November 30, 1998, there were some 2,700
public meetings and processions, averaging five a day, and some
1,299 societies were registered or exempted from registration
under the Societies Ordinance. So far the Police have not once
objected to any applications to hold such activities.
</P>
<P>
Leung, who was in private practice for nearly 30 years, said it
is the Hong Kong residents' conscientious action to safeguard
their own rights and interests by using laws.
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the government slaughtered all chickens in
local farms and all poultry at wholesale markets in a bid to get
rid of the source of influenza, a H5N1 virus of bird flu, a
chicken sales manager brought a charge against the government in
court, asking the government for compensation.
</P>
<P>
Although he lost a lawsuit, it fully reflected an ordinary
citizen's law consciousness, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a variety of ethnic and cultural groups with
differing religious beliefs. Buddhists have been co-existed and
lived in good harmony with Taoists, Jews, Muslims, Christians,
Hindus and Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, the SAR government neither
imposes any restrictions on the Hong Kong residents' freedom of
religious beliefs, nor interferes in their internal affairs of the
religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong residents' religious activities have been held as
usual. Schools, hospitals and welfare institutions run by the
religious organizations have been operating normally.
</P>
<P>
All of these show that some dire predictions that the rights
and freedoms of Hong Kong residents are about to be curtailed
after its return to China are totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the last 18 months have clearly demonstrated
that the SAR government is fully committed to the protection of
human rights by observing closely the Basic Law, maintaining the
rule of law and the independence of the judiciary while the
Central People's government does not interfere in Hong Kong's own
affairs at all.
</P>
<P>
These lay a solid foundation for ensuring the full protection of
Hong Kong people's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
As Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has described that Hong Kong
remains a robust and lively community where people have no
hesitation in speaking their minds.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to do everything it can to protect
and preserve people's rights, he pledged.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Marginally Lower on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed
marginally lower on the Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as trading
was thin in quiet Christmas trading and ahead of the New Year
holidays.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) finished 2.82 points
down at 1,378.45.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was thin totaling 79.61 million units worth 97.64
million Singapore dollars (about 58.87 million U.S. dollars).
Rises led falls by 121 to 97 with 202 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was a 5.69-million parcel of KepTLDBS w00
which transacted at 0.57 Singapore dollars per share. KepTL w02
was the second most heavily traded stock with a volume of 4.65
million units done. CMTel was next with 3.78 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Elec&AMP;E led the ascent of the day with a rise of 25 cents to
finish at 5.3 U.S. dollars. UOB went up 20 cents to close at 6.55
Singapore dollars. SemMarLog was up 19 cents to end at 2.33
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 led the descent of the day
slashing 100 cents to close at 22.3 Singapore dollars. OUB F was
next sinking 25 cents to 6.95 Singapore dollars. DBS F and SPH
retreated 20 cents and ended at 14.9 and 17.6 Singapore dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said seasonal holidays have thinned trading with many
overseas institutions already having closed their books for the
year.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that market also ignored the interest rate
reduction by the United Overseas Bank, which announced Monday to
cut its prime lending rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent following
similar action by the other big four banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
UOB's smaller-than-expected cut in its prime lending rate has
failed to encourage players and led some market observers to
revise their 1999 targets for the prime lending rate to 5 percent
from below 5 percent for next year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Army Ready to Stop Secession Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines is ready to resume operations against separatist rebel
groups if they threaten the country's sovereignty, Orlando
Mercado, secretary of defense of the Philippines, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody wants to secede, we have no choice but to put down
the rebels," Mercado said in a radio interview. "That is our
responsibility under the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada flatly rejected a
demand by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to establish an
independent Islamic state in the south as a precondition to
resuming its talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said that the country's 1987 Constitution decrees that
there is only one government and one Armed Forces of the
Philippines, and that its territory should remain undivided.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said, however, the Estrada administration is exhausting
all peaceful means to deal with the rebels even if this process
takes a long time to realize.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Phase one of the Integrated
Communications Network has been completed in 12 states of Nigeria
with the system connected with Calabar, capital of Cross River
State last week.
</P>
<P>
With the system's connecting with Calabar, capital of Cross
River State last week, the Nigerian police force (NPF)
headquarters in various state capitals are fully integrated into
the sophisticated communications network, the Guardian newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The network is designed to enable the police force to transmit
voice and data between state capitals, and provide the NPF with
an independent Private Network Link nationwide.
</P>
<P>
When Phase two of the project is completed, the NPF can extend
its communications from the police headquarters to the area
command centers and then further down to the divisional police
offices via an independent private network link in all the 36
states in the country.
</P>
<P>
After the system fully commissioned, the state-to-state
message transmission will be achieved through Ultra High
Frequency and Very High Frequency while the communications within
a state command will be channeled through a Demand Assigned
Multiple Access.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the crime rate in the most populous African
country had been on the increase and the sophistication with
which criminals are executing their activities cannot be combated
squarely without a corresponding state-of-the-art facility.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Demand Skyrockets in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency demand in
Vietnam "skyrockets," the Vietnam Investment Review reported in
its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The English-language weekly said foreign-invested enterprises
in Vietnam are facing "tough times," because the country's
"shrinking foreign currency reserves account is unable to match
their growing need for hard currency to pay for imports and
loans."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's banking system sells over 500 million U.S. dollars
worth of foreign currencies to foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs)
every year, the weekly quoted a recent report submitted to the
prime minister by Vietnam's state bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that in 1998 as much as 800 million dollars in
</P>
<P>
foreign currencies was supplied to FIEs and it estimated that
the demand for foreign currencies will jump to 1 billion dollars
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The report said local banks "sometimes do not have enough hard
currencies to sell to FIEs, a dilemma which had severely affected
their production and overall business performance."
</P>
<P>
Another increasingly gloomy development is the growing need of
many FIEs for hard currencies to pay off their debts, the weekly
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly, in 1997, 550 million dollars was
transferred out of Vietnam to pay FIEs' debts. In 1998, it was 790
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming years, there will be an imbalance because the
need of FIEs for hard currency will not be met by their earnings
from exports," said the report by Vietnam's state bank.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the coming years, disbursement of
foreign-invested capital might slow down, there might be a drop in
registered projects, overseas loans might be reduced due to the
regional crisis, and the country's exports might become less
competitive because of the devaluation of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
"All these things will affect the supply of foreign currencies
for FIEs," the report concluded.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Rebel Leader Feared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebel leader Saj
Musa has been feared dead from injuries sustained in a gun battle
with the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG on Christmas eve.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday in Nigeria's capital Abuja,
ECOMOG Press Secretary Malam Buhari Ali said that Musa died in "a
fierce battle" between ECOMOG troops and the rebel force under
his command in a desperate attempt to attack the Benguma Military
Training Center near Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that ECOMOG had averted an attempt by
rebels to infiltrate Freetown with weapons after intercepting a
boat that was discharging arms and ammunition near the Cape
Sierra Hotel in Freetown, Nigerian news paper Daily Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The arms have been seized by the ECOMOG troops while the
captain of the boat is under interrogation, it added.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), Lansana Kouyata, said Monday at an emergency
meeting over the crisis in Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire that
member states "must reinforce ECOMOG troops."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that apart from Ghana, Nigeria and Guinea, "we
are still waiting for soldiers from the rest of the region."
</P>
<P>
After a spate of recent attacks by rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) near Freetown, ECOMOG is said to have deployed
5,000 soldiers in the area, which are reportedly backed by
another 5,000 traditional fighters from the Kamajor militia.
</P>
<P>
Togo's Foreign Minister Joseph Kocou Koffigoh told the
meeting that the United Nations and the Netherlands have "given
the green light" to finance contingents of 400 Malian soldiers
and another 100 from Gambia.
</P>
<P>
Other countries including Cote d'Ivoire, Niger and Benin have
pledged to send troops to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops and RUF rebels engaged in heavy battles at the
weekend in the northern town of Makeni, where both sides claimed
to be in control.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, rebels threatened to attack Freetown within two
to three days and claimed they had taken two neighboring towns,
Waterloo and Benguema, some 30 kilometers away.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Backs Down on Minimum Salary for Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
slashed the minimum salary of civil servants from 5,200 Naira (60
U.S. Dollars) per month approved in September to 3,000 Naira (35
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decision came following dwindling crude oil export
earnings resulted from sustained low oil prices in the
international market, Oyo State Administrator Amen Oyakhire said
in southwestern town of Ibandan Monday.
</P>
<P>
Oil export accounts for more than 80 percent of the budgetary
revenue of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Oyakhire told local media that "5,200 Naira is no longer
tenable, what is now tenable is 3,000 Naira."
</P>
<P>
According to the state administrator, Nigeria's 1999 budget
will be based on nine Dollars per barrel, compared with 17
Dollars per barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Press Secretary to the Head of State, Malam Haruna,
told reporters in Abuja Monday that the decision to slash the
minimum salary is to save the transition program.
</P>
<P>
"If you leave the salary increase as it is, it will be a
time-bomb for the new civilian regime because the fact is there
is simply no money to pay that kind of salary," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government announced the increase of minimum
monthly salary for federal civil servants from 600 Naira (seven
Dollars) to 5,200 Naira in September, sparking off a nationwide
labor unrest, as state governments insist that they do not have
the resources to pay the same salary to their own workers.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many federal civil servants have not been able to
receive their new salaries in the past months because the
governments do not have the money.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with This Day, a major national newspaper last
Friday, Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar
admitted that "we made a mistake in announcing that wage
increase."
</P>
<P>
He continued that "with the dwindling resources caused by the
fall in the price of crude oil, there is no way the federal
government can sustain that increase."
</P>
<P>
"Even if the federal government can afford to pay, since
states are not viable, we are going to put the states in a real
mess if we go ahead with the increase which may lead to further
unrest," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will have its first elected civilian president in 15
years sworn in on May 29, 1999, according to the current military
administration's transition to civil rule program.

MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia should preserve its

Russia has been spending too much to feed the army but too
little to develop military technology and equipment, he said.

The modern equipment in an army with combativeness should
account for at least 70 percent of its arsenal, said Sergeyev.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Toyota Zambia has targeted to
win more than 50 percent of the country's motor dealer market
from which it hopes to take about 28 billion Kwacha (about 10
million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Tuesday quoted Toyota Zambia's Financial
Manager, Douglas Mc Crindle as saying that the company is also
in the process of establishing a dealer network throughout the
country to expand its business line.
</P>
<P>
"So far we are strengthening our overall performance so that
we claim about 54 percent of the local market, we wish to get
about 60 percent," said the manager in an recent interview with
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Crindle said the company has initiated a comprehensive program
which involves the provision of services to meet the ever
changing customer needs.
</P>
<P>
A number of local dealers will be engaged
across the country to market and sell the company's products
which are directly imported from Japan, he added.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, will also contribute to employment generation
in the areas where dealers will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company's sales manager, Malyombo Mumbi,
expressed confidence about the company's performance which, he
said, has been boosted by the modern fleet of vehicles that the
firm is dealing in.
</P>
<P>
According to Toyota Zambia Managing Director, Martin Grasett,
the company plans to invest about 14 million U.S. Dollars in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The company is currently constructing a two million
Dollars ultra-modern showroom on Cairo Road in Lusaka, which is
expected to be ready by the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
The facility will house a banking service outlet for leasing
transactions, insurance offices, repair shop, panel beating
sections and spare parts warehouse.
</P>
<P>
The company has also initiated a special package by which
customers can purchase vehicles on leasing terms through a
leasing agent but allowed to settle the costs in installments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Tennis Player Urged to Dela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- New secretary-general of the
Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti) Sugent Sarjadi has
suggested that the country's best ever tennis player Yayuk Basuki
delay her retirement for a year to give her prospective
successors more time to learn from her.
</P>
<P>
"I want to encourage her not to stop playing after the
Australian Open. Observing her convincing form in the Asiad, I
think it's too early for her to retire," Sugent was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk reiterated her intention to leave competitive tennis
shortly after beating Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn to win the
Asain Games women's singles gold medal in Bangkok this month.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to settle down and enjoy the rest of my life with
my family. If God endows me babies, I'll be very happy because we
have long wished for them", said Yayuk, who married her coach
Suharyadi in January.
</P>
<P>
If the plan goes as expected, Yayuk will bid her farewell at
the Australian Open, which starts on January 18 next year.
</P>
<P>
"She's only 28, compared to Steffi Graf of Germany who is 29
and Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic who is 30. Neither have
plans to quit tennis in the near future," Sugent, who is also a
businessman, said.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk had twice dropped her retirement plan since 1996 ,
saying she could not evade the national duties laid on her
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
"I could do nothing but return to the tennis court that time
because I thought there was nobody to fill my shoes. Now that we
have a batch of young talents, there is no reason not to give the
young players a crack in international tournaments," Yayuk said.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk, who has collected more than one million U.S. dollars in
earnings from the tennis circuit and has donated 2.5 percent of
her income to the needy of Pelti.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk said she still had no idea about trying her hand at
coaching.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I want to have a tennis school or be a
coach. I don't know. All I want to do now is settle down," she
said.

The local unit finished last Thursday at 61.03 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said the
overnight fall was related to concerns over commodity prices,
particularly gold and Tuesday's recovery was the result of an
exaggerated, thin market.
</P>
<P>
Generally weaker commodity prices and concerns over the impact
on gold prices of the January 1 euro currency introduction
resulted in the local unit hitting the early-October lows,
Volanakis said.

Trading was expected to continue quietly ahead of the New Year

<HEADLINE> Defected Khmer Rouge Leaders Meet Cambodian Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Defecting Khmer Rouge
leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea arrived here Tuesday with
their families, and met with Prime Minister Hun Sen in his Takhmau
residence.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan told reporters at the Royal Phnom Penh Hotel
after the meeting that he is very happy to return to the capital.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Khieu has returned to the capital
since 1994, when the Khmer Rouge was outlawed by the royal
government.
</P>
<P>
Nuon Chea has not been in Phnom Penh since the toppling of the
Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, when Vietnamese forces invaded and
drove the movement into its jungle bases.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their return to the society, Khieu said, "Our
return is for the peace and stability of the country. It is for
the national reconciliation and the unity of the nation."
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Hun Sen told us we should forget the past. Only
peace can build our country," Khieu added.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that their return marked the end of the Khmer Rouge
and not the beginning of a new Khmer Rouge as someone has
suspected.
</P>
<P>
The two Khmer Rouge leaders and their families will be tightly
protected by government security forces during their stay in Phnom
Penh. Accompanying them is Ieng Sary, who defected to the
government in 1996 and now controls a semi-autonomous zone in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen approved Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea's defection to the
government on Friday, which was also supported by King Norodom
Sihanouk.

<HEADLINE> (Quotes, Details Added) China Adopts First Securities Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body,
adopted the nation's first Securities Law today with 135 approvals,
three abstentions and no objections.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed a presidential
proclamation which lists the effective date of the law as July 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The law outlines fundamental principles for codes of conduct
governing the country's securities market," according to Li Peng,
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It will play an important role in pooling construction funds,
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors,
preventing and resolving financial risk and guaranteeing the
healthy development of China's fledgling securities market," said
Li.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that legislators formulating the law drew
lessons from the Asian financial crisis and China's experiences
during development of the speculative industry.
</P>
<P>
"The diligent work has effectively enhanced the capacity of the
law to prevent a market crisis and guaranteed the feasibility of
China's market operations," said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Passing the law was far from an easy task," according to Li
Yining, a renowned Chinese economist and chief author of the law.

<P>
Moreover, Li acknowledged the five-week slide on China's major
stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen and said the fact that
promulgation of "the Securities Law will standardize and regulate
the immature market will be 'good news' for investors."
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that promulgation of the law has forced
speculators engaged in activities strictly prohibited by the
rigorous stipulations in the new law to withdraw funds. They also
pointed the withdrawal of funds as one reason for the prolonged
drop in market indexes.
</P>
<P>
The law will help to promote sound healthy markets and overall
economic prosperity which will in turn benefit the stock market,
said Li. He also urged investors to exhibit greater confidence.
</P>
<P>
The law, which includes 214 articles in 12 chapters, covers
all aspects of the securities industry, ranging from the issuance
and trading of stocks to purchases of listed companies, stock
exchanges, securities brokerages, registration and account
settlements agencies, trading service agencies, self-disciplinary
associations, government regulatory bodies and penalties for
violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law clearly defines the three fundamental principles
governing the issuance of stocks as "openness, equity and
fairness." It also strictly prohibits fraud, insider trading and
market manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Law establishes a two-tiered system for the
securities industry. The system requires securities companies to
separate internal accounts from client accounts. Securities
transactions must also be clearly separated from banking, trust
and insurance operations, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The State Council Securities Regulatory Commission is
empowered to exercise "unified" control over the securities market
and is held responsible for verifying the qualifications of listed
companies and approving stock issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
Moreover, the law outlines detailed work procedures for
government regulatory bodies in order to curb corruption and
unfairness.
</P>
<P>
The new law eliminates sources for manipulating funds by
banning state-owned enterprises trading listed stocks and strictly
prohibiting bank funds from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
It also prohibits foreign capital from entering the A-share
market in order to protect domestic investors from the effects of
manipulation resulting from the actions of foreign money brokers.
</P>
<P>
"Investors must present legal documents proving their identity
and Chinese citizenship opening a stock account," according to the
law.
</P>
<P>
The State Council is currently deliberating regulations
governing Chinese stocks available to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Liabilities for violations of the law range from fines, to the
closure of businesses and criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the formulation of the securities law reflects
China's process in understanding rules governing the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
"Standards governing the market will continue to improve along
with the development of China's securities industry," according to
Li.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Securities Exchange, China's first stock exchange,
opened in 1990, with the value of the nation's stock markets
standing at 2,141.2 billion yuan by the end of June 1998. The
markets offer 811 listed companies and serve 37 million registered
investors.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army has
dismissed reports carried by a Ugandan newspaper that 30 of its
soldiers died in an exchange of fire with their Ugandan
counterparts deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Ndahiro, Rwandan army spokesman, said Monday that
their forces did not clash with the Ugandan troops there although
they had some disagreements with Uganda over how to handle the
DRC war, the New Vision daily reported Tuesday.

Rwandan army has no presence in northeastern DRC, in the towns
of Isiro, Beni and Buta where Uganda People's Defense Forces

rebels there, turned on each other recently in Isiro and Beni.

<P>
Both Uganda and Rwanda have admitted that they deployed troops
in eastern DRC for the sake of their border security while DRC
President Laurent Kabila has accused the two countries of backing

<HEADLINE> HK's GDP Falls by 7 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The preliminary estimates of
the expenditure-based Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Hong Kong
for the third quarter of 1998 reveal that GDP in that quarter fell
by 7.1 percent in real terms over a year earlier, having declined
by 5.1 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released Tuesday by the Census and
Statistics Department of Hong Kong, the preliminary GDP estimate
for the third quarter matches closely with the crude initial
assessment made by the Government in late November, which
indicated a decline of around 7.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall inflation in the economy, however, in terms of the
implicit price deflator of GDP, moderated distinctly further, to
only a 0.4 percent rise in the third quarter over a year earlier,
from increases of 4.5 percent in the first quarter and 1.9 percent
in the second.
</P>
<P>
The large decline in GDP in the third quarter of this year was
mainly due to the continued slackening in local consumer demand,
the significant decline in investment spending, and the further
setback in export performance.
</P>
<P>
Putting the major GDP components on a year-on-year comparison,
private consumption expenditure continued to contract, by 10.0
percent in real terms in the third quarter, following a 5.1
percent decline in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Local consumer spending during the quarter was depressed by the
continued rise in unemployment and further dip in asset prices.
But also relevant was the particularly high base of comparison in
the third quarter of last year, when private consumption
expenditure in that quarter grew by 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government consumption expenditure in national account terms
increased by 3.7 percent in real terms in the third quarter,
having dropped by 5.3 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic fixed capital formation decreased by 9.1 percent
in real terms in the third quarter of 1998, after an increase of
5.6 percent in the second quarter. This significant downturn was
mainly attributable to a marked decline of 10.8 percent in real
terms in overall expenditure on building and construction in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
On visible trade, total exports of goods declined by 7.0
percent in real terms in the third quarter, further down from the
0.5 percent decrease in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods fell even more markedly, by 10.5 percent in
real terms in the third quarter, on account of the setback in
domestic demand and further decline in re-exports. This followed a
1.8 percent decline in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
On invisible trade, exports of services recorded a more
moderate decline of 3.7 percent in real terms in the third
quarter. The improvement from the 11.0 percent decline in the
second quarter was mainly due to the pick-up in inbound tourism in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, imports of services slackened to a 1.2
percent decline in real terms in the third quarter, mainly due to
the setback in imports of transport and financial services, and
slower growth in spending by Hong Kong residents in outbound
trips.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the marked
downturn in exports of goods depressed overall economic
performance in the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Also equally relevant was the fact that the sharp volatilities
and price falls in the financial markets during the quarter,
continued credit stringency, high interest cost and uncertain
economic outlook all severely hit domestic demand, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet the spokesman observed that there were certain positive
signs emerging more recently, including improved liquidity from
the earlier tight situation, successive cuts in local interest
rates, and rebound in share prices and flat prices.

European Union recently provided an aid of some 35 million U.S.
Dollars to Mozambique in support for the country's budget.

</P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lifts Ban on Uganda Gin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has lifted the ban on
the importation of Uganda Waragi to the country as a result of
bilateral discussions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
A press release from Uganda Export Promotion Board said
Tuesday that this achievement is attributed to the talks between
Kenya and Uganda during the Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's
visit to Kampala on May 19-21, 1998 as well as the follow-up
meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The lifting of the ban by the Kenya government is good news
for the Ugandan exporters who may now revive their old contacts
and establish new ones," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Every time Uganda has exhibited its Waragi at regional or
international trade shows, it has proved extremely popular among
customers, it added.
</P>
<P>
The years-long ban was reportedly imposed to protect local
wine market by the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Uganda Manufacturers' Association, James
Mulwana has demanded for the lifting of the ban several times. He
asked Kenyan President Moi to lift the ban and promote bilateral
trade when the latter came to open an international trade fair
here in early October.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China is highly concerned
about the developments in Iraq and deeply disturbed by the
exchange of fire in northern Iraq and the casualties incurred.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao today when asked to comment on the exchange of fire
between the warplanes of the West and the anti-aircraft defenses
of Iraq in the No-Fly-Zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has maintained and made it clear on many
occasions that full respect should be given to the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the establishment of the No-Fly-Zone inside Iraqi
territory runs counter to the U.N. Charter and norms governing
international relations," he said, and adding that "We call on
parties concerned to take necessary measures to avert further
deterioration of the situation."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Struggle to Survive Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A self-fulfilled medal
target at the Asian Games in Bangkok this month allowed
Indonesian sports to breathe a sigh of relief, at least for the
moment, the Jakarta Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Indonesia's preparations for the
continent's major event were plagued by a hard-hitting recession
and security concerns, national athletes brought home six gold,
10 silver and 11 bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
An initial proposal suggested that the cash-strapped National
Sports Council (KONI) should take no more than 70 of the most
prospective medal-winning athletes to Bangkok. But as financial
aid poured in, and as the economic strain seemed to lessen, KONI
listed 128 sportsmen and sportswomen for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had to wait a week after the Games opener on
December 6 for its first gold medal. Hendrawan led the new-look
national men's badminton team past archrival China 4-0, giving
Indonesia a back-to-back victory at the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Of the five other Indonesian gold medalists, two came in as
unlikely winners. Underdog Supriati Sutono clinched the women's
5,000-meter title with a last-ditch sprint, and Arief Taufan
Syamsuddin, competing in the men's 60kg class, won gold while his
team expected to collect the laurels from woman's karateka
Nilawati Daud.
</P>
<P>
Supriati's glorious run ended Indonesia's 36-year wait for a
track and field gold medal at the Asiad. Mohammad Sarengat
earned the country two golds in 100 meters and 110 meters hurdles
at the 4th Asian Games here in 1962 .
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded Asian Games also marked a happy farewell
for Indonesia's tennis queen Yayuk Basuki. Smarting from a defeat
in the team event, Yayuk defied the odds to take the singles
crown. She beat the tournament's top two seeds in the process.
</P>
<P>
With Yayuk already setting a January date for her retirement,
Indonesia looks set to disappear from the world tennis map for a
while.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian badminton suffered a blow with a finding that
world men's doubles champion Sigit Budiarto failed a dope test in
the Singapore Open, which he won with Candra Wijaya in August.
</P>
<P>
Sigit, claiming that he unintentionally took nandrolone
anabolic steroids, was barred for one year by the International
Badminton Federation (IBF) following a hearing in November.
</P>
<P>
The punishment was 12 months lighter than the maximum
sentence for a player who violates the IBF anti-doping rules.
Sigit was the third Indonesian to be involved in a drug scandal
after men's singles Hastomo Arbi and in women's singles Minarti
Timur in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But badminton, again, salvaged Indonesia's pride this year
when in May, Hariyanto Arbi and companions stretched their Thomas
Cup men's team championship supremacy for the third consecutive
time.
</P>
<P>
Their female compatriots fell in the last hurdle at the hands
of star-studded China in Uber Cup.
</P>
<P>
Security uncertainty which preceded and succeeded the
transfer of power in May adversely affected sports activities in
the country. The Indonesian soccer league was the first to fall
victim when the national soccer federation prematurely stopped it
in May, leaving the tournament without a champion.
</P>
<P>
The federation's new chairman Agum Gumelar, who took over
from Azwar Anas, who resigned following the shameful behavior
during the Tiger Cup in August, reinstated the league on October
28 amid a sponsorship row.
</P>
<P>
In July, the Women's Tennis Association, the governing body
of women's professional tennis, cited security concerns for its
decision to drop two annual tournaments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Auto sports were another notable victim due to security
concerns. All events were sanctioned by the International
Automobile Federation (FIA). The FIA even failed to list the
used-to-be annual event in its calendar.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Grand Prix world motorcycling championships
was cancelled. Indonesia's Asian Omega Tour gold tournament also
missed the cut this year after its organizers fell short of funds
to provide the prize money.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesia Open badminton championships were lucky to
escape. The tournament suffered only a four-month delay from the
original schedule of July.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian shuttlers romped home with all but the men's
singles title. That prestigious crown went to Yong Hock Kin, the
first Malaysian ever to win a tournament on Indonesian soil.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Former Chief Minister Acquitted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former
Selangor State Chief Minister Muhammad Haji Muhammad Taib was
acquitted by the Kuala Lumpur High Court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Abdul Wahab Patail made the ruling Tuesday morning
after hearing nine prosecution and seven defense witnesses over 11
days of hearing.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, who is a vice president of the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO), was charged for failing to declare
his and his family's assets.
</P>
<P>
But on June 10 last year, Muhammad pleaded not guilty to the
charge.
</P>
<P>
Justice Abdul Wahab said Muhammad's explanation for
non-declaration was that he believed that the properties had been
disposed of and he did not therefore own and have beneficial
interest and Muhammad's evidence of the disposal of beneficial
interest was corroborated with the evidence of transferring and
his evidence in court was unshaken in cross examination.
</P>
<P>
"So accordingly under Section 182 (A) (3) Criminal Procedure
Code, I accordingly order an acquittal on grounds that the
prosecution did not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt," he
ruled.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Grants Financial Aid to Poor Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has approved the immediate release of financial assistance
to some 300 poor municipalities, the Philippine News Agency said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Jinggoy E. Estrada, President Estrada's
son and national president of the League of Municipalities of the
Philippines (LMP), the agency said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada initially directed the Department of Budget
and Management to release some 82 million pesos (2.05 million U.S.
dollars) to the first 12 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Based on the LMP chief's evaluation, the initial amount will
directly benefit more than 1,500 employees and more than 120,000
constituents of the impoverished towns which could therefore pay
their local workers' salaries, incentives and bonuses and provide
the basic services to their people.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Agriculture Improved Modestly in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural output in Kenya
is estimated to increase by 1.5 percent this year as compared
with 1.2 percent in 1997, the East African Standard newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The modest improvement stems from favorable weather conditions
that increased food crop production from the level of 1997 when
drought and El Nino-charged rains destroyed output, the Central
Bank of Kenya (CBK) said.
</P>
<P>
The cash crop sector continued to perform poorly due to lack
of affordable credit ad rising input costs. Structural
constraints to management and marketing have also contributed to
the sector's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
Arising from these factors, output of coffee and horticultural
products fell by 33 percent and 17 percent respectively in 1998
compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export earnings declined by 24.5 percent to 10.5
billion Shillings (about 175 million U.S. Dollars) for the period
between January to August compared with 230 million U.S. Dollars
over a similar period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, tea production and export earnings continued to
improve with average monthly production up by 30.8 percent to
24,121 tons from 18,442 tons in 1997 and export earnings to 400
million U.S. Dollars in the first nine months of this year, up by
69.5 percent over the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The less than satisfactory performance of the cash crop sector
is expected to persist through 1999, mainly because of the
falling prices of tea, coffee and horticultural crops, the CBK
said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Politicians Accused of Marring Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Political interference in
Zambia has marred the distribution of relief food in some parts
of the country, threatening to throw the whole exercise in
disarray, a charity body has warned here Monday.
</P>
<P>
World Vision Zambia (WVZ) Executive Assistant, Fred Simposya
said on Monday that a senior government officer last week tried
to force a WVZ worker in Choma of Southern province, to
accompany him to a political rally to refute claims that the
relief food was distributed by an oppositon party, and when the
the officer was refused, he threatened to halt the
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Simposya said in statement that politicians, eager to get
relief food to their areas as a campaign tool for the local
government elections to be held on December 30, have harassed WVZ
employees and even threatend to stop the distribution of the
relief food in some cases, the government-run newspaper, Times of
Zambia, reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simposya noted that another politician demanded that WVZ
should move sorghum to his constituency from a warehouse
belonging to the Food Reserve Agency, but he was refused.
</P>
<P>
"While we understand that food is a political issue, there
should be some basic rules of decency and we appeal to the office
of the vice-president to ensure that politicians observe this to
safeguard the lives of our staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
Simposya said that as a non-partisan organization, the WVZ
would like to operate professionally instead of being drawn into
the political arena.
</P>
<P>
By November 30 this year, WVZ had distributed 33,281 bags of
25-kg mealie meal to Mpika, Gwember and Choma areas and another
200 bags of 50-kg rice to Kasama. the exericse is still going on
in other areas of the country.

right-wing party he is forming. His candidacy has triggered some

help the Left.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Obtains Big Loan From Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will get a
foreign currency loan of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars from foreign
banks operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government of Malaysia Tuesday signed a facility agreement
with a consortium of 12 foreign commercial banks incorporated in
the country for the extension of the five-year amortizing term
loan, available in U.S. dollars and Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Malaysian government will draw down
800 million dollars at the end of this year and the remaining 550
million dollars will be fully disbursed in early January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Malaysia's Second Finance
Minister Mustapa Mohamed appreciated the foreign banks for their
commitment to participating directly in Malaysia's economic
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
He said this smart partnership will be beneficial to not only
the country but also the foreign banks as an early economic
recovery provides a favorable business environment for all those
operating in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the loan will be utilized by the government
in its development program toward the economic recovery process
and to further strengthen the banking sector, Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the loan based on a market-driven rate, which carries
an all-in cost of 3 percent per annum, served as the benchmark for
the pricing of other foreign currency facilities to be raised by
the government and the private sector in the future.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Attracts More Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia attracted investment
licenses worth over 951 million U.S. Dollars in the first half of
this year compared to the total pledged investment of about 272
million Dollars of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest monthly review of the economy,
Business Trends, published by Standard Chartered Bank, of the 951
million Dollars, 40 percent represented the mining investment, Roan
Antelope (India), and the planned rehabilitation of power
infrastructure by the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Experts observed that potential investors have put Zambia
on hold awaiting the eventual privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the mainstay of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that without considerable research it is
impossible to tell what proportion of the investment pledges are
converted into the actual projects which could also lead to job
creation.
</P>
<P>
However, a rough rule of the thumb applied internationally is
that 50 percent of investment pledges are made into actual
projects and if such a ratio is attained in Zambia, then
investment spending will increase substantially in the early
years of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Coal Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China plans to introduce
preferential loan and fee exemption policies to accelerate the
development of coal gas, one of the nation's main new energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
China has developed over 50 coal gas projects, including a
650,000-cu.m. gas storage tank and coal gas pipeline stretching
620,000 meters, according to a senior official with the
Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
Current figures indicate the country's total coal gas usage
during 1998 will exceed 400 million cu.m., with the figure
representing a substantial rise for previous years.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to promote the coal gas industry by
eliminating compensation fees for enterprises engaged in the
initial stages of exploration and development. Preferential loans
will also be available for key coal gas projects.
</P>
<P>
China has placed priority on the development of coal gas in
order to compensate for shortfalls in the energy supply, according
to the official. The increased use of coal gas is expected to
improve the country's consumption structure for energy resources,
reduce air pollution and enhance safe production.
</P>
<P>
China has abundant coal gas resources. Coal fields in north,
northeast and south China have estimated recoverable coal gas
deposits of over 3.5 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the nation has developed an extensive array of
advanced coal gas technology, including some 20 technological
items which reach international standards.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Civil Servants Get 25 Percent Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
agreed to award the civil servants a 25 percent cost of living
adjustment across the board, effective in January next year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Joint Negotiation Council, Ignatius
Chigwendere said in a statement Monday that negotiations between
the government and staff association representatives had yielded
a 25 percent wage and salary increase.
</P>
<P>
The staff association representatives had hoped for a higher
percentage due to the constant and persistent erosion of their
incomes arising from pressure on the Zimbabwean Dollar, the daily
Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A 25 percent cost of living adjustment awarded for next year
goes a long way toward cushioning the civil servants' plight, but
does not go far enough in redressing present imbalances between
them and workers in industry in general," Chigwendere was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Public servants have been adversely affected by the current
economic situation like other Zimbabweans, he said, but they
believe their situation has been exacerbated by the fact they
are already at the bottom of the social structure.

<HEADLINE> RBI Report Rules Out 6 Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has revised its outlook and said a growth rate of 6 percent
in gross domestic product (GDP) is clearly unattainable this year.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report, RBI has also termed the macroeconomic
situation as a matter of "serious concern." It has painted a
gloomy picture of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The increase in prices of primary commodities and the rate of
inflation has heightened uncertainty about output growth. RBI also
expressed concern about the high growth in money supply despite a
substantial increase in the cash reserve ratio and short-term
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"The slow growth in industry has clouded the prospect of
achieving a rate of growth of 6 percent, which was visualized at
the time of the mid-term review of credit policy in October 98,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also stated that agricultural and industrial
performance has not shown indications of a strong recovery. Up to
October 1998, industrial growth turned out to be significantly
lower at 3.6 percent compared with 6.2 percent in the
corresponding period of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Spaniards Excited on Eve of Euro Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Spaniards are probably the
most excited in the 11 euro-area countries about entering the era
of euro, the single European currency to be launched on January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government is really proud of its achievements in
meeting the five criteria outlined in the Maastricht Treaty for
joining the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the country was far behind in terms of any of
the five criteria including an inflation rate of below 3 percent
and a budget deficit lower than three percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP). But now in just two years, it is fully
qualified to become one of the first wave euro countries.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector also feels happy with its "most crucial and
irreplaceable" role in macro economic control in the past two
years, which has won applause from both the ruling and opposition
camps.
</P>
<P>
Spain's banking sector, as a matter of fact, has become the
most profitable banking sector in the entire Europe and it is
confident of its ability to compete with other banks in the
future euro market.
</P>
<P>
Business people in Spain have a much higher expectation in the
euro era as the labor force and raw material in the country are
cheap compared with other euro countries. They have been
encouraged to grasp the opportunities offered by the launching of
the single European currency to expand their businesses.
</P>
<P>
By joining euro, Spain achieved its long-held target of
integration with Europe, leaving behind the political alienation
which had been there since Francisco Franco Bahamonde was in
power.
</P>
<P>
The most excited in Spain are the young generation, who are
called the "euro generation." For them, all borders in Europe
vanished and they can travel freely and find jobs in any euro
country.
</P>
<P>
In the course to achieve the criteria set in the Maastricht
Treaty, Spain gained a steady economic development and the
inflation rate kept falling, a benefit many feel they gain in
advance from euro.

According to Meguid's statement, the meeting of Arab
foreign ministers has been postponed to January 24.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Vows to Safeguard Ross Sea Toothfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- There is a serious threat
of "pirate" vessels fishing for toothfish in the Ross Sea this
summer, New Zealand Minister for the Environment Simon Upton
warned here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the minister, who is also responsible for
Antarctic affairs, said his country is determined to draw the
world's attention to this threat.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want these ocean pillagers in our Antarctic
neighborhood. If such vessels appear, we will be doing all in our
power to identify them and the companies behind them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government has made provision for aerial
surveillance activities in the Ross Sea region during the January
to mid-March period when ice conditions will allow fishing in
these high latitudes, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Information from various sources suggests that several
longlining vessels which have been involved in uncontrolled
fishing for toothfish in Antarctic waters may be looking at the
Ross Sea for potential rich pickings.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal and unregulated fishing damages the local environment,
kills wildlife and challenges the credibility of the entire
Antarctic Treaty System," Upton said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is committed to defending the Antarctic Treaty
System and is putting the international community on notice that
it will do its part to protect the Antarctic eco-system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Deregister Over 300 Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) - Tanzania will deregister
315 out of 425 newspapers due to their failure to start operation
within the stipulated period, the Tanzania Information Services
director said.
</P>
<P>
Kassim Mpenda told local media Monday that this will be the
government's first step in ensuring active performance of
registered newspapers in accordance with the Newspaper Act of
1976.
</P>
<P>
Mpenda said so far 425 papers have been registered in the
country but only 110 are presumably active on the market.
</P>
<P>
"Some papers have not been published ever since their
registration, such as the Daily Times, Bayana, Jambo and Harakati
as well as the Tanzania Law Magazine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mpenda said that publishers of the newspapers will be given
three months, probably immediately after the New Year's Day, to
defend themselves before being deregistered.
</P>
<P>
He said the next step will be the evaluation of the
performance of all the 110 newspapers actually operating in the
market to be sorted out for another notice of deregistration.
</P>
<P>
However, the director did not specify the time set by the law
in which a paper should be on market after registration.

<HEADLINE> NPC Settles Citizenship Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee, China's top legislative body, today
approved the Explanations on Implementation of the Law on
Nationality in the Macao Special Administrative Region
(MSAR).
</P>
<P>
China will deal with questions concerning the nationality of
Macao residents in a flexible manner which fully complies with the
basic principles of the Law on Nationality and considers
both the reality and history of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Explanations read:
</P>
<P>
-- All Macao residents of Chinese descent who were born on
Chinese territory, including Macao, and those fulfilling the
requirements of the Law on Nationality are Chinese citizens,
regardless of whether they do or do not hold Portuguese travel
certificates or identity cards.
</P>
<P>
Individuals of both Chinese and Portuguese descent are free to
choose between Chinese or Portuguese citizenship. However, prior
to exercising their citizenship option, MSAR residents enjoy all
rights set forth in the Basic Law of the Macao Special Economic
Region, with the exception of the rights restricted by the Law on
Nationality.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese residents in the MSAR holding Portuguese travel
documents can continue to use such documents to travel to other
countries and regions following the founding of the MSAR. However,
in Macao and other parts of China they do not enjoy the protection
of Portuguese consulates because they hold such documents.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese residents in the MSAR with residence rights in other
countries can travel to other countries and regions with
appropriate documents signed by foreign governments. However, in
Macao and other parts of China they do not enjoy the protection of
foreign consulates because they hold such documents.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese residents of the MSAR who return from overseas
either before or after the founding of the MSAR can apply for a
change of citizenship at related departments on the strength of
valid documents.
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Government entrusts the Government of the Macao
SAR to designate departments to handle matters related to
nationality applications in accordance with China's Law on
Nationality and the aforementioned stipulations.

NANCHANG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China recently initiated a
major project to reinforce a vulnerable section of the Yangtze
River levee as part of an effort to combat possible major floods.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to cost 1.95 billion yuan (234.9
million US dollars), focuses on the Jiujiang Levee. Heavy summer
flooding breached the levee and inundated some sections and
threatened the entire city of Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang project, the first Yangtze project of its kind
approved by the central government, is designed to repair and
consolidate banks, dikes and levees along a 196 km. section from
the city of Ruichang to Pengze County. Experts point to potential
problems along 75 percent of the levee in the section.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion within three

<HEADLINE> China Set to Introduce New Investment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) - China is set to introduce the
first in a group of five planned securities investment funds on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The closed-end Puhui Fund will carry a face value of one yuan
and will mature in 15 years. The issue is expected to raise total
capital of two billion yuan. The Penghua Funds Management
Co. Ltd. will manage the fund under the custodianship of the Bank
of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of the new fund indicates China's determination to
launch new investment funds to nurture institutional investors and
will promote the stability and standardization of the securities
market, according to an official with the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, the nation's securities watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the current sluggish stock market
and weak performance of investment funds will not affect the
government's determination to introduce more funds.
</P>
<P>
Various funds are creating investment value in spite of sliding
prices over the past few months, and annual yields for some are
expected to exceed 10 percent when taking profits from new
subscribed stocks into account, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Investment funds emerged as star performers on the stock market
due to the introduction of favorable policies following the launch
of the first two funds -- Jintai Fund and Kaiyuan Fund -- in early
April.
</P>
<P>
Prices for said funds, in fact, surged above two yuan. However,
the failure of the funds to fullfill the expectations of investors
sparked a downward trend, with prices currently fluctuating at
around 1.2 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Prices for the funds have dropped to a reasonable level when
considering the sluggishness of the stock market. Funds will
continue to be a useful investment instrument for investors
seeking reasonable returns and low risk.

<HEADLINE> Stern Wants NBA Vote, Union Says No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- NBA commissioner David
Stern reiterated today the league's intension to cancel the
season while union director Billy Hunter said the union would not
vote on the owner's final proposal.
</P>
<P>
"I think the likelihood is the season will be canceled
January 7," said Stern, who is baffled by the union's strategy of
not voting on any of the proposals presented by the league.
</P>
<P>
"We're not inclined to take anything to membership for a
vote,"said Hunter, who continues to accuse NBA owners of engaging
in concession bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Stern and Hunter spoke in separate teleconferences less than
24 hours after the NBA declared it had made its final proposal at
a five-hour meeting in Denver. NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik added that the sides are "continents" apart.
</P>
<P>
"We do not anticipate any further negotiations between now
and January 7," Stern said. "If the players have something to
tell us, we'll take it back to our labor committee, but the
likelihood is that the season will be canceled on January 7."
</P>
<P>
Stern said the players negotiating committee will be blame if
there is no agreement by January 7.
</P>
<P>
Hunter still confident that a deal is possible, called for a
resumption of talks between both sides' negotiating committees.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that if that does happen, there's a strong
possibility that an agreement could be reached," Hunter said.
"We've done everything that we believe is conceivable, and we
have been earnest in our efforts to make a deal. It comes down to
horse trading, and if they are inclined to trade further, we have
ample time to save the season."
</P>
<P>
"I believe our owners will vote overwhelmingly to reject the
players' last offer," Stern added.
</P>
<P>
The major difference appears to be a backup tax on the escrow
package that would be installed over the last three years of the
six-year proposal. The union believes there is no need for it,
while the owners want it as a financial security system.
</P>
<P>
The sides also are considerably apart on the percentage of
basketball-related income (BRI) to be allocated to the players
over the last three years. The league's final proposal called for
a raise of one percentage point in each year to 53 percent, 53.5
percent and 54 percent. The union is seeking 56 percent, 56 pe
rcent and 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
"They've got to do three things," Hunter said. "Give us a
number at or about 57 percent. They've got to give us the
exceptions we've asked for and they've asked for and they've got
to do away with the tax. I don't think it's necessary."
</P>
<P>
Hunter said 85 percent of his union is squarely behind him.
"I can't understand why you wouldn't allow the membership to
vote, but they tell us they don't have to," Granik said. "We were
instructed by our committee that this is as far as we can
possible go. They would prefer not to operate the NBA rather than
go any further than this proposal."
</P>
<P>
Stern said:"He didn't believe that the NLRB would dismiss the
unfair labor practice, and he didn't believe that Dean Feerick
would rule against him, and he didn't believe we'd lose
regular-season games, and he didn't believe we'd miss Christmas
Day, and he didn't believe we'd cancel the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
"So his analysis of this has been right on target. And on
January 8, he'll turn to his players and say 'Guess what, I was
wrong.'"
</P>
<P>
Granik added:"Or maybe he'll say they didn't really mean it
if the owners cancel the season. But by then it will be too late
to make and difference."

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Albania's parliament on Monday
unanimously endorsed a resolution calling for NATO's intervention
in the Kosovo issue and the Albanian government's strong support
for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current situation in Kosovo as extremely
grave, the resolution urged the international community, in
particular the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the United States, to participate more
actively and effectively in the process of seeking a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under current circumstances, it is necessary for NATO to
intervene in the Kosovo issue to help find an early settlement to
the conflict and to avert humanitarian disasters there, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Albanian government to give strong support
to "Kosovo brothers" , who, it said, are faced with an unusual
situation, in their efforts to seek autonomy in the Serb province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called for all political powers in Kosovo
and Albania to take a unified stand on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Albania's People's Assembly, or Parliament, originally decided
to vote on the resolution last Thursday, but had to postpone it
since deputies from the Democratic Party of Albania boycotted the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Albania, which did not attend Monday's
vote, had reportedly expressed its support for the resolution.

<P>
NANJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
Suzhou, a scenic city of east China's Jiangsu Province, have
accounted for a constantly increasing portion of the city's fiscal
revenues in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded firms currently account for some 20 percent of
total fiscal revenues for the city which is located less than 100
km from Shanghai, China's largest economic and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou has approved 7,560 overseas-funded enterprises since
1984, the second largest number of approvals in the Yangtze River
valley following Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,257 are currently in operation. Recent statistics also
show that 64 of the world's top 500 multinational corporations
have invested in the city.
</P>
<P>
The government decision to transform Shanghai's Pudong New Area
into a financial and trade center for East Asia has accelerated
the influx of overseas funds into Suzhou in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Contracted overseas investment averaged close to four billion
US dollars annually between 1992-1996, with the 1997 figure for
funds actually used hitting 2.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment mainly flows into the textile, light
industry, clothing, power generation and agriculture sectors,
according to a city government official.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand-Asia Relations Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- "Asia will increasingly
shape our (New Zealand) future," Philli Gibson has said in an
article titled "Asia Will Be Back."
</P>
<P>
The article written by the executive director of the Asia 2000
Foundation of New Zealand was published Tuesday in the Dominion, a
 Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the article, Gibson said Even with its economic downturn,
"Asia is still well ahead of where it was just a few years back."
</P>
<P>
"Asia's current problems need to be seen in the context of 30
years of extraordinary growth and development."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand's engagement with the region similarly needs to be
put in context. Asia's downturn has affected us -- and in some
export sectors significantly so. But we remain way ahead of where
we were just a few years back."
</P>
<P>
Gibson noted that Asia at present takes around 35 percent of
New Zealand's total exports. That's down from 38 percent a year
ago. But it's still about the same as Europe and the United States
combined.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 30 years, our (annual) exports to the region
have grown from around 150 million NZ dollars (78 Million U.S.
dollars) to nearly 8 billion NZ dollars (4.16 billion U.S.
dollars)."
</P>
<P>
"Even in recession, Asia remains vitally important to New
Zealand. It is the part of the world where we earn the most and
where we have the potential to earn much more."
</P>
<P>
The author stressed the importance of sustaining and developing
the friendships and relationships New Zealand has built in Asia,
having a keen eye for new trade and investment opportunities, and
knowing much more about the peoples, cultures and economies of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Asia accounts for around one third of global gross domestic
product, contains over one half of the world's population and is
relatively close geographically.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is, Asia will increasingly shape our future," he
said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Thousands of Teen Abortions in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of young New
Zealand females had an abortion last year, according to data
released by the NZ Youth Affairs Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 2,962 abortions were carried out on females aged
between 11 and 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1997, nearly 300 under 15 year-olds contracted a
sexually transmitted decease (STD) and were treated at an STD
clinic. A further 6,843 teenagers (15-19-year-old) with STDs
sought help from clinics nationwide. Under-19-year-olds made up 21
percent of all patients attending STD clinics nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry believes the real number of youngsters
with STDs was probably much higher.
</P>
<P>
A specialist committee under the ministry has raised
recommendations including compulsory sexual health education in
primary schools and a huge campaign using various media such as
youth television and magazines.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Youth affairs Minister Tony Ryall called on parents
to share responsibility for their children's sexual health.

"It is not just the responsibility of the school, it is the
responsibility of families," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia's Economy Experiencing Hard Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1998 saw Zambia's
economy experiencing a hard time following two successive years'
growth, which is characterized by less export earnings, slow
foreign investment, reduced purchasing power of people and heavy
burden of foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The real economic growth rate in the southern African country
is now estimated to be minus two percent this year from last
year's 3.5 percent and 5.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The growth target in the 1998 national budget was set at 5.5
percent and was revised to four percent at mid-year. However,
"many of the problems that emerged in the course of the year have
not been eased or resolved. As a result, the achievement of even
the revised macro-economic objectives for this year is not
possible," said Godfrey Simasiku, the country's Deputy Finance
Minister.
</P>
<P>
One of the major factors which stumbled the country's growth
pace is the drastic decline in export earnings. Total export
earnings for the year are expected to decrease to 888 million
U.S. Dollars from 1,159 million Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings from Zambia's metal mining sector, the
country's major foreign exchange earner, dropped by 42 percent in
the first nine months of this year to 468.83 million Dollars from
809.3 million Dollars in the same period last year by official
count.
</P>
<P>
And copper earnings alone fell by 44 percent from 688.6
million Dollars realized between January and September last year
to mere 386.18 million Dollars in the same period of this year.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the economic crisis in Asia which has
reduced demand for copper thus dragging copper price further
down. Copper price dropped by 33 cents a pound in the London
metal exchange market to 77 cents in the first quarter of this
year compared with 110 cents in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Another factor which had adverse effect on the country's
economic growth this year is seen in less foreign direct
investment. According to World Investment Report 1998, Zambia
ranked the seventh from the bottom among the top 20 recipients of
foreign direct investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
For Zambia, 1998 has seen a wait-and-see attitude from
investors. According to Lusaka Stock Exchange, though some
investors have invested in newly-privatized mines, investment
flows seemed to be merely trickling.
</P>
<P>
To make the situation worse, some donor countries withheld
their pledged aid of 530 million Dollars to Zambia this year in
excuse of the country not completing the privatization of its two
major copper mines.
</P>
<P>
Owing to lack of foreign exchange inflow, Zambia's central
bank had to pursue a tight monetary policy to withdraw excess
funds from the public to curb the speculative demand and
unnecessary demand pressures on the foreign exchange supply.
</P>
<P>
This policy, explained by the bank's spokesman Kabinga Pande,
also aimed to check the continuous depreciation of the local
currency Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
Kwacha has devalued drastically with 2,200 against one U.S.
Dollar at present, compared with 1,400 against one Dollar at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
As Zambia is very dependent on imports, the depreciation of
Kwacha has pushed up the prices of imported commodities. The
prices of local products have also been hiked. As a result, the
purchasing power of Zambians, 70 percent of whom are living in
abject poverty, has been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the output of maize, staple food for Zambians,
dropped by 30 percent to only 650,000 tons this year compared
with that in 1997, which is lowest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The output of soya, rice, sorghum and sunflower also fell due
to El Nino effects, necessitating substantial imports in the
final quarter and early next year, which will, in turn, have
adverse implications for both inflation and exchange rate of the
country's currency.
</P>
<P>
Further more, Zambia spent over 200 million Dollars in 1997 in
servicing its foreign debts now standing at seven billion
Dollars. This year the country is expected to spend 290 million
more on the debt servicing. The amount represents about one third
of its total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Difficult as it was, Zambia's economy is hopeful in the long
run as seen by President Frederick Chiluba. He told a national
convention recently that the country should look away from
exclusive donor dependence in its economic development and tap
its resources to boost non-traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
"Our survival lies in the non-traditional sector, agriculture
in particular, which has the highest potential to support both
primary and secondary industries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People's Rights, Interests Fully Protected (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains free and
open and its residents' legitimate rights and interests are fully
protected under the Basic Law after its return to China on July 1
last year.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion has been proven by a public opinion survey
conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong in December this
year.
</P>
<P>
Among 788 respondents aged between 18 and 40, about 80 percent
said they were satisfied with a high degree of freedom in Hong
Kong and 60 percent expressed satisfaction with the present Hong
Kong's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
About 72 percent of respondents held that freedom of speech
that the Hong Kong people enjoy has been well ensured and 88
percent agreed that freedom of traveling to and from Hong Kong has
been fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 percent said that the Hong Kong people enjoy freedom
of association, of assembly, and of precession and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
As Elsie Leung, secretary for Justice, has said that after Hong
Kong's return to China, the SAR government has been doing all it
can under the Basic Law, through administrative and legal means,
to further enhance the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that provisions of the six significant human rights
conventions as applied to Hong Kong continue to have force in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
These cover a wide range of subjects such as guaranteeing civil
and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights, the
rights of child, and eliminating all forms of racial
discrimination and all forms of discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
During the May Legislative Council election, the first of its
kind since the HKSAR was established on July 1 last year, a record
number of 1.49 million Hong Kong residents, or 53.3 percent of the
2.8 million registered voters, turned out to vote despite heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
Their broad and active participation in the election was
unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. During the 1995 Legislative
Council election under the rule of the British Hong Kong
authorities, the overall turnout rate was only 35.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is a demonstration of Hong Kong people's enthusiasm to
exercise their civic rights and of their determination and
confidence in "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy, said David
Lan, secretary for Home Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People's Rights, Interests Fully Protected  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong is proud of its track record on human rights. Like
what Lan has said that after Hong Kong's return to China, "we
have witnessed much more willingness on the part of our citizens
to exercise their rights."
</P>
<P>
From July 1, 1997 to November 30, 1998, there were some 2,700
public meetings and processions, averaging five a day, and some
1,299 societies were registered or exempted from registration
under the Societies Ordinance. So far, the police have not once
objected to any applications to hold such activities.
</P>
<P>
Leung, who was in private practice for nearly 30 years, said it
is the Hong Kong residents' conscientious action to safeguard
their own rights and interests by using laws.
</P>
<P>
Last year, when the government slaughtered all chickens on
local farms and all poultry on wholesale markets in a bid to
eliminate the source of influenza, a H5N1 virus of bird flu, a
chicken sales manager brought a charge against the government in
court, asking the government for compensation.
</P>
<P>
Although he lost a lawsuit, it fully reflected an ordinary
citizen's law consciousness, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a variety of ethnic and cultural groups with
differing religious beliefs. Buddhists have co-existed and lived
in harmony with Taoists, Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus and
Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, the SAR government neither
imposes any restrictions on the Hong Kong residents' freedom of
religious beliefs, nor interferes in their internal affairs of the
religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong residents' religious activities have been
conducted as usual. Schools, hospitals and welfare institutions
run by the religious organizations have been operating normally.
</P>
<P>
All of these show that some dire predictions that the rights
and freedoms of Hong Kong residents were about to be curtailed
after its return to China are totally groundless.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the last 18 months have clearly demonstrated
that the SAR government is fully committed to the protection of
human rights by observing strictly the Basic Law, maintaining the
rule of law and the independence of the judiciary while the
Central People's government does not interfere in Hong Kong's own
affairs at all.
</P>
<P>
These have laid a solid foundation for ensuring the full
protection of Hong Kong people's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
As Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has stated that Hong Kong
remains a robust and lively community where people have no
hesitation in speaking their minds.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to do everything it can to protect
and preserve people's rights, he pledged.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Take up Heritage-Conserving Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
take up a 6-million U.S. dollar project next year to conserve and
develop the country's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to be launched in the first
quarter of 1999, would be co-funded by the World Bank (WB), The
Daily Star, an English daily newspaper, reported Tuesday, quoting
official sources.
</P>
<P>
A proposal had been prepared for chalking out the details of
the plan by the Ministry of Culture Affairs which would work as
the executing agency of the project.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is likely to have negotiations with the WB in
January 1999 to get the green signal from the bank which will
provide 5 million dollars for the implementation of the project,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of monuments across the country would be one of
the main components of the project, and the other major components
of the project would include promotion of fine arts and
strengthening of public and private libraries, they stated.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is the second largest Muslim country in the world
with 86 percent of its 127 million people being Muslims, and
therefore, the Muslim cultural heritage in the country is rich,
which needs to be conserved.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Sets 5 Conditions for Renouncing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the major opposition in the parliament, has set five
conditions for renouncing hartal in response to the ruling Awami
League's non-hartal announcement made last November.
</P>
<P>
The conditions are: the government must "refrain from
repression on opposition," refrain from "anti-people and
anti-state activities," "ensure voting rights," "allow the
opposition to speak in parliament" and "create no obstacles to
street program of the opposition."
</P>
<P>
Begum Khaleda Zia, BNP chairperson and leader of the
opposition, announced the five conditions while exchanging views
with the newly elected executive body of the Federation of
Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries here Monday, said
press reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, prime minister and president of the ruling party
announced on November 15 that her party would "never call hartals"
either in power or in opposition in the future.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in the wake of the three-day non-stop
hartal of the seven-party opposition alliance between November 9
and 11, which put the whole country at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
"I myself don't like hartal. We will not go for hartal if the
government adhered to the conditions," the BNP leader said, adding
"I believe that hartal sustains loss to the national economy."
</P>
<P>
The ruling party has made no reaction to BNP's five conditions
till now.
</P>
<P>
Hartal is a special political phenomenon in this South Asian
country. The opposition party often finds reasons to hold hartals
in opposing the ruling party, while the latter always adopts some
counter measures to control the situation. As a result, clashes
between the two sides often take place.
</P>
<P>
During hartals, all shops are closed, transport stops and
pedestrians are rarely seen in the street. Meanwhile, almost all
the economic activities in the capital and other major cities in
the country are at a standstill for a day or two days or even
more.
</P>
<P>
A day-long nation-wide hartal in the country may make the
national economy incur an estimated loss of 3.8 billion taka
(about 78.4 million U.S. dollars), according to the Finance
Ministry.

LIMA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A fire that broke out Monday in
a fireworks market in the Peruvian capital city of Lima burned
dead 7 people and injured six, leaving the shopping malls and
warehouses in the market in ruins.
</P>
<P>
The fire started when a retailer lighted a "rocket
firecracker" which shot into the sky and then found its way into
a fireworks warehouse. The people in the market rushed to get
water from the toilet in a futile attempt to put out the fire,
which triggered a chain of explosions.
</P>
<P>
The fire was extinguished two hours later after fire fighters
joined the rescue efforts. Seven bodies were found in the ashes
and all were female, including two children.
</P>
<P>
A government official who inspected the fire site said the
police seized several hundred kilograms of fireworks products in
the market not long before.
</P>
<P>
She urged people to stop selling fireworks for their potential
threats to people's lives.

<HEADLINE> Quarter-Century Step Toward Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The search for a Euro-dollar
currency has been a historic quest since the early 1970s when the
Bretton Woods system collapsed and the then six-nation European
Community (EC) started to look for a way to unite monetarily.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar has since been used by international financial
operators in western Europe. The dollar played its most
influential role in the 1950s and 60s. Now the present
15-country European Union (EU) is ready to enter into a new stage
of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) after making a
quarter-century step toward the euro, the single currency that
was once just a dream for most political leaders in western
European nations.
</P>
<P>
When the world retraces the journey of the EMU, a serious
story will be told. When the United States allowed the dollar to
be floated in August 1971, a fresh wave of market instability
followed. By 1973, the energy crisis squashed the EC's hopes of
tying their currencies closer together. At that time, the EU
said, the then EC member states had not achieved a sufficient
degree of economic convergence and lacked the political will for
strong economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, this setback did not disrupt their interest in trying
to create currency stability. The European Monetary System was
launched in March 1979 with the initiative brought on by three
famous political figures: France's Giscard d'Estaing, West
Germany's Helmut Schmidt and Luxembourg's Pierre Werner. In the
meantime, all nine member states of the EC joined the system,
although the British pound remained outside the mechanism for
stabilizing exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the community gained success with the EMS.
Between 1979 and 1985, exchange rate variability was half what it
had been in 1975-79 and it halved again between 1986 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
In June 1988, the heads of EC member states at their Hanover
meeting set up the "Committee for the study of an Economic and
Monetary Union" under the chairmanship of the then President of
the European Commission, Jacques Delors. The committee included
all EC central bank governors and a few independent experts.
</P>
<P>
In April 1989, the committee members in their report
unanimously agreed that monetary union should be achieved in
three stages, moving from closer economic and monetary
coordination to a single currency and the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report's recommendations shaped the EU Treaty signed in
February 1992 in the Netherlands' city of Maastricht city with
the objective of a single currency by January 1, 1999 at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
Based on the well-known Maastricht Treaty's three-stage
approach to the EMU, the union members tried to remove all
restrictions on capital movements and stepped up their efforts
for economic convergence. Capital movements had been freed in
most member states by the time the EU treaty came into force in
November 1993, a month before the end of the first stage.
</P>
<P>
In January 1994, the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the
forerunner of the European Central Bank (ECB), was set up and
given a number of preparatory tasks including surveillance
procedures introduced for promoting economic convergence.
</P>
<P>
During the second stage of EMU, which will end this year,
heads of the 15 EU members at their Madrid meeting in December
1995 established a definitive three-phase timetable and scenario
for the introduction of the single currency. They named the
future currency "the euro."
</P>
<P>
The third EMU stage will start on New Year's Day. According
to the EU treaty, the common basic law of the regional integr
ation bloc, the date of January 1, 1999, will see the launch of
the euro with the irrevocable locking of exchange rates between
the currencies of the nine countries in euro zone: Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. At the same time, the ECB will
assume responsibility for monetary policy and exchange rate
policy.
</P>
<P>
Europe's dream will come true in just two days. Despite the
possibility of uncertain factors, such as "can the euro challenge
the dollar in the future," and "how long will the euro take to
become a hard currency," the European Union's 40-year effort will
be certain to make its single currency equal in footing with the
dollar. This might be the EU's hefty innovation for the world
monetary system in this century.

<HEADLINE> Nearly Half Loans at Thai Banks Are Non-Performing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 46 percent of the total
loans at Thai commercial banks in October are non-performing loans
(NPLs), a Bank of Thailand (BOT) report available Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's eight private commercial banks had loans more than
three-months in arrears amounting to 39.5 percent of the total
loans, or 1.22 trillion baht (33.9 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Eight state-owned commercial banks had NPLs worth 58.3 percent
of the total loans, or 966.3 billion baht (26.8 billion dollars).
Foreign banks had NPLs of 8.05 percent of the total loans.
</P>
<P>
The eight private banks in Thailand are: Bangkok Bank, Thai
Farmers Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Thai Military
Bank, Bank of Asia, Thai Danu Bank and Nakornthon Bank.
</P>
<P>
The eight state-controlled banks are: Krung Thai Bank,
Radanasin Bank, Laem Thong Bank, Union Bank, Bangkok Metropolitan
Bank, Siam City Bank, First Bangkok City Bank and Bangkok Bank of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
BOT said the banking system overall had NPLs worth 40.5 percent
of the total outstanding credit, or more than 2.25 trillion baht
(62.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks are said to have better asset quality because
their loans were focused on few business sectors, mainly financial
institutions and state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The massive jump in NPLs throughout the banking system shows
the desperate need of local institutions for new capital, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
They also estimate that up to 20 billion dollars in new capital
are required by local banks to wipe out bad debt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on August, the government has pledged up to 300 billion
baht (8.3 billion dollars) in state funds for recapitalizing local
banks in a comprehensive financial reform package.
</P>
<P>
Local institutions are required to make full provision against
projected loan-losses by the end of 2000. Banks and finance
companies unable to meet provision and capital adequacy
requirements must either seek government help or face
nationalization.
</P>
<P>
Finance companies had NPLs totaling 42.3 percent of the
outstanding credit as of October.
</P>
<P>
NPLs in the banking system, including foreign banks, totaled
37.7 percent of the total outstanding credit in September, and
60.6 percent for finance companies.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong tourist was killed
on Sunday in a road accident in Habaraduwa, southern Sri Lanka, a
newspaper here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Island reported the tourist has been identified as Peter
Carey, a 35-year-old lawyer, while his wife and five children were
admitted to the Colombo National Hospital with serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred around 5 a.m., when a private bus
collided with a van carrying the lawyer's family, police said.
</P>
<P>
Four passengers traveling in the private bus had also been
injured and admitted to Karapitiya Teaching Hospital of Galle,
south of Colombo, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police have arrested the driver of the private bus and are
conducting further investigations.
</P>
<P>
The accident rate in Sri Lanka has been soaring in recent years
and is reportedly the highest among South Asian countries. The
road accidents in 1985 were about 24,000 and in 1995 it increased
to 48,000, according to police.

<HEADLINE> More Child Abuse Cases Reported in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 208 children in
Thailand were found to have been sexually abused this year, a 50-
percent increase over the 138 cases reported last year, a report
from the Child Protection Foundation available Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Parents, step-fathers, relatives, teachers and monks were the
major offenders, said the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Of the victims 173 were girls, with their age averaged between
four and nine, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, children were raped many times in a certain
period. Some became pregnant and were expelled from school.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the abusers have not been punished.
</P>
<P>
According to the foundation, the sharp rise in cases was due to
worsening family relationships.
</P>
<P>
The number of physical abuse cases involving children also
rose, with a total of 220 assault cases being reported to the
foundation this year, against 153 cases last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 23 children were beaten to death, the report said.

<P>
The navy claimed that its attack on the logistical craft was
one of its most successful naval attacks. The craft was believed
to be on its way to India when it was attacked.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Promote New Tourism Campaign on Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists will
experience new amazement in Thailand next year as the country's
Public Health Ministry will team up with the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) to launch a campaign focusing on healthy package
tours and the use of Thai herbs.
</P>
<P>
A TAT report available Tuesday quoted Health Minister Korn
Dabbaransi as saying that "Seven Days in Thailand for Your Health"
tours would begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
The tour would encourage the use of Thai herbal drinks, healthy
food and traditional Thai massage.
</P>
<P>
The minister has discussed the idea with the Prime Minister's
Office Minister Pitak Intrawithayanunt, who oversees the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will target western tourists, especially those
business executives and credit-card users, since they are "health
conscious," according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said Thailand needs to do more to export herbal
products rather than raw materials, which bring lower returns.

PANAMA CITY, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian banana
producers on Monday said their earnings would drop by 40 percent
after the European Union's import quotas come into effect on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
In Panama's central provinces, where 960,000 crates of banana

crates.
</P>
<P>
Local producers will have to seek new markets in Mexico and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the quotas imposed on Panama and other banana
producing countries will benefit English-speaking nations from
the British Nation Community.
</P>
<P>
Panama has suggested the U.S. government put pressure on the
EU, since leading banana companies in Panama are American

<HEADLINE> Two Top KR Defected Leaders Arrive in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Defecting Khmer Rouge
leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea arrived here Tuesday with
their families by a special military helicopter from Cambodia's
gem-rich northwest city of Pailin.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter landed straight at Prime Minister Hun Sen's
Takhmau residence, about 10 km near the capital. Accompanied with
them is Ieng Sary, who defected to the government in 1996 and now
controls the semi-autonomous zone in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The two men and their families will be tightly protected by the
government security forces.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen approved Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea's
defection to the government on Friday, which was also supported by
King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Monday that he does not agree to try
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, dismissing calls for the defecting
pair to be arrested and prosecuted at an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
"If the wound does not hurt, should we poke a stick into it and
make it bleed again?" asked Hun Sen. "If we bring the pair to
prison, it could lead to renewed civil war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that his policy was in keeping with the 1991 Paris
Peace Accords signed by all factions including the Khmer Rouge.
"The Paris Peace Accords do not ask holding a trial for the Khmer
Rouge. Now we are continuing to implement the Paris Peace Accords,
" added Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"We should bury old grudges and look ahead into the 21st
century. This is the new government's policy of pacification and
national reconciliation," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
The defection left only the Khmer Rouge's one-legged general Ta
Mok in the jungles with perhaps 100 loyalists.

BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Four more countries and one

Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi in his race for the World
Trade Organization directorship, a foreign ministry official
confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official identified the five WTO members as Panama, Israel,

Their support gave weight to a recent poll showing that
Supachai was enjoying support from the majority of the WTO's 132
members.
</P>
<P>
Only about 30-40 members, including the United States and
European Union, have remained silent about who their favorite
candidate is.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Morocco's ex-trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub, Canada's ex-trade minister Roy MacLaren, and New
Zealand's former prime minister Michael Moore.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry informed that WTO officials
responsible for the contest will invite all members to show their
formal position by mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Monday that his ministry
would write to the countries and regions supporting Thailand,
asking them to continue their support during this "crucial" stage.
</P>

"We are confident our candidate can act as a good coordinator
between the developed and developing countries," the foreign
minister said.

<P>
HANOI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam planned to export 3.9
million tons of rice in 1999, Vietnam's English daily "Vietnam

</P>
<P>
The plan to this effect was included in a decision signed last

</P>
<P>
Under the decision, next year's rice exports will be divided
into two periods to ensure Vietnam's national food security.

In the first period, between January 1 and September 30, the
country will allow up to 3.24 million tons of rice to be
exported.
</P>
<P>
In September, a decision will be made regarding exports of the
remaining volume of 660,000 tons, depending on the actual amount
of rice harvested and the operations of rice exporters.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has harvested a record 31.8 million tons of rice this
year. The figure overshot the planned target by 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported an estimated 3.8 million tons of rice this
year, or about 400,000 tons more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly of Vietnam has targeted food output of 32
million tons for next year, or 200,000 tons more than this year.

<HEADLINE> Latin America's Top 10 Events in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Following is a list of
top ten major news events in Latin America in 1998, as selected
and rated by China's official Xinhua News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
1) Despite the financial crisis first originated in Asia and
later in Russia, Latin America closed the year with an economic
growth averaging 2.3 percent, thanks to the countries'joint
adoption of timely measures aimed at resisting the adverse trends
of a world slump. The growth, however, fell below 1997's 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
2) Re-elected on October 4, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso became the first head of state ever chosen for a second
term in Brazil's history. Cardoso's new term of office is seen as
highly significant in that it will guarantee the consistence of
his political and economic policies through the end of the 20th
century to the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
3) Former Chilean military leader and lifelong senator Augusto
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 in London at a Spanish
court's request for his extradition on charges that he was
responsible for the killing of a number of Spanish nationals
during his rule.
</P>
<P>
The extradition process filed against the 83-year-old former
head of state has deeply divided Chile's political life and
become an unprecedented case in the international law.
</P>
<P>
4) On October 26, Ecuador and Peru signed in Brasilia a final
peace treaty which ended a century-old border dispute between the
two nations. The pact established a precedent for a peaceful
settlement of conflicts between neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
5) Following three years of lobbying, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo's government and social activists pressured the
United States into canceling the projected Sierra Blanca nuclear
dump to be located near the US-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
6) Hurricane Mitch, one of the four most destructive storms
registered in the past hundred years, devastated at the end of
October the impoverished Central American nations of Honduras,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica, leaving more
than 9,000 people dead and nearly 10,000 injured, while over 2.5
million refugees had to be relocated. Total damage was estimated
at 6.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
7) During his state visit to Britain on October 28 to November
2, Argentine President Carlos Menem discussed pending bilateral
issues with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The trip was
believed to mark the start of a new era of cooperation between
the two countries and could lead to a possible relief of tension
in the aftermath of the 1982 war over the sovereignty of the
Malvinas (Falklands) islands.
</P>
<P>
8) Venezuelan former Lieutenant Col. Hugo Chavez won the
December 6 presidential election on a landslide victory. The
president-elect was jailed for two years in 1992 for heading a
coup to oust the then President Carlos Andres Perez. He will be
sworn in on February 2, 1999 for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
9) Argentina and Chile signed on December 15 a treaty on the
delineation of the Continental Ice Shelf, ending their last
border dispute left over by an 1881 pact. The treaty has set
another example of settling border disputes through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
10) For the first time in the past 30 years, Cubans celebrated
on December 25 their first "official" Christmas. The forced
austerity in the country did not dampen the islanders' happiness
or their belief that the current hardship would be overcome. The
Cuban government decided to remove the ban on Christmas following
Pope John Paul II's January visit.

opium in the first 15 days of the two-month massive crackdown on
drug-related criminals in the country, Vietnam news agency (VNA)

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Airline Reports Losses Due to EU's Air Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's national
carrier, the JAT airline, reported Monday that it suffered heavy
economic losses in the past year due to the European Union's air
ban.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Zika Petrovic told reporters the passenger
transport volume in 1998 was 980,000 persons, down 47 percent
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cargo transport volume amounted to 3,500 tons,
down 50 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the big slump of both the passenger and cargo
transport volumes to the EU's Vienna decision in June to ban
Yugoslavia's passenger planes from landing in EU member
countries' airports because of the latter's crackdown on
separatist-minded ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision forced JAT to cut 45 percent of the regular
flights, and 40 percent of the workforce were compelled to take
vacation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Pledges Neutrality in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) will stay neutral and maintain an equal distance with all
contestants during next June's general election, ABRI chief Gen.
Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI as a social, political and security element will stay
neutral and will not assist any election contestant," Wiranto told
reporters after a meeting with President B.J. Habibie on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He promised that ABRI would only "wear its own jacket" and
would not ally itself with any of the parties in the upcoming
election.
</P>
<P>
By adopting such a stance, ABRI gives a chance to all the
contestants to fully exercise their rights, national newspapers
Tuesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also promised that ABRI would only work to secure next
June's poll from disturbances so that contesting parties would be
able to exercise their rights fully.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the security condition in the run-up to the
1999 general election would be more conducive. "Security is needed
not only prior to the general elections but also at all time," he
added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first statement made by Wiranto concerning ABRI's
position in next year's elections. However, the Indonesian
Observer said, it remains to be seen whether or not ABRI will be
able to play a neutral role in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI had in the past made the same promise of not becoming
involved in elections, but in practice it continued to dabble.
</P>
<P>
During former president Soeharto's 32 years in power, ABRI
directly or indirectly assisted the ruling party Golkar
(Functional Group) to obtain a majority in six consecutive
elections in the period since 1972. This helped Soeharto to remain
to power.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think it is like that. Now, ABRI will really guard
its neutrality," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wiranto reported to Habibie preparations for the
coming elections along with Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid,
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs Feisal
Tandjung, Justice Minister Muladi and Minister/State Secretary
Akbar Tanjung.
</P>
<P>
Hamid told reporters that the general election planned for June
7 would likely be contested by 15 parties.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot predict, but from the 120 parties listed ... the ones
which qualify would probably not be more than 15," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamid said the president is committed to holding fair and
honest elections next year, once the election bill is approved by
the parliament next month.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Tax Evasion in Italy Eats Fiscal Revenues in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Monday that tax evasion and avoidance in Italy caused
fiscal loss equal to 12.6 percent of its gross domestic
product(GDP), about 250 trillion lire (152 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
IMF reports said that Italy's small and medium businesses
lacked in their obligations to the financial administration in
failing to report revenues which account for an estimated 58.7
percent of all potential taxable income.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said Italy had become a country with the
heaviest tax burden on back in Europe. Direct taxes levied
accounted for 12.5 percent of GDP in Europe in 1997 and for 15.9
percent of GDP in Italy.

<HEADLINE> Former NPC Deputy Applauds Rural Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's rural reform has
greatly benefited the rural population, providing a better life
for Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
"The same efforts now may have totally different results due to
the change of policies," said Wang Zuoshan, a deputy to the
National People's Congress during China's "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Wang was the head of Xiaojin Village in Baodi County in
Tianjin, about 100 kilometers from Beijing, for 18 years. The
village was famous for its revolutionary ardor during the
"Cultural Revolution."
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old former village head was unwilling to talk about
his leadership in that period, saying that he didn't catch the
good times when he served as the village head.
</P>
<P>
The old man has been preoccupied with the question why he and
the villagers worked so hard in the past, yet their toil didn't
pay off.
</P>
<P>
"We did as much as we could at that time, but our village was
much poorer than it is now," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, one laborer earned less than one yuan (0.12
U.S. dollar) a day, but that still represented the highest income
in the whole suburban areas of Tianjin. Last year, the average per
capita income in the village reached 3,800 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Our village used to be the best-equipped in the region," Wang
said. "We had eight walking tractors and one large tractor in the
past, which made other villages envious of us."
</P>
<P>
Today, farm work in the village is done by hundreds of motor
vehicles. Wheat harvesting which used to take a month can now be
finished within a week, and the village has also improved its
fields to make them invulnerable to natural disasters.

"Nowadays, most of the young people don't work in the fields
anymore, they work in the township enterprises, and some go out to
big cities to work on construction sites," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In many of China's rural areas, township enterprises
contribute a large proportion to the villagers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of the village's income comes from
agriculture now, and those who don't work in the factories are
mostly engaged in cash-crop planting and livestock breeding.
</P>
<P>
"We used to grow what we ate, but now we are focusing on the
most profitable crops," Wang said. At present, Xiaojin Village
mainly grows onion and garlic.
</P>
<P>
"We were not allowed to grow these crops in the past, they were
regarded as part of the capitalist economy. I knew that's not
right, and that's why the harder I tried to implement those
policies, the worse things became," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang's two sons are now engaged in businesses which were
criticized and forbidden under Wang's leadership in the past. The
elder son has opened a factory repairing agricultural machinery,
and the younger son owns a chicken farm.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his wife now live peacefully in their own house. They
have three children, two sons and a daughter, and the daughter is
working in the seat of Baodi County. Each month, Wang receives a
pension of 80 yuan for his past services from the County
Government.
</P>
<P>
Although living in a small village of only 600 people, Wang
keeps a close eye on the outside world. He said that reform had
made the village a part of the world, and he is intent on all the
information concerning the village.

<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) - With the birth of the euro only
three days away and the absence of London markets - closed for
Bank Holiday - European stock markets Monday continued to build on
their pre-Christmas gains.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's blue-chip Xetra DAX index rose above the 5000
points for the first time this month despite the low trading
volume before the euro currency's January 1 launch.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said enough investors were making traditional
end-of-the-year purchases for the DAX to extend its gains.
</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra DAX closed up 61.53 points, or
1.24 percent, at 5040.15 points while the floor DAX climbed 1.88
percent to 5044.77.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index closed up 0.68 points to close at 3873.10
while trading volume stood at Ffr 4.5bn. "Anyone with an order can
move this market, volumes are so thin, and most people are very
disinterested," said one trader.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen very little activity today, there are very few
people around and nobody wants to make any big move," said another
Paris dealer.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Have Drawn Up a Lunar Mining Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A team of geologists led by
Jeffrey Johnson of the US Geological Survey said that they have
worked out a map of the lunar deposits of helium-3, making the
prospect of the commercial exploitation of the Moon moving a step
closer, said the British weekly the New Scientist.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this valuable isotope of helium might become
the source of nuclear energy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The geologists said they identified three factors that
influence the concentration of the gas. The first is the age of
rock: helium-3 should be concentrated in old soils, since they
have been exposed to the solar wind for much longer. The second
factor is the type of rock: titanium-containing minerals,
principally ilmenite, are particularly effective at trapping
helium-3. The last factor is the strength of the solar wind:
places where it is strongest will accumulate more helium-3.
</P>
<P>
Based on the above three factors, the geologists have deduced
that the best places possible to find helium-3 are the Mare
Tranquillitatis and the Oceanus Procellarum on the near side of
Moon, and the Tsiolkovskiy crater and the Mare Orientale on the
far side.
</P>
<P>
According to their estimates, there is about a million tons
of helium-3 on the Moon as a whole, compared with an estimated 20
tons in the Earth's deep interior.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say a nuclear fusion reactor exploiting the fusion
of helium-3 and deuterium would generate very few neutrons. This
has the great advantage of not making the containment vessel
radioactive, as happens in a conventional tritium-deuterium fusion
reactor.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Visits Greece Over Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides left for Greece Monday afternoon to meet Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis on the future of the Russian S-300
missiles ordered by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly before his departure, Clerides said the
National Council, the top advisory body to the president on Cyprus
issue, will meet Tuesday to decide the issue after his return
from Greece.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said only a decision that can be unanimously approved
by the council "will be respected."
</P>
<P>
If not, the final decision will be made by himself, the
president of the republic, Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the surface-to-air missiles in January 1997 in a
bid to cement its air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the close ally of independence-seeking Turkish Cypriots
in Cyprus, has threatened to launch a preemptive strike on the
missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., the U.S. and Britain have also expressed opposition
to the deployment of the missiles, which they said will increase
tensions on the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also pointed out that there have been no suggestions
for a referendum on the future of the missiles, saying "a
referendum will not serve national interests."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says It Downs Enemy Warplane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced that its air
defense force has shot down an enemy warplane on Monday.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman said Monday evening that
the enemy warplane might be a U.S. one, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
No further details were given by the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said its F-16c's policing Iraq's northern no-fly zone
were fired at by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles, signalling an
escalation of confrontation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes responded with heat-seeking missiles to
destroy the Iraqi military post. Baghdad said earlier that four
soldiers were killed and seven wounded.
</P>
<P>
The INA report said the U.S. did not announce one of its
warplanes was shot down because it hoped the pilot, if survived,
could "steal out of Iraq," or that his corpse, if dead, could be
taken back "surreptitiously" by U.S. "claws."
