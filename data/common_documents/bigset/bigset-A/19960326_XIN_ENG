<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt's Monetary Policy Remains Tight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's monetary policy will
remain tight until inflation and interest rates fall to
sustainable levels, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said here today.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Tsumba, governor of the bank, said macro-economic
stability would only be realised once inflation falls.
</P>
<P>
Tsumba said despite hopes of a six percent economic growth
rate in 1996 compared with a decline of three percent last year,
inflation was still as high as 28 percent in January this year,
the highest in 36 months.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, inflation is likely to be between 20 to 23 percent
by June 1996, and should continue to fall thereafter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had hoped that the inflation would fall to
between 16 and 18 percent by June this year, a target set by the
International Monetary Fund, which suspended its aid to Zimbabwe
last year mainly due to the government's soaring budget.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal support is necessary to reduce interest rates because
the burden of ensuring price stability will be shared between the
government and the Reserve Bank," said the bank governor.

<HEADLINE> Mineral Industry Remains Mainstay of Zimbabwe's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Gold, asbestos and ferro-alloys
will remain Zimbabwe's mineral mainstays by the turn of the
century, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, prepared by the United States Department of the
Interior, said coal and nickel were also listed as the major
commodities that Zimbabwe could rely on in the medium and long
term.
</P>
<P>
However, the report warned that many of Zimbabwe's small and
marginal mineral operations would continue to be adversely
affected by poor economic picture in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"Optimism of the industry is tempered with by cash flow
problems, high interest rates, equipment failures and increased
energy costs," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has at least 50 different mineral commodities
produced from over 400 mines.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, more than half of the world's high
grade chromium ore have been found in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The country is also the world's biggest exporter of chrysotile
asbesto and a major producer of gold, ferrochrome and lithium
minerals.

<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The zimbabwean government is
working on a new program to support indigenous businessmen
wishing to enter the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Environment said the initiatives included
establishing a revolving fund to provide low interest loans to
small and medium-scale enterprises in the hotel sector, as well
as taking an affirmative stance in granting permits and licences.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry, together with the World Bank, had

<HEADLINE> NY City University Declares Crisis Over State Aid Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The City University of New York
declared Monday a state of emergency as it is facing the biggest
budget problems in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"We are in financial exigency," the university's Chancellor, W.
Ann Reyonds, told the board of trustees who had voted 11 to 1,
with one abstention, to formally declare the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis would lead to a reduction of more than 1,330
full-time faculty and staff positions, local newspapers today
quoted university officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
For many colleges, this means a cut of 10 to 15 percent of
their full-time workers and some of the departments have to be
closed or shrunk. College presidents have been told to appoint
retrenchment committees to recommend specific steps.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came when New York State proposed to cut financial
assistance to the university.
</P>
<P>
The senior colleges have a budget of more than 900 million U.S.
dollars, of which 500 million comes from the state. The state's
proposed budget calls for a 57 million dollar, or more than 10
percent, reduction in aid to the university. Added with the
increased expenses like contractual pay raises and energy costs,
the university is facing a budget gap of 96.3 million dollars, The
New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
The university officials also complained that because 40
percent of its students come from low income households, the
university was limited in raising tuition. Moreover, according to
the govenor's budget plan, it will also lose 50 million dollars
of tuition aid from the state.

<HEADLINE> Experts Rule Out Locust Outbreak In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Experts today ruled out an
immediate outbreak in Zimbabwe of locusts, which is destroying
crops in other parts of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect any outbreak of locusts until after June,
and this means wheat crop is unlikely to be affected," said Simon
Sithole, an agricultural expert in the Plant Protection Research
Institute of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
They said the plague, which is spreading in Mozambique,
Malawi, Angola and parts of Zambia, is unlikely to invade
zimbabwe until this winter, said researchers in the Plant
Protection Research Institute of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
And the current crops would be safe and efforts were being
made to ensure the reported outbreaks did not spread to zimbabwe,
where most of the crops planted this season were near maturity
stage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malawi agricultural officials last week reported
that a plague of locusts had invaded the country from Mozambique
following heavy rains, and that spraying of insecticides was said
to be underway.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, reports say several farms of maize and sorghum in
southern provinces were completely destroyed by locusts as
farmers could not procure pesticides in time.

MAPUTO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The actual unemployment rate has
reached a new high of being over 50 percent in Mozambique, taking
refugees and the retired soldiers into account, said a report
released here today by the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier statistics showed that a number of 10,6000 people are
unemployed, accounting for 7.2 percent of the total number of the
employees in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor Ministry report noted today that this
number excluded the refugees and the disbanded soldiers of the
armed forces, saying that if taking these people into account,
the unemployment rate should actually be as high as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the unemployed people, it pointed out, female Mozambicans
account for 20.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the group of young people aged from 18 to 25, constitutes
37 percent, said the report.

LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
told parliament this afternoon that he would study carefully the
recommendations made by the National Farmers Union (NFU) over the
crisis of BSE, known as mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister stressed once again that science did not
recommend the slaughter of old cattle on health grounds.
</P>
<P>
Since last Wednesday, Britain has been haunted by the news of
potential link between Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and
its deadly human form Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
Britain's beef industry has been severely hit as the European
Commission decided Monday to impose a total ban on British beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
Now Britain is also facing a sharp decline in domestic beef
consumption for its beef and a worldwide boycott as well.
</P>
<P>
Amid collapsing consumer confidence, the NFU called for the
immediate destruction of older cows.
</P>
<P>
NFU president Sir David Naish said the steps announced by the
government so far had failed to restore the public confidence.
</P>
<P>
He argued, "The events of the past week showed that we have
gone beyond the stage of relying solely on science."
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, extra police are being moved
into position along the border between Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic to stop Ulster farmers trying to smuggle cattle
into the Irish Republic.

JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's would-be
free trade agreement with the European Union (EU) topped the
agenda of the talks between President Nelson Mandela and visiting
Irish President Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure your contribution will be of more assistance to
South Africa," said Mandela, referring to the fact that Robinson

Speaking after signing a Memorandum of Understanding on

noting that the bilateral trade imbalance was in favor of
Ireland, said he was confident that the gap could soon be closed.

It is estimated that South Africa's imports from Ireland was
132 million U.S. dollars in 1995, with only 53 million Dollars of
South African goods exported to Ireland.

Irish Minister of State, Jim Higgins, said it was a "happy

<HEADLINE> China: Right to Development Should Not Be Neglected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate said here today
that economic, social and cultural rights and the right to
development should not be neglected at the debates of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights which is now in its six-week annual
session here.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jun, an alternate representative of the Chinese
delegation, told today's meeting that human rights mean not only
the full enjoyment of civil and political rights, but also each
individual's full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural
rights, and the full realization of the right to development of
his country and people.
</P>
<P>
"Economic, social and cultural rights and the right to
development are by comparison even more closely linked with
people's daily life, and are of even more practical significance.
If the economic, social and cultural rights are not guaranteed,
the enjoyment of civil and political rights will remain empty
words," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, as well
as the realization of the right to development are therefore of
great importance for the better enjoyment of all human rights, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang pointed out that due to the influence of a small
number of countries, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights has for
some time neglected an important integral part of its mandate, and
has not been able to play its due role in the promotion of the
right to development and the protection of economic, social and
cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Zhang noted, out of the 33 special rapporteurs
appointed by the commission, only one deals with economic, social
and cultural rights. Of the 93 resolutions adopted at the
commission's session last year, only seven were directly related
to economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that a few countries which claim to be
"human rights defenders" talk glibly on some agenda items, but
refuse to recognize the right to development as a basic human
right, and actively water down consideration by the commission of
the items on economic, social and cultural rights and the right to
development.
</P>
<P>
"This abnormal phenomenon should not be allowed to continue,"
Zhang said. He appealed to the commission to "correct this
erroneous tendency and treat in a fair and equal manner the right
to development as well as the economic, social and cultural
rights."
</P>
<P>
Zhang also said that China supports the establishment of a new
mechanism in the commission to deal specially with the
implementation of the right to development.
</P>
<P>
The new mechanism "should focus on removing the international
obstacles encountered by the developing countries and play a
coordinating role in international economic and political
relations," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Visits Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Likud Party Leader Benyamin
Netanyahu arrived in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba today to discuss
with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan the latest developments in the
region and the peace process following a spate of suicide bombings
in Israel last month.
</P>
<P>
This was his second visit to the kingdom since the two
countries signed the peace treaty in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is a strong challenger to Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres in May 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher told reporters in his
Monday's press briefing that the visit of the Israeli opposition
party leader was part of Jordan's efforts to be closely informed
on developments in the Israeli political scene.
</P>
<P>
"It was only natural for Mr. Netanyahu to visit Jordan because
we are in contact with all Israeli political spectrum to
familiarize ourselves with what is happening in the Israeli arena
and not to be surprised by any developments." Muasher said.
</P>
<P>
Muasher, who was Jordan's first ambassador to Israel before he
was named as information minister in the new government early last
month, affirmed that Likud was not the only party that Jordan was
in touch with among Israeli political parties, but he declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He added the visit, upon an invitation from the Jordanian
price, is aimed at "an exchange of views on various issues" and
that "it has no other bearing whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
There is an overwhelming across-the-board support among Israeli
political parties for the peace treaty with Jordan, and Netanyahu
has reaffirmed in public comments his support for close
Israeli-Jordanian economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel had made frequent contacts in the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli delegation representing the judiciary and headed by
Ahron Barak, head of the Israeli Supreme Court, visited the Kingdom
last week and was received by Crown Prince Hassan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Abdul Karim al Doughmi, in Monday's press
briefing held by Information Minister Marwan Muasher, described
the Israeli judiciary team's visit as "simply technical."
</P>
<P>
Doughmi also denied reports that Jordan and Israel had reached
an extradition agreement during the team's visit.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, Israel's minister at the Prime Minister's Office,
who also is in charge of the country's peace process, visited
Jordan Monday and discussed with Crown Prince Hassan and Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti the latest developments in the
region and the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the Crown Prince called on Israel to lift
its one-month-old blockade of the Palestinian territories imposed
after a wave of suicide bomings last month which killed dozens of
people in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Likely to Have Impact on UK Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The growing public concern over
the safety of beef and a possible link with mad cow disease could
eventually cause serious impact on the British economy, City
economists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The City was Monday night predicting an increase of up to 1.5
billion pounds (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) a year in the trade gap
following Europe's ban on beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said exports of 590 million pounds (896 million U.S.
dollars) a year could be wiped out by the international reaction
to the scare and retailers were likely to switch to imported beef.
</P>
<P>
Economists were still not ruling out the possibility that the
government would eventually have to order the slaughter of all 11
million beef and dairy cattle.
</P>
<P>
They said this "nightmare scenario" would slash growth, push up
inflation, possibly force the introduction of milk rationing, and
might eliminate all chances of tax cuts in the November budget.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious impact would be on the public finance, where
the cost of compensating farmers alone would be 10 billion pounds
(15.2 billion U.S. dollars), economists said.
</P>
<P>
The government will still probably have to foot the bill for
subsidies to help farmers rebuild their businesses and for the
long-term costs of unemployment in the food processing and dairy
industries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the total costs could add up to a maximum of
20 billion pounds (30.4 billion U.S. dollars) on the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR), perhaps spread over a number of
years.
</P>
<P>
The PSBR in the current financial year already looks set to
exceed 30 billion pounds (45.6 billion U.S. dollars), and the City
was already having doubts about the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
ability to deliver big pre-election tax cuts even before last
week's revelations about the disease.
</P>
<P>
What's more, killing every head of cattle would also magnify
the impact of the ban on beef exports, since it would mean
importing vast quantities of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Allowing for the loss of all exports of milk and dairy products
and assuming a one-for-one switch to imports, the trade deficit
would swell by a further 6 billion pounds (9.1 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Britain currently imports virtually no fresh milk, yet consumes
around 200 million pints a week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that it would not be feasible to import such
high quantities, and that the shortages would lead to sharply
higher prices. A doubling of prices would add 1.5 points to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The government would then be faced with an uncomfortable
choice. Either it could see inflation breach its 2.5 percent
target or it could increase the cost to public borrowing by huge
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, higher imports and lower domestic
production would also affect economic growth. Economists believe
this could amount to one percentage point off Gross Domestic
Product.

Before his trip to Damascus, Bush had visited the six oil-rich
Gulf countries as part of the activities on celebrating the fifth
anniversary of the end to the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz said Monday "it is
undoubted that his visit is important since it proves the (U.S.)
concern for Lebanon, and proves a possibility of a (U.S.)
president or an official to visit Lebanon without a fear of his
security."
</P>
<P>
Washington still refuses to lift the ban on American
citizens' travel to Lebanon on the ground that the security
of U.S. interests in this country can not be efficiently
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government imposed the travel ban in 1985, following a
series of terrorist attacks at Americans, including kidnaping,
killing and hijacking planes, by radical Lebanese and
Palestinian militant groups in the darkest days of the Lebanese
civil war.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Bush served as vice president in President Ronald
Reagon's administration. Bush visited Beirut in 1983 in his
capacity of vice president.
</P>
<P>
A few days after the visit, a large van loaded with
explosives rushed into the U.S. embassy in Ras Beirut and
exploded, killing 62 people, including the Central Intelligence
Agency's chief Middle East analyst, Robert Ames, and other 16
Americans.
</P>
<P>
Six months later, 241 U.S. marines were blown away by another
suicide bomber, thereby making 1983 the most disastrous year for
the United States in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was apparently not a coincidence when a Beirut military
court of appeals ordered Monday the trial of 15 militants
accused of engineering the 1983 suicide car bombing of the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
The five-men tribunal overtuned a verdict by a lower
military court in 1993 that ruled the deadly bombing was
covered by an amnesty order issued in 1991 for crimes committed
during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
"The amnesty law clearly and specifically excludes murder
crimes against foreign diplomats and diplomatic targets," the
higher court's verdict stated.
</P>
<P>
All of the 15 Lebanese, Palestinians and Egyptians who were
released in 1993 are to be re-tried at a date to be set soon,
arrest warrants will be issued for their re-arrest at once, and
those remain at large will be tried in absentia, according to the
Monday verdict.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Coordinate Initiatives on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today that the Russian government
intends to call on the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council to coordinate efforts to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at his daily press briefing that Russia
intends to raise the issue of coordination among the "big five" on
the Cyprus problem at their informal meeting in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides stressed that everybody agreed that all attempts
to settle the Cyprus issue should be under the auspices of the
U.N. Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided in 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the
U.N.-sponsored peace efforts for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that "we consider the involvement of the
permanent five and the European Union (EU) in Cyprus as their
response to Ghali's call for assistance to push his good offices
mission out of the current deadlock."
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council in May 1994, the
U.N. Secretary-General called on all concerned "to undertake a
fundamental and far-reaching reflection on how to approach the
Cyprus problem in a manner that will yield results."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said the permanent five members of the Security
Council, which includes Russia, the U.S., Britain, France and
China, and EU members themselves have shown their political will
to be part of the U.N. chief's good office mission.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Likely to Take Part in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb leader
indicated today that Radovan Karadzic was likely to take part in
the forthcoming elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Kolievic, who is currently
visiting the northern Greek city of Salonika, told reporters there
that the leadership of the "Serb Republic" is making efforts for
Karadzic to participate in the elections, despite the fact that
the Serb leader has been indicted as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Kolievic also referred to efforts by
Russia to have Karadzic acquitted of all charges, saying "someone
who has not been convicted of war crimes cannot be left out of the
elections."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged however that the European Union and the United
States are exerting pressure to prevent Karadzic from taking part
in the elections, scheduled for August.
</P>
<P>
Kolievic said that the Bosnian Serb leadership "began our
struggle together and will end it together." Efforts are being
made "abroad" to split the leadership and promote "certain
candidates" prior to elections, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Sends Message to Greek Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz today sent a message to his Greek counterpart, Costas
Simitis, urging a comprehensive peaceful settlement of
Greek-Turkish differences.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Turkish Ambassador in Athens
Umit Pamir during a 25-minute meeting with Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Pamir outlined Yilmaz's positions
expressed during a press conference last Sunday, and reiterated
Yilmaz's invitation to Simitis to visit Ankara.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Yilmaz called for a comprehensive
peaceful settlement of Greek-Turkish differences, and said that
his country respected Greece's territorial integrity and desired
the application of international agreements in the resolution of
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Simitis reportedly told the Turkish envoy that Greece "desires
good relations with Turkey" and called on Ankara to "help
decisively in this direction."
</P>
<P>
Simitis also asked Turkey to accept the text on "common
positions" agreed by the 15 EU member states Monday in Brussels,
which calls for renunciation of the use of threat or use of
violence, respect for the principle of sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and respect for international law and treaties and the
relevant international practice.
</P>
<P>
The refusal of the text by Turkey resulted in the postponement
of a Turkey-EU Association council meeting scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said later that
the Greek and Turkish premiers could not meet "under the present
conditions."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said upon
returning to Athens from Brussels that "there will be no smooth
course for the EU-Turkey Customs Association as long as Turkey
continues to put forward claims and dispute the treaties which
establish our sovereignty in the Aegean."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected a dialogue with Turkey on issues touching
on Greek sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"If Turkey believes that certain borders are not to its liking,
it should have recourse to the International Court of Justice and
let it decide," Pangalos said.
</P>
<P>
Greece has vowed to veto any EU aid to Turkey following the
recent Imia crisis in the Aegean before Turkey renounces the
threat of use of force in its dispute with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Foreign Debt Reaches 129.4 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign debt reached 129.4
billion U.S. dollars as of early this year and has increased by
4.6 times over the last 10 years, a high-ranking Russian official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Director of the Economic
Analysis Institute Andrei Illarionov said that the debt total
means that every Russian shares about 800 dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
The long-term debt totals 80.6 billion dollars, and the
short-term debt comes to 12.8 billion, the director said.
Russia's debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is 9
billion dollars, while to other former Soviet republics it stands
at 27 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overdue payments on the foreign debt amounted to 31.4 billion
as of late 1995, Illarionov added.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, Russia appeared to be bankrupt. However, its debt
is being restructured and postponed for several political and
other reasons," he pointed out, adding: "Currently, we are trying
to resolve our several short-term problems by creating long-term
ones."
</P>
<P>
According to experts here, the volume of accumulated direct
private investments in Russia in 1986-1995 totalled only 4.3
billion dollars, whereas the volume of the IMF credit was 6.5
billion dollars by December 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is the single country in the world where the volume of
accumulated foreign investments appeared to be less than the
volumes of credits granted by the IMF," Illarionov noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy of foreign borrowings pursued by the
Russian government over the last few months greatly remains one of
the feverish campaign on accumulating foreign debt which former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was pursuing during his last
years in power.
</P>
<P>
"New credits are being taken without any notion as to where and
how the country will remit them," the director added.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to settle the foreign debt even by exchanging
it for shares of state-run enterprises as was done in Mexico,
Argentina and Brazil, the experts opined.
</P>
<P>
"Corporatization of all shares of the Russian companies will
help to collect a sum of money which will not exceed 30 billion
dollars, or one-fourth of Russia's total foreign debt," Illaionov
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Minister for Cooperation with CIS (the
Commonwealth of Independent States) Countries Valery Serov told a
news briefing that other CIS member countries owe Russia some 9
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the overall debts consist of outstanding payments
for state loans, for the past supplies of Russian energy resources
and for deliveries to economic entities within the CIS.

<HEADLINE> CIS Military Chiefs Discuss Collective Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A meeting on military cooperation
in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) opened here today,
focusing on the formation of a CIS collective security system,
according to Defense Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the one-day conference will define the main
sources of a military danger and the factors which can develop the
danger into a direct military threat to the CIS states.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the meeting attended by defense
ministers from 12 CIS member states, Russian Deputy Defense
Minister Andrei Kokoshin said that a plan for implementing the
concept of CIS collective security would be fully prepared by a
special working group by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister also said a full-scale theory of CIS
collective security has to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
"The present idea of collective security reflects a level of
relations between the states and their armed forces which rules
out aggression and attempts at settling political and other
disputes by means of war, armed conflicts or the threat of the use
of force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been eager to enforce the CIS collective security
system in recent two years, while the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization has made efforts to realize its eastward expansion
plan.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Adopts Stopgap Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
adopted a 50-day stopgap budget of 11,621.5 billion yen (about 116
billion U.S. dollars) to keep the government going in the absence
of a full budget for fiscal 1996 beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior members of the House of Representatives
Budget Committee agreed to vote Wednesday on the emergency budget
program necessitated by a three-week blockade of the committee's
room by opposition party lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came a day after the ruling coalition and
opposition leaders agreed Monday to end the Diet stalemate and
resume debate over the fiscal 1996 state budget that includes an
allocation of 685 billion yen (6.85 billion dollars) to help
liquidate seven failed housing-loan companies or "jusen," now at
the center of Japan's banking mess.
</P>
<P>
The stopgap budget, for April 1 through May 20, includes
2,991.5 billion yen (30 billion dollars) in public works spending,
or 31.1 percent of the outlays set aside for public works in the
main fiscal 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
The large public works expenditures stem from the concern that
the protracted Diet deadlock over the government's "jusen" scheme
could have an adverse impact on the budding economic recovery,
government officials said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Invites International Tenders for Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- International tenders for a
major canal project in Pakistan were opened today in Lahore,
capital of Punjab province, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The tenders were opened by a high level committee headed by a
member of the country's Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA), Khalid Mohtadullah.
</P>
<P>
A total of six pre-qualified companies from China, the Republic
of Korea, the United States, Turkey and Pakistan bid for the
contract.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohtadullah, the lowest bid was 5.720 billion
rupees (about 168 million US dollars) offered by the TEKSER
Construction of Turkey while the second lowest was 6.227 billion
rupees (about 183 million US dollars) offered by a Chinese firm.
</P>
<P>
However, the lowest bid was not accompanied by a formal
procedure of bank guarantee and, therefore, it has been referred
to the legal department of the WAPDA for closer scrutiny before
the final decision is made, he said.
</P>
<P>
All the bids will be evaluated and scrutinized to meet the
tender requirements before the contract was awarded to the
successful bidder with the approval of the donor agencies, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
Mohtadullah said 65 percent of the cost of the project is to be
funded by the Asian Development Bank, 21 percent by Germany and 14
percent by the WAPDA.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an estimated cost of 6 billion rupees (about
176 million US dollars), covers 94 miles of the third and final
stage of the 170-mile Chashma Right Bank Canal (CRBC).
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to be completed by 2000, the inter-provincial project
will ensure irrigation supplies on a perennial basis to 236,000
acres of land in Northwest Frontier and Punjab provinces.
</P>
<P>
The first (52 miles) and second (24 miles) stages of the CRBC
project have been in operation since January 1987 and December
1993 respectively, providing irrigation supplies to 236,000 acres
of cultivable land in Northwest Frontier province.

<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here today issued instructions that the sending of Indonesian
workers abroad should not trigger problems which could blemish the
country's image.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at the opening of the "national
coordination meeting on the export of workers." The meeting aims
to formulate strategies and policies that deal with the growing
number of laborers sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto pointed out that "although Indonesia
benefits from its overseas contract workers, the program has also
caused various problems that require thorough consideration."
</P>
<P>
He reminded related departments to pay attention to the
negative impacts caused by the unskilled laborers abroad.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has since three years ago been sending workers abroad
in a bid to alleviate the problem of unemployment in the country.
The government policy states that only skilled workers can be sent
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government expects to send 2.5 million workers
abroad by the year 2000 and to earn 12.5 billion US dollars in
foreign exchange annually, said Manpower Minister Latief.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japan Trade Links Level, Economic Conference Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China has transformed a massive
trade deficit with Japan into a level pegging cross trade link, an
economic conference has been told.
</P>
<P>
The tenth round of the Sino-Japan economic and trade
consultative conference has closed in Kunming, capital city of
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Sino-Japan economic and trade
coordination committee of China, and the Japan-China trade
expansion agreement committee of Japan ten years ago, a
consultative conference has been held either in China or in Japan,
negotiating and solving problems in Sino-Japan trade development,
every year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1986, the trade volume between China
and Japan was only 17.21 billion US dollars, with China's trade
deficit hitting 7.65 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
But in 1995, the trade volume reached 57.46 billion US
dollars, and a balanced trade development was almost achieved
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Members from both sides agreed that the further development of
economic and trade relations between China and Japan will be
beneficial not only to the two countries, but also to the economic
development of the Asia-Pacific region, and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
They also said that they will continue to cooperate with each
other, and push forward bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Uncover Secret Hamas Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian police have
uncovered a secret network within Izzadin Kassam, military wing
of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Mohammed Dahlan, head of the Palestinian
Preventive Security in the Gaza Strip, as saying that the network
was dedicated to attacking Israel and weakening the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Dahlan noted that the secret cells of military groups were
more dangerous than individual fugitive, like Mohammed Dief, a
top leader of Izzadin Kassam.
</P>
<P>
He said most members of the secret network were unknown, and
some of them had the permissions to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, beyond saying some members of the network had
assassinated Palestinian policemen, Dahlan would not go into
details until the investigations are concluded.
</P>
<P>
He added that Palestinian police have arrested all but two
heads of the Hamas military wing, but he could not rule out
further attacks against Israel targets.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel
since February 25, which left more than 60 dead and over 150
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been pressing the PNA to crack down on extremist
military groups operating inside the Palestinian autonomous areas,
saying the closure would continue until all heads of military
groups are caught.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teams in Hong Kong for Rugby 10s International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A rugby team from China became
a big news for Hong Kong sports here today as the team from the
Sports Institute of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) arrived for
the Carlsberg Cup Rugby Tens International starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The team is the first ever from the Guangzhou-based PLA Sports
Institute to visit Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Major General Bryan Dutton, commander of the British Forces in
Hong Kong, described the visit as "of historical significance,"
considering the fact that a special PLA unit is to be stationed in
Hong Kong after the transition of sovereignty in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The PLA team has won the second place in the national
university league for the past two years. Colonel Liu Guangmiao,
the team's manager and deputy director of the Institute, said his
team aims at learning from others and fostering friendship with
the Hong Kong rugby circles.
</P>
<P>
The team is thought one of the toughest sides for the 32-team
Hong Kong event which is celebrating this year the 10th
anniversary of the inaugural Hong Kong Ten-a-side International.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union said they were
surprised of the physics of the Chinese army players. "They are
really big-sized and tough," said George Simpkin, technical
supervisor of the Union.
</P>
<P>
"They will be one of the strongest sides at this year's 10s
event," he said.
</P>
<P>
Joining in the PLA team is a team from the China Agricultural
University based in Beijing. Pioneer of the sport in China, the
collegiate side has been the national champion ever since it was
established late in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Cao Xihuang, a professor in the University, said that the sport
is comparatively new in China and Chinese players have much to
learn.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be here again," he said, referring to his team's
appearance at last year's 10s International here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese teams will remain here after the two-day 10s event,
so as to watch the following Carlsberg Cup Hong Kong Seven-a-side
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that most of the 32 teams for the 10s event
have arrived.
</P>
<P>
The teams are pooled into eight groups of four for the
preliminaries. The groups' top teams enter the Cup competition,
the second-placed teams are to compete in the Plate event while
the third placers enter the Bowl competitions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Davetalevu from Fiji won the Cup, Australia's
Cairns Marlins took the Plate and Usk team from Wales settled for
the Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Plunged in Diplomatic Flare-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has confirmed that it had
expelled an Iraqi diplomat last week for his "activities
non-compatible with his diplomatic status," while Baghdad ordered
the expulsion of an administrator at Jordan's embassy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher, while addressing a weekly
press briefing here Monday, said Jordan had ordered the assistant
press attache at the Iraqi Embassy in Amman to leave the kingdom
for his involvement in "activities non-compatible with his
diplomatic status," the local daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said the expelled Iraqi diplomat, Hussein Faraj Khalif,
has already left Jordan, while Raed Hamouri, administrator at the
Jordanian Embassy in Baghdad who was ordered to leave in apparent
retaliation by the Iraqi regime, has not arrived back in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The information minister declined to elaborate on how the Iraqi
attache had violated his diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
Playing down suggestions that the expulsion would further
strain the ties between Jordan and Iraq, the minister said, "We
should not give the matter more attentions than it deserves. This
happens between countries."
</P>
<P>
The diplomat flare-up was the latest twist to Jordanian-Iraqi
political relations which have been deteriorating in the wake of
Jordan's criticism of policies of the Baghdad regime and calls for
an end to the sufferings of the Iraqi people resulting from those
policies.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Jordan expelled an Iraqi diplomat
and the second time in five months that the kingdom expelled a
foreign diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In November, the government declared an Iranian diplomat
persona non grata for "activities incompatible with his diplomatic
status." Tehran retaliated by expelling a Jordanian administrator
at the kingdom's embassy in the Iranian capital.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Iraqi political ties plunged sharply after the
kingdom offered shelter to Hussein Kamal and his brother Saddam
Kamal, both sons-in-law of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and
their families following their defection to Jordan in August last
year.
</P>
<P>
The gap was widened when Hussein Kamal, at his first and the
only public press conference during his half-a-year stay in Amman,
called for the overthrow of the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
Iraq described Jordan's criticism of its internal and external
policies as interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Last week, another Iraqi defector, former chief of staff
Lieutenant General Nizar Kazaji, arrived in Jordan and was granted
a permission "to stay for two months."
</P>
<P>
In the last six months, Jordan intercepted four Iraqi-bound
shipments of spare parts, material and equipment that the kingdom
found to be in violation of the U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strain in political ties, Jordan and Iraq are
maintaining trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is getting its full needs of oil from Iraq under an
exemption granted by the U.N. Sanctions Committee and is sending
food and medicine to Iraq in partial settlement of the oil bill.
</P>
<P>
Amman reduced exports to Iraq covered under a formal trade
accord for fiscal year 1996 to 220 million U.S. dollars from 400
million dollars in a move that Jordanian officials said was purely
prompted by economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said in Monday's press briefings that his government
has no role whatsoever in Sunday's parliamentary elections in Iraq
and noted that the polls were Iraq's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
The minister also affirmed that Jordan had no plan to host a
"camp for Iraqi refugees" as was reported last week.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Sees Return of Singapore Interests (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore investors' interests in
the Philippines are slowly reviving one year after the hanging of
a Filipino maid in Singapore on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Senior executives of Schroder Asia-Pacific Regional Advisory
Group, a leading international investment bank and fund manager,
are scheduled to come here next week to check out business
opportunities for their Singapore clients.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to meet Philippine companies involved in the
manufacture and distribution of food equipment, including Allied
Metals, Food Technology International and Asia Stainless Quality
Equipment.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Philippine Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) said today that Singapore investors' interest has
picked up but not in the same magnitude as before.
</P>
<P>
"In time, we hope that the situation will improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over last year's execution of the Filipino maid
strained the diplomatic relations between the two countries and
has affected economic ties as well.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the diplomatic row, the Singapore government
shelved Manila's request to open Singapore's market to chicken,
fish, meat and other meat products.
</P>
<P>
DTI officials said that Singapore "postponed indefinitely" its
plan to send a team of experts to assess health standards in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The assessment is a prerequisite for the Philippines to be duly
accredited as an exporting country of poultry and meat products.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is a major trading partner of the Philippines and an
important source of investments in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, trade volume between the two countries totalled 2.1
billion US dollars while Singapore's investments in the
Philippines amounted to 4.2 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Return to One-China Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Public figures in Taiwan have
called on some Taiwan leaders to return to the "one-China" stand,
and end the state of hostility across the Taiwan Straits at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
They also want to see the speedy realization of direct
across-straits mail services, trade, air and shipping services.
</P>
<P>
At a forum held recently, Wei Yong said that the current
tension in the Taiwan Straits has been caused by problems cropping
up in the policies of Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Lee Teng-hui understands the
reality, and reiterates the "one-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yu-shan, a professor with Politics University, urged that
Lee Teng-hui should follow the road of adhering to "one-China" in
the interests of 21 million Taiwan residents, and take specific
action to achieve direct across-straits exchanges of mail
services, trade, air and shipping services, and hold negotiations
to this end.
</P>
<P>
Yang Kai-huang, a professor with Soochow University, said that
the Chinese Communist Party demanded that Lee Teng-hui should
return to the "one-China" stand not only in words, but also in
actions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that if Lee fails to commit himself to the
"one-China" principle, it is unlikely that any breakthrough will
be made in across-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan business people and manufacturers have expressed the
wish to improve across-straits relations, and realize direct
exchanges of mail services, trade and air and shipping services.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yong-Zai, general manager of the Taiwan Plastics Company,
said that people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"If Taiwan declared independence," this would be a matter
concerning the safety of 21 million Taiwan residents, he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Lee Teng-hui's current primary task should
be to "relax strained relations across the straits," "to state
resolutely and explicitly the stand that Taiwan will not seek
independence", and "then to improve across-straits economic and
trade relations" through various channels and forms.
</P>
<P>
Wang's view is shared by Fei Jing-han, chairman of the Taiwan
"China Economics Research Institute."
</P>
<P>
Fei expressed the view that as the first step, Lee Teng-hui
should reiterate that his stand to seek reunification remains
unchanged and that he sticks to the reunification line.

TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Choe Gyong-Sop and Kim Song-Hui,
both from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have secured
the Olympic berths after finishing atop at the first stage group
competitions of the Asian zone table tennis qualifying round for
the Atlanta Games in Chiba on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Choe, Kim and Li Gun-Sang, the world best defensive player,
were the members of the 1990 Beijing Asian Games silver medalist

</P>
<P>
The top finishers of the eight first-stage groups advance to
the 1-8 place play-off in the second stage and top seven final
finishers qualify for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
There are three Chinese and two South Koreans in the men's top
eight, and three Chinese, two Japanese and two South Koreans in
the women's. Only one of them each are able to go to Atlanta as
they have already secured two seats apiece earlier.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea, which had not booked any berth before the Chiba
meet, will definitely have Choe and Kim in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Holds Talks with Visiting UN Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali today echoed Chinese Premier
Li Peng that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese Territory.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, speaking in Beijing, said that the Taiwan issue is a
matter of principle which should be defended.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came at a meeting in China's capital at which the
Chinese Premier pledged continued Chinese support for, and
participation in, the UN's efforts in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Ghali at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Li
said that China has always paid attention to the role of the UN in
international affairs, and is willing to give continued support
"in an active and pragmatic manner."
</P>
<P>
Calling the UN chief "an old friend of the Chinese people," Li
said he felt very happy to have "candid and friendly" talks with
him.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the UN chief for his standpoint over the issue of
Taiwan, and outlined the principled stand of "one China", and the
policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" of
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said that the Taiwan issue is "a matter of principle,"
which should be defended.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory and
this has been affirmed by the UN, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"I am safeguarding the principle of the UN," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the UN chief on the recently-held Asia-Europe
Meeting in Bangkok, saying that it was "very successful,"
reflecting the multi-polarization trends of the present world.
</P>
<P>
"It was the first such meeting in history at which Asian and
European countries were sitting together as equal partners," Li
said. The meeting had two distinctions, he added.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, all the participants were seeking common ground
while shelving their differences, and avoiding provoking
disagreements and disputes.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, economic, trade and technological cooperation were
the main topics, aiming at forging closer mutually-beneficial ties
between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Asia has an enormous market, while Europe has
great technological and capital potential. Their trans-continental
cooperation will be a great contribution to world peace and
stability, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said the Asia-Europe Meeting was a very important event,
and was supported and welcomed by the UN.
</P>
<P>
The UN is going to pay more attention to international economic
cooperation, which is one of the aims of the international body,
he said.
</P>
<P>
There will be no peace if there is no development, and peace
and development are inter-dependent, the UN chief said, hoping
China would give more support in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed with him, saying peace and development remain the two
major problems facing the world.
</P>
<P>
"As the most broadly-based, and the most representative
international body, the UN should, under the guidance of its
Charter and purposes, play its distinctive role in international
affairs, especially in helping developing countries to eradicate
poverty and to develop, thus meeting the expectations of people
all over the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The functions of the UN cannot be substituted by those of any
other international organization," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Li also praised Boutros-Ghali for his unremitting efforts, over
the past four years of his tenure, to settling problems concerning
peace and development, in a complicated and changing world
situation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on the circumstances in
Africa, and agreed that more help should be rendered to the people
there.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief gave Li a book entitled "The UN and its Promotion
of the Social Status of Women" as a present.
</P>
<P>
He said the UN will publish more books in Chinese, and make
public China's contributions to the international body.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed thanks, and in return presented the UN chief a
gift, the two-volume "Treasured Paintings of Zhongnanhai."

<HEADLINE> EC Commissioner Issues Open Letter on Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A European Commission (EC)
official today called for strong cooperation and dialogue among
European Union (EU) bodies for the protection of wild birds.
</P>
<P>
Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard made the appeal in an
open letter responding to several thousand letters from European
citizens, mainly in France and the United Kingdom, who were
concerned over the hunting season for migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
Among some EU countries, the question of when and how to
determine the end of the hunting season is a highly controversial
one.
</P>
<P>
Some argue that the hunting season for migratory birds should
end no later than January 30, while others are in support of a
more flexible solution.
</P>
<P>
"A good and democratic solution will only be found if we
establish strong cooperation and dialogue between the three
European institutions involved: the Commission, the European
Parliament and the Council," Mrs. Bjerregaard said in the
letter.

<HEADLINE> Japan Needs to Boost Sino-Japanese Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An influential Japanese trade
organization said today that Japan should strengthen its economic
and trade cooperation with China, especially in the fields of
agriculture, transport, energy, communication and environment.
</P>
<P>
Ywao Nakada, chairman of the Japanese Association for the
Promotion of International Trade, made the remarks when he was
outlining the association's policy and plan for 1996 at a plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
He said the association will encourage Japanese businesses to
invest in China so as to push bilateral economic and trade
relations to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
While Japan needs to expand the imports from China, especially
the key products of petroleum, food and fibre, it should encourage
the imports of new Chinese products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ywao believed that as China is shifting its economic emphasis
to its western regions, Japanese enterprises should also increase
their investment there.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the association further strengthen the studies
of China's investment climate, hold more business talks, furnish
its members with more information about the Chinese economy, and
train more specialized personnel for Japanese businesses investing
in China.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Approves U.N. Sea Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet today approved
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and submitted
the treaty and eight related proposals to the Diet (parliament)
for ratification, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also called for negotiations with China and South
Korea over revising fishing operations agreements in the seas near
a handful of disputed islands while avoiding direct mention of
conflicting claims of the islands, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling three party leaders has called on the government
to seek an agreement by the end of the year with China and South
Korea on revising the fishing agreement.
</P>
<P>
The three-party leaders has called on the government to apply
the exclusive economic zone on its entirety within a year, if no
agreement is reached with the two neighboring countries by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a fisheries official said Japan would give priority
to fishing operations over territorial disputes in the future
application of the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone under
the U.N. convention.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said Japan should permit South Korea and
other countries with which it has territorial disputes to engage
in fishing operations in its 200-nautical-mile zone and then
settle the disagreements through bilateral negotiations, according
to the Kyodo report.

MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- France has promised to support the
Philippines in its trade dispute with the European Union (EU),
Philippine Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said
today.
</P>
<P>
Among Manila's concerns are the EU's proposed ban on Philippine
seaweed, the country's export credit rating and alleged dumping of
Philippine-made disposable lighters.
</P>
<P>
According to Bautista, French Undersecretary for External
Economic Relations Jean-Pierre Landau said last week that France
shared Manila's concerns and would work for their early
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine seaweed was reclassified as a non-toxic food
additive by two UN agencies last year, which counters the EU's
moves to ban its import.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin-Brundtland Talks Focus on NATO, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland today in
Oslo to discuss NATO enlargement, environment and the Chechen
conflict, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration signed during the talks, the two leaders
agreed to set up an international fund to clear up nuclear wastes
and to work together for global nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
But difference of opinion remained over NATO's expansion plan
to include the central and eastern European countries. Russia is
against such a move, while Norway is the only NATO member to share
a border with Russia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the talks, Brundtland admitted that
"nothing new" had resulted from the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion was not easy" on the subject of NATO, but
"there is no need to hurry to discuss this question," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Yeltsin assured that he would try to end the
15-month war in the breakaway Chechnya before a presidential poll
on June 16.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to stop the military activities in Chechnya before
the election," he said. He is due to announce details of a peace
plan for Chechnya at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived in Oslo on Monday, is due to return to
Moscow this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Military Facility Fenced to Face Protest Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Defense authorities in Okinawa,
southwestern Japan, began constructing a fence today around a
U.S. military communications facility that is expected to be the
focal point of anti-base demonstrations later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Naha Regional Defense Facilities Administration Bureau said
it has received reports that anti-base demonstrators plan to rally
at the site of the Sobe Communications Facility in protest at the
forced leasing of the land to the U.S. military, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have received information that some disruptions can be
expected in the area over the weekend," the bureau said,
explaining its decision to erect the fence.
</P>
<P>
It is building a 2.3-meter-high fence of strengthened plastic
around the facility with another fence of 1.5 meters in height
outside the first.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Okinawa police have established a security
headquarters in order to deal with up to 1,500 anti-base activists
who are expected to travel to the island prefecture for the rally.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's action came in the wake of Monday's court decision
ordering Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to sign the required
documents forcing local landowners to lease their land to the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto can sign the documents if the
governor continues to refuse to do so.
</P>
<P>
The lease on the 236 square meters of land used by the facility
in Yomitan expires March 31 and landowner Shoichi Chibana has
demanded that the land be returned to him.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Chibana indicated he might take legal action against
the U.S. government for the return of his land some 25 kilometers
northeast of the prefectural capital of Naha.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all Japanese land for U.S. military use is
in Okinawa, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's total area
and is located about 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that the current momentum in Sino-French links should be
treasured.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, speaking in Beijing, added that the improvement of
Sino-French political relations would promote the development of
bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during a meeting with a French economic and
trade delegation, headed by Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of
the France-China Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said the cooperative fields of China and France, whose
economies are complementary, are widening. There exists enormous
potential, and good prospects in Sino-French cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with French President Chirac, during the
Asia-Europe Meeting, as "good", Li said that Sino-French political
ties have witnessed great improvements, which would enhance the
growth of economic links between the two countries.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The delegation, composed of leaders of more than ten well-known
French enterprises, attended the second symposium on the economies
of China and France, which opened in the Chinese capital today.
</P>
<P>
Desgeorges told Li that the ongoing symposium focuses on the
issues that China is concerned about, such as the relations
between China's state-owned enterprises and the state, the
development and protection of famous products, energy industry and
environmental protection. These subjects are closely related to
China's Ninth Five-Year Plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the symposium offers a good opportunity for the
Chinese and French enterprises to exchange their experiences. He
also voiced his appreciation to the useful work the France-China
Committee has done in promoting understanding and mutually
beneficial cooperation between the two countries' economic
circles.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Erupts Near Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISH, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting broke out in
the coastal villages of Dhanane and Jilib, 60 km south of here,
early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted when the militiamen of South Mogadishu
faction leader Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid launched attacks on the
temporary military bases of Osman Hassan Ali Atto, former
financier of Aidid, at Dhanane, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources from the so-called Presidential
Palace of Aidid, the attacks were aimed at eliminating the forces
of Osman Atto.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is now spreading to the strategic road linking
the Somali capital with the fertile farming region of Lower
Shabelle and the port town of Merca, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There is also a growing fear that the fighting may spread to
Mogadishu and Merca, where both sides are enormously represented.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Osman Atto's faction said in South Mogadishu that
his men repulsed the attacks of General Aidid's men and
captured some of them.
</P>
<P>
He said these prisoners of war will be released publicy along
with a written warning to their families. "We won't release them
for the second time it they are captured again during
fighting," he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no word from the selfstyled government of
General Aidid over the clashes. Sources said, none of his
officials is permitted to talk about what's going on in the
battlefield. His troops are currently engaged in armed
confrontations with the forces of the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) in Bakol and Bay regions of southwestern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known the casualties or damage caused by the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
This is the third round of fighting between Osman Atto and
Aidid over the control of Lower Shabelle Region. Last week, their
forces clashed separately in Merca and Dhanane, with dozens of
militiamen from both sides killed and many others wounded.

MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev returned to Moscow today after his one-day working visit
to breakaway Chechnya, where he held a meeting with commanders of
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
This was his second trip to the separatist republic within one
week.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return, Grachev said the operation designed to wipe
out rebel Chechen militants loyal to their separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev has been generally successful.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the situation remains complicated in the
south and east of the war-torn Chechnya, where the rebels were
fighting against Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin declared on Monday that he will
address the nation on March 31 to disclose the Kremlin's plan to
end the 15-month Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, Russian troops have been speeding up
their military operation in Chechnya to fight the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Site of 2,500-Year-Old Capital Found in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have found
the ruins of a city dating from some 2,500 years ago in Nanling
County in east China's Anhui Province through aerial photography.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that it is probably the site of the capital
city of the State of Wu in its early times during the Spring and
Autumn Period (770-476 BC).
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the political and cultural center
of Wu, whose most famous capital was present-day Suzhou City in
Jiangsu Province to the east of Anhui, was in Anhui in early times.
</P>
<P>
The experts say that the find will contribute to the study of
early Wu, of which few historical documents have left.
</P>
<P>
The find is just one of six major archaeological discoveries
made in the province in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In Guzhen County archaeologists excavated 12 tombs of the Han
Dynasty (206 b.c- a.d. 220) and the Southern and Northern
Dynasties (420-589), and unearthed a great number of precious
cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
A Late Stone Age site some 5,000 years old, which covers an
area of 30,000 sq m, was also found in the county, and might be
one of the earliest city ruins ever found in China, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year two tombs of nobles of the state of Cai, also
of the Spring and Autumn Period, were found in Shouxian County,
which, according to the experts, for the first time proved that
the county was the location of the capital of Cai.
</P>
<P>
A large tomb with 16 chambers was found in Huoqiu
County. Experts say that the tomb, belonging to a marquis of the
Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), is unique in structure.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the province were a great number of fossilized
dinosaur eggs at Mount Huangshan, a famous tourist attraction.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Some five billion pesos (200
million US dollars) worth of investments through joint ventures
especially between the Philippines and Indonesia are expected to
pour into the East ASEAN Growth Area within a period of three
years.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Araullo, director of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources, said today that the investments will focus on the
establishment of tuna canneries.
</P>
<P>
The East ASEAN Growth Area includes Brunei Darussalam, northern
Indonesia, western Malaysia and southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bullish investment environment for the fishery sector is
triggered by the development of strong cooperation between the
Philippines and Indonesia.

The two ASEAN countries are known for their rich fishing
grounds particularly for the tuna.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint venture agreement between the two
countries, the Philippines, through private sector participation,

<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said here today that Egypt is making its utmost efforts to remove
the sufferings of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his talks with visiting
Hungarian President Goncz Arpad, Mubarak called on Israel to end
its closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, imposed since
February 25 when Palestinian Islamic extremists started a series
of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been barred from their work in Israel due
to the closure, and the living conditions in the Palestinian
self-rule territories have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Egypt will again call for the lifting of the
closure during the upcoming follow-up conference to the Summit of
Peacemakers held in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
on March 13.
</P>
<P>
The follow-up meeting is scheduled to take place in Washington
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Ban Beef Imports From Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry
decided today to order food importers to stop importing beef from
Northern Ireland after reported "mad cow" disease cases created a
health scare in Europe and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is expected to issue an administrative order to
importers to stop importing beef from Northern Ireland through
quarantine stations, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been importing beef from Northern Ireland, rather
than from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese decision came after nearly all of the 15 European
Union (EU) countries and a growing number from outside the bloc
had already suspended British beef imports.
</P>

London disclosed last Wednesday a possible link between Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and its human equivalent,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Agriculture Vice-Minister Wants Cleaner Rural Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Pollution is costing losses
to China's agriculture industry running into millions of yuan, a
top government official said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Vice-Minister Hong Fuzeng urged governments at all
levels to step up efforts to protect the agricultural environment
from further deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Hong said, at a working meeting on the protection of
agricultural environment and on rural energy, that the protection
of rural environments plays a key role in future agriculture
development.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the ministry noted that the current agricultural
environment in the country is unsatisfactory, as the excessive
utilization of rural resources had polluted the environment, and
caused great damage to the ecology, thus affecting the health of
people, and farming production.
</P>
<P>
Statistics have revealed that the acreage of polluted farming
land in the country has reached 10 million hectares, causing
losses of annual farming crops worth an estimated 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acreage of soil turning to desert has reached
153 million ha, and that of soil erosion, 2.67 million square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Hong said China had drawn up plans to protect the agricultural
environment by the end of this century. Measures are to be adopted
to ease, or basically control, the process of agricultural
environment deterioration.
</P>
<P>
China has already made great achievements in protecting the
agricultural environment, Hong said. In the past five years
several government departments have collectively carried out a
trial project to develop ecological agriculture in 50 counties in
the country.

and Henan provinces between March 21 and 25, Jiang said that
despite light rain in parts of north China recently, the
seriousness of drought has not been alleviated.
</P>
<P>
He asked governments at all levels to step up an anti-drought
drive in a bid to reap a good wheat harvest in summer.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Combating drought, and ensuring the success of spring
sowing and summer harvest, are the overriding central tasks in
drought-affected rural areas."
</P>
<P>
A good harvest in China depends largely on the success of the
current anti-drought drive, he told local officials.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate agricultural growth in arid north China, it is
imperative to build more water conservancy facilities, and try to
improve production conditions for the farming sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told officials and farmers in Henan and Hebei to make
effective use of Yellow River water, pump underground water where
appropriate, build more reservoirs in mountainous areas, and
extend water-efficient irrigation techniques.
</P>
<P>
"I think the water conservancy facility managerial system
should be reformed, to meet the needs of a socialist market
economy, and social funds be encouraged to flow to the water
conservancy sector," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
met here today with former U.S. President George Bush who arrived
here this morning on a tour of a number of Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here expected that Assad and Bush will
discuss the latest developments in the Middle East region and ways
of pushing forward the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Bush's current visit to Syria comes at a time when the
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations stalled despite the concerted
efforts of the U.S. to secure some progress on the track.
</P>
<P>
Syria criticizes the U.S. administration for supporting Israel
under the slogan of anti-terrorism, instead of seeking to achieve
a fair peace.
</P>
<P>
Syria also disagrees with the U.S. conception of terrorism,
arguing that terrorism should be differentiated from the right of
nations to resist foreign occupation, and that it is only a fair
and overall peace which can ensure the security and stability of
all nations of the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Syrian diplomatic sources, Syria refuses to
resume peace negotiations with Israel on any Israeli conditions.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some Israeli officials have made statements
that Israel will not resume peace negotiations with Syria until
the later takes action against the anti-Israeli resistance
movements.

<HEADLINE> China Hits the High Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- It took centuries to build the
Great Wall of China. But in just a few years the country has
embarked on a massive road building programme.
</P>
<P>
The result is that thousands of towns and villages have been
literally put on the - road - map.
</P>
<P>
Motorway-style expressways, thousands of bridges, and roads
reaching remote villages have all become part of the country's
modern landscape during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The total length of China's highways increased by over 12
percent between 1991 and 1995, a highway construction seminar was
told in Taiyuan, capital city of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had 1.15 million kilometers of
highways, including 2,141 km of express roadways. During the
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), China built 129,000 km of
highways, including 1,619 km of super highways.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year every county in China was accessible by
roadway, with 98 percent of townships and 80 percent of villages
having highways.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China saw a rapid extension of
high-grade roads with the construction of some key highway
projects.
</P>
<P>
About three quarters of the country's expressways were
build during the past half decade.
</P>
<P>
During 1991 and 1995, 28,000 bridges were also built, with the
total number in the country reaching almost 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that China's achievements in highway construction
should be mainly attributed to the state's priority on
transportation, in addition to stressing energy and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments have been active in raising funds
for highway construction. From 1991 to 1995, a total of 220
billion yuan (about 26.5 billion US dollars) from various social
sectors was channelled into the construction, five times the
amount spent during the country's Seventh Five-Year Plan.

Development Council (TDC) and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Electrical
 Appliances Merchants Association Ltd, will be held from April 5
to 8.
</P>
<P>
At a press preview announcing details of the exposition today,

international brand names ranging from "fuzzy-logic" washing
machine, tailor-made kitchen cupboard set, high-tech audio-visual
equipment, handy blood pressure meters, energy-saving cooking
utensils, children's furniture, gold-plated bathroom accessories
to cedar wall panels.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day fair, the organizers will stage various
special programs to add to the festive atmosphere, including
auctions and live entertainment programs hosted by celebrities,
magic and puppet shows, as well as product demonstrations and game
 shows by various exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
A "Betrue Home Theater Demonstration '96" will be set up in the
 fairground where high-end European audio-visual systems will be
displayed for consumers looking for superb entertainment
facilities at home.
</P>
<P>
According to TDC, last year Hong Kong's exports and imports of
electrical home appliances both surged 19 percent to reach 23.8
and 20.9 billion HK dollars (3.05 and 2.68 billion US dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports of home furnishing items also rose 17 percent to reach

<HEADLINE> 229 Chinese Ports Open to Foreign Individuals and Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China had opened 229 border
crossings and marine and airports to foreign persons and vessels
by the end of 1995, Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
Of those, 69 are coastal ports for shipping, 55 are on inland
waters, 50 are airports, and the other 55 are highway and railway
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
At a conference for port, customs and commodities inspection
officials nationwide, the head of the National Port Office, Ye
Jian, said that opening the 229 ports marks a new stage in China's
opening-up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
According to Ye, during the last five years, more ports were
opened than at any time since China began the opening-up policy in
late 1970s. Every year 16 ports opened, and this has greatly
increased China's international trade and tourism, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, China's annual imports and exports went from
115.4 billion U. S. dollars to 280.8 billion U. S. dollars, with
an average annual growth rate of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
During that time period, the amount of cargo handled annually
went from 200 million tons to 360 million tons, and the number of
people crossing its borders from 65 million to 108 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country had more than 10 million vehicles and
vessels entering or leaving the country, compared to 6.4 million
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In that time, the nation's income from duties and value-added
taxes on imports rose from 28.2 billion yuan to 69.8 billion yuan
a year, with an annual growth rate of 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The last five years also saw great improvement in port
facilities, thanks to investment from both the central and
provincial governments. Guangdong Province in south China alone
spent 2.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China has also made progress in reforming the port
administration system. The approval of an experimental reform of
Shenzhen Port by the State Council in July 1995 marks a crucial
step in that direction.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover Protein Useful In Treating Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
discovered a natural protein that may prove useful in treating
autoimmune diseases, according to Journal of Biological
Chemistry, a press bulletin published by Weizman Institute of
Science.
</P>
<P>
The institute's scientists believe that this protein, called
restrictin-P, acts as a "secret officer" that restricts the
activity of a particular type of immune cell, namely the plasma
cell, that produces antibodies. In autoimmune disorders, the
immune system mistakenly turns its weapons against the body's
healthy tissues.
</P>
<P>
The researchers think that it may be possible to exploit
restrictin-P's vigilance to restrain plasma cells that manufacture
 abnormal antibodies causing autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
Using cancerous plasma cells as their model, the institute's
scientists have discovered that restrictin-P interferes with
signals emitted by the growth factor interleukin-6, because
interleukin-6 is essential for these cells' survival. Interference
with the growth factor's signals causes them to die.
</P>
<P>
This study was performed by Prof. Dov Zipori of the Molecular
Cell Biology Department, together with Prof. Yigal Burstein of
the Organic Chemistry Department and other colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Apart from autoimmune diseases, restrictin-P may be used to
fight multiple myeloma, a plasma cell cancer. It may also be
capable of counteracting the dangerous side effects of treatment
based on interleukin-6, which hold promise for fighting highly
metastatic cancers and other clinical conditions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Are Walking Tall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China's population is growing --
and so is the size of its people, an official report revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
A new survey in the world's most populated country shows that
Chinese children are walking tall -- their height is over three
centimeters more than the average just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The study also disclosed that Chinese schoolchildren and
students aged seven to 22 are in better health.
</P>
<P>
The physical make-up, and general health condition of today's
students has improved for the better, said Song Jinxian, who
headed the '95 nationwide survey on students' constitutions and
health conditions, at a press conference held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the result of the first nationwide students'
health survey conducted in 1985, today's students aged from seven
to 18 are 3.09 centimeters taller, and 2.50 kilograms heavier than
before.
</P>
<P>
The relevant world index was that young people are one
centimeter taller and 0.5 kilogram heavier every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Fewer students have decayed teeth.
</P>
<P>
China conducted three similar surveys in 1979, 1985 and
1991.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey was the largest one covering 310,000
students, from 21 ethnic backgrounds in 30 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions. China plans to conduct one
large-scale health survey among students every 10 years in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Song said that the health of students among another 20 ethnic
backgrounds, such as Tibetan, Zhuang, Miao, Hui, are the same as,
or even better, than that of students of Han background.
</P>
<P>
However, health problems do exist. Song said that the major
health problem among students in large and medium-sized cities is
that some students are over-weight. Some 12.03 percent of urban
boy students between the ages of seven to 18 are over-weighted.
</P>
<P>
The rate of nearsightedness among urban students also remains
high. More than 70 percent of all urban high school students
surveyed are nearsighted. More rural students are suffering from
bad eyesight, with 58.5 percent of them nearsighted.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 200 million primary schoolchildren, and
middle school students. There are 2.8 million college students on
campuses.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly conducted by the State Education
Commission (SEC), State Physical Culture and Sports Commission,
Ministry of Public Health, State Nationalities Affairs Commission
and the State Science and Technology Commission.

TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran today rejected charges by
former British Premier Margaret Thatcher that Tehran was after
weapons of mass destruction, labeling her as a "politically
bankrupt" person.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio today quoted an Iranian Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying that "Iran was itself the initiator
of a new plan for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests."
</P>
<P>
"Our plan was received with enthusiasm by the countries,
including Britain, that took part in Disarmament Conference held
in Geneva," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iraqi chemical attacks on Iran during the
eight-year war (1980-88), the spokesman termed Iran as "this
century's last victim of chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
"We have reiterated again and again that we would support any
move to cleanse the Middle East of the weapons of mass
destruction,' he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also attacked the "joint propaganda campaign" by
the U.S. and Israel against Iran, adding that the campaign
amounted to "a psychological war" against Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Lebanon Comes into Period of Temporary Calm (by Fu Weijian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 26 (Xinhua) -- the situation in south Lebanon has
come into a period of temporary calmness following the
international endeavors which were made to relax tension after
Israel threatened to deal a blow to the Hezbollah (Party of God)
organization.
</P>
<P>
One month ago Hezbollah intensified its guerrilla operations
inside the Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon,
killing or wounding a large number of Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Ali Monif Ashmer, a guerrilla of Hezbollah, carried out on
March 20 a suicide operation inside the border enclave, killing
an Israeli army officer.
</P>
<P>
This induced Israel to send troops reinforcements and armored
vehicles into the border enclave, while Israeli senior officials
uttered threats to mount retaliatory military operations in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese diplomacy acted quickly and succeeded in persuading
the U.S. and some friendly states to keep Israel from launching
an attack on south Lebanon, in return for the halting by Lebanon's
Islamic resistance movement of its operations inside the
Israeli-occupied border enclave temporarily.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, the U.S. made contacts with Tel-Aviv,
Damascus and Beirut, and put pressure on Israel to delay dealing a
heavy blow to Hezbollah scheduled for last Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Washington told Tel-Aviv it would also
persuade both Beirut and Damascus to act quickly to halt guerrilla
operations in south Lebanon, including the border enclave, until
the coming Israeli parliamentary election is over, that is for
nearly a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Washington also told Tel-Aviv no to take military action
against Hezbollah before the meetings due to be held in Washington
by the committee stemming from the Sharm El-Sheikh summit on March
28 and 29 to debate the security proposals made by the states
which participated in the summit.
</P>
<P>
As far as Lebanon is concerned, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
affirmed recently that the endeavors which were made regionally
and internationally secured some success in controlling the
deteriorating situation in south lebanon, as Lebanon got
assurances from Washington that Israel would not carry out its
threats to deal a military blow at south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government sources also said that the Syrian and
Lebanese leaderships had made contacts with Hezbollah with the aim
of persuading it to freeze its guerrilla operations inside the
Israeli-occupied border enclave, so that it might not give Israel
a pretext to mount a military operation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Observers in the Lebanese capital think that Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres needed to prevent suicide operations in both
 Israel and the border enclave of south Lebanon in order to win
the parliamentary election due to be held in May, while
U.S. President Clinton needed to push forward the Middle East
peace process in order to wing his battle for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Though Israeli threats have abated, political observers do not
think it unlikely for Israel to deal limited blow at the posts of
Hezbollah, which reaffirmed Monday that they would retaliate
against any Israeli aggression by firing rockets at Jewish
settlements in Israel.

<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines today joined a
growing number of countries that have imposed a total ban on beef
exports from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said that the
ban, sparked by reports that a fatal brain-wasting disease was
likely caused by the "mad cow disease" afflicting British cattle,
will take effect tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The ban, following guidelines from the European Commission,
covers every beef product from fresh meat of cattle slaughtered in
Britain to gelatin and fat used in food items.
</P>
<P>
Also included in the ban are products used for medicinal,
cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes, biscuits, yogurt and ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British beef poses risks to Filipinos, but
added, "there is very little risk that Filipino consumers would be
infected by this disease."
</P>
<P>
He noted that beef imports from Britain amounted to only
120,404 US dollars or 0.86 percent of the country's total beef
imports of 14 million US dollars in 1995.

<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (xinhua) -- Aquaculture is playing a major
role in China's fisheries production with more than half of the
fishery output coming from aquaculture, according to today's
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that per capita output of aquatic products in
China last year was 19 kilograms, which is higher than the world's
average. China now accounts for one-fifth of the world's fishery
output.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in 1994 showed that China's inland fish farms and
marine aquaculture had five million ha of ponds or pools,
producing 11 million tons of aquatic products or 53 percent of
China's total.
</P>
<P>
In promoting the development of inland fish farming, China
started developing ways of improving marine fishery resources in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to People's Daily, the country has formulated
shore-term guidelines for fisheries development to accelerate
aquaculture development and to stabilize offshore fishing.
</P>
<P>
China now has 6.75 million ha of inland water suitable for fish
farming and 5.02 million ha of shallow seas or mud flats suitable
for marine aquaculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with visiting United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros
Ghali in Zhongnanhai, the site of the Chinese government, here
today.
</P>
<P>
They had a friendly conversation on strengthening the relations
between the UN and China and issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his joy to meet Ghali again, and said he
believed that the visit by Ghali, a friend of the Chinese people,
would deepen the friendship and understanding between the UN and
China.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his presence at the celebrations marking the 50th
anniversary of the UN founding in New York last October, Jiang
said that he was deeply impressed by the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The world is still in a process of complicated and profound
changes, with peace and development remaining the major tasks of
the current world, Jiang said. Peace and development are
complementary and closely related to each other. The UN still has
much to do before lasting global peace and common development are
attained, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang defined the UN formed by sovereign countries as a most
representative international organization of governments, the role
of which can not be replaced by any other international
organization. Most of the UN member nations are developing
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government holds that all countries, big or small,
rich or poor, should have equal rights to participate in
international affairs and that UN affairs should be handled by all
its member states through consultations, he said. Only in this way
can the UN accomplish its historical mission and meet the changing
situations of the world.
</P>
<P>
As one of the founders of the UN and a permanent member of the
UN Security Council, China attaches importance to and supports the
UN as it plays its positive role in international affairs in line
with the UN Charter's principles, Jiang said, adding that his
country will continue to support the work of the UN and its
Secretary General while actively involving itself in UN activities.
</P>
<P>
Ghali thanked the Chinese government for its efforts in
successfully convening the Fourth World Conference on Women last
year. He hoped that in the future more UN-sponsored international
conferences would be held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Ghali's promise that the UN will increase its aid
to African countries in the years to come, Jiang said China has
always attached importance to African affairs and the development
of Africa. China offered whatever help it could to African
countries for social and economic growth in the past, and, in the
future it will increase exchanges and co-operation with African
countries in various forms.

Hong Kong should be compiled jointly by the Chinese side, the
British side, and the chief executive and its leading body, that
are to be appointed, of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
This was announced at the first session of the economic panel
of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR that closed here
today.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the 12 proposals of the economic panel of the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the
Hong Kong SAR, members held that they have laid a favorable
foundation for the Preparatory Committee's further study of the
relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
They said that the principle of the budget compilation should
be in accordance with the relevant stipulations in the Basic Law
so as to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the budget expenditure must be in line with the
increase of the total output value of Hong Kong and the allocation
of the financial sources must be helpful for the long-term
development of Hong Kong's economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of securities firms to provide loans,
members agreed that it will play a positive role in promoting the
stability of the banking system and boost the development of the
bond market. But the decision should be made after opinions from
various sectors are solicited, they added.
</P>
<P>
It is also decided that four sub-groups will be set up under
the economic panel, responsible for checking the government assets
and debts, large-scale infrastructure projects, finance, and the
overall development of Hong Kong's economy.

</P>
<P>
Mbonde said that while contries in Europe, America and Asia

harder to integrate their economies now.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants drawn from SADC member states to
keep abreast the unfolding challenges of the 21th century which
include changes in the global commerical scenario and
technolgical advancement, noting these challenges will be
accompanied with many risks and opportunities for African
countries.

<HEADLINE> People's Construction Bank of China Has New Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Construction Bank of
China today re-named itself the China Construction Bank (CCB), and
adopted a new emblem.
</P>
<P>
"Using a new name is part of the efforts to turn our bank into
a real state-owned commercial bank," said the bank's president,
Wang Qishan.
</P>
<P>
The new name will help the bank expand its business and avoid
the confusion resulting from the similarity between the People's
Construction Bank of China and the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Letters, documents, telegrams and remittances have often been
sent to the wrong bank because of the similarity in their names.
</P>
<P>
"The new name can clearly indicate the CCB's identity as a
commercial entity and protect the People's Bank of China's status
as the central bank," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The new name will not affect the CCB's rights and duties, he
said, "We will stick to our duties and maintain and develop good
relations with our customers in line with law."
</P>
<P>
The CCB is expected to continue managing capital according to a
comprehensive plan and to merge or dismantle some subsidiaries in
some cities in order that it can have only one subsidiary in each
city. The merging has begun in Haikou, capital of south China's
Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
In the bid to commercialize itself, CCB will keep the growth
rate of its employees "at or below zero point" in the run-up to
the year 2000 as the CCB has already more than 300,000 employees,
Wang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
If possible, CCB will put in place a new system under which the
headquarters controls revenues and expenditures for all its
departments, branches, and other subsidiaries according to a
unified plan, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's state commercial banks, the CCB has 1.72267

figure to two trillion yuan and have 12 percent returns from its
assets by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Dissolving Soviet Union Violates Constitution: Duma Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma (lower house of
parliament) Chairman Gennady Seleznev said today that the
dissolution of the former Soviet Union five years ago was a
violation of the Constitution and against the will of the Soviet
people.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev, who arrived here on Monday morning for an official
visit, made the remarks to the press after emerging from his talks
with Bulgaria's National Assembly Chairman Blagovest Sendov.
</P>
<P>
The March 15 Duma resolution for restoring the Soviet Union was
adopted only to show that breaking up the union violates the
Soviet Constitution and runs against the will of the Soviet
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was strongly criticized by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, declared null and void a 1991 parliament
decision which laid the basis for the dissolution of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev said that there exists a new possibility for reviving
the 1922 Treaty on the Formation of the Soviet Union, which was
renounced in a 1991 agreement signed by Yeltsin and the then
leaders of Belarus and Ukraine in Beloveshsk, Belarus.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Duma resolution has left a good room with the
president and the prime minister for handling the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Duma is ready for a Constitution revision but its adoption
will be very difficult, Seleznev said.

<HEADLINE> State Development Bank Gets High Overseas Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China has recently received high ratings for long-term credit from
three leading rating institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Moody's Company, the Standard and Poor Company, both of the
United States, and Nippon Investors Services of Japan have awarded
the bank A3, BBB and AA- in long-term credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
The three ratings are all equal to sovereignty credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
The ratings reflect that the bank has played an important part
in implementing state policies and promoting economic growth, said
sources at Moody's.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Standard and Poor Company pointed out that the
ratings indicate that the Chinese government has made efforts to
commercialize state banks and has firmly supported and efficiently
managed the development bank, which has given priority to key
state projects.
</P>
<P>
The high ratings have created good conditions for the bank to
raise funds at low cost on the international capital market.
</P>
<P>
At the end of February this year the bank issued 30 billion yen
in samurai bonds on the Japanese bourse to finance power plants in
south and north China.

NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian automobile
manufacturers said that with so many players operating in India's
auto market, a shake out in the industry is inevitable and may
occur soon.
</P>
<P>
A whole new generation of foreign cars have finally come to the
booming Indian auto market putting the consumer in the driver's
seat. The local market, however, does not have room for such a
large number of players, nor is there a realistic demand to absorb
the supply, they said.

<P>
"The Indian auto market does not have sufficient space for so
many players and I expect a shake out within a year or two," said
Sameer Gupta, dealer development officer of Opel Astra Car.
</P>
<P>
"Practically every one is aiming at the middle class-upper
middle class segment. There is too much to choose from and a shake

<HEADLINE> Official Campaign for South Korea's 15th National Assembly  Elections Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korean political parties and
candidates, including independents, kicked off their official
campaign throughout the nation today for the 15th National
Assembly elections to be held on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Candidates will register their candidacies with the Central
Election Management Committee (CEMC) today and tomorrow before
entering official campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming elections will select 299 members of the
National Assembly. Among them, 253 lawmakers will be elected
through direct popular voting in electoral districts. The
remaining 46 uncontested seats are distributed to parties in
proportion to the number of votes they obtain in direct voting.
</P>
<P>
The total number of eligible voters in the general elections is
31.53 million, including 792,360 absentee voters, the CEMC said
here today.
</P>
<P>
CEMC officials forecast that some 1,350 candidates will contend
for the 253 seats by popular vote, chalking up a competition ratio
of 5.3:1, the highest in the National Assembly election history.
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party (NKP), the minor opposition
Democratic Party (DP) and the conservative United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) will announce the lists of nominees for the
national constituency seats by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
bared the list of 46 national constituency candidates on March 23,
placing party leader Kim Dae-jung as low as 14th in a move to
appeal the electorate to give as many votes as possible to NCNP
candidates nationwide thereby ensuring a National Assembly seat
for him.
</P>
<P>
Candidates, whose campaigning was limited to their party
members until now, will be allowed to meet with voters and hold
two mass rallies beginning tomorrow, the last day of candidacy
registration with the CEMC.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are also allowed to hold two mass rallies in
each electoral district in support of their candidates.
</P>
<P>
The election campaigning began amid predictions that no party
will win a majority of the 299 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The elections are expected to become a showdown among the
ruling party and the three opposition parties, which are wielding
much political clout in their home provinces.
</P>
<P>
Presidents and chief campaign managers of the four political
parties yesterday held press conferences to appeal to the people
to support their candidates in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Kim Suk-soo, CEMC president, yesterday issued a statement
calling for cooperation from parties and candidates to realize
clean and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung yesterday presided
over a meeting of election-related government ministers and
instructed public officials to stay strictly neutral during the
electioneering period.
</P>
<P>
With only 16 days left until the elections, political parties
are all out to rally support from voters, a considerable portion
of whom are reportedly listed as the "still undecided."
</P>
<P>
The ruling New Korea Party plans to solicit voter support with
a campaign slogan that political stability is possible only when
it wins a majority of parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are intent on taking advantage of the
recent bribery scandal of Chang Hak-ro, a former secretary for
President Kim young-sam, to win over perennial supporters for the
ruling camp and reform-minded young voters.
</P>
<P>
Their strategies are apparently paying off with newspaper and
unofficial polls indicating that support for the ruling NKP is
sliding.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have claimed that the forthcoming
elections would serve to evaluate the three-year performance of
President Kim's administration.

LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Following are major news items

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

pensions between couples was confirmed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Diet Resumes Work After 3-Week Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Diet (parliament)
resumed its normal business today after a three-week stalemate as
senior members of the House of Representatives Budget Committee
met to discuss the schedule of debate over a fiscal 1996 stopgap
budget.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Diet impasse came a day after the leading
opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) lifted its
blockade of the budget committee's room Monday and agreed to
return Diet proceedings to normal, after reaching a vaguely-worded
compromise with the ruling coalition over continuing debate on the
fiscal 1996 budget bills.
</P>
<P>
Shinshinto lawmakers had formed a human barricade since March 4
to protest a 685 billion yen (6.85 billion U.S. dollars)
allocation in the budget that would help liquidate seven insolvent
housing loan companies, or "jusen".
</P>
<P>
The final agreement to resolve the Diet deadlock was reached in
a meeting of leaders of the five major parties in the lower house
on Monday, arranged by Speaker Takako Doi.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the five parties agreed that the committee will
"sincerely" deal with a Shinshinto demand to have Koichi Kato,
secretary general of the dominant ruling coalition partner Liberal
Democratic Party, testify as an unsworn witness over his alleged
receipt of 10 million yen (100,000 dollars) donation from a debtor
of one of the seven failed "jusen."
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear if the government's "jusen" scheme will
remain intact due to continuing strong public resentment toward
use of taxpayers' money, despite the Sunday victory by a
coalition-backed candidate in a House of Councillors by-election
in Gifu Prefecture in central Japan.

<HEADLINE> 15 Sri Lankan Soldiers Killed by Rebels in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen government soldiers were
killed in east Sri Lanka by Tamil rebels Monday, bringing the
death toll to 133 in the past two weeks, according to military
sources today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy others were reportedly injured during the same period.
 Most of them were young recruits and volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in their
latest attack had hit a routine route clearing army patrol. They
had also removed the arms and ammunition of the dead soldiers, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has made several attacks on military positions in the
East of Sri Lanka during the past two weeks. The attacks were
aimed at discouraging government troops from conducting limited
scale operations and sending out patrols.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that there is a massive build-up in the area
and it is obvious they want to prevent any major attack by the
government troops on the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting against the government for a
separate state in the north and east of the island country since
1983.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO Endorses Clinton for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The AFL-CIO, the largest trade
union in America, endorsed U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday
for re-election and decided to fund a 35-million-dollar political
warchest to fight for workers' issues.
</P>
<P>
Creation of the political fund has drawn sharp criticism from
Republicans, the chief targets of labor leaders' attacks during a
one-day special convention of the 13-million-member federation.
</P>
<P>
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney decried the
Republican-controlled Congress' efforts to cut the National Labor
Relations Board, Medicaid and Medicare and the Republican
opposition to raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
It was the first special convention called since the American
Federation of Labor (AFL) merged with the Congress of Industrial
Organizations (CIO) in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO is targeting 75 House districts this fall and plans
to use the 35 million dollars to educate voters on candidates'
records.
</P>
<P>
The convention raised the amount unions pay to the AFL-CIO by
15 cents monthly per union member. Labor leaders say workers' dues
won't rise.
</P>
<P>
The National Republican Senatorial Committee called the program
"a massive negative smear campaign against GOP Senate and House
candidates."
</P>
<P>
Sweeney said labor leaders' endorsement was supported by a poll
of AFL-CIO members that showed strong support for Clinton despite
his approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which
labor vehemently opposed.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about Democrats and Republicans -- it's about
where these candidates, whose records are very well known, stand
on the issues that affect the lives and the future of working
families," Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore accepted the endorsement.

<HEADLINE> Stable Economic Growth Projected in East Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Economic development in east
European countries will go onto a stable track in 1996, but
unemployment remains a serious problem, according to a group of
German Deutsche Bank economists.
</P>
<P>
The economists said that national economy in most east European
countries have moved out of the darkest period since these
countries began to adopt economic structure reform in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that their 1995 gross domestic product (GDP),
excluding that of the former Soviet Union republics, registered an
average growth of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
When prices are lower in 1996, the figure will probably remain
the same, the economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that economic growth in east European
countries will mainly rely upon export during their first stage of
reform toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Consumption and investment also played an important role in
helping recover economic vitality in these countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the economists said, high unemployment rate is still a
serious problem that most east European countries, except the
Czech republic, have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
New jobs will be created only when these countries continue to
push forward the economic reform, to attract more foreign
investment and to promote the development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises, the group of German economists suggested.
</P>
<P>
Another problem for eastern Europe's economic development is
the lack of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The German economists said although east European countries can
offer cheaper labor than their western neighbors, few foreign
investors showed interest in this area.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment there totaled 24 billion U.S. dollars during
the past six years, compared with 16 billion dollars during the
same period in Argentina alone.
</P>
<P>
As for east European countries' admission into the European
Union (EU), they said it is hard to be realized by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Strong opposition coming from southwest European countries is
one reason, and the other is that the EU has to pay a lot to
accept all of them at the same time.
</P>
<P>
A possible solution for these countries is to join the EU one
by one in the coming 10 or 15 years, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
When talking about Russia and Ukraine, they said economic
situation in the two nations showed little improvement with a high
inflation of over 100 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
German economists estimated that Russian and Ukraine's economy
will begin to pick up in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Opposition Urged To Accept Last October's Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) --The Tanzanian ruling
Revolutionary Party (CCM) has called on the opposition Civic United
Front (CUF) to accept the poll results of last October's
elections in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read on Monday by the National Publicity
Secretary Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru after a two-day meeting of the
party's National Executive Committee (NEC), CCM said the
opposition party should accept the outcome of last October's
presidential elections as they were "free and and fair" and use
its presence in the house of representatives to influence change.
</P>
<P>
CUF won 24 out of 50 seats of the house, the rest going to
CCM.
</P>
<P>
But CUF has been boycotting house of representatives sessions
as a protest against the presidential polls which it claims was
manipulated in favour of CCM. CUF has refused to recognize the
government under President Salmin Amour.
</P>
<P>
The statement said after reviewing a report on last year's
general elections, the NEC was satisfied that the October 22
Zanzibar polls were held " fairly and freely with 95 percent of
the electorate casting their votes".
</P>
<P>
On political situation in Tanzania, it said the situation was
peaceful except for Zanzibar, especially Pemba where there is a
political crisis and violation of law, forcing the people to live
in fear. Main source of the political "hooliganism" is CUF's
unacceptance of the outcome of the election results, added the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged the Zanzibar and union governments to
take immediate measures to maintain law and order in the country
and at the some time implement effective socio-economic plans to
eradicate poverty of the people.

<HEADLINE> Sino-French Economy Seminar Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The development of Sino-French
ties offers more opportunities and fields for furthering two-way
trade and economic co-operation, said the head of China's largest
unofficial trade organization.
</P>
<P>
Guo Dongpo, chairman of the China Council for Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT), told a seminar on Sino-French
economic ties held here today that there is great potential for
the growth of the Sino-French trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the driving power of the development of the
bilateral trade to China's rapid economic growth, France's leading
position in international trade, and its strength in the fields
of agriculture, communications, energy and chemistry, which are
China's top priorities for development.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of the France-China
Committee, told the seminar that businessmen of the two countries
should strengthen their co-operation on the principle of mutual
understanding and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The major topics of the seminar, including the relations
between state-owned businesses and governments, would help the
participants to exchange favorable experiences in this regard, he
added.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 officials, scholars and business people are
participating in the seminar which is jointly sponsored by the
CCPIT, China International Chamber of Commerce and France-China
Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting the Chinese officials will brief the
participants on the reform of China's state-owned enterprises, and
the policy toward and current situation of the management of
state-owned firms. The French side will focus on the ties between
French state-run businesses and their government.

<HEADLINE> S. African Finance Minister On Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua)-- The South African tax system did
not general have a negative impact on the country as an investment
destination, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A local daily ''The Citizen'' today quoted Mr. Liebenberg as
saying that taxes varied in importance in various stages of a
country's development, and concepts such as source and residence, the
company tax and other taxes had to be considered.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to a question from Johannes Niemann (National
Party) in parliament, Liebenberg presented an analysis of tax rates
in 17 countries which showed the average to be 31 percent. While
South Africa's company tax rates began at 35 percent, inter-country
comparisons were not always meaningful, since many factors had to be
considered.
</P>
<P>
Of the countries compared, Singapre had the lowest corporate rates
(27 percent and a concessionary rate of 10 percent), while Iran
levied corporate taxes of between 12 and 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rates for some of the other countries analysed were: Australia 33
percent, Egypt 42 percent, Israel 36 percent, Malaysia 34 percent,
Thailand 30 percent, and the United States between 15 and 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Election Campaign Starts in India (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from BJP and the Congress, the major players in Indian
politics, left wing parties have also launched their election
campaigns in the country.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal Chief Minister and one of the leaders of the Indian
Communist Party (M) Jyoti Basu, his Bihar state counterpart Laloo
Prasad Yadav and V.P. Singh shared a single platform at the left
front rally at the brigade parade ground in Calcutta on March 24
and pledged to form a third front comprising the left, democratic
and secular forces to defeat "the corrupted" Congress and the BJP
of "barbarians".
</P>
<P>
Over ten parties are expected to fight for 543 seats in the Lok
Sabha (Lower House) general elections to be conducted in four
phases from April 27 to May 30 this year. Although the major
battle will be taken place between the Congress Party and BJP,
neither party is expected to be capable to win a clear majority in
the election due to their respective weaknesses. In this
circumstances, small parties could play a crucial role in the
election as well as in forming new government. At the moment,
both the BJP and Congress are trying hard to win over small and
local parties.
</P>
<P>
Although both the Congress and BJP have not released their
election programs, from what they have hinted time and again one
can see that the Congress's main election plank is "stability" and
"prosperity" while the BJP will focus on the Rao government's
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission and Home Ministry have been reviewing
the security arrangements for the general elections and ordered to
unearth illegal arms.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,200 fishing boats
of Guangdong Province are sailing onto the high seas to look for
greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
The province's ocean-going fisheries have an annual output of
400,000 tons, ranking ahead of other provinces, according to data
released by the provincial department of ocean affairs and aquatic
products.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen are under greater pressure as offshore waters are
becoming over-fished, and local authorities are encouraging both
state-run and private fishing companies to go farther, to take
pressure off local waters and to catch more fish. Fishing boats
with more advanced navigational equipment are being built to meet
the increasing technical needs.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which is on the south China coast, has rich marine
resources in the South China Sea. The province has also developed
closer cooperation with nine countries and areas, including Belau
and Micronesia in the South Pacific.

BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Mayor Duan Qiang of Beijing
said here today that the city plans to increase its tree coverage
to 40 percent by the year 2000, from the present 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting with units and workers who plant trees and
grass, Duan said that the municipal government is seeing to it
that the tree planting drive will go hand in hand with economic
and social development over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Municipal Forestry Bureau, since 1991, Beijing
has added 132,000 hectares of woods and increased its tree
coverage to 36 percent from 28 percent in 1990. Per-capita green
space has risen to 7.08 sq m from 6.14 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Suburban areas, however, still have 140,000 hectares of barren
hillsides and 14,000 hectares of sandy land. The vice-mayor said
that those hillsides and sandy areas will be covered by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next five years we will also plant more trees and
grass in residential areas, courtyards, industrial development
zones, and high-tech development parks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita green space is targeted for an increase to eight
sq.m. in the year 2000, he explained.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the tree and grass coverage in the urban area
will rise to 40 percent and per-capita green space to ten sq.m.,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy continued to
decline in February, a German economic research institute said in
its monthly report today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ifo, a Munich-based institute, the industry,
construction and commerce sectors performed worse in February than
in January. Many enterprises showed no prospects of an upturn in
the future, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that in February, enterprises surveyed in
western Germany were more pessimistic about doing business and
promoting exports than in January.
</P>
<P>
Though eastern German enterprises said they were "satisfied"
with the economic situation, they continued to lay off workers,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Germany reached a post-World War II record in
January, with nearly 4.2 million people, or 10.8 percent of the
active population, registered as jobless.
</P>
<P>
The operational index of enterprises in the industry,
construction and commerce sectors dropped from January's 92.6 to
91.8 in February in western Germany, and from 104.3 in January to
102.3 in February in eastern Germany, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Resolve Dispute Over Chicken Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) --The United States said today
that Russia had agreed to lift a ban on shipments of U.S. chicken
following the resolution of health concerns.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said in a statement that Russian
negotiators had accepted in talks here that U.S. poultry was safe
for Russian consumption.
</P>
<P>
The administration had agreed to tighten inspection procedures
for poultry bound for Russia, including spot checks of American
poultry plants to be conducted jointly by U.S. and Russian
inspectors, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would also issue special inspection certificates for
the approved shipments.
</P>
<P>
Russia will accept poultry shipments that departed the
U.S. before March 20, and will begin to issue new import licenses
within days, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following intensive negotiations
between the two countries since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russia suspended issuing import licenses from February 16,
saying there were concerns over salmonella in imported U.S.
poultry. The ban was a major blow to American chicken farmers as
Russia is the biggest foreign buyer of U.S. chicken, accounting
for 500 million U.S. dollars in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
In imposing the ban, Russia had contended that too much of
imported U.S. poultry is contaminated and that American producers
must take steps to eliminate salmonella, a sometimes deadly
bacteria. According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, salmonella
bacteria show up in 25 percent of processed American poultry.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the office of U.S. Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor said they planned to begin separate talks with the Russians
on Thursday over higher tariffs and other import barriers that
Russia recently imposed on American chicken imports.

KIEV, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The broadening of Ukraine-China
cooperation will be the major topic during a visit by a high-level
delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) this
week, a senior Ukrainian official said today.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Alexander Moroz, chairman of the Ukrainian
Supreme Soviet, a delegation led by Qiao Shi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the NPC, will start a good-will visit to
Ukraine March 28.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also visit Russia, Cuba and Canada.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Moroz described Qiao's upcoming
visit as another significant event in Sino-Ukrainian relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted a firm legal basis has been gained for the development
of the bilateral cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries more than four years ago. Some
50 documents of cooperation on various levels have been signed.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is great potential for further cooperation,
</P>
<P>
Moroz said Ukraine and China have a bright future in improving
the trade structure and trade balance between them, and in
broadening their cooperation in the fields of chemical industry,
metallurgical industry, machinery and space, and high-tech fields
in particular.
</P>
<P>
He added that Ukraine can learn from China's success in
building economic zones, in improving competitiveness of its
products, and in combining state management of production with
market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The development of Sino-Ukrainian cooperation will also build a
bridge for cooperation in Eurasia, benefiting not only the two
countries but also the stability and development of the world,
Moroz said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet has set up a
16-member group to seek more ways of developing parliamentary
contacts between Ukraine and China.

countries and through promoting legislation basis for such
cooperation, Moroz stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day seminar of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
opened here today to discuss the Multilateral Agreement on
Investment (MAI) issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Denise Yue, secretary for Trade and
Industry, said that Hong Kong is not a member of the OECD, but it
has involved itself in the policy dialogue between the OECD and
dynamic non-member economies since 1989.
</P>
<P>
She said that Hong Kong considers that a multilateral code on
investment based on free and liberalized principles will go a long
way to provide a level playing field for investors and will
greatly facilitate global investment.
</P>
<P>
The MAI would be the first multilateral treaty providing high
standards for the liberalization and protection of international
investment, and for effectively settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the terms of the MAI opened in the OECD last
May and are expected to be concluded by mid-1997 and consultations
at the meeting in Hong Kong are part of the regular policy
dialogue between OECD members and dynamic non-member economies
(including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, the Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Chinese Taibei.
</P>
<P>
Participants from China, India and the Indonesian private
sector have also been invited to the meeting organized by the OECD
and hosted by the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
The OECD will present a publication entitled "Towards
Multilateral Investment Rules." The book presents key reports
explaining the nature and purpose of the MAI, including background
documentation not previously available to the public on existing
liberalization, new disciplines, investment protection, dispute
settlement and non-members and institutional issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held in the form of workshop discussion,
will also address the liberalization of foreign direct investment
and how it will affect recipient economies.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 senior government officials, academics and other
nominees attended the workshop in their personal capacity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Impose Ban on Import of British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has issued a regulation
to ban the import and sale of British beef and milk products,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which will come into effect this week, based on
the 1979 food act, empowers the Food and Drug Administration to
impose bans on products which carry risks to consumers, such as
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, milk and all beef products, canned or
otherwise packed, will be banned, Pakdee Pothisri,
secretary-general of the Food and Drug Administration, was quoted
by today's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Food inspectors have also been assigned to check markets to
make sure that no beef products from Britain are sold in Thailand,
Pakdee said.
</P>
<P>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the human equivalent of mad
cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), has never
been experienced in Thailand, said Dmrong Boonyuen, director of
the Communicable Disease Control Department.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the spread of BSE among cows in Britain is
possibly because they were fed offal along with grass and
vegetables, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai ministries of Public Health and Agriculture and
Cooperatives, he said, have been in contact with their
counterparts in Britain about precautions in preventing the
disease.

<HEADLINE> 8,000-year-old Bone Needle Found in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A bone needle dating back some
8,000 years has been found in Yichuan county, in central China's
Henan Province, according to China Archaeological News.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the 5.6-cm-long, 1.2-mm-round
needle could still be used today, and is one of the finest ever
found in China.
</P>
<P>
The most puzzling to experts about the needle is how early man
could make such a smooth bone needle with an eye that is one-third
that of a modern needle.
</P>
<P>
The needle was discovered among pottery and pieces of inscribed
bones belonging to the neolithic Cishan-Peiligang Culture. It
dates back 7,000-8,000 years. Traces of the culture were found at
Cishan in Wu'an, Hebei Province, in 1973, and at Peiligang in
Xinzheng, Henan in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The oldest bone needle in China is from some 50,000 years ago,
found in Haicheng, in northeast China's Liaoning Province.

<HEADLINE> France: Lower Economic Growth Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The French government has more than
halved its projected growth rate for the country in 1996, from 2.8
percent to 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The higher estimate, made last fall during work on the 1996
budget, had been questioned by most economic research institutes,
whose best projection was 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today the government fell into line. Jean Arthuis, minister of
economics and finance, said the lower forecast is a direct result
of last year's economic slowdown. But it pencilled in a 2.8 per
cent growth rate for 1997 as it expects the economy to pick up in
the second half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
France's gross domestic product (GDP) slowed to a 2.4 percent
rise in 1995, against 2.9 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised 1996 growth rate, job openings in France's
non-agriculture sectors is expected to increase this year by just
15,000, rather than the 290,000 projected earlier, but should rise
by 215,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis gave no estimates about unemployment figures for 1996,
but most research institutes put the jobless rate at between 11.8
percent and 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's budget deficit, said the finance
minister, is likely to remain at 4 percent of GDP in 1996 and is
expected to go down to 3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But according to Agence France Presse, private analysts expect
at least a 4.6 per cent deficit for 1996, falling to 3.8 per cent
in 1997, higher than the 3 per cent limit set by the Maastricht
Treaty for joining the single European currency.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President's Attorney Rejects U.S. "Interference" </HEADLINE>

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper's defense attorney Monday rejected comments made by
U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette as "improper interference" in the
official investigation of his client.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Luis Guillero Nieto Roa said "it is the
unlawful interference of a foreign ambassador in the internal
affairs of a country."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "Portafolio", an economic weekly,
Frechette had questioned the credibility of the House of
Representatives' Accusation Committee, which is investigating
Samper over allegations that drug traffickers had contributed
funds to his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is accustomed to going against all the norms
of international diplomacy in its belief that it can interfere
anywhere," Nieto Roa said.
</P>
<P>
The attorney said the U.S. government wanted the ongoing
investigation to be made public so that the world would know if
the committee was acting impartially.
</P>
<P>
But Nieto Roa said that the wisest thing that the
U.S. ambassador or any other diplomatic representative can do is
not to prejudge the work of the committee but to speak out after
the investigation has ended.

<HEADLINE> Tombs of Lost Tribe Discovered in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in China have
discovered tombs of a lost nationality that disappeared from the
face of the earth over 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Precious relics, including bronze daggers and unique pottery
belonging to the lost tribe were among the items found.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists made their discoveries in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The group of tombs, discovered for the first time, are located
in Chifeng city, in the southeastern part of the region. From the
finds it appears that the people living in the area at that time,
were more likely to have been farmers, rather than nomadic
tribes. The archaeologists concluded that the tombs were probably
for the Mo Nationality, whose living habits were more influenced
by central China, than from northern nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that the Mo Nationality was
destroyed by the Yan State in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221
BC).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the find will significantly help in the study
of the vanished nationality.
</P>
<P>
The find is just one of 16 major archaeological discoveries in
the past year in a region which is focal point for northern
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
On the northern side of the Yinshan Mountains at the western
edge of the region, archaeologists found 13 Turkish tombs from the
Sui (589-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties, city ruins dating back
to the Jin (1115-1234) and Yuan (1271-1368) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish tombs, the experts say, are unique with a stone
plate or pillar in front of them, which had not been processed.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the region, the archaeologists have
found 18 tombs dating from the Warring State Period (476 - 221
BC), the Han Dynasty (206-221), and the Northern Wei Dynasty
(386-534), which may have been the final resting place of soldiers
from central China who guarded the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Expert say that the find is valuable for comparison of burial
systems between central China and northern nomadic tribes, and
exchanges between the two systems.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the region wooden coffins were found in
a cave sealed with a stone wall. The people buried were in a
flexed position. Experts say they are the first ever found in the
region, and probably represent a new kind of culture.
</P>
<P>
The largest porcelain kiln in northern China was found in
Chifeng, where the experts unearthed kiln remains, as well as
thousands of pieces of porcelain, dating back to the Jin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
In the first capital city site of the Yuan Dynasty, in the
southeastern part of the region, silver kettles, gold earrings,
and iron saddles that are typically Mongolian were discovered.
</P>
<P>
All the finds, the experts say, have forcefully proved that the
northern nationalities have contributed to Chinese culture, and
the eventual combination of different nationalities.

</P>
<P>
Menem said that the consolidation of the Mercosur, consisting
of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, requires the joint
effort of the member countries and hoped that more will join the
economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
As for Argentina, Menem said, the government will continue the
road towards the completion of state reforms and lower
unemployment.
</P>
<P>

future strategies will consist of playing a major role in ensuring
economic growth with social equity in the countries of this region.
</P>

development of Latin America and the Caribbean lie in education,
the sector of small and medium-sized business, people's living
standards, institutional development and state reforms.

<HEADLINE> France to Partially Lift Border Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- France said Monday it will soon
lift border controls with Spain and Germany but maintain controls
with Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry communique said France had decided to
maintain border controls with the three neighboring nations until
"operational solutions" to fight drug-trafficking are available.
</P>
<P>
The communique stressed that France will not lift the controls
until the Netherlands beefs up efforts to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The French government believes drugs are flowing into the
country from the Netherlands via Belgium and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
France will officially announce the partial lifting of border
controls soon.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts interpreted the move as an effort to implement
the Schengen agreement, which aims at scrapping border controls
between Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed a year ago, allows citizens of the seven
nations to move freely across their borders.
</P>
<P>
But France has delayed full implementation of the agreement for
fear of an influx of drugs, illegal immigrants and terrorism
threats.
</P>
<P>
Other countries which have signed the Schengen agreement see
France's stance as impeding efforts to build a unified Europe.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an article written by President Jacques
Chirac for the French newspaper Liberation Monday urged
governments of European Union nations to ban the production and
sale of drugs in any form.
</P>
<P>
Although drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, modest amounts
of soft drugs are sold at so-called "coffee shops" and police
turn a blind eye to possession of small quantities of hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of "tourists" from Belgium, France and Germany visit
Dutch towns every week to buy cheap and readily-available drugs
which they often try to smuggle home.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's newly appointed
260-member Senate is scheduled to elect its speaker on April 5, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Former Senate Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan, who is among the 60
members of the previous Senate reappointed to the Upper House, has
a strong chance for being re-elected, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Former Parliament President Van Chansue is also backed for the
post by a number of new senators who reported to the parliament
Friday, but the 72-year-old Van has said he would give way to the
younger Meechai if nominated, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The list of the new 260-member Senate, proposed by Thai Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa, was unveiled last weekend following
a royal decree.
</P>
<P>
The new Senate consists of 140 active and retired officials
from the public sector and 120 people from 28 professions in the
private sector.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Legislative Committee Interrogates 31 Magistrates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 30
magistrates have been questioned over accusations of government
pressure to influence the appointment of Colombia's top prosecutor
to hamper investigations of drug money in President Samper's
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary legislative committee sent questionnaires to
nine magistrates of the Constitutional Court and 22 magistrates of
the Council of State, the National Radio Network said today.
</P>
<P>
The committee was trying to establish whether the magistrates
were aware of alleged pressure by the government or other
departments to force General Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso out of
his job early.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire was sent out after former Defense Minister
Fernando Botero said magistrates of the Council of State and the
Constitutional Court were leaned on to shorten the prosecutor's
term of office.
</P>
<P>
Botero said the move was part of a government strategy to
hamper investigations into drug-related money infiltrated into the
election campaign of President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
The two judicial bodies were charged with deciding whether
Valdivieso should hold the post of General Prosecutor for a full
four-year term, or only to complete the term of office of his
predecessor Gustavo de Greiff, who was forced to retire because of
his age.
</P>
<P>
But both bodies rejected the allegations, citing in their
defense their decision that the prosecutor should fulfill a
four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Bayer's New Joint Venture in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The German pharmaceutical group,
Bayer, had a ground-breaking ceremony for its new joint venture
Bayer Healthcare Co. Ltd. here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The diverse German multinational employs more than 140,000
people worldwide. It has put DM 450 million into joint ventures in
China.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be put into operation in the fourth
quarter of 1997. Annual sales are expected to reach DM 110 million
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bayer Chairman Manfred Schneider said that the group will put
greater emphasis on market expansion in Asia and try to double
annual sales in China from the present DM 722 million to DM 1.5
billion within the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
As part of its plan to expand research and development in
China, Bayer also signed two financial assistance agreements with
two Chinese universities in chemical technology and business
administration.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Legislation on Tourism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The draft of the law has been changed several times in the
past few years in order to keep up with the fast market changes,"
the director said.
</P>
<P>
The drafters have also studied tourism laws in other countries
to gain valuable experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another important task is revising the Provisional Regulations
Regarding Management of Travel Agencies which took effect in
1985. By the end of 1995, China had 4,926 travel agencies across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations which are expected to be issued soon,
travel agencies will be divided into two categories: those
involved in international tourism and those in domestic tourism;
instead of the present three.
</P>
<P>
The new document gives the go-ahead to international travel
agencies for overseas advertising. Under the old rules, only
Category One agencies could do so.
</P>
<P>
The travel agencies are also allowed, for the first time, to
set up branches of their own. Although they have greater autonomy,
they still have to show that they have a certain amount of
operating capital and are subject to more legal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"The new regulations are conducive to market expansion and
merging of travel agencies, and to helping improve service and to
sharpening their competitive edge," Liu Jiaxiang, general manager
of China International Travel Service, China's largest, said.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also includes a revision of the Provisional
Regulations on the Management of Tourist Guides.
</P>
<P>
The changes are intended to improve controls on guides, a
growing number of whom have become professionals in order to meet
the changing demands of the seasonal tourist market.
</P>
<P>
Still to be worked out are Regulations Regarding Tourist
Complaints, a provision of the Tourism Law.
</P>
<P>
Still in the works are the Regulations on Hotels and Tourist
Accommodations. China has said it will bring the number of hotels
up to around 4,000, with a total of 650,000 rooms, by the year
2000, Feng said.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Legislation on Tourism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China is working on more tourism
laws in a move to help the fast-growing tourism industry reach an
ambitious goal in 15 years, tourism authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
China's first Tourism Law and several rules and regulations
dealing with travel agencies, hotel management, tourist
complaints, and tourist guides are being worked out, according to
Feng Zongsu, director of the Policy and Law Department of the
China National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has been one of the fastest-growing sectors in China's
economy in recent years. According to the Madrid-based World
Tourism Organization, China ranked fifth in the world in overseas
tourist arrivals in 1995, and ninth in foreign exchange earnings
from that.
</P>
<P>
However, the income from tourism accounts for only 3.5 percent
of China's GDP, as compared with 10 percent in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to narrow that gap, the Chinese Government has set the
goal of becoming the major tourist country in Asia by the year
2000, and one of the strongest in the world in 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation will give the industry a sharp edge," Feng
said. In explaining the Tourism Law, he told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview that the law essentially defines government
guidelines and policies on tourism and the industry's place in the
national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
Also important is providing a legal basis for government
coordination.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination is very important because, as a multi-faceted
industry, tourism has connections with other sectors such as
transportation and relics protection," Feng explained.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination is perhaps more important in China since it has
to shake loose of the fetters of decades of a rigidly planned
economy and jump free of the restrictive traditional distribution
of labor," Feng went on.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Law also explicitly states the necessary
qualifications, responsibilities, and rights of people running
businesses, with emphasis being placed on regulation by law
instead of simply by administrative means.
</P>
<P>
The law provides protection for tourists and states their
responsibilities, such as environmental protection and proper
behavior.

SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in
Latin America slowed down in 1995 with an increase of 0.6 percent
in gross domestic product, the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The region registered a 5 percent increase in 1994, according
to the report, which was made public here today.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in economic growth in the region indicated a
decline in per capita income in real terms as the population
outgrew the GDP, said the IBD report.
</P>
<P>
The average GDP increase in Latin American countries last year
would be 4.2 percent, if Mexico and Argentina were excluded.
Mexico registered a drop of close to 7 percent and Argentina, a
drop of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The IDB report also showed that investments in the region only
increased 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments decreased by 12.8 percent in Argentina,
25.4 percent in Mexico and 8.6 percent in Venezuela but increased
by 22 percent in Colombia, 20 percent in Peru, 20 percent in
Brazil and 52.5 percent in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The region's deficits in current accounts reduced from 46
billion dollars to 30.5 billion last year.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A corner of northwest China's
Gansu province has become a haven for hundreds of wild and rare
animals.
</P>
<P>
They are being helped by the 10,000 strong population who are
doing their best to help preserve their neighbors from the animal
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The natural environment in the northern part of the province is
said to be well suited to wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Inside the Mongolia Autonomous County of Northern Gansu has
become home to 174 various kinds of wild animals, 32 of them under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
The animal inhabitants include white lipped deer, wild yak,
snow leopard, lynx, brown bear, argali sheep, snow pheasant and
Tibetan Gazelle, and they are often found roaming the county's
mountainous pasture areas.
</P>
<P>
Located in the western tip of the Hexi Corridor, the Mongolia
Autonomous County of Northern Gansu covers an area of 66,000 sq km
and has a population of over 10,000. Most of the county's area is
located 3,000 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
The county now takes the top position in Gansu Province in
terms of its varieties, and distribution of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The county has set up wild animal protection zones since the
1980s, and local people are prohibited from hunting wild animals.
</P>
<P>
As a result the number of wild animals has increased
rapidly. Based on the active protection of wild animals, the
county has established a hunting field for foreign hunters, making
a profit of over 600,000 yuan for the county.

British middle distance runner Diane Modahl, it was announced on

<HEADLINE> Major Astonished at EU Ban on British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
expressed his "astonishment" today at the decision made by the
European Commission to impose a total ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said the angry premier telephoned
Jacques Santer, the European Commission President, that he was
sending a team of senior UK scientists on Tuesday to Brussels to
explain why British beef was safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
Since last Wednesday, Britain has been haunted by the new of
potential link between Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), now
generally known as "mad cow" disease, and its deadly human
equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jacob disease (JCD), and even the world has
been greatly alarmed.
</P>
<P>
With the six billion US dollars been industry facing ruin as
princes plummeted, the British government is trying every means to
soothe the public fears.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell told the parliament this
afternoon that the government medical advisors have concluded that
the risk from eating British been is very small.
</P>
<P>
Children are unlikely to be more at risk from the human form of
mad cow disease than adults.
</P>
<P>
And sick people, pregnant women and people on
immuno-suppressive drugs are unlikely to be at increase risk too,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it is safe to consume gelatine and milk, and there
is no scientific proof of a link between BSE and JCD, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's efforts seem not effective as four
big fast food chains have now stopped serving British beef.
</P>
<P>
Schools across the country have also written off been from
dinner menus.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Consumers' Association said in a statement today that
the government's advice had done nothing to answer the key
concerns about British beef.

<HEADLINE> EU Recommends Ban on Exports of British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- After a whole day meeting the
European Union's(EU) Scientific Veterinary Committee today voted
unanimously except British delegation to recommand a definite ban
on all exports of beef and other related products from the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler said that the ban extends to live
animals to sperm and embryo as well as the meat of cattle which
have been slaughtered or will be slaughtered in Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commissioner, the ban also includes all the
products made from beef and veal which are used for medicinal and
cosmetic purposes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the member states which have adopted certain
traditional measures should also bring their measures in line with
this decision.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom has been asked to report to the European
Commission on a fortnightly basis on the implementation of the
protective measures.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's decision, Mr. Fischler stressed that "the
first and foremost aim is to ensure that consumers are properly
protected".
</P>
<P>
But the decision was called by a British delegate to the
meeting as "rushed, unscientific and proportional".
</P>
<P>
The Committee's recommendation would carry considerable weight
with the EC, which takes the final decision, probably on
wednesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Tighten Controls On Arms Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cameron Commission of
Inquiry Into South Africa's Arms Industry today recommended
tighter controls on the arms trade.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was contained in the commission's second
report released here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by Judge Edwin Cameron, was appointed
by President Nelson Mandela to comment on the appropriateness of
South Africa's arms trade policy.
</P>
<P>
The commission's first report, released in June last year,
dealt with the alleged sale of AK-47 rifles to Lebanon by South
Africa's leading military manufacturer Armscor.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the official release of the
report, Commissioner Lawrence Nathan, producer of the report,
said the primary goal of a new export policy should be to
restrict the transfer of arms.
</P>
<P>
''The political, ethical, legal and strategic reasons for
exercising restraint should take precedence over the economic and
commercial motivation for selling arms,'' said Nathan.
</P>
<P>
He also recommended that South Africa should adopt criteria
and rules for determining to which countries it may or may not
sell arms. The rules should be embodied in a code of conduct
empowered by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the broad criteria should be that South Africa only
sell to internationally recognized countries and not to countries
under military rule or where human rights violations have taken
place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commission Chairman Cameron told the media
conference that South Africa had in the past exported arms to
virtually ''every dirty scrap in the world''.
</P>
<P>
Cameron said there was evidence arms had gone to civil
conflicts in countries including the former Yugoslavia, Lebanon,
Yemen, Rwanda and the Sudan.

LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- About 110 members of the
opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) in Northwestern
province today defected from ZDC and re-joined the ruling

and tell the people the truth about the party's achievements and
plans."

JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's presidency of the
European Union (EU) in July would help South Africa achieve
better access to Europe's markets, visiting Irish President Mary
Robinson said today.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who arrived in South Africa Monday, is now paying a
four-day state visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint sitting of parliament, Robinson said
Ireland is keen to develop commercial, trading and investment
links with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the trade mission accompanying this visit will deepen
these bilateral links," said Robinson, adding Ireland's EU
presidency would let them highlight the need to agree on better
access for South Africa to the wider European market.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, European foreign ministers met in Brussels and
approved a long-awaited negotiating mandate for a free trade
agreement with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers gave the commission a minimum list of
agricultural products that had to be excluded from the proposed
agreement. The exclusion was largely resulted from German, French
and Spainish pressure and accounted for about 38.63 percent of
present trade between the EU and South Africa.

ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministry said

<HEADLINE> Ankara Expresses Regret over Put-off of Turk-EU Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry today
reminded the European Union that the delay of a planned Turco-EU
Association Council meeting would lead Turkey to reasses its
obligations toward the EU.
</P>
<P>
Athens' determined veto prevented the meeting scheduled today
during which a draft declaration was to be made praising Turkey's
offer of "unconditional dialogue" between the two rival
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement blaming the
postponement on Greece. The statement said the put-off was due to
factors outside the scope of the customs union and therefore was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Ankara pointed out that any failure to carry out obligations
by the EU was "an attitude that had legal consequences".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local press quoted a senior foreign ministry
official as saying that Ankara still clung to its olive branch
offered to Athens by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's offer was not a move to lift
the Greek veto before the Association Council," said the
official. "This is an important offer which opens a new front to
Turkey and we hope that Greece will accept it after
deliberation."
