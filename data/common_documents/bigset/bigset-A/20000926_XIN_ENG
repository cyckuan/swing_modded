<HEADLINE> Chirac Orders Investigation into Posthumous Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday ordered an investigation into a posthumous tape in which
Chirac was accused of illegally collecting fund for his Gaullist
Rally for the Republic (RPR).
</P>
<P>
Chirac asked Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to carry out the
investigation in the fiscal administration under the Ministry of
Finance after judicial authorities found last weekend that former
Minister of Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn was involved in the
tape affair.
</P>
<P>
In the tape which was made three years ago, Jean-Claude Mery, a
property developer who died of cancer in 1999, accused Chirac of
getting tens of millions of U.S. dollars of kickbacks for the RPR
through housing contracts from the 1980s through the 1990s, when
Chirac was mayor of Paris and prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Investigating judges found last weekend that Strauss-Kahn
obtained the tape in 1998 and he knew the people involved in
making the tape.
</P>
<P>
One of the persons involved in the scandal, Parisian fiscal
lawyer Alain Belot who served as an advisor for Mery, said that
the tape was secretly made in 1996 by one of his friends Arnaud
Hamelin, a journalist.
</P>
<P>
Belot said he gave a copy of the tape to Strauss-Kahn in 1998
and then the original one in 1999, in order to seek a deal of
fiscal arrangement for the famous dressmaker Karl Lagerfeld who
was his customer.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn, used to be an important figure of the Socialist
Party, resigned in November, 1999 due to alleged involvement in a
financial scandal.

<HEADLINE> San San May Take Part in Another Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Lee Lai-shan, Hong Kong's
only world-class athlete, was thinking about taking part in one
more Olympic Games after she finished sixth in the women's event
at the Games in Sydney Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility that I will take part in one more
Olympic Games," said San San, a winner of the gold medal at the
Atlanta Games four years ago. "I'll take my time and make a
decision before the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
She finished 21st in the final race of the women's mistral
windsurfing, leaving her sixth overall at the end of a thoroughly
demolishing week. Her final placing just about summed up her
competition and that of Hong Kong in general at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
"I tried my best. But things didn't go as well as I expected.
The level of competition was much different from four years ago,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the reason why she could not break into the top three
in any one race was due to the fact she failed to read the wind
conditions and that she was physically drained midway through the
race.
</P>
<P>
San San said that she would go on holiday to San Francisco in
November. Before that, she will first take part in the Asian
Continental Windsurfing Championship that will be held in Hong
Kong in the last week of October.
</P>
<P>
The lure of another Asian Games, where she is the defending
gold medalist, and another Olympics will probably see San San go
for gold again.

<HEADLINE> Nothing Found in Inner Chamber of Coffin of Laoshan Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Nothing has been found inside
the coffin's inner chamber at the Laoshan tomb in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists found only decorative patterns of silk fabrics
when the outer chamber of the ancient tomb was opened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A senior archaeologist said thieves had stolen everything in
the coffin.
</P>
<P>
It took archeologists half a day today to open the lid of the
coffin inside the tomb dating back to the Western Han Dynasty (206
B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The tomb was accidentally found early this year. Archeological
excavations have continued since then.
</P>
<P>
The 12-meter-tall tomb occupies an area half the size of a
football field.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wuyu, who is in charge of the excavation, said some of the
unearthed objects from the Laoshan tomb indicate that the tomb
occupant was a king of the Yan Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Phase out Minibuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will phase out the
operation of minibuses in inner part of the city as from today,
including the major avenues in the central part of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The ban signals the beginning of the end of these minibuses
which have been operating in the city since 1984, when the city
had insufficient public transport.
</P>
<P>
But the minibuses have been blamed for many problems in the
city. They randomly stop to pick up or let passengers alight,
which block the flow of traffic and emit excessive amounts of
pollution from their environmentally-unsound exhaust pipes.
</P>
<P>
There are 33 minibus companies with 3,800 minibuses. They
employ about 8,000 people and carry 191 million passengers
annually.
</P>
<P>
The minibuses will be gradually replaced with petroleum- or
electric-driven buses.

<HEADLINE> GCC Ministers Slam Iraqi Threat Against Kuwait, Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Information ministers of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states on Tuesday condemned
Iraq's fresh verbal campaign against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, during their 11th meeting in the Saudi capital
Riyadh, were referring to the remarks made by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein during a cabinet meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was quoted by the official Iraq News Agency as saying
that with the support of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the United States
has been able to continue enforcing no-fly zones and keep Iraq
under United Nations sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president urged Kuwait and Saudi Arabia not to push
Iraq "to the brink of confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are providing bases for U.S. and
British aircraft to take off to patrol the no-fly zone in southern
Iraq. The U.S. and Britain are using bases in Turkey to monitor
another no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 heavily-equipped U.S. ground troops are also deployed
in northern Kuwait, near the southern border of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The GCC officials also criticized Baghdad for ignoring relevant
international resolutions and objecting to the Arab and
international initiatives that aim at ending the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq, imposed since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Besides Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the GCC also includes Bahrain,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, who have resumed links
with Iraq in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army Manufactures Armored Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's army has manufactured "
Sayyad armored vehicle" which is resistant to mortar and artillery
shells, a military officer was quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The armored vehicle was tested successfully in the "Zolfaqar-3"
military exercise held from Friday to Sunday near the border with
Iraq, said Brigadier General Zaafari, who is in charge of the self-
sufficiency campaign of the army's ground force.
</P>
<P>
The armored vehicle, which has high speed and is significantly
small in size, can carry three to six soldiers, according to the
officer.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is capable of being equipped with missiles and
rocket launchers and artillery batteries as well as machine guns
and telecommunication devices.
</P>
<P>
The armored vehicle is named after General Ali Sayyad Shiriazi,
former deputy commander of the joint staff of the armed forces who
was assassinated in front of his home in Tehran on April 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based Iranian military opposition Mujaheddin Khalq
Organization claimed responsibility for the attack and other
terrorist operations inside Iran.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Position on Jerusalem Still Clear: Arafat's Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu-Rudienah said here Tuesday that the
Palestinian position on Jerusalem and its holy sites as well as the
other final-status issues is still clear.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed now is a new Israeli position and genuine U.S.
efforts to force Israel to implement the signed accords," Abu-
Rudienah told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He termed Arafat's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Monday evening as an appraisal meeting of the current
Palestinian-Israeli contacts and a review of the United States,
European and Arab efforts to push forward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, U.S. President Bill Clinton called the two
leaders to express his country's readiness to make every possible
effort to salvage the peace process and urged the two sides to
break the deadlock of the peace talks, Abu-Rudienah added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the peace process is still facing a crisis and
that there are not sufficient positive indicators. Efforts are
still being made around the clock to break the deadlock and revive
the Palestinian-Israeli peace track, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official deemed the coming days as being very
difficult and decisive, noting that the last meeting between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Arafat reached an agreement on giving
four to five weeks as a "new chance" to the peace process. "The new
deadline has started and is eroding away quickly," he warned.
</P>
<P>
There is a pressing need for a positive response from the
Israeli side to the international legitimacy resolutions and the
signed accords, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, seized by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war and later annexed by the Jewish state, to be the
capital of their future independent state. However, Israel insists
that Jerusalem is its "eternal and undivided" capital, a stance not
internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is the main stumbling block in the peace
talks between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Egypt Discuss Trial of Bulgarians in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bulgarian Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov on Tuesday discussed with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak the trial in Libya of six Bulgarians accused of
deliberately infecting nearly 400 children with AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Kostov told reporters after meeting with Mubarak that he raised
the issue with the Egyptian leader, explaining the Bulgarian point
of view on the case.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak showed understanding for the Bulgarian stance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria demands a fair trial by Libya, he added.
</P>
<P>
The six Bulgarians, five nurses and a doctor, have been accused
of injecting 393 children with AIDS virus. Twenty-three of them
have already died. The trial is set to resume on October 7.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has been lobbying Egypt to support endeavors to ensure
a fair and objective trial.
</P>
<P>
Kostov, who arrived in Cairo Monday night for a two-day visit,
also held talks Tuesday with his Egyptian counterpart Atef Obeid on
ways of promoting economic and trade cooperation between Bulgaria
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-
Meguid to discuss the Bulgarian-Arab relations.

<HEADLINE> Planes to Be Sprayed in UAE to Prevent Rift Valley Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) authorities Tuesday said that all planes coming from areas
infected with Rift Valley Fever will be sprayed with pesticides at
UAE airports.
</P>
<P>
Strict inspections will also be carried out on all imported
animal feed to ensure that it was free from insects and mosquitoes,
according to a meeting attended by all relevant authorities in
Emirates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to add Djibouti to the blacklist of
countries with banned livestock, which includes Yemen and some
African countries, reported the official news agency.
</P>
<P>
The participants recommended the launch of an intensive campaign
to spray mosquitoes throughout the country, particularly border
areas and entry ports.
</P>
<P>
The deadly fever, which broke out in parts of Saudi Arabia, has
already prompted the UAE Public Health Department to take actions
to prevent the disease from reaching the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has intensified checks
on live animals in quarantine; at the same time, the UAE
municipalities will ensure that slaughtered animals are safe for
human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The disease has reportedly killed more than 16 people and
hospitalized others in southern Saudi Arabia. The symptoms of the
disease appear in the form of very high fever, extensive blood
diarrhoea and dysfunction of kidneys.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Seeking more Funds for Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Forestry Commission of
Zimbabwe Tuesday said it is seeking for more funds for its rural
afforestation program.
</P>
<P>
Sipho Moyo, an high-ranking official with the commission, told
the Zimbabwe News Agency that the commission had set aside 80
million Zimbabwean dollars (1.6 million U.S. dollars) for its
afforestation program this year. But the amount, according to him,
was far from enough.
</P>
<P>
He said deforestation quickened up recently in farming and
forestry areas where war veterans and other people had cleared
woodland for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Firewood is now in greater demand in rural areas as paraffin
and electricity prices have increased.
</P>
<P>
Taking into all these elements, Moyo said the commission would
need at least ato double the present allocation to stay on top of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the afforestation program has been a success over the
years despite the unfavorable situation.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization is training farmers to produce more
seedlings on a profitable basis, adding that between 10 and 14
million seedlings are produced annually by farmers in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
About 43 percent of Zimbabwe's territory is covered by forest,
according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Western Countries Urged to Make Deeds in Fighting AIDS in Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An American HIV/AIDS expert
Tuesday said it is high time the developed countries do some
substantial work in stead of only complaining about the worsening
HIV/AIDS situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Richard Marlink of Harvard Aids Institute of the United States,
said in an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency here that
doctors in the western countries should have more intensive
collaboration with their African colleagues.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 people are dying annually from AIDS related
diseases in Zimbabwe, in contrast to a number of about 30,000
victims in the U. S., according to the American expert.
</P>
<P>
Marlink urged traditional medicine doctors and western trained
doctors in Africa to learn from each other, and collaborate in
their common work of combating HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe experts said tests show that traditional herbs used
together with conventional medicine could help control worsening
of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of those affected by the deadly disease in
Zimbabwe are using or have used traditional medicine in curing it,
but most of them have done so secretly. Zimbabwe currently has a
total of 45,000 registered traditional doctors and less than 2,000
western trained ones, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Ruling Party Denounces Victory Declaration Before Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The ruling party's
presidential candidate of Zanzibar, Tanzania's semi-autonomous
region, has condemned his rival's declaration of victory even
before the elections have started.
</P>
<P>
It was unwise for any party to claim victory before the
upcoming October 29 elections for any unfavorable final result
could lead to unnecessary turmoil, Tanzanian news media Tuesday
quoted the candidate as saying.
</P>
<P>
Amani Karume, running on the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)
party's ticket, told a press conference in Zanzibar Monday evening
that the scoreboard still read zero to zero, as far as he was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
He was clearly referring to an early announcement by Seif Hamad,
candidate of the opposition Civic United Front (CUF), that he had
"already won the October 29 elections."
</P>
<P>
Karume said on the occasion that conflict followed in the 1995
elections, when a local television station announced a wrong
version of the isle's presidential election results.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But with its own government and
parliament, it is a semi-autonomous region in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It will go to polls simultaneously with the mainland in the
second multi-party elections this year, choosing its own president
as well as a new leader of the Union government.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under President Salmin, claimed a narrow
victory over CUF candidate Hamad in the 1995 elections, but the
CUF refused to accept the election result, alleging that the
ballot had been rigged in Salmin's favor and has been seeking a
revenge.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Antitrust Case Sent to Appellate Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on
Tuesday sent the Microsoft antitrust case to an appeals court,
effectively delaying efforts by the government to break the
software giant into two separate entities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued as the court announced its calendar for
the 2000-2001 term starting next Monday, the court wrote that "the
direct appeal is denied, and the case is remanded to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit."
</P>
<P>
The decision amounted to a tactical victory for Microsoft in
the drawn-out legal battle. It had asked the justices to take that
course. The Justice Department wanted the Supreme Court to bypass
that step and hear arguments this winter over whether the company
must be broken up.
</P>
<P>
The court acted on an 8-1 vote, with Justice Stephen G. Breyer
dissenting.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft is seeking to overturn U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson's ruling that it engaged in illegally anti-
competitive conduct. The judge in June ordered the company split
in two, one to develop personal computer operating systems and the
other to specialize in software applications. But he postponed
enforcement of the order during Microsoft's appeal.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said after Tuesday's court
action that "we've always said we're confident that this will be
overturned on appeal, whether it was heard by the Supreme Court or
the Court of Appeals."
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said, "We look
forward to presenting our case to the Court of Appeals as
expeditiously as possible."
</P>
<P>
A federal law allows major antitrust cases to skip the appeals
court step and move straight from a trial court to the Supreme
Court if the justices grant direct review.
</P>
<P>
But Microsoft urged the justices not to do so, contending the
case is too complicated and that the appeals court should "clear
out the procedural and factual underbrush first."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said taking the case through the appeals
court would delay a final ruling by at least a year. A long
appeals process "could irreparably harm competition in a vital and
rapidly evolving sector of the national economy," government
lawyers contended.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft sought to take its appeal first to the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia because that court
has reversed Jackson's decisions on Microsoft-related matters
twice in the past. The Justice Department wanted to avoid the
Court of Appeals for the same reason.

<HEADLINE> Former Secret Agent Testifies in Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A defected
former Libyan secret agent testified on Tuesday behind screens in
the Lockerbie trial.
</P>
<P>
The witness, identified as Abdul Majid Giaka, told the court
that he used to work undercover as an assistant manager in Malta
for the Libyan Arab Airlines along with Abdel Basset al-Megrahi
and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, the two Libyans accused of planting a
bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 which exploded over Lockerbie in
December 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Giaka told the court that Fahima had kept some explosives in
his drawer in the airport office since 1986. "Fahima told me he
had had 10 kilograms of TNT delivered by Abdel Basset (Megrahi).
He opened the drawer and there were two boxes which contained a
yellowish material."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Libyan intelligence had ordered him to take
charge of the explosives after Fahima was called back to Libya in
late 1988. But Giaka said that he refused and handed the
explosives to the Libyan consul in Malta.
</P>
<P>
The witness told the court that the defendants had collected a
suitcase from the baggage carousel and took it through the customs
without opening it for inspection one evening in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claim that the two Libyan accused placed a
suitcase bomb onto a Frankfurt-bound plane in Malta and the
unaccompanied suitcase was then transferred to the New York-bound
Pan Am flight in the German airport.
</P>
<P>
The former secret agent, who became a CIA mole shortly before
the December 1988 mid-air bombing, is considered a key witness in
the Lockerbie trial that is being held under an agreement with
Libya. The mass murder case is being tried under Scottish law at
a Scottish court on Dutch soil in a former United States air force
base.
</P>
<P>
Giaka's testimony in court was postponed several times due to
the fact that the defense team had required more information from
the CIA.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Demands West Timor Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday reiterated the demand that Indonesia
quickly disarm the militiamen in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the 15-member council was briefed on what
occurred in Atambua, West Timor, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the militiamen in West Timor attacked policemen,
demanding the return of their weapons which they surrendered
Saturday in the first step of what the United Nations and
Indonesia hope will be a total disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The clash happened near a mission of the United Nations, where
three foreign aid workers were slaughtered by a militia mob on
September 6. The militiamen are intent on destabilizing U.N.-
administered East Timor transition to self-rule and preventing 120,
000 East Timorese refugees languishing in squalid camps in West
Timor from returning home.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, the Security Council expressed it
deep concern that the United Nations personnel were once again
threatened by armed militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its call for the government of Indonesia
to disarm and disband the militiamen in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ambassador to the United Nations
Makarim Wibisono wrote a letter to the Security Council Tuesday to
inform it of the developments in the militia weapons collection in
West Timor.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Wibsono said that his government had decided to
extend the period for the voluntary surrendering of weapons from
September 25 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that date, strict enforcement measures would be taken
against those who are found to be illegally in possession of
weapons, the ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE to Launch Mini FTSE 100 Index Futures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) - The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) announced on
Tuesday that it will launch its Mini FTSE 100 Index futures
contract on October 17.
</P>
<P>
The Mini FTSE 100 Index futures contract is a smaller contract
size version of the existing FTSE 1-- Index futures contract and
has been developed for the private investor.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that just like the highly popular e-mini S&AMP;P 500
futures contract in the U.S. market, the Mini FTSE 100 Index
future contract will enable the retail investor to trade in the
movement of the entire FTSE 100 Index for a fraction of its cost.
</P>
<P>
Karen Dixon, LIFFE's Marketing Director, said: "This is one of
a number of exciting initiatives that form part of our equities
strategy, announced three weeks ago, aimed at opening the doors to
a wider trading community."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the launch, Dan Casey, marketing and development
managing director at LIFFE, said, "The Mini FTSE 100 Index futures
contract brings index futures trading closer to the private
investor through its smaller contract size and smaller margin
requirement."

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Regrets New Iraqi Rhetoric Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on Tuesday voiced regret over Iraq's
fresh rhetoric campaign against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, saying the
Iraqi offence will not help heal the crack in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"I regret the continuation of the Iraqi threats against Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia," said Sheikh Sabah, who is also acting prime
minister, in a statement to the official Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Iraqi leadership will turn to what's better for the
Arab and Muslim nations" and halt launching threats against its
neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah was commenting on remarks made on Monday by Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein, who warned Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to
stop provoking Baghdad by offering logistic support to the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
But Iraqi Information Minister Humam Abd Al-Khaliq said later
Monday that Iraq had no intention to attack Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah stressed that as the Arab world is witnessing
significant events including the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks,
continuous Iraqi threats against Kuwait would do no good to cement
the rupture within the Arab nation since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq annoyed Kuwait early this month by accusing the oil-rich
Gulf state of stealing Iraqi oil in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait vehemently rejected the Iraqi allegation and accused
Baghdad of trying to trigger a new regional war.

<HEADLINE> Israel's GDP Growth This Year May Be Higher than Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics reported Tuesday that Israel's gross domestic product
(GDP) may rise 5 to 6 percent in the year 2000, higher than an
early forecast of 4.5 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected increase is mainly attributed to the
flourishing "new economy" companies, such as the Internet, bio-
technology, or other high-tech start-ups, and the halt of the
downslide in most of the traditional industries, bureau officials
said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The updated 2000 GDP outlook was based on statistics from
January through July this year, which showed a more driving
economic recovery than expected.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have predicted earlier that they expect GDP
growth to near 4.5 percent this year, which is already well in
excess of the government's official 3 percent growth target for
2000.
</P>
<P>
The higher GDP growth rate should be accompanied by accelerated
imports of capital goods and higher private consumption, the bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew just 2 percent last year, its lowest pace in
the decade. The GDP growth data for 1998 is 2.2 percent, and that
for 1997 2.9 percent, a trend showing a three-year-long economic
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
However, the tendency was turned around in late 1999, during
which the nation's GDP surged at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
But economists warned that the pace of economic recovery has
been slowing down recently, although they still don't know if the
trend is temporary or more lasting. If the trend continues, the
figures in the 2001 will be affected, they claimed.

DAMASCUS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said here on Tuesday that his country supports the call for
lifting the United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Following his second round of talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz Tuesday afternoon, Shareh told reporters that "
the ban has become unjustified as it is the Iraqi people who have
been suffering."

"Syria supports relieving the Iraqi people's sufferings, taking

Shareh. "Syria voiced this position during the meetings of the U.N.
General Assembly and Arab League and in Syria's mass media," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials should pay visits to Baghdad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz, who is here on his second visit since bilateral
relations were normalized in 1997, said the "tour was aimed at
exchanging views on bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
He added "I hope that there will be good ties between the two
neighborly and sisterly states so as to discuss issues of mutual
concern."
</P>

The Iraqi official arrived here Monday evening on a two-day
visit to Syria. He has met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Says Too Early to Decide Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
said Tuesday it is too early to decide who will be the next prime
minister in the new government, the official NNA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud made the remark after his meeting with dozens of newly-
elected parliament members in the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Murr announced Monday that he did not
think that it was clear who will assume the post.
</P>
<P>
But billionaire ex-premier Rafik Hariri was seen by local press
as the "sole" candidate to head the new government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese constitution stipulates that the post of premier is for
a Sunni Muslim who is designated by the president and must get the
nod of two thirds of the parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Hariri scored a landslide victory in the just-ended
parliamentary elections. He and his allies took 65 seats in the
128-seat parliament. But he has been at odds with Lahoud, since he
resigned the premiership in 1998 after Lahoud was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Transportation Najib Mikati, the
only candidate who can compete with Hariri for premiership, has
said that he has no intention to be the leader in the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Nabih Berri made a 24-hour visit to Damascus over the
weekend for meetings with Syrian leaders. Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon with 35,000 troops stationed in the country, has
announced publicly that it will not intervene the designation of
premiership because it "is Lebanon's internal issue."
</P>
<P>
Berri met with Hariri shortly after his return from Syria and
tried to mediate a reconciliation between Hariri and Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud has said he has "the same distance with all possible
premiership candidates." But it seems that he will not make an easy
consensus with Hariri about the new government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Talks with Iran: Former FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli legislator David
Levy said Tuesday that he turned down diplomatic overtures from
Iran when he was foreign minister early this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Levy revealed that over the
past year, Iran and other sources put out feelers about secret-
channel talks with Israel, though the two Mideast powers are
technically at war.
</P>
<P>
However, Levy said, Israel rejected all these attempts after
cautious reviewing and weighing the implications of these talks,
such as that on diplomatic relations with the United States, who
regarded Iran as a regional devil.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say for sure why they wanted to hold contacts but the
result of them was one big question mark. Things were not ripe,"
stated Levy.
</P>
<P>
The former foreign minister, who resigned from his portfolio for
disputes with Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the style of peace
talks with the Palestinians and the formation of Barak's government
last August, had refrained from issuing public remarks since his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Iran had diplomatic relations during the late shah's
era. But after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, its spiritual
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini cut off ties with the Jewish
state. Since then, the two countries have been painting each other
as major strategic threat to the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel also charged Iran with assisting Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas, who had inflicted heavy casualties on Israel troops
when they occupied a so-called security-zone in south Lebanon, and
forced Israel to withdraw in May after 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran test-launched a Shehab-3 ballistic missile and
declared it a success. The 1,300-kilometer range missile could
reach targets across Israel, which prompted Israel to test Arrow-2
anti-ballistic missile system earlier this month.

<P>
Barak also noted that after the three-hour meeting, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiation teams already flew to the United States to
launch another round of peace talks, trying to iron out their
disputes on core issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem and the
return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
These issues were deal-breakers at last July's Camp David summit
between Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Monday
night's meeting between Barak and Arafat was their first after the
Camp David failure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak's top aide Danny Yatom said the two leaders held
most of their talks at Barak's residence in central Israel alone,
and he didn't know if there were breakthroughs. However, he
stressed that both leaders felt the time pressure for a peace deal
and they are all committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition parties sharply attacked Barak's
handling with the peace track at Tuesday's special Knesset session
in summer recess.
</P>
<P>
Likud legislator Uzi Landau, a leading hawkish figure, even
termed Barak's negotiation style as "street prostitution." He said
Barak is so desperate to reach a deal with the Palestinians that he
nearly gave up everything and caved in to every demand made by
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
But lawmaker Colette Avital, from Barak's One Israel coalition,
defended the prime minister by saying that Barak put Israel's
security before everything else. She also believed that Israel and
the Palestinians will continue to make peace progress.

<HEADLINE> First Iranian-Made Plane Ready for Test Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The first Iranian-made
passenger plane rolled off the production line on Tuesday and is
ready for test flight, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane, called "Iran 140," will begin operation after 60 days
of testing, said Minister of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics Ali
Shamkhani after inspecting the plane's production line.
</P>
<P>
He said the plane would formally join the national air fleet
during the "10-day dawn" period (February 1-11) marking the 21th
anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani described the features of the plane as high
maneuverability, low fuel consumption and low engine noise.
</P>
<P>
He said the plane is able to fly at an altitude of 25,000 feet
(about 7,620 meters) with a cruise speed of 575 kilometers per
hour. It can transport 52 passengers and has a flight range of 2,
100 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, his ministry has so far received
orders for 127 planes and that 12 planes would be produced
annually.
</P>
<P>
As the plane has been built completely by Iranian experts, it
reflects an important development in the country's plane building
industry, Shamkhani said.

<HEADLINE> Jail Sentences Upheld on Islamist Journalists in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's highest court on Tuesday
confirmed the jail sentences on three Islamist journalists accused
of libelling the country's agriculture minister.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Court of Cassation against the three
staffers at the bi-weekly newspaper Al-Shaab upheld a lower court
ruling in April and cannot be further appealed, state-run Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab is the mouthpiece of the Islamist-oriented Labor Party,
which, along with the newspaper, was suspended in May.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's editor in chief, Magdi Ahmed Hussein, and
reporter Salah Bedawi were both sentenced to two years in prison,
while cartoonist Essam Hanafi was condemned to one year behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
The three were also fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds (about 5,500 U.
S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The fines were also confirmed by the Court of Cassation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab launched a campaign starting in spring 1999 against
Agriculture Minister Youssef Wali, accusing him of abusing his
power and sabotaging Egyptian agriculture in collaboration with
Israeli intelligent agents.
</P>
<P>
Hussein had also been sentenced for libel in February 1998, when
he got one year in prison for accusing the son of former interior
minister, Hassan al-Alfi, of using his father's position to make
illegal profits. But that sentence was annulled after he served
four months in prison.
</P>
<P>
Six journalists have been sentenced to prison for libel in Egypt
since December 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for
Information, Transport and Communications Msaalia Mudavadi said
here Tuesday that Kenya upholds the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi made the remarks at a reception marking the 51st
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
hosted by Chinese ambassador to Kenya An Yongyu.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Mudavadi said Kenya, like China,
adheres to the principle of national sovereignty, peaceful
settlement of international disputes and the Charter of the United
Nations, and on the basis of these principles, Kenya upholds the "
One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the government and people of Kenya, he conveyed to
the Chinese government and people warm congratulations and best
wishes on the occasion of China's national day.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and Kenya enjoy cordial and warm relations
dating back to Kenya's independence in 1963, saying the recent
exchanges of visits by leaders and senior government officials of
the two countries have served to enhance political, cultural and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Financial and technical assistance from China has played a
crucial role in the development of our infrastructure,
particularly in the areas of road construction and sports
facilities. China has certainly become one of the leading partners
for our development, " he added.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, ambassador An briefed the guests on China's
economic development since 1978 and China's consistent policy on
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Kenyan relations have been developing steadily
with the expansion of bilateral cooperation and continuous
exchanges of high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador emphasized, "China always treasures Sino-Kenyan
friendship and is ready to make great efforts, together with Kenya,
to bring our long-term, stable and mutual beneficial friendly
relations and comprehensive cooperation into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Attending the reception were some 500 people including Kenyan
Minister for Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas Biwott, Minister
for Education Stephen Musyoka, Minister for Energy Francis
Masakhalia and other senior government officials as well as

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's main opposition
party, the former rebel movement Renamo, on Tuesday announced that
it would stage "peaceful demonstrations" throughout the country
from the end of this month to protest against the unfair general
election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a Maputo press conference, Renamo's Secretary-general Joao
Alexandre insisted, despite an earlier supreme court ruling not in
his favor, that the incumbent President Joaquim Chissano won last
year's elections through fraudulent methods.
</P>
<P>
He called for a re-count of the votes or new elections,
threatening to divide the country into two, if his party could not
get its will.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999 elections, Chissano was declared by the National
Elections Commission (CNE) on 22 December 1999, winner of the
general elections. The Frelimo, current ruling party led by him,
won 133 seats in the parliament, while Renamo and its allies
wining 117 parliamentary seats in the same elections.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Hutu Parties Refuse Change of Peace Negotiation Venue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Some pro-Hutu parties
in the Burundi peace talks, popularly known as G-7, Tuesday said
that it was too early to move the venue of the peace negotiations
to Bujumbura, Brundi's capital from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The cease-fire agreement is still not in place, how do we move
to Burundi?", asked a delegate representing the parties at a
plenary session of the peace talks in Tanzania's northern tourist
town of Arusha, which has hosted the negotiations for more than
two years.
</P>
<P>
The parties made the refusal in response to a recent
declaration by Burundian President Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, that
the next "big" meeting of the negotiations would take place in
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Tutsi parties in the negotiation are arguing that the
time has come to take the talks back home for implementation of
the peace accord signed earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, violence has continued in Burundi. Thirteen people,
including women and children, were reportedly killed near the
capital Bujumbura last week.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people have been killed in the seven-year
ethnic civil war triggered by the assassination of Burundi's first
democratically elected president, Melchoir Ndadaye, a Hutu, by
Tutsi paratroopers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
During a recent summit on Burundi peace held in Nairobi,
dissident Hutu rebel groups, the CNDD-FDD and FNL, had failed to
start cease-fire talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The summit gave the rebels 30 days to agree upon a cease-fire,
and that the peace mediators would be trying to get them to
another meeting as soon as possible to discuss a cease-fire date,
said Bomani.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive question of the transition leadership is also
supposed to be decided upon within 30 days of the signing of the
accord. But the delegates had not yet made any decision on the
issue, said the report.

ATHENS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday refused to make
any comments on Sunday's presidential and general elections in
Yugoslavia, but said that it would expect the final official
results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government could not make any comments on the
elections in Yugoslavia now because the final results were not
announced in that country, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Calling on all sides in Yugoslavia to display caution and calm
while the votes are counted, Reppas said that the Greek government
would wait for the final official results that would be announced

He also hoped that Yugoslavia, which is now isolated by the
Western countries, could get out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's opponent, Vojislav
Kostunica, has claimed victory in the elections, but the ruling
party insists that President Milosevic still leads the count.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 481 Million Dollars in U.N. "Oil-for-Food" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported 18.1
million barrels of oil last week, earning an additional 481
million U.S. dollars for the United Nations humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, the United Nations Office of Iraq Program said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The office, which administers the U.N. humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, reported that in the week to September 22, the U.N.
Security Council sanctions committee approved one new contract for
the sale of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the phase VIII of the "oil-for-food"
program on June 9, Iraq has exported 220.1 million barrels for a
total revenue of around 5.5 billion dollars, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that since the first oil exports under the
program began on December 10, 1996, Iraq has exported just over 2,
050 million barrels with a value of over 34.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total value of contracts on hold in all sectors has reached
2 billion, and the highest level of holds is in the transport and
telecommunications sector with over 45 percent of all circulated
contracts in this sector having been placed on hold, the office
reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution establishing the "oil-for-
food program," 66 percent of earning goes to fund the country's
humanitarian needs and 30 percent is directed to the Compensation
Commission which pays claims arising from Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The remainder goes to pay the costs of the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission and U.N. operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted until the United
Nations clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arm inspectors have been away from Iraq since the U.S.-
led military air strikes against the country in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russia Chides West for Interference in Yugoslav Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's top lawmaker on
Tuesday criticized western countries for their "interference in
Yugoslavia's internal affairs" following the September 24
presidential elections in the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma ( lower house of
parliament), said he was "shocked by a statement made by British
Foreign Secretary Mr. (Robin) Cook, who actually recognized
Vojislav Kostunica's victory before the results of the
presidential elections were made public."
</P>
<P>
Kostunica is the opposition candidate in the presidential race
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"This is gross interference in a sovereign country's affairs,
it is in fact blackmail and a provocation -- to additionally stir
up people who have already taken to Belgrade's streets in an
agitated condition," the Interfax news agency quoted Seleznyov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the West believes that in the event of what they consider
to be the victory of their candidate they will feel at ease, then
I doubt so very much," Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
It would be most appropriate for everybody to wait for an
official promulgation of the results of the presidential elections
in Yugoslavia, Seleznyov noted.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry circulated a
statement on the Yugoslav elections, calling on all political
forces in the Balkan country to refrain from confrontational
actions.
</P>
<P>
"Already the first round of the presidential elections has
revealed a considerable democratic potential in Yugoslav society,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that civil peace and stability in the country be
preserved now and that all political forces refrain from
confrontational actions," the document said.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of who will become the legitimate Yugoslav
president, Yugoslavia must be urgently taken out of international
isolation, and the sanctions imposed upon it by western countries
must be lifted," the statement said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-sponsored
Cyprus proximity talks concluded Tuesday with no breakthrough at
the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Alvaro de Soto, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's special advisor on Cyprus, said the 14-day talks
between the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, who attended the talks as leader of
the Greek Cypriots, were useful in stimulating discussions on core
issues that have kept the island divided for years.
</P>
<P>
Soto said a further round of talks is scheduled from November 1
to 10 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Soto said he will visit Cyprus in October for consultations for
the new round talks.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with a blackout, the special advisor was tight-
lipped about the details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth round of talks between the two men since the
current series began in New York last December.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite
Cyprus as a bizonal, bi-communal federation, as prescribed in U.N.
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since troops from Turkey
took over the north in 1974 in reaction to a coup in Nicosia

<HEADLINE> Russian Rocket Sends Five Foreign Satellites Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A Russian intercontinental
ballistic missile on Tuesday launched five foreign satellites into
orbit, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RS-20 Satan rocket, designated in the West as SS-18,
blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 2:05 p.m.
Moscow time (1115GMT).
</P>
<P>
Aside from launching the satellites, the other main aim of the
project is to confirm an extension for operating these types of
missiles in Russia's Strategic Missiles Forces, Interfax quoted a
spokesman for the forces as saying.
</P>
<P>
The latest launch was the third attempt, after launches on
August 25 and 26 were canceled at the last minute for technical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The RS-20, a prototype of the new booster Dnepr, launched two
satellites each for Italy and Saudi Arabia and one for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Megsat space vehicle, weighing 56 kilograms, is
designed for environment control and is equipped with transmitting
devices for commercial use. Its second vehicle, Unisat, weighing
10 kilograms and belonging to the University of Rome, will be used
for educational and scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Saudisat-1A and Saudisat-1B satellites, weighing 10
kilograms each, are designed for educational and scientific tasks.
</P>
<P>
The fifth vehicle, the Tiungsat satellite weighing 52 kilograms
and belonging to a Malaysian state company, is equipped with
instruments for distant probing of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The RS-20 will be renamed the Dnepr after a cycle of tests and
certification, Russia's Strategic Missiles Forces reported.

Medical experts announced the result of their examination on
Tuesday morning and the cow is to be killed and destroyed later on
while 74 other cows raised along with the diseased cow will be
under close screening for the disease.
</P>
<P>
The possible cause of the newly-discovered madcow disease was
said to have well rooted at the time when the cow was born. In
the early 1990s, Belgium did not ban the use of cattle feed made
of cattle bones and other parts that were not used for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Later research found that animal feed made of the brain and
bones of the diseased cattle can spread the disease to other
animals. Official bans were later put in place to stop using
cattle brain and bones to make animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The madcow disease, formally known as the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or as BSE for short, was first found in Britain in
1985 and up to 150,000 heads of madcow cattle have been found in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Britain announced in March 1996 that the BSE is somewhat
related to a human variation known as the Creutzfeld Jacob disease
that has so far killed upwards of 30 people in Britain alone.

MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Strategic Missile
Forces on Tuesday test-launched a Topol-M intercontinental
ballistic missile from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
Strategic Missile Forces spokesman Colonel Islet Baichurin said
the test's main goal was "to confirm the combat characteristics of
the missile complex, which will make the nucleus of the Russian

<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the
Communist Party of China (CPC) here today expressed the hope to
further cooperation and exchanges within the labor workforce
between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks in
a meeting with Saito Kunihiko, president of the Japan Institute of
Labor, and his delegation.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU) briefed the guests on China's political and
economic situation and the work of China's trade unions.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, it is extremely important for China's trade
unions to participate in and deal with labor issues so as to
protect the workers' interests in accordance with laws.
</P>
<P>
In China, one of the key measures for adjusting labor relations
and ensuring the democratic rights of workers is to guarantee the
role of worker's congress system in the enterprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kunihiko said his organization has good relations with China,
adding that with different historic and cultural traditions, all
countries should adopt measures tailoring to their own conditions
in dealing with labor issues.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that his organization will further cooperate
with its Chinese counterparts in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov will visit Cyprus on October 10 for talks with the Cypriot
government, Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Developments on Cyprus issue following the fourth round of U.N.-

Russian-Cypriot relations will be the focus of Ivanov's discussions
in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Ivanov is expected to meet Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, who will returns from New York on Thursday, and
have talks with his Cypriot counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Four rounds of United Nations-sponsored proximity talks on
Cyprus have been held since last December in an effort to find a
way leading to a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's Cyprus trip will coincide with the 40th anniversary of
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cyprus and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
After Nicosia, Ivanov will visit Athens on October 11 for talks
with the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
His Athens talks are expected to focus on the situation in the
Balkans and the Cyprus issue.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Lusaka confirmed
on Tuesday that over 7,000 Angolan refugees have entered
northwestern Zambia over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 of these refugees are scattered in villages along
the border area and are expected to move to transit centers in the

Bajulaiye.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees entered Zambia through Mwinilunga district
following intensified military activities in the eastern part of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
If the current influx continues, the number of refugees
expected by September 30 may top 10,000, he said, explaining that
an emergency response mechanism has now fully been activated in
response.
</P>
<P>
According to Bajulaiye, some 4,000 refugees were reported to
have entered Zambia through Mwinilunga last Sunday but the number

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's population was up to
30,750,000 from the previous record of about 30,500,000, largely
due to an increase in the number of immigrants, Statistics Canada
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Between July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000, more than 205,000
immigrants arrived to contribute to a population growth of 256,700,
compared with a growth rate of 245,500 for the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The population would have seen a decrease without immigration
as the number of births fell by 5,000 while deaths increased by 6,
000.
</P>
<P>
Ontario and Alberta recorded the highest growth rate of 1.3
percent among the country's 13 provinces and territories, of which
Newfoundland, Saskatchewan and Yukon suffered declines as a result
of migration to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
All other provinces and territories registered a population
growth of at least 1,000 such as in Nova Scotia, to more than 35,
000 as in British Columbia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer confidence
rose slightly in September after an August fall, The Conference
Board said Tuesday in a survey.
</P>
<P>
The board, one of the prominent business research groups, said
its consumer confidence index now stands at 141.9, up from the
revised 140.8 in August, but well below the record level of 144.7
in January and May.
</P>
<P>
"Despite higher gasoline prices this summer and the prospect of
higher heating oil costs this winter, consumers remain in an
upbeat mood," Said Lynn Franco, director of The Conference Board's
Consumer Research Center. "Nothing in this latest survey suggests
the economy will run out of steam soon."
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index is based on a representative
sample of 5,000 U.S. households. The index is widely watched as a
barometer of the U.S. economy in the next six months because
consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are more upbeat in September, according to the survey.
The percentage of consumers who rated current business conditions
as "good" rose to 48.9 percent from 46.2 percent in the previous
month and consumers rating conditions as "bad" rose slightly from
8.6 to 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are also more optimistic about the short-term outlook.
The percentage expecting an improvement in business conditions
over the next six months increased to 18.4 percent, up from 17.2
percent in August, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion anticipating conditions to worsen, however, rose
moderately from 5.4 percent to 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The employment outlook is also more favorable. Consumers
expecting more jobs to become available in the coming months rose
to 17.9 percent from 17.1 percent in August and those claiming
jobs were "hard to get" dropped to 10.7 percent from 11.5 percent
last month, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
But the survey said income prospects were less optimistic.
Currently, only 27.3 percent of consumers anticipate an increase
in their income, down from 28.6 percent in August.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Candidate Countries to Prepare for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday that it is time for candidate countries to start preparing
for the introduction of the euro, EU's single currency.
</P>
<P>
If companies from candidate countries in the central and
eastern Europe fail to see this, they are mistaken about the role
of the euro, said the European Commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1, 2002, financial transactions in the euro-zone
should be carried out with the euro only. The Commission, with
support of the European Parliament, has launched an information
campaign to make candidate countries aware of the impact of the
change on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Companies from the 15-nation EU and its candidate countries,
public administrations and the media are invited to exchange views
on the effect and strategic implications of the cash changeover.
</P>
<P>
"Given the de facto increasing integration of candidate
countries with the euro-zone economy, the Commission will take a
pro-active approach in helping them prepare for the euro while at
the same time intensifying our information campaign for companies
and citizens within Europe," EU Commissioner for Economic and
Monetary Affairs Pedro Solbes said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that businesses from the candidate countries
can benefit from further integration with the euro-zone economy.
</P>
<P>
It will take time but the first companies to adapt themselves
to the new environment will undoubtedly draw the largest benefits,
the Commission said.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts to Develop Super-economical Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday it has launched a research project on lightweight
materials for a new type of super-economic car in a bid to avoid
serious dependence on petrol and diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, said the
project was launched as "Europe recovers from the recent protests
over fuel prices, and the realization of just how dependent we are
on petrol and diesel fuel".
</P>
<P>
The fund for the project totals 5.2 million euros (4.5 million
U.S. dollars), of which 50 percent comes from the commission and
another 50 percent from other partners.
</P>
<P>
Lightweight materials, expected to cut the vehicle's weight by
about 40 percent, will help lower the petrol consumption in cars
and drastically reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at producing the materials, which are low-cost
carbon composites, by 2004 for a prototype car traveling 100 KM on
just one liter of diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
"This research project is a joint effort by the car industry,
research laboratories and materials producers to give at least a
partial answer to the question of Europe's dependence on oil," EU
Commissioner for Research Philippe Busquin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The commission said an ultra-lightweight version of
Volkswagen's Lupo TDI should be ready for production and whether
the development of the new type of car is successful will be
determined by the cost of production.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
committed to making Hong Kong the information technology hub of
Asia, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting Carrie

</P>
<P>
Yau said IT had become an indispensable element in the daily
lives of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"One in two households now has a computer at home. Over one-
third, or 2.5 million of our population, are Internet users. In
fact, IT has touched on almost all aspects of our everyday life,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yau noted that there was still a lack of understanding
of the use of IT in certain sectors in the community.
</P>
<P>
The IT campaign is aimed at promoting the use of IT in all
sectors of the community to ensure that all people in Hong Kong
enjoy the benefits brought about by technological advances and to
make Hong Kong a leading digital city in the region.

<HEADLINE> HK Lighting Industry Backed by Strong Export Growth: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The strong growth in
lighting export has strengthened Hong Kong's status as the souring
center of lighting products in Asia, according to a recent report
released Tuesday by the Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has enjoyed double-digit increases in total exports
of lighting products since last year, and the export figure
registered another 21 percent rise in the first seven months this
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
And Exports to major markets such as the United States, the EU
and Japan grew by 25 percent, 22 percent and 20 percent
respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
Such strong growth was mainly spurred by increases in
construction activities and home purchases in the United States,
which stimulated the demand for indoor electric lighting items,
and back up by improved consumer confidence in the EU and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports of lighting products in 1999 reached
10,628 million Hong Kong dollars (1,362 million U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces seized
some 1,000 kilograms of drugs over the past 48 hours during armed
conflicts with drug smugglers in the southeastern Kerman Province.
</P>
<P>
A drug band involved in the production and distribution of
narcotic drugs was also busted in the province during the same
period, the official IRNA news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Brigadier General Abbas Ali Roohi, commander of the
security forces in the province, three armed smugglers were killed
and dozens of others arrested during the operations.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become common in Iran as it sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from the eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian Gulf, Europe
and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran closed down 725 kilometers of its borders with
Afghanistan as part of the stepped-up effort to fight drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (parliament) has also earmarked 200 billion rials
(about 24.4 million U.S. dollars) in credits to block the eastern
borders from drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 740 drug traffickers and 174 Iranian police officers
were killed in narcotics-related confrontations, according to

<HEADLINE> Summit to Consolidate Ties Between OPEC Members: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Relations between member states
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will be
consolidated through their upcoming summit in Caracas, Venezuela,
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda will be improving ties among OPEC members and
turning the bloc into a determining force in the world's economic
affairs, Khatami told reporters before his departure for the summit
to be held on September 27-28.
</P>
<P>
He said that although OPEC is not the sole supplier of oil and
energy in the world, it plays a very important role in this regard,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the summit will put emphasis on
upgrading solidarity among OPEC member states, instead of seeking
to set oil prices and production ceiling, which are mainly decided
in OPEC ministerial meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Caracas summit is aimed at bringing about further
convergence among OPEC member states and finding long-term
mechanisms for activating and strengthening the organization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also criticized the profiteering attitude of major oil
consuming countries, which, he said, led to high taxes and cost for
oil products, thus contributing to the soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He urged major oil consuming countries to give up their unjust
profiteering attitude and cooperate with oil producing countries in
bringing stability to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh and Economy and Finance Minister Hussein Namazi are
accompanying Khatami during his visit to Caracas.
</P>
<P>
This year's summit is the second in the 40-year history of OPEC.
The first summit was held in the Algerian capital of Algiers in
1975.
</P>
<P>
The organization was established in Baghdad, Iraq, in 1960 and
currently has 11 members, namely Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Algeria, Nigeria, Libya
and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Institute Energy Conservation Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it will soon announce definite energy conservation
measures to cushion the impact of another oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
In his regular press briefing, Press Secretary and Presidential
Spokesman Ricardo Puno said there is already an existing Executive
Order which mandates a 10 percent cut in energy consumption in all
government offices.
</P>
<P>
"But the specifics of that and exactly what will be doe is
still being worked out," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that studies are now being made so that all these
measures will be listed down, to include such things as cutting
the use of air conditioners or the use of motor vehicles in
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Puno pointed out that not only the government but the private
sector as well would be encouraged to reduce energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
He said this is a worldwide effort and even developed countries
are also trying to encourage economy measures among consumers of
oil products.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that the oil companies may increase their
products by an average of 1.50 pesos (0.03 U.S. dollar) per liter,
Puno said all that the government can do is to exercise persuasion.
</P>
<P>
He added that based on the computation of the Department of
Energy and a private consumer price watch group, the increase in
the price of fuel should not be more than 1.20 pesos (0.027 dollar)
per liter.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the
economic advisers of President Joseph Estrada will come out in two
days with their recommendation on the proposal to temporarily
reduce the excise tax on socially sensitive oil products.
</P>
<P>
He said this issue needs to be carefully studied considering
that potential losses to the government may amount to 1 billion
pesos (22 million dollars) in just three months if the excise tax
on diesel and liquefied petroleum gas alone are reduced.

<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Tuesday sought India's cooperation for construction
of the proposed Ganges Barrage in Bangladesh while meeting with a
visiting Indian state minister.
</P>
<P>
Hasina also called for regional cooperation in harnessing water
resources for their optimum use when visiting Indian State
Minister for Water Resources Sreemati Bijoya Chakraborti called on
the prime minister at her office.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said steps are being taken for dredging rivers to tame
the intensity of flood and an afforestation program in reclaimed
lands for maintaining ecological balance and human habitation has
been launched.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister observed that regional cooperation is
important for proper utilization of water resources. If India
agrees, such cooperation would be possible, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Indian state minister, who arrived here Monday to discuss
mainly water-related issues, said both India and Bangladesh are
exchanging information about flood forecasting.
</P>
<P>
Possible cooperation in combating arsenic contamination of
ground water and development of information technology also came
up for discussion during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said arsenic contamination of water has become a major
problem in the country, noting that it is common for both India
and Bangladesh. She said a delegation of parliamentary standing
committee on water resources ministry would soon visit India to
exchange the experiences on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Praising India's development in the IT sector, the prime
minister said her government is giving various incentives to
develop the sector in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day visit in the country, the Indian state
minister will also hold official talks with Bangladeshi Water
Resources Minister Abdur Razzak.

</P>
<P>
Chuan said though the two countries are far away geographically,
Thailand can serve as a gateway of Romania to the Southeast Asia
while Romania can be a gateway of Thailand to the eastern and
central Europe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> -Feature: Farewell to Slum Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Hamida Banu, 40, is now at home
with all her family members at village Pathalia, near northern
Jamalpur town, bidding farewell to the slum life she lived for
eight years long, with smile on her face.
</P>
<P>
Her home-coming has become possible thanks to Ghare Fera (
Return Home), an ambitious credit program of the government of
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that helps slum people return to
villages.
</P>
<P>
"I am really happy with my seven-member family in my tiny house
on the bank of the might Brahmaputra river," said Hamida, looking
back to the horrendous life in Dhaka's Khilgaon slum.
</P>
<P>
Driven by poverty, Hamida left her home in the small village
with her kids and her crippled husband, Abdul Gafur, in search of
a better life, but landed at the slum at last.
</P>
<P>
Hamida along with her 22-year-old son Rubel launched a serious
fight against poverty, but failed to tame it. Her son did not
yield to the threat to his life from terrorists for denial to be
involved in illegal trade with them.
</P>
<P>
Defeated in the fight, Hamida heard about the government's
Ghare Fera program for rehabilitation of the rootless slum people
and decided to try her luck again.
</P>
<P>
She went to the Bangladesh Krishi (agriculture) Bank (BKB), the
implementing agency of the program, for a loan of 20,000 taka (400
U.S. dollars) and got the money without much trouble, which is
uncommon in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Hamida bought two paddle rickshaws, three goats and invested 7,
000 taka (140 dollars) in her cloth trade with the credit. She is
now earning on an average 6,000 taka (120 dollars) a month. She
has already repaid 7,000 taka (140 dollars) of the credit in a
year after she got the credit.
</P>
<P>
"Now I am living a better life here. I won't leave my house for
a slum again," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other slum dwellers who got the credit from the BKB
like Hamida are benefiting from the program and live a better life.
Anjuara Begum of Dhakin Koidula village of Jamalpur district, who
also returned to her village, narrated a similar story.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was launched in May, 1999 to improve the
quality of life and ease the overcrowding in the capital and other
cities, over 11,000 slum people were rehabilitated till last June
under the credit program, BKB officials said.
</P>
<P>
The BKB so far has disbursed 31,125,000 taka (622,500 dollars)
as loan at the interest rate of 10 percent among 10,450 slum
families. The recipients of the credit are reaping benefits and
improving the quality of life through investment, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the BKB provides credit to those slum
dwellers who have at least a piece of land at their villages. A
high-profile team headed by the managing director of the BKB is
overseeing the implementation of the program.
</P>
<P>
According to BKB sources, around 1.8 million people, or about
20 percent of the total population of the capital, live in the
shanties in Dhaka. The growth of slum people during 1981-1999
period was 45.52 percent, the highest in the last 29 years.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting in Sri Lanka leaves 30 dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops launched
Tuesday fresh offensive against separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in
the north of the country, killing 17 rebels but losing 13 soldiers,
a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said government troops backed by artillery guns
and aircraft mounted the offensive in the early hours of the day
and successfully completed by 9:00 a.m. Approximately a 10-square
kilometers area near the town of Sarasalai in the Jaffna peninsula
has been recaptured.
</P>
<P>
Five soldiers were killed and 30 others were wounded in the
offensive while another eight died and 15 more were wounded during
consolidation of their positions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the losses among the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were not immediately known, but 17 rebels were
killed in three separate clashes in surrounding areas Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest victory came five days after the military said it
had retaken the town of Chavakachcheri from LTTE following a three-
stage offensive which began on September 3.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE mounted a ferocious counter attack in April this year
and took the main entrance to the Jaffna peninsula known as the
Elephant Pass. The Peninsula has been under government forces
control after its capital town of Jaffna was recaptured in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tiger rebels have been locked in a bitter war with
government forces since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Government forces have stepped up their attack against Tamil
Tiger rebels in the north of the country in recent days. The move
is widely believed to be part of the election campaign strategy of
ruling People's Alliance (PA) in an attempt to win over more
voters.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka told a PA election
rally recently that the better equipped and strengthened
government forces were demolishing the LTTE strongholds and
recapturing areas which the terrorist group captured in April.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident the forces would recapture Elephant Pass, by
the day we are going to polls on October 10," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan nutrition expert
Tuesday suggested a diet based on local food as a way to combat
the widespread malnutrition in the country, the official news
agency Angop reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina Pinto, an expert with an Angolan youth organization,
was quoted as saying that local children should eat more food made
of maize, beans, peanuts and cassava leaves because these things
are rich in hydrocarbon, ferrum, vitamin A, protein, fat and fiber.
</P>
<P>
The nutritious elements will help reduce an alarming
malnutrition rate of some 80 percent among Angolan children, Pinto
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the food based on these local produce has a similar
nutritive value to those more expensive products like milk powder,
which is usually out of the reach of many ordinary families.

PRAGUE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Trevor Andrew Manuel, chairman
of the 55th Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (
IMF) and the World Bank, urged Tuesday the two financial
institutions to ensure that the globalization benefits all nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the annual meetings, Manuel
said that at the beginning of a new millennium, "we live in a
world of unprecedented prosperity, but it is also a world of
unprecedented inequality and poverty."
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank and the IMF should oversee the process
of globalization, and facilitate the integration of all countries
into the global economy in a mutually beneficial way.
</P>
<P>
Horst Kohler, managing director of the IMF, warned in his
opening address that the IMF is facing two major challenges of
poverty and the international private capital flows, which could
lead to volatility and crisis.
</P>
<P>
He called on the IMF to cooperate with other financial
institutions in safeguarding the stability of the international
financial system, aimed at long-term non-inflationary economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Group President James D. Wolfensohn said the
developed countries should increase their aid to the developing
countries and dismantle trade barriers to poor nations.

<HEADLINE> Many Asian Firms Holding Back on Internet Investment: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of Asian
executives showed that many Asian business are holding back on
heavy investment in new technology though they generally agreed
that the Internet would increase competition.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey were unveiled at the Asian Wall
Street Journal First CEO Technology Summit in Hong Kong Monday,
and compiled from interviews with 500 senior executives in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
The survey found an impressive pace of change for companies
that had taken the plunge, especially considering that many were
still recovering from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
For example, 69 percent of those polled said their companies
had a Website, and nearly a third had had their websites for less
than a year and just under a quarter for between one and two years.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that many of the company sites simply
offered non-interactive information on goods and services; only 15
percent let customers make online transactions.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get a clearer sense of how Asian executives
really saw the Internet," said Reginald Chua, editor of the Asian
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
Despite a stated optimism about opportunities the Internet
offers, many companies and executives hesitate to seize them. Less
than half the companies surveyed had assigned someone to explore
online business ventures.
</P>
<P>
"E-business should not be viewed as a radical shift in the
fundamentals of business, but more as evolution of businesses as
they move into a more efficient, networked and customer-centric
business environment," said Anthony Lipp, e-business partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that Asian companies with regional or
international operations tend to have more sophisticated Websites
and are more likely to say they see the Internet fueling not just
opportunities but competition.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Assistance for Landmine Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Tuesday urged the
international community to help clear the mines in some areas
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The country had established a national task force to implement
the Ottawa Convention on Anti-personnel Mines with a comprehensive
action program, but among the problems remained was the lack of
resources and qualified personnel, said Deputy Foreign Minister
Valentine Kayope.
</P>
<P>
He urged the rich countries to give the much needed equipment,
financial assistance, and help training a multidisciplinary mine
clearing team of 30 people.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister told a visiting U.S. delegation
that despite Zambia's landmine problem was less severe than some
of the other countries in Africa, but scattered mine fields were
also widespread along the country's borders with Angola,
Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe, as well as areas around former
rebels' bases.
</P>
<P>
Six of the country's nine provinces had landmine problems,
which posed a threat to the country's development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation, to which Kayope talked, arrived here on
Monday for a five-day assessment trip on landmine problem.

<HEADLINE> Tertiary Industry Contributes More to GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An senior official with the State Development Planning
Commission said today that some 47 percent of the country's GDP
will come from the tertiary industry during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
"Development of the tertiary industry is a significant part of
China's Ninth Five-Year Plan. Since 1996, the industry has
continued to grow and many sectors in the industry have become new
forces boosting the country's economic growth," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the added value of the tertiary
industry increased by 660 billion yuan from 1996 to 1999, an
annual increase of 8.18 percent. It accounted for 32.9 percent of
the national GDP growth, up from 30.1 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 million people have entered the tertiary industry
during the same period, accounting for more than 60 percent of the
country's total. Both first and second industries saw a fall in
employment, down 0.4 and 0.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the tertiary industry will play an even
more important role in attracting labor force and promoting
economic growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Fundamental reforms have been carried out in the industry
during the period. The telecom sector broke its monopoly and is
set to introduce an effective management method. The housing
sector abolished the welfare housing system, and introduced
regulations on opening second-hand housing market. China also
allows insurance capital into the securities market.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and telecommunications also grew at an incredible speed.
From 1996 to 2000, China earned 14.1 billion U.S. dollars and 283.
1 billion yuan from tourism. There are 200 million phone
subscribers in China, with 65 million mobile phone users.

<HEADLINE> Employment in Agriculture Declines in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- During the period of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan(19967-2000), employment in agriculture
declined to such a degree that, for the first time, it accounted
for less than 50 percent of the total working force.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Development Planning Commission, with
the quickening of industrialization and readjusting of industrial
structure, employment in industry saw a minor increase and
employment in the tertiary industry increased very rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there was a tendency for people to shift from
public and collective units to private businesses and by the end
of 1999, private businesses were employing 39.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the pro-active financial policy adopted by the
central government, the overall employment scale was expanded. By
the end of 2000, the registered unemployment rate is expected to
stand at less than 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, during the period of the Ninth Five-
Year Plan, the urban working force pool increased by 19.21 million
people and in rural areas it increased by 7.18 million.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, registered unemployed urban residents
amounted to 5.75 million and registered unemployment rate stood at
3.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Barak Tries to Regroup Ruling Coalition Before Peace Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Tuesday confirmed that he is trying to regroup his minority
coalition to prepare for tough parliamentary battles ahead of
possible peace breakthrough with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told Jerusalem Post's website that
negotiations between his One Israel party and four Knesset
(Parliament) factions for their joining the coalition are under
way.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four possible ruling partners, Shinui, Democratic
Choice party and One Nation party, are all secular and left-wing
parties. The fourth, the dovish Meretz, never quit the coalition,
but its ministers resigned from the cabinet in June. Barak hopes to
re-invite the party into his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The four parties will boost Barak's coalition, which now only
controls 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset, to 50 seats in face of
the forthcoming winter parliamentary session that will begin at the
end of October. Such an alliance will still need 10 votes of the
Israeli Arab parties outside the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yosef Lapid, party leader of the Shinui, said Tuesday morning
that his party is poised to join the government. He indicated that
the party had been promised two portfolios. One of them is
reportedly the communications portfolio, which is currently held by
Barak's confidant Binyamin Ben Eliezer.
</P>
<P>
Shinui's secular fellow Meretz also held a central committee
meeting Monday night to discuss its relations with Barak's
government.
</P>
<P>
The committee laid out a series of conditions, including the
continuing efforts by Barak to carry out secular reform and try
hard in peace talks with the Palestinians and Syria, for the
party's rejoining the government. The party also demanded regaining
the three portfolios which it abandoned in June.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised last July after taking office that he will bring
any peace agreement with the Palestinians to the Knesset and a
referendum for approval.
</P>
<P>
The peace process had been in deadlock since last July's Camp
David summit failed to reach a final deal due to significant gaps
between the two sides over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak and Arafat held their first meeting since Camp
David late Monday night, bringing hope to the stalled peace talks.
Although there was no breakthrough reported after the summit, the
atmosphere during the meeting was reportedly good.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiating teams, led by Israeli acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and attorney Gilad Sher and Palestinian
negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohamed Dahlan respectively, had flied
to the United States for further talks separately with American
teams.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helps Thailand Set up Independent Telecom Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States will help
Thailand establish its first independent telecom regulatory body
by offering policy and regulatory assistance, a top U.S. telecom
regulator said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conferences, William E. Kennard, visiting
chairman of the U.S. Federal Communication Commission (FCC), the U.
S. government agency which regulates telecom and broadcasting
industries, said that the setting-up of Thailand's National
Telecommunications Commission (NTC) will boost the liberalization
of the kingdom's telecom market and eventually benefit the people.
</P>
<P>
"Independent regulatory bodies will help the developing
countries such as Thailand to achieve universal telecom service
through competition, liberalization, privatization and
transparency -- the goals written in the World Trade Organization
(WTO)'s Basic Telecom Services Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between FCC and Post and Telegraph Department
of Thailand (PDT), which is the current telecom regulator in the
country, has been "productive and fruitful," according to him.
</P>
<P>
Satthapphorn Khusriphitak, PDT director-general said in the
news conference that he has discussed with Kennard on topics which
is essential to form the new regulatory agency, including
regulatory process, competition, licensing, consumers, new
technology, standardization and universal service.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is moving toward liberalizing its state-monoplized
telecom market to meet the WTO requirements about telecom
liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Rwanda Seek Compensation for Entering Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Rwanda have
tendered compensation applications for their anticipated revenue
loss when the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (
COMESA) Free Trade Area (FTA) takes effect next month, COMESA
spokesman Mweusi Karake said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted Karake as saying in an interview
that the two countries were among the first member states to apply
for compensation ahead of the launch of the FTA.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the recent sealing of an agreement between
COMESA and the European Union (EU) on the release of funds for
compensating member states which would lose revenue in the course
of implementing the FTA.
</P>
<P>
Karake said the compensation was meant to cover losses which
the two countries were expected to incur in their respective
manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
Revenue losses in the Zambian manufacturing sector for instance
had been projected at 2 percent while Rwanda's case was more
serious as its revenue loss was estimated at 4 percent, one of the
highest among the member states.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the member countries revenue losses are around 2
percent except in the case of Rwanda whose loss is the highest,"
Karake explained.
</P>
<P>
Karake said a recent study carried out in all member states had
identified priority sectors which urgently needed some form of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and agricultural sectors were found to be the
most affected in the member states and the EU would soon start
disbursing the funds to offset the losses.
</P>
<P>
The EU also pledged some funds in direct budget support once
tariff reduction was implemented under the COMESA FTA, Karake said.

<HEADLINE> Xiong Ni of China Wins springboard gold (updated with quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Ni of China became the
second diver to defend the men's 3m springboard Olympic title as
he totalled 708.72 points in the final on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The other diver who won two consecutive Olympic men's
springboard title was Greg Louganis of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He became the second diver to win medals at four Olympics,
tying Italy's Klaus Dibiasi, who accomplished the feat from 1964-
76.
</P>
<P>
"The final was very emotional, I just could not hold back tears,
" said Xiong Ni.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most difficult event for Chinese diving. In the
first three events we missed the golds. This is very unusual for
us. We were very excited and happy (about the win). The coaches
were together and we were all crying."
</P>
<P>
The final was full of drama with Russian Dmitri Saoutine led
all the way till the final round. But he faltered in his sixth and
last dive, a reverse two and a half somersaults with one and a
half twists, collecting only 65.10 points.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Ni garnered 81.60 points from his final dive, beating
Mexican Fernando Platas to the second place by a margin of 0.30
points. Saoutine, who won the platform gold four years ago at
Atlanta, finished a disappointing third at 703.20 points.
</P>
<P>
"I won the platform gold in Atlanta and wanted this event to
complete the set," said Saoutine, "I led from the beginning to the
final dive so it is very disappointing to lose. May last dive is
the most difficult in my program, so maybe it was a mistake to
include it."
</P>
<P>
Platas, who won Mexico's first medal on springboard since 1980,
said:"This medal means happiness and responsibility. That's what
we work for - everyone to be happy."
</P>
<P>
"I tried to focus on my technique, there was probably more
pressure on the other divers," said Platas. "It's the dream of any
diver to win a medal at this kind of competition."

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Absorb Foreign Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its
policy for foreign direct investment (FDI) absorption in the new
century, said a foreign trade official here today.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jingyan, director of the Foreign Investment Administration
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC),
made the remark at the opening ceremony of a 4-day trade and
economic cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that FDI absorption constitutes an important part of
China's opening-up policy. All efforts are being made to seize the
opportunities offered by economic globalization and to better
adapt to the information revolution, so as to create a stable
environment for overseas investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that China will further open its service industries and
encourage more FDI in such sectors as commerce, foreign trade,
transportation, medical service, education, finance, insurance,
telecommunication and intermediary services.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the Chinese government encourages overseas-funded
enterprises to invest in China's vast western areas, to help
perfect China's legal system, to participate in the renovation of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to restructure China's SOEs
through procurement or acquisition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also taken measures to encourage
overseas investors to introduce and develop new and high-
technologies and welcome more multinational corporations to invest
in China, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has been the biggest FDI recipient
among developing countries for seven consecutive years since 1993.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August this year, investors from more than 180
countries and regions had established over 355,600 overseas-funded
enterprises in China. Total contractual overseas investment
exceeded 640 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the top 500 transnational corporations of the world, almost
400 have invested in China. Overseas-funded enterprises have
played an important role in boosting China's economy. The majority
of these enterprises are operating well in China and have achieved
positive economic results. In 1999, the total import and export
volume of overseas-funded enterprises reached 170 billion U.S.
dollars, up 10.67% from that of 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- To resolve the water shortage
in cities is an imperative task that affects economic and social
development, daily life, as well as the country's modernization
drive and long-term development, said Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made the remark at a national conference on
water supply, water conservation and water pollution, which was
convened by the State Council in the nation's capital from
September 25-26.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged local governments at different levels to recognize
the importance of the issue and to ensure that cities achieve
sustainable development through the sustainable utilization of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
China is short of water resources, with its per-capita water
resources accounting for one fourth of the world's average,
according to Wen. Water shortage has hampered the development of
many Chinese cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to give top priority to saving water by
readjusting the industrial structure, by promoting water-
conservation technology, by strengthening water usage controls and
pushing forward the reform of water pricing.
</P>
<P>
He also called for resolute measures to control water pollution,
while making greater efforts to increase channels of water supply
for cities in a rational and scientific manner.
</P>
<P>
The media should play an important role in creating greater
awareness among the public about water shortages, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Marked Increase in External Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports
and imports showed a marked increase in August, according to
figures released Tuesday by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the value of total exports of goods (
comprising re-exports and domestic exports) increased strongly, by
18.2 percent in August over a year earlier to 147 billion Hong
Kong dollars (18.84 billion U.S. dollars). Within this total, the
value of re-exports surged by 19.5 percent, while that of domestic
exports increased by 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports also soared by 23.4 percent over a year
earlier to 150.4 billion Hong Kong dollars (19.28 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the rapid growth, a Government Secretariat
spokesman noted that total exports of goods continued to put up a
robust performance, underpinned by strong import absorption in all
the major overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Also, the intake of imports of goods for local use rose
markedly further, reflecting the pick-up in domestic demand, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months this year as a whole, the value of
total exports of goods increased considerably, by 17.2 percent
over a year earlier. Within this total, the value of re-exports
increased by 18.5 percent, and that of domestic exports by 8.3
percent.

HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, associate member

celebrating together with 158 members the World Maritime Day 2000
this week.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's celebration is "IMO: Building

The annual World Maritime Day was first held on March 17, 1978 to

</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the date, IMO's Secretary-General William
O'Neil said that the foundation stone of IMO's success had been
partnership, because the organization at its heart was a co-
operative relationship among the members who joined together in
framing, implementing and policing the standards and the rules
that governed international shipping.
</P>
<P>
"It is a partnership that has produced more than 40 conventions
and several hundred protocols and resolutions that together
provide the blueprint for a safe, environmentally friendly and
cost-effectively industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neil urged members to commit to a process of continually re-
examining the established standards and the mechanisms that had
been created for ensuring their proper, uniform implementation. He
stressed that these objectives could only be achieved through
global partnerships in a global forum.

<P>
In 1999, he said, Xinjiang's GDP was eight times that of 1978.
The region's agriculture has recorded year-on-year bumper harvests
since 1978 and cotton output has accounted for one third of China'
s total, making Xinjiang one of the major commodity cotton
producers in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Xinjiang has established a comparatively complete
industrial system. During the January-August period this year, the
region's industrial sector grew by 8.4 percent, earning 3.665
billion yuan (441.5 million U.S. dollars) in profit and putting an
end to consecutive losses from the past five years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Xinjiang has set up trade relations with
more than 70 countries and regions worldwide. In the first eight
months of this year, the total trade volume for the region reached
1.46 billion U.S. dollars, up 47.4 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Abdul'ahat Abdurixit said, Xinjiang welcomes foreign
businessmen to invest in the west-east gas transmission project,
adding, "a great number of foreign business people have
investigated and showed great interest in related projects in the
region."
</P>
<P>
He said, the region has completed a group of highways and
railways including China's longest highway which traverses the
Taklimakan, the largest desert in the country. The region has 33,
500 kilometers of highways and 3,008 kilometers of railways which
have opened to traffic. At present, Xinjiang has opened 61
domestic and international air routes.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, with a vast area and rich natural resources, has
discovered 138 kinds of minerals, 117 with proved reserves.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum reserves in the region have been estimated at 20.86
billion tons, or 30 percent of China's total petroleum resources
on land. Natural gas reserves have been estimated at 10.3 trillion
cubic meters, or 34 percent of the country's total, while coal
reserves have been estimated at 2.19 trillion tons, accounting for
40 percent of the national total.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Catholics Denounce Vatican's Planned Canonization of " Saints" (1) EDS-Details added </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Catholic church
today expressed its indignation at the Vatican's planned
canonization of 120 "saints", saying the move "distorts history".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College, the Chinese
Catholic church expressed its grave concern over the Vatican's
planned canonization of 120 Catholics "martyred in China" on
October 1, which represents an attempt to distort and tamper
history.
</P>
<P>
The statement notes that the traditions of the Catholic church
set strict requirements on canonization, including stringent
investigation and assessment procedures, so as to ensure the
canonized are worthy of the title.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese Catholic church is surprised at the
forthcoming canonization, as the Holy See has never, as required
by traditional procedures, sought comments from bishops of the
dioceses of those to be canonized and the Chinese Catholic Bishops
College, but instead, let "the bishops college of the Taiwan area"
decide everything.
</P>
<P>
This kind of giddy-headed conduct, which has ignored the
sovereignty of the Chinese Catholic church, is shocking, it says.
</P>
<P>
The procedures were confused and quite a few of those to be
canonized are notorious, the statement says. The proposed
canonization falls on October 1, which is China's National Day, a
day that marks the Chinese people getting rid of imperialist and
colonialist aggression and pillage, the statement says, and the
timing is an open insult and defiance to the Chinese people and
the Chinese Catholic church, which "we can never tolerate and
accept."
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that in the 700-year long history of the
Chinese Catholic church, there have been many great Catholics who
are patriotic and love the Church, and meanwhile, it has been a
centuries-old hope of the Chinese church to have canonized Chinese
saints.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Catholics Denounce Vatican's Planned Canonization of " Saints" (2) EDS-Details added </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, some of the foreign missionaries to be canonized by
the Holy See were accomplices of imperialists in their aggression
against China, who have committed severe crimes against the
Chinese people, while some of their followers were not martyrs of
the religion, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, while imperialist countries used
Catholic and Christian churches to serve their own interests, some
foreign missionaries acted wildly against the law and public
opinion under the protection of unequal treaties imposed on China,
which resulted in over 1,500 "religious cases" in which a large
number of Chinese people, including some innocent Chinese
Catholics, lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
The traumatic experiences have remained in the minds of the
Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic church, the statement says.
"We are not willing to recall the painful past or to open the
historical scar, but the history can never be denied nor be
covered up by anyone."
</P>
<P>
A commentary of the Vatican's official news service Fides said
"The canonization of the Chinese martyrs is a challenge to the
courage of the Beijing government", the statement notes. Such a
comment reveals the scheme of some people in the Vatican trying to
resume their control over the Chinese Catholic church, encourage
Chinese Catholics to counter the government and the law, oppose
China's socialist system and interfere in China's internal affairs
by using religious issues.
</P>
<P>
"It is a challenge not only to the Chinese government but also
to the conscience of the four million Chinese Catholics and the
feelings of the 1.2 billion Chinese people," the statement
emphasizes.

<P>
The statement cites a number of mistakes made by the Vatican,
including an erroneous decision made by the Holy See that resulted
in a century-long ban of Catholicism in ancient China; the Vatican
's demand of Chinese Catholics to remain "neutral" to Japan's
imperialist aggression against China during the 1937-45 period,
and the Vatican being the first to recognize the puppet Manchukuo
regime set up by Japanese imperialists, which had seriously hurt
the Chinese people's feelings; and the Vatican's hostile attitude
to New China after its founding and the Holy See's encouragement
of Chinese Catholics to counter the government, which once pushed
the Chinese Catholic church to the edge of precipice.
</P>
<P>
"The Vatican's erroneous China policy has caused irreparable
losses to the Chinese Catholic church," it says.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Church's entering the Third Millennium, "we
hope the Holy See would change its hostile policy toward China and
will not repeat the historical mistakes to bring about even
greater damages to evangelization of the Chinese Catholic church,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the Millennium is the year of peace as
well as the year of Confession. It strongly demands the Holy See
to confess truthfully its historical wrongdoing to the Chinese
nation, fully respect the sovereignty of the Chinese Catholic
church on the issue of canonization, fully respect the feelings of
the Chinese Catholics and stop creating barriers to improving
relations between China and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
"Let's pray to the God, for the God to grant the Church the
virtues of sincerity, justice and benevolence. Under the sacred
guidance of the God, the Chinese Catholic church will continue to
adhere to the principles of patriotism, faith to the Church, and
independence and self-management of the church, to push forward
evangelization, score successes for the Chinese Catholic church,
and safeguard the holiness and peace of the Holy Church," it says.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Militia Given Deadline to Surrender Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- East Timorese militias were
given Wednesday as the deadline to surrender their firearms,
Indonesian Defense Minister Mahfudz M.D. said here Tuesday and
vowed that the Indonesian Military (TNI) would launch raid against
the militias who refuse to hand over weapons by that time.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after attending a closed-door coordinating
meeting for social, political and security affairs, Mahfudz said
that East Timorese militia have been given time to surrender their
weapons until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We give them time until tomorrow to surrender firearms. If as
of Wednesday, they refuse to hand over weapons we will launch
raids and arrest them. We will arrest those (elements of militia)
who are found of possessing weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow is the final day for the transfer of firearms. This
is the decision of today's meeting," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to make further comment about the possible
steps that will be taken by the military if the militia group
resist the raids.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an unconfirmed report said that an exchange of fire
involving militia and U.N. soldiers broke out again on Tuesday,
along the border line between East Timor and West Timor, killing a
U.N soldier and a militia member.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the report, Mahfudz said, "I have not yet heard
such an information," he said while rushing to his car.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said that the
joint investigation team for the Atambua incident has been
intensifying their probe into those allegedly implicated in the
murder of three international workers on September 6.
</P>
<P>
"These steps have been taken to convince the international
community that we are responsive but not reactive to the U.N.
resolution No.1319/2000 as well as to make sure the Indonesian
public that the steps were taken seriously and effectively for the
sake of our national interest," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been under a strong pressure from the
international community following a bloody incident in Atambua
city, East Nusa Tenggara province, during which three
international workers were killed by militia elements.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, Darusman added, has been identified and as
many as 13 suspects were allegedly behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said that there are no obstacles that hamper the
investigation process against the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"We are given time for two weeks by the U.N. to deal with the
issue (to investigate the incident). We have taken concrete steps
on that point," he said.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese militias and many refugees entered Indonesia
last year following a ballot in August during which most people
voted for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
There are still about 130,000 East Timorese refugees in
Indonesia, most of them are in East Nusa Tenggara province
bordering with East Timor.

<HEADLINE> British Trade Deficit Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) - UK imports soared to a new
level in July to produce a record trade deficit of 3 billion U.S.
dollars, according to the latest official figures by the Office
for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The trade gap in June was 2.4 billion pounds. The import boom
was fueled by strong consumer demands - and is likely to increase
pressure for a rise in the 6 percent interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the robust level of imports highlighted the
strength of the UK domestic economy and warned that interest rates
might have to rise to restrain demand.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Juanakar, associate director of economic analysis at the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) says, "The widening of the
trade deficit remains a concern."
</P>
<P>
Underlying growth in exporting volumes is robust, helped by
expansion in overseas markets. But manufacturing export prices
continue to be under pressure with margins being squeezed," he
adds.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest CBI survey, exports have been expanded
but firms say they are still below expectations, with the high
level of the pound against the euro remaining a problem.
</P>
<P>
Britain's trading position has always been helped out by a
strong performance in the services sector. However, the surplus in
the sector in July registered 850 million pounds, down from 869
million pounds in June.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States defeated
Japan 2-1 to take the Olympic softball gold medal here Tuesday
after the Japanese committed a fatal eighth-inning error.
</P>
<P>
Before the rain poured in, Japan, who earlier ended the U.S.
women's 112-game winning streak in the preliminary rounds, held
the gold-medal favorites to just one hit and a 1-1 tie through the
regulation seven innings.
</P>
<P>
While dominating the U.S. batters in the 6th and 7th innings,
pitcher Juri Takayama struggled with her control in the 8th,
walking U.S. right fielder Leah O'Brien-Amico and second baseman
Dot Richardson to put the winning runs on base.
</P>
<P>
In the next at bat center fielder Laura Berg launched a fly
ball to left field where Japan's Shiori Koseki slipped, allowing
it to pop out of her glove as she fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Despite a fourth-place finish in the preliminary rounds, the
Americans beat the Australians 1-0 Monday night in the semifinal
en route to their eventual victory.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports of Electromechanical Products to Top 100 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imports and exports of electromechanical products from January
to August amounted to 130 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 43
percent of the country's total foreign trade volume, according to
the ministry at an ongoing meeting being held here.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, exports were 66 billion U.S. dollars and imports
were 64 billion U.S. dollars, up 40 percent and 34 percent
respectively over the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Planning Period (1996-2000), exports of
electromechanical products kept growing with a strong momentum,
with an annual increase rate of 18 percent, due to technological
innovations.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, exports of the products accounted for
40 percent over the country's total foreign trade volume, said Fan
Shande, deputy director general of the Electromechanical Products
Imports and Exports Department of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Fan said manufacturers have paid attention to technological
innovations. As a result, the varieties and functions of
electromechanical products have improved remarkably, which gave a
strong boost to exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the products are exported to more countries and
regions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Sees Booming Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China has witnessed a booming
tourism sector this year and officials estimate the number of
tourist arrivals may hit a new record.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that more than 6.11 million tourists came
to Macao in the first eight months of the year, an increase of 22.
83 percent over the same period last year. In August alone, the
number of tourist arrivals reached a monthly record of 900,974
which resulted in a growth of as high as 30.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the current situation, there lies a great chance
that the number of tourists this year will exceed that in 1996,"
Fernando Chui Sai On, secretary for social and cultural affairs of
the Macao SAR government, said Tuesday at a tourism conference.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, tourist arrivals scored the highest figure of 8.15
million in Macao with a population of about 400,000. However, the
Asian financial crisis and poor public securities in Macao in the
following years deterred tourists.
</P>
<P>
With mounting tourist arrivals this year, the occupation rate
in hotels rose 20.28 percent over the same January-August period
in 1999. In particular, the occupation rate in five-star hotels
grew 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the booming tourism is an ensuing effect of Macao'
s power transfer from Portugal to China. Macao is now better known
by the outside world. In addition, improving public security
prompts people to take Macao as a safe place for their holidays.
</P>
<P>
Tourism plays a key role in Macao's economy, yielding about 40
percent of the local GDP and employing one-third of the work force.
Hence, the SAR government gives priority to tourism development in
revitalizing the economy.
</P>
<P>
Along with the official visits of the SAR's chief executive to
France and Portugal in May, Singapore at the end of August and
Japan last week, the governmental Tourist Office organized large-
scale promotion activities to better promote Macao's tourism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Tourist Office organized delegations to attend
tourism fairs in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
Fujian Province, and other places in the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the number of tourists from the inland
areas accounted for 24.7 percent of the total. And there is
potential of more tourists, local tourism officials said.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the Tourist Office has established representative
agencies in about a dozen countries and territories to enhance the
contacts of people in tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
"The (SAR) government has spared no efforts to improve tourist
facilities and upgrade tourist service," Fernando Chui Sai On said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the Tourist Office has stationed special
inspectors at the Macao-Hong Kong Ferry Terminal and the Macao
International Airport to handle complaints from tourists. From
January to August, a total of 99 complaints were reported and 98
of which were settled.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Tourist Office put forward a new slogan --
Macao Welcomes You, which can be seen at Macao's airport, ferry
terminals, streets, buildings, bus stops and tourist sites. The
move is aimed at establishing a brand-new image for Macao so that
tourists can enjoy their stay here.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Considering Appointing Ambassador to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has said to raise its
diplomatic ties with Iraq to ambassadorial level, which is seen as
a protest of the U.S. Congress approval of a bill recognizing the
1915 killings of Armenians by Turks in the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said at the Erciyes
University in the southeastern Kayseri province Monday that the
appointment of an ambassador to Iraq was on his ministry's agenda,
Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Cem denied the potential upgrade of Turkish representation
level in Baghdad was in connection with the approval of the "
Armenian Genocide" bill by a U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
Armenia claimed that Ottoman troops massacred tens of thousands
of Armenians in 1995 and is campaigning for an international
condemnation against Ankara regarding the alleged atrocity.
</P>
<P>
The International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives will vote on Thursday on the bill.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources said that the representation upgrade
was not a new issue, adding that Turkey had been considering
appointing an ambassador to Baghdad for three months. "We've
nominated a name and are now waiting for Iraq's official
acceptance," said one source.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Minister-Counselor Mehmet Akat, who is
currently working at the Turkish Embassy in London, was nominated
as ambassador to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, Ambassador Selim Karaosmanoglu has been representing
Turkey in Baghdad at the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been learned that due to the objections of the
U.S., Turkey's ally, Ankara had backtracked and decided to postpone
the issue for some time.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the U.S. have quite different approaches towards
Baghdad. The U.S. tries to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
while Turkey wants problems concerning Iraq solved within that
country, not through outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
Ankara fears that political turmoil in Iraq could lead to an
independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has launched anti-
Ankara campaign since 1984 for self-rule in largely Kurdish-
populated southeast Turkey, bordering northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi diplomatic sources in Ankara said that they have long
asked Turkey to appoint an ambassador to Baghdad and had strongly
conveyed this message to Turkish authorities in bilateral meetings,
Turkish Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is an internal matter for Turkey, but we will very happy
if Turkey decides to appoint an ambassador to Iraq," said an Iraqi
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that despite Turkish officials' denial, the
foreign ministry's move was apparently intended to force the U.S.
administration to exert more efforts to block the bill's passage in
House committee.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Send Plane to Baghdad Within 48 Hours: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan announced Tuesday an
Jordanian plane will fly to Iraq within 48 hours, taking the lead
among the Arab states in defying the U.N. sweeping sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Necessary preparations are under way for the takeoff and the
passengers will include officials, cabinet ministers and lawmakers,
Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came following a brief meeting late Monday
between Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Ragheb and visiting Iraqi
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Jordan announced it had submitted a request
to the United Nations to allow the resumption of air links with
Baghdad and said it was awaiting an answer.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sweeping sanctions on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which includes a ban of
flight to and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, Baghdad reopened Saddam International Airport
after 10 years of idleness. Ever since, the airport has received
several foreign planes on humanitarian missions, but none from Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the most important trading partner of Jordan and also
its sole crude oil provider at a price lower than that in the
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly urged Amman to allow the planes flying to
and from Iraq to use its air space, arguing that the U.N. trade
embargo did not apply to passenger flights.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Decides to Stop Using U.S. Dollar in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to confront the
United States domination in the world economy, the Iraqi government
has made a major policy shift to replace the U.S. dollar with the
euro or any other currency in its business dealings.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has decided to stop "trading, selling and purchasing
with the dollar" and replace it with the euro or any other
currency, Iraqi Finance Minister Hikmet Mizban Ibrahim said in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was adopted at the 38th cabinet meeting, chaired by
President Saddam Hussein, on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. dollar is one of the levers of our enemy's influence
and power on both regional and international levels," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It called upon world states to follow the suit, and accused the
United States, in collaboration with the Zionist (Israel), of
designing policies "to harm the world people and jeopardize their
independence."
</P>
<P>
However, it remains to be seen how the policy will be put into
practice, as the greenback is now the sole choice of foreign
currency in the sanctions-hit country.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Arab Baath Socialist Party came into power in
Iraq in 1968, Iraq's foreign reserves and overseas transactions
have all been done in U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
As the Iraqi government has decided to dump the dollar, the most
likely currency choice will be the euro, officially launched on
January 1, 1999 by the European Union (EU) as a counter-balance to
the dollar in the world financial market as well as in the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
But is has been a clear fact that the euro has fallen steadily
against the dollar since its inception.
</P>
<P>
The euro has been relatively weak in recent months, compared
with the strong dollar behind the growingly strong U.S. economy.
The latest exchange rate between the euro and dollar was 1:0.86,
some 30 percent depreciation compared with the glorious figure of
1:1.18 when the European single currency was born.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi cabinet meeting held on September 14 made the decision
to appoint a group of financial experts to study the possibility of
replacing the dollar with another "politically correct" currency as
termed by Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the announcement of the government decision, the weak
Iraqi dinar has somewhat recovered its value, as the staggering
exchange rate between the dollar and the Iraqi dinar has fallen
from 1:2100 to 1:1900.

TOKYO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Tuesday welcomed the
results of the first-ever meeting between the defense ministers of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea
that ended earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the fact that the follow-up to the summit between
the two Koreas was held in this way," Japanese Deputy Chief
Cabinet Secretary Kosei Ueno told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"This is especially important because ...it shows the
possibility of the two Koreas making progress in confidence-
building measures not only in the political and economic fields,
but also in the area of military affairs," Ueno said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government spokesman also expressed the hope that
dialogue and exchanges between Pyongyang and Seoul will continue

<P>
GENEVA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's parliament has
approved plans to arm troops taking part in international
peacekeeping missions, media reports said here.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives on Tuesday joined the Senate in
giving the green light to the plans, which have to be finally
decided by voters in a referendum next year.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss army has been providing support for the multinational
force in Bosnia-Herzegovina since 1996 and is currently taking
part in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. The troops have not
been fully armed.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Switzerland also joined NATO's Partnership for Peace
Program, but the government repeatedly ruled out NATO membership,
saying this was incompatible with Switzerland's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
The Senate in June voted to make the deployment of the troops
dependent on a mandate by the United Nations or the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

</P>
<P>
You will be forgiven for asking this: Did Jones, the fastest
woman on the earth, know what his loving and caring husband had
done?
</P>
<P>
Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan lost her all-around gold medal
after testing positive for banned drug pseudoephedrine, which a
Romanian official said resulted from two cold medication pills
administered by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
The cold medicine that cost gold for Raducan made history for
China's Liu Xuan: She became the first Chinese woman ever to win
three gymnastic medals at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
World shot put champion Hunter, whose marriage with glamorous
Jones was described by European reporters as the one of "Beauty
and Beast", cried like a kid and vowed to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened, I don't know how it happened,"
Hunter told a news conference. "I can promise that I will defend
myself vigorously."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Alexandre de Merode, head of the International Olympic
Committee's (IOC) Medical Commission, said Hunter had tested
positive three times for nandrolone in competition, as well as an
out-of-competition positive test in Oslo in July. Hunter's tests
showed levels around 1,000 times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who began her assault at five gold medals by winning the
100m dash on Saturday, told the conference: "This has been a very
difficult couple of days and I am here pretty much to show my
support for my husband."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he could explain the positive tests, Hunter said: "I
don't know what has happened. But I can promise everybody that I'm
going to find out and you are going to know."
</P>
<P>
Raducan, who charmed audiences and impressed the judges with
nearly flawless routines, was stripped of gold medal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Olympic Committee president Ion Tiriac said Raducan
had taken two flu and cold medicine pills, one containing
pseudoephedrine and the other an over-the-counter drug.
</P>
<P>
Tiriac said pseudoephedrine is "not at all on the (banned drug)
list of the International Gymnastics Federation but is on the list
of the IOC" .
</P>
<P>
Team coach Octavian Belu threatened to withdraw the whole team
from the games.
</P>
<P>
Raducan will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)
for the IOC's decision to disqualify her from the competition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Xiong Ni defended his springboard title in most
dramatic way.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, ranked second to Russian Dmitri Saoutine before the last
dive, pulled off a flawless dive to win the gold, while Saoutine
splashed for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Xiong scored 708.72 points, beating silver medalist Fernando
Platas of Mexico by 0.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Russia hauled in three gold medals, including two in Greco-
Roman wrestling.
</P>
<P>
Varteres Samourgachev beat three-time medalist Juan Luis Maren
of Cuba 3-0 at 63kg class, while Mourat Kardanov subdued Matt
Lindland, who had to go to court to gain his place on the U.S.
Olympic team, 3-0 at 76kg.
</P>
<P>
Russia also got a gold in the synchronized swimming duet.
</P>
<P>
In the road race cycling, Dutchwoman Leontien Zijlaard
outsprinted Hanka Kupfernagel of Germany and Diana Ziliute of
Lithuania for the gold.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Ni of China became the
second diver to defend the men's 3m springboard Olympic title as
he totalled 708.72 points in the final on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The other diver who won two consecutive Olympic men's
springboard title was Greg Louganis of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He became the second diver to win medals at four Olympics,
tying Italy's Klaus Dibiasi, who accomplished the feat from 1964-
76.
</P>
<P>
The final was full of drama with Russian Dmitri Saoutine led
all the way till the final round. But he faltered in his sixth and
last dive, a reverse two and a half somersaults with one and a
half twists, collecting only 65.10 points.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Ni garnered 81.60 points from his final dive, beating
Mexican Fernando Platas to the second place by a margin of 0.30
points. Saoutine, who won the platform gold four years ago at
Atlanta, finished a disappointing third at 703.20 points.
</P>
<P>
"I won the platform gold in Atlanta and wanted this event to
complete the set," said Saoutine, "I led from the beginning to the

final dive so it is very disappointing to lose. May last dive is
the most difficult in my program, so maybe it was a mistake to
include it."
</P>
<P>
Platas, who won Mexico's first medal on springboard since 1980,
said:"This medal means happiness and responsibility. That's what
we work for - everyone to be happy."
</P>
<P>
"I tried to focus on my technique, there was probably more
pressure on the other divers," said Platas. "It's the dream of any
diver to win a medal at this kind of competition."

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Demands U.S. to Repatriate Criminal Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said China strongly demands the repatriation of
a Chinese criminal suspect from the United States as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here today at a regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
Sun said Zhang Hongbao, a Chinese national who has been
involved in crimes of rape, counterfeiting certificates and
illegal emigration, entered the United States in February
illegally.
</P>
<P>
China has made several solemn and just representations to the U.
S. and provided evidence concerning Zhang's involvement in the
crimes, demanding that the United States repatriate Zhang to China
for the benefit of law enforcement and bilateral relations
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Sun said, a U.S. immigration court has granted Zhang "
protection status from cruel penalty" on September 20. This action
by the U.S. may aid the criminal suspect in escaping necessary
punishment, and as a result, the legitimate rights of the victims
are not protected.
</P>
<P>
This is also a wanton distortion and an attack against China's
legal system, Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the actions of the U.S. also reveals its
hypocrisy in respecting the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
China has expressed strong resentment and firm opposition to
the actions made by the U.S., and strongly demands that the U.S.
correct its decision and repatriate Zhang as soon as possible, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat met in Barak's Kochav Yair home late Monday night, in what
Israeli officials were calling an attempt to "clear the air" and "
create a positive environment."
</P>
<P>
Although the two spoke briefly while attending the U.N.
millennium summit in New York earlier this month, this was their
first working meeting since the Camp David talks broke down in
July. An Israel Radio report said the meeting was proceeding in a "
very good" atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton called during the meeting and spoke
to both Barak and Arafat, the radio reported. The two told Clinton
they are determined to make every effort to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Administration will Tuesday resume separate meetings
with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in an effort to bridge the
gaps between the two sides, and examine ideas that could be
incorporated into the bridging proposals being worked out by the
American peace team.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton decided this week to defer the submission of
the proposals, but instructed the team to continue preparing them
and to present the American ideas to the sides verbally.
</P>
<P>
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Gilad Sher
will go to Washington for the talks, while Saeb Erekat and Mohammed
Dahlan will be representing the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The radar from Israel's Arrow-2 anti-ballistic missile system
succeeded in detecting the weekend test launch of a longer-range
Scud-D by Syria, Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Shaul Mofaz told
reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
Syria reportedly tested the missile over the weekend, just a
week after Israel successfully tested its Arrow-2 system. Syria's
Scud missiles have long had most of Israel within range, but the
new Scud-D, with a range of some 700 kilometers, gives Damascus the
option of deploying them deeper into Syria to better protect them.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Barak said he is concerned about the Scud-D
test. "It is definitely a development which effectively puts all of
Israel in range of Syrian missiles, and in this way it is a
negative development," Barak told reporters at the Defense Ministry
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Knesset (parliament) law committee approved Monday
the preliminary reading of an amendment to a basic law to prevent
handing Jerusalem over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The amendment bars the transfer of any municipal authority to a
non-Israeli entity.
</P>
<P>
The bill, authored by Likud lawmaker Yehoshua Matza, is expected
to be submitted to the Knesset for a vote as soon as it reconvenes
at the end of October.

MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday it is considering the use of solar power and wind energy
to bring electricity to about 4,500 villages situated in isolated
coastal communities and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Mario Tiaoqui of the Department of Energy (DOE) said
in a statement that this is in line with President Joseph Estrada'
s goal to complete the electrification of all barangays (villages)
before his term ends in 2004.
</P>
<P>
"In about half of the 9,000 barangays under our rural
electrification program, we plan to use solar, wind or micro-hydro
power," said Tiaoqui.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the Estrada administration in 1998, according
to the DOE, 26 percent of the country's barangays did not have
access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
The DOE reported the Estrada administration brought
electricity to 1,332 barangays in 1999 and facilitated the
electrification of another 215 rural barangays in the first
quarter of 2000, raising the level of barangay electrification to
77.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tiaoqui said the rural electrification program, which aims to
provide adequate and reliable electricity service to the remaining
9,714 unenergized barangays by 2004, requires an investment of
around 15 billion pesos (333 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With this huge investment requirement, the DOE has made rural
eletrification its flagship program in order to mobilize its full
resources and the support of its attached agencies and the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
It had tapped independent power producers to help the
government fill the rural electrification gap and private firms to
pool their resources and adopt a barangay that they will help
energize.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Gets Funds to Conserve Mt. Kenya Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) will provide 400 million shillings (
about 5.2 million U.S. dollars) for the protection and
conservation of the vast forest of Mt. Kenya in central Kenya,
which has been declared an international heritage site.
</P>
<P>
The funds, channeled through the Global Environment Facility,
will be used to support field-based conservation activities by non-
governmental organizations and community-based groups, the East
African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Boniface Kiteme, a program advisor with the community
management of protected areas, said the project aims to
demonstrate that sustainable livelihood approaches and other
community level intervention can help reduce threats to the forest.
</P>
<P>
Situated in central Kenya, Mt. Kenya forest is now gravely
threatened by overfelling and overgrazing, and the Kenyan
government has taken measures to ban logging in the area to save
vast natural resources.
</P>
<P>
During a recent tour to the forest, Kiteme said there is a need
to increase awareness for the protection of natural heritage sites
and promote partnerships with concerned groups at local and
national levels.
</P>
<P>
He noted that communities living around protected areas can
identify socioeconomic activities beneficial to them, including
the running of tourism facilities and park maintenance, or acting
as eco-tourism guides.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Hosts Record High Tourists in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania received a
record 570,000 tourists during the first quarter of this year,
earning the eastern African country a total of 670 million U.S.
dollars, the African newspaper reported here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia Meghji was
quoted as saying that the number of tourists visiting the country
is expected to increase during the next quarter. Tanzania is
ranked as the number one tourist destination in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said the resources generated from the tourism sector
will tremendously supplement government development programs and
efforts to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of the country's fastest growing sectors with an
average growth rate of 20 percent per annum since mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Many of the tourists are from European countries, the U.S.,
Japan, South Africa and the Republic of Korea. They come to sample
Tanzania's tourist attractions ranging from wild animals to
geographical features like Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the dramatic increase in the number of tourists is
attributed to the ministry's integrated tourism development plan
adopted last year whose priority is aggressive promotion of the
country's tourist potentials abroad.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Spain defeated China 84-64 in
their last game for a ninth-place finish in the men's basketball
competition of the Sydney Olympic Game on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After defeating European Champion Italy, a better performance
was expected from China, who started today's game slowly and
trailed 46-28 at the half-time.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 2.27-meter towering center Yao Ming, China were
outclassed under the basket and grabbed only eight rebounders to
Spain's 15 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Spain enlarged their lead after the interval with more long
shots from guard Carlos Jimenez and inside baskets by 2.18 meter
center Roberto Duenas. Spain finally out-rebounded China 38-19 and
hold a leading margin of 20 points through the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
"We should have finished with better ranking than what we got
now," said the 2.27-meter and 20 year-old Yao Ming on his first
Olympic games. "But at least we get some international experiences
in the great Olympic Games. I am so glad to mark my value in the
world basketball field."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, New Zealand beat African champion
Angola 70-60 in style to finish in the 11th at the men's
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
Angola came into the 12th with 6 defeat no win in the 12-team
Olympic competition which start on September 17.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand dominated the first half by jumping to a 15-0 lead
early in the game, but the slow starting Angola found their pace
minutes before the end of the half and nailed 9 points to trail 37-
26 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
Angola reduced the margin to 42-34 in the beginning of the
second half and closed to 65-58 in the final minutes. But the
taller and stronger Kiwis, led by Kirk Penney's 17 points and Sean
Marks' 15, held on for their first victory in six games on their
Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis had a 36-24 edge in rebounding and shot 44.4 percent
from the field, compared with 35.6 percent for Angola.  The
winless Angola again relied too much on outside shooting, making
eight of 28 attempts from beyond the 3-point arc, including three
of 15 in the first half.
</P>

The quarter-finals in the men's basketball tournament will

SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Romanian gymnast Andreea
Raducan, women's individual all-around gold medal winner at
Sydney Olympics, will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport
(CAS) for the International Olympic Committee's decision to
disqualify her from the competition after a positive drugs test.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the CAS, Raducan would
seek to overturn the IOC's decision which stripped her of the gold.
</P>
<P>
"Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan filed an appeal with the ad
hoc division of the Court of Arbritration for Sport challenging
the decision made by the IOC Executive Board earlier this morning
to disqualify her," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
CAS would hold a closed hearing in Sydney on Wednesday with
three arbitrators to determine the outcome of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The CAS will decide after that hearing whether or not a final
decision will be issued on the same day," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Raducan had her medal taken away after testing positive for use
of the banned stimulant pseudoephedrine.
</P>
<P>
Traces of the drug exceeding permitted levels were found in her
urine sample following the individual all around competition on
September 21.
</P>
<P>
The drug entered the gymnast's system after Romania's team
physician gave her two over-the-counter cold remedy tablets.

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing began construction on
the 20 km-long western section of its first light railway today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first phase of a 40.5-km light. It will links
Xizhimen, northwest of the city proper, and Huilongguan, north
suburb, which is scheduled to be completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The whole project is expected to be finished in 2005, in time
for the 2008 Olympic Games, in which Beijing is bidding for.
</P>
<P>
Cost of the whole light railway is estimated at 5.864 billion
yuan (approximately 708 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The light railway is designed to travel at 80 km per hour. The
project will allow residents living in the northern suburbs of
Beijing more convenience when traveling.
</P>
<P>
Light rail is a high-speed, safe, pollution-free transportation
method with a large passenger capacity. It will help Beijing
alleviate cumbersome road transportation and establish a multi-
dimensional traffic system, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Impose Traffic Control for Week-long National Day Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will impose traffic
control in some areas during the week-long National Day vacation
starting on October 1.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that nearly 100 million tourists will visit
Beijing by various roads during the "golden week".
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhenchuan, chief of Beijing Traffic Control Bureau, said the
temporary traffic control is aimed to guarantee safe and unblocked
transportation in Beijing, and to create a sound transportation
climate for the holiday economy.
</P>
<P>
Drivers will be required to show a special pass issued by the
bureau to go to some popular destinations, such as the Summer
Palace and the Great Wall (Badaling Section).
</P>
<P>
Temporary parking lots have been prepared in these places.
</P>
<P>
Beijing learnt a lesson from the extreme traffic jam in May
when hundreds of thousands of people crowded into places like the
Badaling Great Wall during the week-long vacation, which started
on May 1.
</P>
<P>
It took some people more than 12 hours, at least 10 hours on
ordinary days, to arrive at the foot of the Great Wall on May 1
due to heavily blocked traffic.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhenchuan has asked local people and tourists to avoid
making travel plans on the peak days of October 1 to 3, and listen
to the radio for traffic information.

NANJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The High People's Court of
east China's Jiangsu Province today rejected the appeals of four
Chinese murderers of a German family and retained the death
penalty granted by a local court in the provincial capital,
Nanjing.
</P>
<P>

Shanyang, 21; and Zhang Eryang, 20, were executed immediately

<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Force (TNI)
chief Adm Widodo A.S. Tuesday said he will investigate two
military officers suspected of having launched bomb attacks in
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed Kostrad (the Army's Strategic Reserve
Command) chief (Lt. Gen. Ryamizard Ryacudu) and Kopassus (the Army
's Special Troops) chief (Maj. Gen. Amirul Isnaeni) to investigate
the two military officials allegedly involved in the series of
bombings in Jakarta," Widodo told reporters before attending a
coordinating meeting on political and security affairs here.
</P>
<P>
He said the TNI has tried hard to disclose the alleged
involvement of the two military officers in the bomb attacks and
that it trusts the police in investigating the incidents.
</P>
<P>
Kostrad member Sergeant Ibrahim and Kopassus member Sergeant
Irwan were arrested in Bandung, about 180 kilometers southeast of
Jakarta, on Sunday. The two added to the 25 earlier arrested in
connection with the September 13 bombing of the Jakarta Stock
Exchange building and in the grenade attack at the Malaysian
Embassy last month.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Police chief Gen. Bimantoro said here Monday that
the two military officers were from conflict-torn Aceh province.

<HEADLINE> Weakening Baht Benefits Thai Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted Arporn Chewakriengkrai, an
economic adviser to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, as saying that
Thai exports would remain on the same competitive platform as
trading rivals, as the Thai currency had fallen in line with other
currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
Domestic prices were also expected to remain stable, with
inflation, excluding oil and agricultural products, predicted to
remain within the annual 3.5 percent-level targeted by the Bank of
Thailand (BOT), the country's central bank, projected Arporn.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's foreign reserves remained healthy as well, at 32.2
billion U.S. dollars as of September 15, reducing the country's
vulnerability to external shocks, while capital outflows were
primary due to foreign debt repayments that helped strengthen
Thailand's overall financial status, said the senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank had reiterated its policy not to
intervene in the currency market to prop up the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
A BOT economist agreed that strong exports would help offset
negative effects caused by the current oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank projected that overall Thai
exports would grow 10-15 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Promises Payment to Retrenched Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- All workers who have
been retrenched from the privatized state firms will get their
lawful terminal benefits, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has
promised.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally for the October general elections
in the western Kigoma Region on Monday, Mkapa said that all
retrenched workers' demands are being verified and once the
exercise is completed, payment will be effected, newspapers
reported here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president told his cheering supporters that the divestiture
of ailing parastatals did not mean to punish the retrenched
workers, but was designed to boost productivity.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the exercise had led to unemployment, but
countered that many such companies had over-employed.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said, however, that after privatization, some companies
that could not even pay tax have improved production and now pay
taxes in billions.
</P>
<P>
He said an evaluation would be done to establish the number of
unpaid retrenched workers and the amount of money they were
claiming.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is now in the seventh year of privatization program.
Until the end of last year, more than 275, or over 60 percent of
all its 425 public enterprises had been privatized. The rest,
which are in different stages of privatization, include large
public utilities, infrastructure enterprises and financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Law Enforcers Top List of Corruption in Bangladesh: TIB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The law enforcing agency is the
most corrupt sector in Bangladesh, The Daily Star reported Tuesday
quoting the News Scan Database Report of Transparency
International Bangladesh (TIB).
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and eleven incidents of corruption caused a loss
of 115 billion taka (2.1 billion U.S. dollars) to the government
during the first six months of 2000, said the report based on 1,
345 incidents of corruption reported in nine national dailies of
the country from January to June this year.
</P>
<P>
Local government, education and health sectors were identified
as the second, third and fourth most corrupt ones among the total
of 38 sectors, divisions, departments and directorates covered by
the report.
</P>
<P>
The findings reminded the results of studies carried out by
different donor agencies and international organizations which
dubbed Bangladesh one of the most corrupt nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
In its Corruption Perception Index of 1996, the Berlin-based
Transparency International put Bangladesh at the fourth place
while the recent poverty report of the United Nations Development
Program identified Bangladesh as one of the leading corrupt
countries.
</P>
<P>
A study on corruption by the World Bank recently suggested
that Bangladesh could post two to three percent more GDP growth
and double the per capita income if the extent of corruption could
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
After evaluating the studies, the TIB said corruption is a
general phenomenon in many of the developing countries and the
problem is severe in Bangladesh, limiting the national and donor-
aided efforts to reduce poverty.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh to Benefit from EC Move on Quota-Free Access  by Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission's
favorable response to the request for duty-free and quota-free
access for products from the least-developed countries (LDCs) to
European markets would benefit the LDCs including Bangladesh,
observers in Dhaka said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission on September 20 adopted a plan to
provide full access for the world's poorest countries to the
European markets. The proposal, which is expected to receive
consideration of the 15-member Council of Ministers of the
European Union, would cover all goods except arms.
</P>
<P>
A high official in Bangladesh's Ministry of Commerce was
quoted by the Finance Express Tuesday as saying that the adoption
of the proposal by the EC has opened the door for further steps.
</P>
<P>
From the previous experiences of records, it can be presumed
that the council of ministers would vet it. Finally it would be
placed before the European parliament to make it a law.
</P>
<P>
"We do hope the proposal adopted by the EC would not face
opposition at the following stages," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Informed circles, however, feared that the proposal may face
stiff opposition from some states, including France, in the
council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The farmers of those countries, for the obvious reason, may
create pressure on their respective governments not to be too
liberal in vetting the EC proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to information available from Brussels, European
Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy welcomed the commission's adoption
of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the free access is not enough to enable the
poorest countries to benefit from the liberalized trade. We need
to help them build their capacity to supply goods of export
quality and we reaffirm the commission's commitment to continued
technical and financial assistance to this end," said the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The proposal reflects the commission's belief that all World
Trade Organization members can and should benefit from trade
liberalization, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the spokesman of the LDCs, Bangladesh has been in the
forefront in the battle for duty-free and quota-free entry of LDC
goods into developed country markets for the last several years.
</P>
<P>
The EC's proposal would obviously bring satisfaction to
Bangladesh, local economic observers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it should not be misconstrued that the European
Union would compromise with the quality of the products to be
exported to their markets, they warned.
</P>
<P>
With quality strictly maintained, Bangladeshi manufacturers
are believed to be able to export knitwear, ready-made garments
and leather products in greater volume when the law is enacted,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Remains Opposed to U.S.-Proposed Democracy Bill: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Foreign
Affairs Stan Mudenge Monday said his country remained opposed to
the U.S.-proposed Zimbabwe Democracy Bill as it sought to impose
punitive sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if the legislation could not be done away with
completely, then it should be amended to accentuate positive
elements in it.
</P>
<P>
These included urging Americans to put together monetary
resources for Zimbabwe's current land redistribution exercise,
which would be in fulfillment of promises made in the past.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge was briefing reporters after returning from the United
States where he attended the U.N. Millennium Summit and U.N.
General Assembly and led a delegation of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) in opposing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Bill should die," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said that if this is not achieved or the positive
elements are passed he would be happy, stressing that all
elements of sanctions should be removed.
</P>
<P>
The SADC delegation met several American representatives,
including Secretary of State Madeline Albright who, according to
Mudenge, agreed to convey their protests to President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
She reportedly told the delegation that the American government
was not sponsoring the legislation although White House shared one
of its objectives, that of restoring law and order in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Democracy Bill 2000 would bar aid and debt relief
and instruct U.S. Executive Directors of Multinational Lending
Institutions to oppose credits to Zimbabwe unless "law and order
is restored".
</P>
<P>
Mudenge also took Monday's press briefing to dispel fears that
Zimbabwe might be forced to close some foreign offices owing to
the current foreign currency shortages.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was currently working on a program to
scale down operations and not completely shut down.

<HEADLINE> Over 5,000 University Staff to be Laid off in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 staff members in
Kenya's public universities will be laid off under the current
civil service retrenchment program beginning from November.
</P>
<P>
Half of those to be sent for early retirement are from Nairobi
University, according to the university's Vice-chancellor Francis
Gichaga.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 2,500 will be from the Kenyatta University, the
Egerton University and the Moi University.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the University of Nairobi employees who received
notices of early retirement have demanded a compensation between
300,000 shillings and 500,000 shillings (about 78 shillings are
equal to one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
The employees claimed that they would not accept 40,000
shillings paid to civil servants in the government.
</P>
<P>
From this November to January 2002, about 48,000 are set to be
axed among a total of 215,000 civil servants in a move by the
Kenyan government to improve efficiency and cut administrative
expenses.

<HEADLINE> (Specially for China-Africa Cooperation Forum) Interview: Zambia Hopes for More Investment From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Qiaoyan
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia expects China to expand
its investment in the African country so as to tap the potentials
for economic cooperation and trade, Zambian Minister for Commerce,
Trade and Industry William Harrington said in a recent exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The potential between Zambia and China is enormous," said
Harrington, who has been invited to the China-Africa Cooperation
Forum scheduled for October in China's capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese statistics, China-Zambia trade volume
stood at 26 million U.S. dollars in 1999, dipping 2 million from
the previous year, while in 1997 the volume climbed to 37 million,
suggesting large potentials for the two sides to tap.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister noted that to attract more foreign
investment, the Zambian government has put in place a series of
measures, including launching privatization programs, signing
investment protection agreements and liberalizing foreign exchange
control.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese companies should make good use of the
opportunity, stressing that all forms of investment, whether
direct investment or joint ventures from China, are encouraged "at
all costs".
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Harrington suggested that Chinese companies and
African countries take advantage of the expanded market in the
region with the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa Free
Trade Area which will come into being on October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Zambia is favorably located in south-east Africa,
therefore provides an opportunity to export to all the eight
neighboring countries and South Africa, suggesting that China
could increase investment in this region and especially in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The minister recalled that China and Zambia have enjoyed good
cooperation in the past four decades, during which many joint
ventures were set up.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned, among others, the 1,860-kilometer Tanzanian-
Zambia Railway Line linking Kapiri Mposhi with Dar-Es-salaam in
the early years and the Zambia-China Mulungushi Textile in 1997,
the latter being a pilot project in a new form of cooperation
between African countries and China.
</P>
<P>
The successful experiences of the Mulungushi Textiles, which
offers jobs for 1,500 people, provides a good example for further
enhancing economic cooperation between Zambia and Chian, noted the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said while China's investment in Zambia has been focusing on
road and railway construction, agricultural machinery production
and farm produce processing in the past 40 years, China has begun
to invest in other sectors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a branch of the Bank of China, the first one in
Africa, was established in Zambian capital Lusaka over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Harrington said that it has been proved cooperation between
Zambia and China is possible in various areas, which should be an
encouragement for China to widen its investment fields.
</P>
<P>
However, Harrington noted there is a trade imbalance between
China and Zambia, which was resulted from the different industrial
structures between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To redress the imbalance, the minister suggested that Chinese
companies could invest more in Zambia and make products oriented
at exporting to China.
</P>
<P>
He further recommended trade fairs and shows as a way of
promoting trade and strengthening economic ties between the two
countries.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand beat African
champion Angola 70-60 in a stylish play-off game to finish 11th at
the men's basketball tournament of the Sydney Olympic Games here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Angola came 12th with 6 straight defeats in the 12-team Olympic
competition which started on September 17.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand dominated the first half by jumping to a 15-0 lead
early in the game, but the slow starting Angola found their pace
minutes before the end of the half and nailed 9 points to trail 37-
26 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
Angola reduced the margin to 42-34 in the beginning of the
second half and closed to 65-58 in the final minutes. But the
taller and stronger Kiwis, led by Kirk Penney's 17 points and Sean
Marks' 15, held on for its first victory in six games on their
Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
The Kiwis had a 36-24 edge in rebounding and shot 44.4 percent
from the field, compared with 35.6 percent for Angola.
</P>
<P>
The winless Angola again relied too much on outside shooting,
making eight of 28 attempts from beyond the 3-point arc, including
three of 15 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The other game deciding the 9th and 10th places is undergoing
between Spain and China this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> China Int'l Friendship Cities Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 China International
Friendship Cities Conference opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription to the three-
day event -- develop friendly sister-city activities and expand
the fields of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said in his message to the
Conference that the Chinese government has consistently supported
international friendly sister-city activities and earnestly called
for substantial exchanges and cooperation between local
governments of China and those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of solidarity and cooperation among cities, imbued
with vigor, promises broad prospects for development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the opening ceremony of the Conference were
representatives from more than 120 Chinese cities and their
counterparts from 46 countries, with a view to discussing new ways
and areas of cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is sponsored by the Chinese People's Association
for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and the China
International Friendship Cities Association (CIFCA).
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan also sent a message to
congratulate the convening of the Conference, saying that "This
admirable initiative of the CPAFFC is very much in the spirit of
the United Nations Charter and its call for tolerance and
cooperation among the world's people".
</P>
<P>
To date, 30 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions,
municipalities and nearly 300 cities have forged 950 sister-city
links with their foreign counterparts in more than 100 countries.

</P>
<P>
Qian said that sister-city activities of China are designed to
promote understanding and friendship among people all over the
world, and to expand substantial cooperation between cities, as
well as to seek common development and promote world peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a major task of the international community
to safeguard peace and promote development, and human beings are
facing many new challenges and opportunities along with the
relaxation of the international situation and the rapid progress
of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the Chinese people are willing to
work with people of the rest of the world to enhance cooperation
and exchanges, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the participants will discuss such
issues as sustainable development strategy for local authorities,
high-tech and urban development, community service, employment and
social security system, aging problem and cooperation between
different types of civilization.
</P>
<P>
Qian described urban prosperity and development as a symbol of
human civilization, saying that cooperation between cities would
help push ahead the progress of human society.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration of Local Governments on Peace, Friendship and
Cooperation in the New Century was made public in the opening
ceremony of the Conference. The declaration was already signed by

<HEADLINE> Cuba Enters Olympic Baseball Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Orestes Kindelan smacked a two-
run single in the sixth inning to help defending champion Cuba
defeat Japan 3-0 for the Olympic baseball final here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, winners in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, will face
either South Korea and the United States who will play later in
other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Kindelan plated the only runs Cuba needed behind pitcher Jose
Ariel Contreras, who struck out 10, allowing only three over the
first six innings of a complete-game shutout.
</P>
<P>
Cuba opened the scoring in the fourth when Yasser Gomez singled,
moved to second on a poorly thrown pickoff attempt by Japanese
second baseman Jun Heima, setting the stage for Kindelan's single
to bring him home.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Luis Ulacia and Gomez hit back-to-back singles,
advanced on a wild pitch from Japanese starter Tomohiro Kuroki and
scored when Kindelan pounded a single to deep left field.
</P>
<P>
Japan threatened in the seventh when So Taguchi singled and
went to third on Nobuhiko Matsunaka's single. But Contreras struck
out Yukio Tanaka and induced pinch-hitter Shinnosuke Abe into an
inning-ending ground out.
</P>
<P>
Japanese leftfielder So Taguchi threw out German Mesa at home
plate to save a run in the eighth inning but Japan went down in
order in the final inning.
</P>
<P>
The game was interrupted for 68 minutes by rain after half an
inning.

<HEADLINE> Friendship Cities Convention Issues Declaration, Calling for Peace, Friendship and Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- 2000 China International
Friendship Cities Conference here this morning issued the
Declaration of Local Governments on Peace, Friendship and
Cooperation in the New Century.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the Declaration:
</P>
<P>
"We are standing at the glorious starting point of a new
century. We are full of hope for the future of humanity.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, incessant wars across the world during the past
century have left many painful memories to all humankind. As the
new century is approaching, we must assume the sublime mission of
safeguarding peace, never to carry various historical disasters
and regrets into the new 21st century we are facing.
</P>
<P>
Cities and local governments ( or authorities ) in all
countries are dedicated to their own economic, cultural and social
progress, creating fruitful modalities of development suited to
the needs of their own inhabitants, and expanding reciprocal
contacts, exchanges and co-operation. We are meeting opportunities
and challenges, both arising with the new century. Upholding the
principles of peace, friendship and co-operation is precisely the
most important prerequisite for us to gain success.
</P>
<P>
We hereby solemnly declare:
</P>
<P>
To strive to maintain and continually promote the peace of all
humankind. In the new century, political differences may still
exist between various countries and regions in the world. But such
differences must not lead to antagonism and ignite war as they
invariably did in the past. On the contrary, they should be
thrashed out through dialogue and negotiation so as to ensure
world peace and stability
</P>
<P>
To strive to maintain and continually enhance the friendship
among all the peoples. In the new century, differences may still
exist in the cultural traditions of various countries and regions
in the world. But such differences must not become gaps separating
the peoples as they often did in the past. On the contrary, they
may be turned into positive factors that attract the people of
various countries together, enabling them to realize the splendor
of diversity in the world, and build understanding and confidence
through studies and exchanges, thus to open up a new era of unity
of all humankind.
</P>
<P>
To strive to maintain and continually expand the co-operation
among the local governments (or authorities ) of all countries. In
the days to come, imbalance may still emerge from the economic
growth of various countries and regions in the world. But such
imbalance must not bring bitterness of injustice to the peoples as
it always did in the past. On the contrary, this may provide an
opportunity for them to plunge into peaceful and fair competitions
in a bid for mutual development through co-operation, thus
advancing to general prosperity and winning world stability and
progress.
</P>
<P>
Cities and local governments (or authorities), born along with
human civilization, will play an even more active role in the
history of the world making progress.
</P>
<P>
Let us join hands to fulfil this solemn mission. Let us step
forward to the new century with full confidence."
</P>
<P>
The document has already been signed by 183 heads of local
governments or authorities worldwide and will remain open for
signing till the end of the four-day conference.

<HEADLINE> Dipping Into U.S. Oil Reserve Can Help Stabilize Oil Prices: OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman said
here Monday that the decision of the United States to use oil from
its strategic reserves will be helpful in stabilizing the oil
market.
</P>
<P>
Lukman, who is in Caracas to attend the second summit of OPEC
and to discuss the rising oil prices which have reached a high
since the Gulf War, made the remark upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
The United States has announced the use of 5.25 percent of its
571 million barrels of its reserves.
</P>
<P>
Ali Rodriguez, the president of OPEC and a spokesperson for the
Venezuelan Energy and Mining Ministry, said the amount of oil the
United States will release will add to the 800,000 daily oil
barrels agreed upon by OPEC during its ministerial conference on
September 10.
</P>
<P>
President of Petroleos de Venezuela Hector Ciavaldini estimated
that oil prices should decrease five or six dollars per barrel as
a result of the decision by the United States to make use of its
strategic reserves.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, it may take weeks before the U.S. strategy works and
the oil prices stay between 22-25 dollars per barrel, Ciavaldini
said.

SEOUL, September 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) agreed on Tuesday to establish a
working-level military committee to settle issues concerning the
relinking of the inter-Korean railway and road systems.
</P>
<P>
In a five-point statement following the inter-Korean defense

Minister Cho Sung-tae and DPRK People's Armed Forces Minister Kim
Il Chol also agreed to meet again in the DPRK in November.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Attack Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oil pipeline Cano Limon-Covenas, the second longest line in
the country, suffered two attacks on Friday and Sunday by the
National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The pipeline has been attacked on 22 occasions since July 23,
having paralyzed Cano Limon exports.
</P>
<P>
The trans-Andean pipeline , which used to carry 50,000 bpd of
Ecuadorian oil and 10,000 bpd of Colombian oil from the oil fields
of Orito to the Tumaco harbor on the Pacific Ocean, were hit by at
least two explosives attacks during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The attacks caused a spill of thousands of barrels of oil,
thereby polluting 60 kilometers of the Putumayo and Yarumo rivers
and many of their tributaries, said Ecopetrol.
</P>
<P>
The sabotage of the trans-Andean pipeline took place during a
cease-fire that had been ordered by the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC), which had blocked the highway to the Guames
valley along the Ecuador border.
</P>
<P>
The intense offensive led by the ELN and FARC guerrillas
against pipelines has reduced the production and export of oil in
August and September by more than 100,000 bpd. Colombia regularly
produces about 720,000 bpd of oil.

SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Pre-match favourite Cuba
eventually ended in the ninth place of the women's basketball
tournament in the Sydney Games here on Tuesday, winning a play-off
game 65-58 against Canada at the Dome.
</P>
<P>
Canada ranked in the 10th place in the 12 teams tournament as
New Zealand outplayed Senegal to take the 11th place over the
African Champion in an earlier play-off.
</P>
<P>
Cuba took control of the game in the early minutes by jumping
to a 12-5 lead. But Canada rallied back with a 13-0 surge and took
over the domination by leading one point with three minutes and 14
second to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
By the interval and after the lead changed nine times, Cuba
regained its lead at 35-34. The Cubans were forced to battle for
the first 20 minutes without Yamilet Martinez, who is the leading
scorer, sidelined for some 10 minutes after committing three early
fouls.
</P>
<P>
When Martinez returned to the field and stayed out of foul
trouble, Cuba gained the ascendancy in the match against the
Canadians, who qualified for the Sydney Games by finishing third
in the Americas Zone behind Brazil and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians kept fighting hard right to the end of the match
but could not stop the Cubans from earning their win with an 8-1
scoring streak in the final two-and-a-half minutes on the clock.

</P>
<P>
"We played five times against Canada and just lost one before
the Olympic Games, so we were prepared and confident to win the
game," said Martinez, who scored 13 points and had 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Martinez were strongly supported by teammates Jacquelin Plutin
and Maria Leon, both added 13 for Cuba's victory.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier play-off game for the 11th and 12 places, New
Zealand edged Senegal 72-69 to mark it its victory in Olympic
Games as both teams were making their Olympic basketball debut at
the Sydney 2000 Games and both were short of any single victory.
</P>
<P>
With two minutes and 20 seconds to go in the first half, New
Zealand held a 12-points lead at 40-28 before the African champion
surged back and hit 11 points to nil in the remaining time to claw
for 39-40 by the interval.
</P>
<P>
Despite an eight-point lead with eight minutes into the second
half, Senegal was overtaken again before Kiristin Daly made two
free throws to tie the scored at 61-all, and the tight tussle kept
going to the end when New Zealand's Tania Brunton sealed the game
with a fast break layup.
</P>
<P>
Tania Brunton led New Zealand with 17 points while Adama
Diakhate and Astou Ndiaye each scored 18 for Senegal, who tailed
in the bottom of the tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing. We weren't supposed to lose in that game,"
said Ndiaye, "We did expect to win and we know we have a better
level. But we're just not playing to our potential."
</P>
<P>
The women's quarterfinals will be played on Wednesday as
defending champion the United States faces Slovakia, host
Australia plays Poland, Russia meets Brazil and South Korea
encounters France.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will meet to accelerate investment
liberalization on October 4 in Chiang Mai, the Thai government
disclosed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be chaired by Thai minister to the prime
minister's office Abhisit Vajajjiva, will set time limit for those
industries that some members are not ready to open up for free
investment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ASEAN is divided into two groups based on their
readiness to open up for free investment by 2020. Members that
have pledged to follow the time frame are Thailand, Indonesia,
Singapore, Brunei Malaysia and the Philippines, while the rest
four members -- Myanmar Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, have expressed
their unreadiness.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also discuss the promotion plan to draw
investment from the United States, Europe and Japan into the
region, which has been carried out during the first half of the
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the meeting will raise the issue of setting up an
ASEAN industrial database and information system for investors to
use when making investment decisions.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Lanka Ties Better Than Ever: Lankan Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar said that relations between India and Sri
Lanka were governed by absolute candor and mutual trust and could
not be better.
</P>
<P>
The government Daily News quoted Tuesday Kadirgamar as saying
that sympathy for Sri Lanka's separatist Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in some quarters in Tamil Nadu of India was
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no hide and seek in Sri Lanka's relationship
with India over the last six years. It has been absolutely candid
and completely open. There was nothing that he and his Indian
counterpart Singh could not discuss openly. The same applied to
the heads of state of the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
On his recent visit to the United States Kadirgamar had met
both Singh and Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee. He said that it was
now a completely transformed relationship and all the initial
qualms of the Indian government sympathetic to the LTTE had
completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that it was in India's own interest never to allow
it to countenance a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka because the
consequences could be incalculable for the Indian union.
</P>
<P>
India, Sri Lanka's largest neighbor, once sheltered and
provided training for the LTTE, sent troops to Sri Lanka in 1987
in an attempt to make peace between government forces and LTTE.
The mission, however, ended with heavy casualties inflicted by
LTTE which forced it to pull out of the island country.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Criticizes Remarks of S. Korean FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) criticized South Korean Foreign and Trade
Minister Lee Joung-bin for describing the June summit meeting
between both sides of the Korean peninsula as a "result of the
engagement policy of the South Korean government."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean minister made the remark in his speech at the
U.N. General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary that
the speech is "unpardonable" and "lays an artificial obstacle in
the way of implementing the June 15 North-South joint declaration
that reaffirms the three principles for national reunification."
</P>
<P>
The KCNA said that the DPRK believes the historic summit
meeting and the issuance of the joint declaration are "shining
fruition of the resolution and will of the leaders of the North
and the South" and represent the "aspirations and desire of the 70
million people for reunification."
</P>
<P>
The KCNA said that if South Korean authorities truly value the
success of the summit meeting and are willing to implement the
joint declaration, they should not talk about the engagement
policy but rather work for the common interests of the nation in
the spirit of national independence.

minute phone call, assured Clinton that they would send their
negotiating teams to Washington to pursue talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton encouraged both leaders to do that.

SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand snatched a close
battle 72-69 against Senegal to finish in the 11th place at the
women's basketball tournament in the Sydney Olympic Games here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As both teams were making their Olympic debut at the Sydney
2000 Games, it became New Zealand's first victory in six games
after neither sides claimed a win in any preliminary matches.
</P>
<P>
With two minutes and 20 seconds to go in the first half, New
Zealand held a 12-points lead at 40-28 before the African champion
Senegal surged back and hit 11 points to nil in the remaining time
and only lagged behind by one point at 40-39 half break.
</P>
<P>
Senegal took the lead in the opening minute of the second half,
but was overtaken again before the African women set up an eight-
point lead with eight minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Kiwis fought back and Kiristin Daly made two free throws to tie
the scored at 61-all, and the tight tussle kept going to the end

<P>
"It's disappointing. We weren't supposed to lose in that game,"
said Ndiaye, "We did expect to win and we know we have a better
level. But we're just not playing to our potential."

<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Leontien Zijlaard of the
Netherlands outsprinted an elite field to take the first gold
medal of the road cycling events for the Sydney Olympic Games here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She held an advantage of about three bike lengths over silver
medalist Hanka Kupfernagel of Germany and Diana Ziliute of
Lithuania after the 119.7-km course against windy rains.
</P>
<P>
Zijlaard is one step away from taking home her coach's
prediction of four medals in her four events. She already has a
gold and silver medal from the track cycling events and will also
be riding the road time trial on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rain began to fall on the third lap of the seven-lap race,
making conditions difficult for the field of 58 riders. There
were several crashes because of the slippery roads, but none of
the riders were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
From the sixth lap, there were several attempted escapes from
riders such as Pia Sundstedt of Finland, Mirjam Melchers of the
Netherlands and Joane Somarriba Arrola of Spain. The Spaniard was
persistent with her attacking on the climb out of Bronte beach,
but none of the attempts were successful.
</P>
<P>
In the final lap, the Lithuanian team kept the race under
control by setting a fast tempo. Finn Sundstedt tried her luck
several times, gaining a small advantage before eventually being
reeled in by the work of the Dutch and the Lithuanians.
</P>
<P>
Going into the final kilometer, the Dutch team was led by
Melchers who had Zijlaard close behind in her slipstream. With
about 400 meters to race, the local favorite Anna Wilson began her
sprint from well back in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team control allowed Zijlaard to come to the front
with about 200 meters remaining. With her proven strenth, no one
was able to challenge the undisputed queen of the Olympic cycling.
</P>
<P>
The race was completed in 3:06:31 at an average speed of 38.51
kph.

all the sprinters. Mirjam Melchers was the best on the mountains,
the real mountain was too short for her but it was good that she
broke many riders."
</P>
<P>
On their tactics, she said that "Mirjam did it in the sprint
but Chantal Beltman she did everything in the beginning of the
race as we came with high hopes given our strong riders."

The two-day meeting, opened by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, was themed "Rural and Island Women: Poverty and

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Conference in Italy Calls for Global Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Around 550 delegates from 70
nations and regions attended an international anti-drug conference
that opened Monday in Italy. Delegates discussed means for a
united fight against drug addiction through international economic
means and cooperative prevention and recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions ranged from integrating drug-producing countries
into the global economy, canceling their foreign debts and
creating joint recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the conference that took place in Palermo,
southern Italy, were Italian House Speaker Luciano Violante,
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, Justice Minister Piero Fassino and
Defense Minister Sergio Mattarella.
</P>
<P>
Vilante said that the G-8 nations must aid drug-producing
countries that are trying to convert to alternative crops to
prevent severe economic loss.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction should be fought jointly, and prevention efforts
should be made against all kinds of dependency, including alcohol,
tobacco, and any other addictive substances such, including
certain prescription drugs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fassino stressed the concept of "global strategy." He said, "It
is necessary to erase the debt of countries which produce drugs
and at the same time integrate their economies into the
international market - they cannot be left out."
</P>
<P>
"The war against drugs must be fought through a common, united
policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference will end next Friday.

<P>
ROME, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Friday's joint intervention of
leading central banks to support the faltering single European
currency - the euro, was successful and opportune, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dini, who is also co-director of the International Monetary
Fund, was quoted by Italian news agency Ansa as saying that the
concerted intervention would be effective in the short term,
although in the long run it would be necessary to wait for
readjustments arising from economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Dini also said he was optimistic about the euro's capacity for
recovery, adding that he believed the outflow of European capital
would slow, which will help balance exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement of interests led to Friday's attempt, which sent
a clear signal to markets to halt the excessive trends in recent
weeks," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Maradona to Return Home to Launch Autobiography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- After a nearly fatal car carsh
days ago in Cuba, Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona plans to
return to Buenos Aires this week to launch an autobiography on his
career.
</P>
<P>
In the book named "Yo Soy El Diego" ("I Am Diego"), the 39-year-
old recounted such events like his famous fisted goal against
England in the 1986 World Cup. He had said he felt like a revenge
for Britain's defeat of Argentina in a war following their
disputes over the Malvinas Islands several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We knew many Argentine boys had died there ... In some way, we
blamed the English players for what had happened," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said, before the game, that you shouldn't mix things,
but that was a lie. We didn't think of anything else -- the hell
was it going to be just another game!" he added.
</P>
<P>
In the 2-1 defeat of England, Maradona scored a fisted goal,
which he later attributed to the "Hand of God."
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who has been in Cuba since the beginning of the year
to recover from a life-threatening heart condition caused by drug
and alcohol abuse, is due to fly on Tuesday to Buenos Aires for a
gala book launch on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Maradona flicked through the first printed
copies of the book at the Havana health clinic where he lives.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine soccer star almost killed himself earlier this
month when he drove his jeep into a tourist bus at night in the
rain in a Havana suburb.
</P>
<P>
Trapped in mangled wreckage for about an hour, Maradona emerged
shaken up but with only a few bruises to his left knee and ankle.
He has vigorously denied media insinuations he might have been
drunk or on drugs at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can have an accident," he was quoted as saying at the
time.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs More International Experience, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Psychological barriers and a
lack of international experience have been blamed for Indonesia's
poor performance at the Sydney Olympic Games, according to
Indonesia chef de mission Arie Sudewo.
</P>
<P>
During a media teleconference on Monday, Sudewo said the
Indonesian athletes "were mentally unready to challenge world-
class rivals", despite the money spent by the Indonesian Sports
Council (KONI) to fund their overseas training prior to the Games.
</P>
<P>
He said psychological obstacles had even prevented some
athletes from equaling, not to mention improving on, their
personal bests.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our latest evaluation on the athletes' performance,
we conclude that they could not reach or improve their personal
bests because they might have been too nervous when competing
against world-class athletes," Sudewo was quoted by Tuesday's
Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Smarting from the unexpected outcome, Sudewo said giving
athletes more opportunities to compete in international events
would help the athletes improve.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia brought 48 athletes, 23 coaches and 19 officials to
the Sydney Games. It has so far collected one gold medal, three
silvers and two bronzes from badminton and weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
The country won two golds in Barcelona in 1992 and a gold, a
silver and two bronzes four years later in the Atlanta Olympics.

SGS will use the inspections to help the government set proper

<P>
The new contract is for two years, with an option for a third
year.
</P>
<P>
Restricted imports in Cambodia, requiring government approval,
cover such categories as coins, aircraft and most weapons.
Prohibited import items include illegal drugs and chemicals used

are more than 100 years old, pornography, toxic waste and
counterfeit goods.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Judge Orders Medical Tests for Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chilean judge Juan Guzman
decided Monday to postpone a scheduled interrogation of former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet and ordered him to take medical
tests.
</P>
<P>
Guzman, who is investigating 171 cases against Pinochet, set
back his questioning planned for October 9 by a month to allow
time for Pinochet's medical examination, which will include
psychological tests.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers said that the 84-year-old former Chilean
leader no longer remembers events that occurred during his 1973-
1990 rule. Last month the lawyers asked Guzman to order the
medical examinations.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's own doctors said the retired general, who has a
pacemaker and suffers from diabetes, had at least two strokes in
Britain that caused "irreversible brain damage."
</P>
<P>
Chile's Supreme Court voted in early August to strip the
retired general of his immunity from prosecution, and thus paved
way for the former leader to stand trial on 171 charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, more than 3,000 people died
or disappeared and tens of thousands fled the country during
Pinochet's reign from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet returned to Chile in early march after 503 days under
house arrest in Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China
plans to solve its drinking water shortage problem of the people
in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's water ration per capita is just one-sixth of the
national average. About 1.5 million people in 3,440 villages have
a very limited supply of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
When drought hits the coastal province every year, over 3
million people are affected.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation officials said that the province will invest
millions of dollars annually in the coming three years to deal
with this problem.
</P>
<P>
Under a new government plan, the officials said Shandong will
build a group of small or medium-sized projects to hold or
intercept water in areas which have little groundwater.
</P>
<P>
In mountainous areas and on islands, the government will help
residents build structures to capture water pouring down from
roofs.
</P>
<P>
The province will also build canals for villagers, and persuade
people living in those areas with harsh conditions to resettle in
other areas.

<HEADLINE> China Closes Down 3,700 Printing Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China has closed down 3,727
illegal printing factories and confiscated 2.79 million yuan (
about 336,000 U.S. dollars) in a crackdown on unlawful
publications since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have dealt with 1,767 cases and seized more than 6
million illegal books or brochures, including those advocating the
Falungong cult, according to a meeting held recently in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
People involved in the cases have been punished since the
crackdown started in October 1998, according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The government also ordered more than 20,000 printing
enterprises and 12,200 photocopy and printing centers to shut down
because they failed to meet professional standards.
</P>
<P>
The Press and Publication Administration, the Ministry of
Public Security, and the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, jointly carried out the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian, director of the Press and Publication
Administration, said at the meeting that the institutional reforms
in printing enterprises across the country are basically over.
</P>
<P>
He said printing enterprises are to be managed by press and
publication administrations in various regions.
</P>
<P>
After the crackdown, printing businesses in China have dropped
to 151,900 from 185,000 two years earlier. Currently, the industry
employs 3.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 1,222 major printing enterprises in the country made a
profit of more than 400 million yuan (about 48 million U.S.
dollars).

SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have
successfully removed a large brain tumor from a four-month-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
Doctors discovered an egg-size tumor at the back part of the
brain when she was born. The tumor became bigger and bigger as the

</P>
<P>
The girl's parents went to a hospital affiliated with Shanghai
N0. 2 Medical Science University, seeking medical care for their
child.
</P>
<P>
Doctors examined the girl, finding that an operation could
result in massive bleeding and lead to sequela.
</P>
<P>
They worked out a meticulous operation plan. During the
operation, they bypassed dangerous areas and removed the tumor.
</P>
<P>
The girl, from the neighboring province of Zhejiang, has been
discharged from the hospital and is reportedly doing fine.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Farm Produce Changes Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of chefs from the
United States are staying in Shanghai's top-class hotels to teach
Chinese chefs skills about their cuisine.
</P>
<P>
Previously, U.S. marine products businessmen in co-operation
with hotels in Shanghai hold a seafood festival, providing
consumers menus with U.S food in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farm produce businessmen are holding the seafood festival
as China will soon enter the WTO.
</P>
<P>
According to customs statistics from January to July, U.S.
edible oil seeds, frozen meat, and milk and butter goods passing
through Shanghai customs respectively increased 68.2 percent, 219.
7 percent and 80.5 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fruit and nuts, feather and down imports increased as high as
289 times and 56.6 times the figure for last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, sturgeons which live in cold water have
successfully reproduced in the Yangtze River. It is a favorable
food in many Shanghai hotels together with Salmon from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
Farmers planting water melons, oranges and apples in Anhui,
Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shaanxi provinces are busy with
registering trade marks, after seeing that "Sunkist" orange from
the United States are well-sold because of its brand.
</P>
<P>
With superior geographic position and better techniques,
Shanghai has imported more than 300 kinds of seeds of vegetables
and flowers. And now it grows 30,000 tons of overseas vegetables
annually.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yanming, owner of a sturgeons farm in northern Shanghai,
said that due to the improvement of breeding techniques and the
market demands, he has introduced several kinds of fish from cold
areas. His 40,000-square-meter breeding pond has become the
largest sturgeon breeding center in east China.
</P>
<P>
Sturgeons sell at more than 200 yuan (about 12 U.S dollars) a
kilogram but still cannot meet market demands.
</P>
<P>
Shao Wangyu, professor with a WTO research center in Shanghai,
said that Chinese and overseas farm produce compete with each
other. The influx of overseas produce has given Chinese consumers
more choices.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese farmers should increase market awareness and
learn marketing strategies from their overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
On March 23, shortly after China announced that it would lift
restrictions on importing U.S oranges, Sunkist oranges began to
roll into the Chinese market with a big publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
U.S. businessmen plan to export 500 million yuan worth of
Sunkist oranges to China in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The chefs from the United States are scheduled to teach 1,200
people in major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Dalian in
one year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Greg Drescher, a senior official with the Culinary Institute of
America, said the training program is funded by U.S. Department of
Agriculture, and supported by over 30 U.S wheat, peanuts, wine,
oranges and marine products companies.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Steel Makers Tap Market Potential in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign steel makers are
busy tapping market potential in China as the country will soon
enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Representtives of Germany's Krupp Thyssen and Dongbu Steel of
the Republic of Korea recently came China to establish contact
with the major steel market in Shanghai, hoping to find trading
partners. The two steel giants held business talks with more than
20 Chinese firms, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
An official from Krupp Thyssen's Beijing representative office
said that as China will soon become a WTO member, there is an
urgent need for his company to find out where China will import
steel products from, market prices of steel and the sales
situation related to the goods.
</P>
<P>
Chinese sales managers said that foreign iron and steel
companies are stepping up efforts to investigate the Chinese
market and at the same time seek cooperation partners.
</P>
<P>
But they said many foreign companies have underestimated the
development of Chinese iron and steel enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In fact, as the Shanghai-based Baoshan Iron and Steel Company
Group has become a major player in the industry, the managers said,
common products cannot meet the demands of Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign enterprises should realize that China only needs value-
added steel products such as cold plate, and steel products with
favorable prices, marketing researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the researchers said Chinese steel enterprises seem
to be slow in making polices to prepare for China's pending
accession to the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Up to 1,351 Traps Seized in Canada's Lobster Fishing Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian fisheries officers
have seized up to 1,351 traps in lobster fishing dispute with
native fishermen in the country's Atlantic province of New
Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
"We've pulled up 1,351 traps," said Fisheries Minister Herb
Dhaliwal Monday in Ottawa. "They're out there enforcing the law
and people should not intervene with them doing that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Provincial police reported shots early in the morning while
trying to take nearly a hundred traps in Miramichi Bay.
</P>
<P>
An officer heard three shots were fired from the mainland, but
nobody was injured; no damage was done, said Royal Canadian
Mounted Police officer Roger Somers.
</P>
<P>
Local native fishermen have said they will defend their traps
until they end fishing on October 7. They insist on their right to
set traps "to make a moderate livelihood", citing a Supreme Court
of Canada decision made last year in the Donald Marshall case as
support for their treaty right to fish where and when they wish.
</P>
<P>
Last month, federal Indian Affairs Minister Robert Nault and
leaders of the local Burnt Church band of Mi'kmaq Indians failed
to reach a fisheries agreement on the balance of "the rule of law"
and the interests of Indian bands.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Gymnast Stripped of Gold After Positive Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Andreea Raducan was
stripped of her women's all-around gymnastics gold medal after
testing positive for a banned stimulant, the International Olympic
Committee announced here on Tuesday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said the decision to strip the gold medal of the 16-
year-old, who's drawn comparisons to Nadia Comaneci for her looks
and talent, was made by the IOC's executive board, following the
recommendation from its medical commission.
</P>
<P>
The team doctor who gave Raducan the drug in two cold medicine
pills was expelled from the games and suspended through the 2002
winter games in Salt Lake and 2004 summer games in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Raducan is the first gymnast to be stripped of a medal because
of a drug violation, and is the second athlete at these games to
lose a gold. She is the sixth positive drug case at the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
With Raducan's disqualification, another Romanian, Simona
Amanar, gets the gold and teammate Maria Olaru goes from bronze to
silver. Liu Xuan of China, the original fourth-place finisher, now
gets the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Raducan was allowed to keep her other medals, a gold from the
team competition and a silver from the vault. Raducan tested
positive for pseudoephidrene, which is on the IOC's list of banned
stimulants, the IOC said.
</P>
<P>
She underwent three different tests after each competition. She
tested negative after the Romanians won the team gold last Tuesday,
but positive after she won the all-around Thursday.She tested
negative after winning a silver in the vault Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drug was given to her by a team doctor in two cold
medications, the IOC said. Raducan took two pills, one containing
pseudoephedrine and the second an over-the-counter drug.

progress, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The teams, led by Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
and attorney Gilad Sher, and Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat
and Mohamed Dahlan respectively, are scheduled to leave in a few
hours for Washington for further detailed talks in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the summit was being held in a very
good atmosphere and positive spirit. The two leaders were aiming at
building mutual trust after the failed Camp David summit and
narrowing gaps between them for reaching a final deal.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, Transport and Tourism Minster Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and
Barak's top aide Danny Yatom attended the summit, as did Arafat's
deputy Abu Mazen, Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed
Qurei (Abu Ala), Erekat and Arafat's political adviser Nabil Abu
Rudaineh.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a statement issued by Barak's office tried to lower
expectations for the summit, on which many analysts pinned hopes
for a breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "The meeting is aimed at voicing assessments
and exchanging views and not for conducting negotiations on
specific issues which are on the agenda."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been in a standstill mainly over the issue
of Jerusalem, and both sides were awaiting a package of bridging
proposals the Americans were expected to present in order to break
the current deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Romanian All-Around Winner Stripped of Gold After Positive Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Andreea Raducan was
stripped of her all-around gold medal after testing positive for a
banned drug, the International Olympic Committee sources said here
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The decision Tuesday to strip the medal of the 16-year-old,
who's drawn comparisons to Nadia Comaneci for her looks and talent,
was made by the IOC's executive board, following the
recommendation from its medical commission, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
He said the team doctor who gave Raducan the drug in two cold
medicine pills was expelled from the games and suspended through
the 2002 winter games in Salt Lake and 2004 summer games in Athens.
The decisions were confirmed by He Zhenliang, a member of the
International Olympic Committee's executive board.
</P>
<P>
Raducan is the first gymnast to be stripped of a medal because
of a drug violation, and is the second athlete at these games to
lose a gold. She is the sixth positive drug case at the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
With Raducan's disqualification, another Romanian, Simona
Amanar, gets the gold and teammate Maria Olaru goes from bronze to
silver. Liu Xuan of China, the original fourth-place finisher, now
gets the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Raducan was allowed to keep her other medals, a gold from the
team competition and a silver from the vault, He said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Progress Achieved in Cyprus Indirect Talks by Liu Xingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus appeared to have made some
progress as the two sides of the divided island have begun to touch
upon substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
The indirect talks had been focused mainly on procedural matters
and plans for future direct talks.
</P>
<P>
"One could say that there is some progress, that we are
discussing the four core issues (constitution, security, territory,
refugees-property) but that should not be taken to mean that we
have reached any agreements," Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
noted.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash was
indeed engaged in discussions on all four core issues, despite his
public protestations prior to this round of talks to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the tiny Mediterranean island after a failed coup seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The process of United Nations-sponsored proximity talks on
Cyprus started last December in an effort to find a way leading to
a comprehensive settlement on the island. The two-week fourth round
of indirect talks ended Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
So far, the positions of the two sides on the four key issues
continue to differ greatly, but on the issue of security some of
the floating ideas find the two sides edging toward each other.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has showed during discussions its
intention to accept the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern
Cyprus, provided that the 1960 treaty of guarantee continues to be
valid with a clear provision that Ankara would have the right to
intervene in Cyprus if the consitutional order is disturbed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, on the other hand, appeared ready to accept the presence
of a multi-national force under U.N. or NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. considered the existing treaties of establishment,
alliance and guarantee of 1960, which set up the Republic of
Cyprus, as reasonable agreements but acknowledged that they have to
be amended to make both sides feel secure.
</P>
<P>
Britain, one of the guarantor powers, fully backed the idea of
maintaining the 1960 treaties so long as its interests are
safeguarded by retaining its two military bases on the island and
particularly its monitoring systems in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side considered it imperative to find such
arrangements that would safeguard the implementation of any
agreement on security and find mechanisms that would deal with any
differences that may arise.
</P>
<P>
The most thorny issue under discussion at the talks, according
to reports here, was property and the return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots insisted on the right of all refugees to
choose to return to their homes, whereas the Turkish Cypriots
claimed that the return of Greek Cypriot refugees to the Turkish
Cypriot-administered area would change the demographic structure
there.
</P>
<P>
On the constitutional matters, controversy focused on
sovereignty, representation in governance, consensus in decision-
making bodies and rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of territory, the U.N. has set out certain criteria
relating to the economic viability of the areas along the existing
cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the new round of talks will probably take place
before the U.S. presidential elections, set for November 7, at the
U.N. bureau in Geneva and there are plans to bring the two sides
back to New York in early January.
</P>
<P>
Now it is believed that the U.N. will submit a comprehensive set
of ideas on all key aspects of the Cyprus issue at the next round
of proximity talks with a view to get more reactions from the two
sides to enable the peace process to move on.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges to Fight for Second Term in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, September 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair admitted Tuesday that the ruling Labor has
made mistakes over pension rises and the visitors attraction of
Millennium Dome, but he pledged to lead the Labor Party to a
second term in office.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech to the Labor's annual conference held in
the southern seaside city of Brighton, Blair spoke of a host of
initiatives to improve the health service, crack down on crime and
boost prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Britain faced a stark choice between the Tories, who would make
16 billion pounds (about 22.8 billion U.S. dollars) of cuts in
public services, and Labor which would invest for the long term,
he said.
</P>
<P>
But on the fuel crisis, the prime minister offered no fresh
promises to hauliers and farmers whose protests over fuel taxes
nearly brought the country to a standstill. He insisted the
government was listening to them but also had to listen to people
who wanted more money spent on services such as the National
Health Service (NHS).
</P>
<P>
In the one-hour speech which was billed as the most important
of Blair's political life, the prime minister admitted Labor had
come in for some of its harshest criticisms.
</P>
<P>
"After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the
government has taken a knock," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair admitted mistakes in handling pensions policy, with a
much-mocked 75 pence (1.10 U.S. dollars) a week increase this year,
and said he should have listened to warnings before backing London
's cash-guzzling Millennium Dome attraction.
</P>
<P>
"And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people
angry and we should be open enough to admit it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing and if I had my time
again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn
't try to run big visitor attractions.
</P>
<P>
On fuel duty, Blair said he was listening to stories of
hardship by hauliers, farmers and ordinary motorists.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted the world was full of competing causes, and
there were choices to be made.
</P>
<P>
On pensions, he reiterated the promises made by Chancellor
Gordon Brown Monday to target more help at middle- and low-income
pensioners.
</P>
<P>
He promised that those who have saved all their lives but are
not wealthy would also be helped.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he had a vision of a second term in office worth
fighting for.
</P>
<P>
He also promised a crackdown on youth crime, giving police
greater power to issue on-the-spot fines, close down pubs where
fighting breaks out, and to clamp down on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for zero tolerance of the yob culture," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Education spending would continue to rise, and an extra 1
billion pounds (1.45 billion U.S. dollars) would help provide
schools with Internet access, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also accused the Conservatives of achieving
the opposite of what they claimed and offering short-term tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Blair hailed a list of Labor's achievements since coming to
office, such as reducing unemployment and investing in schools and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
"The people's priorities are our priorities. This is a second-
term vision worth fighting for," he said. "For us, this government,
this party that believes passionately in a Britain where everyone,
not just a few, gets a chance to succeed and knows the Tories will
only take us backwards, we now know we are in a fight and it's a
fight I relish."
</P>
<P>
After three years of double-digit poll leads, Labor's standing
crashed this month following pickets at oil depots that nearly
shut the country down in protest against sky-high fuel taxes. The
Tories are now leading by four to eight points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advertising Expenditure Continues to Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. advertisers
continued to increase their spending on both traditional and
Internet media in the first half of this year, according to a
report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, advertising dollars spent in television,
newspapers, magazines, radio and outdoor increased by almost 15
percent to 47.7 billion U.S. dollars as compared with the
corresponding period last year, said the report from Competitive
Media Reporting (CMR), an advertising service company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, overall Internet advertising expenditures rose 65
percent to 1.3 billion dollars, accounting for 2.6 percent of all
advertising expenditures. A year ago this sector accounted for
only 1.8 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Among media outlets, cable networks led the growth with a
revenue increase of 31 percent, the CMR report said.
</P>
<P>
Among the industry groups, the automotive sector took the lead
by spending 5.6 billion dollars in the first six months, followed
by retail with 4.6 billion dollars. Among leading advertisers
General Motors led the way spending 1.4 billion dollars via
traditional advertising outlets. McDonald's was the number one
individual brand, spending 315 million dollars.

Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
an 11-foot high Polio Countdown Clock will be stationed at the U.N.
headquarters in New York during the summit and it will record the
number of cases of polio worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The number of cases recorded in 1988 at the launch of the
eradication initiative was 350,000 and had been reduced to 7,000
in 1999," Eckhard said. "It is hoped that by 2005 the clock will
read zero cases of polio."
</P>
<P>
Polio is a highly infectious disease which mainly afflicts
children below the age of three. The virus invades the nervous
system and can cause paralysis.
</P>
<P>
Widely endemic on five continents in 1988, polio is now found
only in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and the
Indian sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
Gro Harlem Brundtland, director-general of the World Health
Organization (WHO), and Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Finds New Case of Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgium said Tuesday it had
found its fifth case of mad cow disease since the start of this
year, sending the country's total figure to 15.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry said that health officials found a
seven-year-old cow with signs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) Monday in a farm near Bioul in southern Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The animal and the 74 other cows in the herd were to be
slaughtered later Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In Belgium's neighboring country Britain, the BSE epidemic is
starting to drop off in line with scientists' predictions, but the
number of known cases of "variant" CJD, the human form of the
disease, has increased to 74 in Britain, according to a latest
scientific report.
</P>
<P>
The new study by the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food came Monday after government officials played down fears
that up to eight more cows may have contracted BSE because of
inadequate measures to eradicated it.
</P>
<P>
The progress report outlined the measures taken to protect
public health in the six months from December 1999. It said that
BSE cases have already shown a dramatic decline and that the
situation was due to improve further in the future.
</P>
<P>
On average about 30 new cases were being found each month,
compared to 1,000 a month at the height of the epidemic in 1993,
the report said. The epidemic led to a serious food crisis in
Britain after the first case of mad cow disease was found in the
island country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union has taken several steps to monitor
and control the EU-wide spread of the mad cow disease since then.
</P>
<P>
However, 63 people had died of CJD by the end of June 2000,
with three provisional victims who had already died and a further
seven still alive but believed to have the disease, according to
the British report.
</P>
<P>
The British government said last Sunday that there was no new
outbreak of BSE and there was only one confirmed case of BSE in
July in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall on Earnings Warning From Kodak (RPT With Corrections) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
again Tuesday as a profit warning from Eastman Kodak increased
worries about investment returns in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 176.83 at 10,631.
32 points, extending its loss of 39.22 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 52.12 at 3,689.10 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 11.82 at 1,427.21.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged after Kodak announced that its third-quarter
earnings will be below the expectations because of rising material
costs, weakness in euro, the common European currency, and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
The latest warning of disappointing earnings hit both blue
chips and tech shares. Investors got concerned about investment
returns after the first batch of companies warned earlier this
month that their earnings in the third quarter will not meet the
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the price of oil and the weakening euro in the
recent days intensified worries about corporate earnings and
investment returns. The price of sweet crude was 31.53 U.S.
dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange today, down
nearly 7 dollars last week but worries about its effect on
corporate profits remained.
</P>
<P>
While stocks of manufacturers and retailers were lower, energy
issues were higher. Among them were Halliburton, Exxon Mobil and
Enron.
</P>
<P>
Some tech issues also moved higher. Microsoft rose after the
Supreme Court ruled that the software maker's appeal of its
antitrust case should be heard in lower court.
</P>
<P>
Handheld computer maker Palm was also higher. But Intel fell
for the third consecutive session after the chipmaker issued a
profit warning late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 4.65 at 654.83 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.56 at 928.45. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 5.49 at 509.89.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,604 down, 1,284 up and 487
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.09 billion shares from 977.53
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Recover: OPEC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After meeting with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Saudi
Arabian Minister of Petroleum Ibrahim Al Naimi, Rodriguez said
that before approving the price bands, a careful study was made,
which indicated the band system would obey the interests of
producing and consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez recalled that oil producers and consumers are
interested in looking for  stability, and therefore consider that
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) should
work on the part that corresponds to it, wherefore it expects that
the rest of the market's actors play their part.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the OPEC president referred to the
possibility that European Union countries follow the example of
the United States, and free part of their strategic oil reserves.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Europe Lagging Behind Japan in Mobile Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Mobile commerce in Japan
is expected to generate 400 million U.S. dollars this year, and it
will take the United States and Europe two years to reach that
point.
</P>
<P>
Even then, according to a report released Tuesday by U.S.
Internet research firm Jupiter Communications, U.S. and European
carriers must upgrade their infrastructure and adopt business
models that have driven the success of the Japanese markets.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide mobile commerce market is expected to grow to 7.6
billion dollars in 2003 and 22 billion dollars by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Japan's lead in the mobile market is aided by the sheer number
of Internet-enabled handsets in the country, Jupiter said. By the
end of 2000, the number of Net-enabled handsets will reach 6
million in both the U.S. and Europe, compared to 30 million in
Japan. By 2003, the number will rise to 115 million in the U.S.
and 254 million in Europe. Mobile commerce revenues in 2003 will
reach 600 million dollars in the U.S., 1.7 billion dollars in
Europe, and 3.5 billion dollars in Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to Jupiter, Japan's success in mobile interactive
services is largely due to effective carrier execution built
around four key elements: an adequate supply of handsets, the
implementation of a packet data network, equal opportunities for
content providers, and a billing infrastructure upgraded to
support charges for premium services.
</P>
<P>
Forrester Research, another U.S. Internet research firm,
reported Monday that online retail in the United States is alive
and well, despite the fact that many dot-coms have been dropping
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Forrester has revised its U.S. forecast for 2000 online retail
upward by 16 percent from 38.6 billion dollars to 44.8 billion
dollars. This growth is precipitated by a network effect in which
new consumers, retailers, product categories and technologies
increase the value of a market. But online retail will be
dominated by PC-based sales this year and through 2005, the
research firm said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Talks to Prevent Oil Price Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Gavrin said Tuesday at a
press conference in Caracas that "exaggerated high prices can turn
into a crisis and the excess of offer as new price falls, which
would damage producers' interests."
</P>
<P>
Russia, Oman, Norway, Angola and Mexico are five non-member
producing nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC). They are attending as "observers" the
interministerial meeting of 11 OPEC member counties, planned for
Tuesday, and which begins the second Summit in the organization's
history.
</P>
<P>
Gavrin warned OPEC that "it must be very balanced when weighing
steps, because prices must tend toward an equilibrium and --
according to his government -- the ideal is full growth between
producers and consumers" to prevent a crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia will produce 317 million tons of oil this year, of which
it will export 120 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Russia's production, Gavrin said his country is
following an "independent and reserved" policy, and has increased
it by 12 million tons in the year 2000; however more increases
aren't planned.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the minister said Russia has no plans to join
the OPEC oil-producing cartel.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation which we currently have with OPEC member
states is sufficient," he told reporters ahead of an OPEC summit
starting Wednesday in the Venezuelan capital.
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to join OPEC," added the minister, who
regularly attends meeting of the 11-member cartel as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Omani Oil Minister Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhy also dismissed
suggestions that his country could join OPEC, telling reporters
that "cooperating with the organization is more important than
being card-carrying member."
</P>
<P>
The OPEC comprised only five countries when it was first formed
in 1960. Its current 11 members are Saudi Arabia, Algeria, United
Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar and Venezuela.
