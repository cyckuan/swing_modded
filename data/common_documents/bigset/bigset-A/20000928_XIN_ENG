<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Makes Agreement with Striking Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina Wednesday made an agreement with the striking non-
government primary school teachers, promising to increase salary
and allowance of the teachers, according to the United News of
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister announced a 300 million taka (around 5.6
million U.S. dollars) financial package at a meeting with
representatives of Non-government Primary School Teachers
Association at her office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new financial measures, monthly salary and allowance
of an Assistant Teacher of non-government primary school has been
increased to 1,750 taka (32.4 dollars) from 1,300 taka (24 dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
The headmaster of non-government primary school will now
receive monthly salary and allowance of 1,800 taka (33 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Amidst cheers and slogans, Sheikh Hasina said the government
has also decided to pay monthly house rent of 100 taka (1.9
dollars) and medical allowance of 150 taka (2.8 dollars) for non-
government primary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said with the new financial benefit
announced Wednesday, non-government primary school teachers would
engage their talent more for the spread and development of
education.
</P>
<P>
"Education is the main weapon to combat poverty," she said,
adding that her government is committed to ensuring education to
all, a constitutional right of all citizens. A nation's socio-
economic development depends on uniform education, she added.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said the government is aware of the problems facing the
teacher community and assured that all these problems would be
addressed in phases within limited resources.
</P>
<P>
Some 93,000 teachers of 23,000 non-government primary schools
across the country went on strike for an indefinite period from
September 2, demanding nationalization of their respective
institutions.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the movement to press home their demand, the
teachers staged a demonstration near the prime minister's office
on September 25. Several teachers were hurt during clash with
police on the day.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Meteorological Observing System Installed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- An Advanced Meteorological
Observing System (AMOS) was formally opened Wednesday at Dhaka
Meteorological Office by Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina to improve
the weather forecasting and warning system in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The AMOS was installed under a project "Strengthening of
Weather Warning Services Related to Natural Disasters" with the
financial support of the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Under the same project, the radar network of Meteorological
Department has been expanded with the installation of a new radar
at Rangpur and replacement of the old one in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The entire Bangladesh is now under the coverage of four weather
surveillance radar stationed at Dhaka, Rangpur, Cox's Bazar and
Khepupara, officials of the Meteorological Department disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the opening ceremony, Hasina called for building
an effective and modern weather forecasting and warning system to
improve the quality of people's life and development.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Bangladesh is one of the most disaster-
prone countries in the world with frequent tropical cyclones,
storm surges, floods and droughts every year. The natural
calamities hamper normal life, hinder development and destroy
environmental balance.
</P>
<P>
Hasina hoped that there will be new dimension in the
development of forecasting models enabling meteorologists to
provide effective forecasts.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Olu Adeniji, Special
Representative of the UN Secretary-general Kofi Annan in Sierra
Leone, has said that the UN peace mission in the west African
country will succeed despite its current difficulties, reports
reaching here from Freetown said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Adeniji as saying during a trip here on
Tuesday that the UN, in conjunction with the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), has begun tackling the lingering
conflicts in Sierra Leone, in a way both politically and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a lecture named "the UN peacekeeping in Africa in
the post-cold war era: the Central African Republic and Sierra
Leone", Adeniji said the UN is expanding its political and
military roles in its peace keeping efforts in the two African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The UN is pushing forward a comprehensive package of
peacekeeping and political development in the region with an aim
to ensure peace and good governance, according to the UN diplomat.

The UN is also changing its mandate from peacekeeping to peace
enforcement, he said.

has made the peace prospect brighter in the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Air Embargo on Iraq Faces Serious Challenges by Li Xuejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- With more and more foreign
planes landing at the Saddam International Airport in the western
suburb of the Iraqi capital, the decade-old air embargo on Iraq is
facing increasingly serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
The latest challenge came from Jordan, a U.S. ally in the
region. The Jordanians sent an airliner to Baghdad, with a 75-
member delegation aboard, Wednesday evening to show solidarity with
the embargo-hit country.
</P>
<P>
It was the first plane from an Arab country to arrive here since
Iraq reopened the airport on August 17, and also the first flight
to Iraq from Jordan in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Jordanian Health Minister Tareq Suheimat said
Amman only notified the United Nations Sanctions Committee of the
flight, but did not wait for its approval.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that this will be the beginning of the
resumption of regular flights between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was following the lead of Russia and France, two
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, in
breaking the air ban maintained by the United States and Britain
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Russia was the first to send a plane to Baghdad, one day after
the reopening of the international airport, to underscore its
backing of Iraq's anti-embargo efforts.
</P>
<P>
So far, three Russian planes have landed in Baghdad in defiance
of the air embargo. This gave a strong signal that humanitarian and
civil flights to and from Iraq must not be banned.
</P>
<P>
German and France have followed suit. On August 20, a German
plane arrived on a humanitarian mission; and on September 22, a
French plane made a direct flight from Paris to Baghdad, the first
since the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As a driving force to keep the lid on Iraq, the U.S. felt uneasy
about this new development. "In the American view, it (flight to
Iraq) is a violation of the sanctions regime, something we deeply
regret and quite disappointed," a U.S. official to the U.N. said.
</P>
<P>
But France, part of the anti-Iraq international coalition during
the 1991 Gulf War, has a different understanding of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, we have considered there is no flight embargo
against Iraq," French Ambassador to the U.N. Jean-David Levitte
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that notification (to the U.N. Sanctions Committee)
is enough when it is a humanitarian flight or when there is no
cargo in the flight," he said.
</P>
<P>
There has been disagreement within the U.N. Security Council
over whether the sanctions include an air ban. While the U.S. and
Britain argue that all flights to or from Iraq must get prior
permission from the Sanctions Committee, Russia and France hold
that authorization is unnecessary as long as it is a humanitarian
or civil flight.
</P>
<P>
With more and more planes coming or planning to come to Iraq, it
appears the U.S. can do little to stop such flights.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has been reported that Russia and France will send
more planes to Iraq soon, and Russia has even announced to resume
regular civil flights from Moscow to Baghdad sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Iceland, India and other Arab countries such as
Yemen, Syria and Lebanon are also considering taking the bold move
to challenge the air embargo in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
All these point to the fact that the international demand for
ending the decade-old sanctions on Iraq is upsurging in defiance of
U.S. and British pressures.

<HEADLINE> Another Ship with Illegal Immigrants Found off Cyprus Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A ship carrying 35 illegal
immigrants anchored Thursday off the coast of Cyprus following a
mechanical problem, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said the
vessel will not be allowed to enter the port of the island, and
Cyprus is willing to offer the ship fuel, food and other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The ship's destination is not clear, he added.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a press conference after a meeting with
permanent secretary of the Interior Ministry Kyriakos
Triantafyllides, who returned Thursday from Lebanon where he held
talks with Lebanese officials over the repatriation of illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
More than 260 illegal immigrants arrived on the island's shores
earlier this month and are now on board a ship at southern coast
town Limassol.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government said the illegal immigrants, mainly
Pakistanis and Kurds, came to Cyprus from Lebanon. It insists that
they should be sent back to Lebanon according to an agreement
signed between the two countries last year that envisages the
return of illegal immigrants to the country from which they sail.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese government is still disputing evidence that the
illegal immigrants came from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a Lebanese delegation is expected to arrive here "
within the next few days" for further consultations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus island, due to its geographical location, has been a
major transit for illegal immigrants from the Middle East to
European countries. Some seek political asylum here or abroad and
many are conned by foreigners who promise to take them elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Calls for Total Write-off of its Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Finance Minister
Luisa Diogo has called for a total write-off of the country's
foreign debt, under the World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is almost certain to qualify for further debt relief,
under the "enhanced" version of the HIPC initiative, but that is
not enough, said Diogo in Prague, capital of the Czech Republic,
where she were attending the annual meeting of the IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal solution for a country as poor as ours ... would be
to write off the current debt in its entirety", said the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, Diogo admitted that there is no guarantee that the
country's creditors would listen to these pleas.
</P>
<P>
But the current leaders of the IMF and World Bank are receptive
to calls for further elimination of the poor country's debts,
according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Killer Shark Killed on Tanzanian Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A killer shark, which
has taken five lives away from the beaches here has been killed,
the police confirmed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A police officer with the Central Police Station of the city
said that the shark was killed by Hugo Lawick, director of a Dar
es Salaam-based private sports fishing company.
</P>
<P>
Since hearing loss of the lives caused by the shark's attack,
Lawick, a renowned marine hunter, decided to use all his fishing
experiences to kill the fish, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
He organized a six-man team and embarked on the hunting journey
aboard a special fishing boat on Wednesday. He returned on
Thursday morning with the killed shark.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the shark hunter, the number of the
sharks in the nearby waters is likely to grow, for many of them,
like the one he had just killed, are pregnant.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Stresses Kwacha as Legal Tender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has warned
that it will take stern action against individuals and business
houses refusing to accept the Zambian kwacha as a medium of
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said in a statement released in
Lusaka on Thursday that the Zambian kwacha is still the legal
tender, adding that it is an offense for anyone to refuse to
accept the kwacha as a medium of exchange under the Bank of Zambia
Act.
</P>
<P>
He added that any rejection of the kwacha should be reported to
police so that appropriate action could be taken against the
erring individuals and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said the suspension of exchange controls and
liberalization of the foreign exchange mean that the Zambian
kwacha can be converted into other foreign currencies without any
hindrance.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to local, foreign as well as multi-national
companies and non-governmental organizations to protect the
credibility and integrity of the kwacha as the official Zambian
legal tender.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba's statement follows the misrepresentation by some
sectors of the community that there is no legislation in Zambia
which restricts business houses to use the kwacha as the only
medium of business transaction as people are free to use any type
of currency to do business.

BUCHAREST, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania's reform in the

on Thursday during a meeting between Romania's Minister of
National Defense Sorin Frunzaverde and NATO Deputy Secretary for

<P>
NATO will analyze Romania's plan which was completed a few
weeks ago, the NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is designed to make the partner countries to meet the
NATO entry criteria, more quickly, Kleiber said. NATO has been
following with special interest the reform in the Romanian army
and has provided recommendations so that the process may be
fulfilled as good as possible, the NATO official added. Kleiber

<HEADLINE> Romania's Foreign Debt Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania's medium and long-
term foreign debt stood at 8.6 billion U.S. dollars at end-June
2000, which was 145 million dollars or 1.7 percent higher than at
end-1999, Romania's Central Bank (BNR) reported.
</P>
<P>
Short-term foreign debt was of 327 million dollars at the same
date.
</P>
<P>
According to BNR, the increase in foreign debt is due to a
deficit of 306.1 million dollars between drawings and repayments.
</P>
<P>
High on the debtors' list is the government, with 48.2 percent
of the medium and long-term foreign debt contracted through direct
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
Government-guaranteed debt recorded a 1.6 percent fall, while
private debt also went down to 27.8 percent from a previous 28.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Romania's foreign debt to international creditors went up 317
million dollars and made up 48.2 percent of the total foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Warns Dangers of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
president Nelson Mandela Thursday called for condemnation of those
aspects of globalization that brought poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the closing session of Britain's ruling
Labour Party conference in southern England's coastal town of
Brighton, Mandela said: "All human beings are born equal and they
must be treated equally."
</P>
<P>
"The concern for the common good, which characterized the
international solidarity we spoke of, is in danger of being lost
in the current understanding of a global world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would argue that the shrinking of the globe through the
advances in communications and information technology has made it
even more incumbent upon us to become once more the keepers of our
brothers and sisters wherever in the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our historic relationship with the Labour Party rests upon our
common concern to centrally represent the voice and interests of
those sectors traditionally excluded from power and privilege,"
said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the impact of AIDS and HIV on South Africa was "a
crisis of a dimension which I cannot support in words".
</P>
<P>
"In our country, 10 teachers die every month of AIDS. In one
university, a student dies every week. And in one of the most
prominent universities in the country, more than 25 percent of the
students are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
"In one of our neighboring countries, three Cabinet ministers,
one of whom was a doctor, have died because of illness."
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is an honorary member of the Labour Party,
appealed: "We look to our friends to assist us to stave off that
crisis."
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad fact of our times that in spite of the huge
advances... of humankind, poverty and inequality remain features
of all societies," he said. "This may very well be one of the
major political and moral tasks of the Labour Party in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
Mandela was the first black president of South Africa after the
end of apartheid. As the African National Congress leader, he
spent over 27 years in jail, mainly on Robben Island.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sees Agriculture Important to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Increasing
productivity in agriculture offers a number of strategic
advantages in developing countries, according to the annual U.N.
world economic and social survey released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In most of the developing nations, agriculture can absorb 70 to
95 percent of the labor force where poverty rates tend to be
higher than in urban areas, U.N. economists said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a strengthened farm sector can bring down food
prices and improve nutrition and labor productivity in the entire
country, generate employment and heighten demand for manufactured
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
It even can help channel labor and capital into the development
of other sectors and earn foreign exchange, they found.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, they said, a situation where manufacturing
operates with developing economies of scale is likely to lead to a
poverty trap, because farmer income is too low to create a demand
for manufactured goods and services.

<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott wound up the Labor conference on Thursday in the
southern coastal town of Brighton with a speech telling delegates
to get out and start winning the next election.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told conference the party would "take the Tories to
the cleaners" at the next election.
</P>
<P>
He called on delegates to recruit more members before the next
election. "Be confident. Be proud. Walk tall. Get out there and
tell the people what we have done," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tell them what we will do with their support. Tell them what
the Tories would do if they ever came back. And remember to ask
the people to join the Party. Our solidarity is our strength," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told the conference Labor had been delivering on its
promises. "We have got a simple message to tell. Labor has got the
economy on a steady course, which meant taking some difficult
decisions. Now we are investing in our public services - hospitals,
schools, police and transport."
</P>
<P>
On the Party's 100th birthday, Prescott said the Labor movement
had civilized the 20th century with its vision of democratic
socialism - and he called for its values to be carried on into the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> NGO Conference for South Lebanon Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 delegates participated
in a two-day conference of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO)
that opened in Beirut Thursday to study ways of helping development
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. news release published Thursday said the conference is
the product of joint efforts by the Italian government, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Lebanon's Council for
Development and Reconstruction (CDR), the government's development
arm.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss opened the conference which includes
representatives of 80 international NGOs and 70 national ones in
addition to representatives of the donor countries and other U.N.
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the people in south Lebanon want a donor meeting as
soon as possible and only "the development in the south can
guarantee the internal solidarity, build the confidence in Lebanon
and avoid unrest in this region."
</P>
<P>
The conference came only days after Lebanon was disappointed by
the lack of sufficient response from international donor nations to
its request for a meeting on October 9 to commit funds for
development projects in the south.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries want to wait until the new Lebanese
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The NGOs conference is expected to provide a stopgap before a
more suitable time comes for the donor nations to meet.
</P>
<P>
European Union Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos attended the
conference. He said to local media when he arrived in Beirut from
Syria Wednesday that the conference will help pave the way for the
projected donor nations conference "at an appropriate time."

<HEADLINE> E.U. Envoy Talks with Lebanese Speaker on South Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Middle East
envoy Miguel Moratinos talked with Lebanese Speaker Nabih Berri
here Thursday on the situation in south Lebanon, the official NNA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who arrived here Wednesday from Syria to attend the
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) Conference, said that offering
water, electricity and removing mines in south Lebanon are the most
important tasks now.
</P>
<P>
"For the people in south, the provision of enough water and
electricity is more important than offering money for them. I hope
they will not have these problems in the coming winter," the envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the process of mine clearance should be
accelerated. "Among all 130,000 mines planted in the south, only a
few have been removed and the remainders are threatening the
residents in south, especially the children," he said, adding
that "the mines deter the potential investment and development
there."
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon was liberated in May after Israel withdrew its
troops after 22 years of occupation there.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian refugees issue, the E.U. envoy said he
understands Lebanon's stance on this issue and agreed that the
refugees in Lebanon should be given priority.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the problem, we have to wait for the process of
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, but all of us know that the
refugees in Lebanon should be considered at first," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 450,000 Palestinian refugees are taking shelter in Lebanon.
Beirut said the refugees should have the right to return home.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said the NGO Conference would help pave the way for
the projected donor nations conference "at an appropriate time." "
Lebanese government should know, full preparations must be made
before holding a donors meeting," the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
The present government of Lebanon will step down next month and
it was reported that many donors think it is better to hold a
donors meeting after the new government is formed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Busts Bombing Network, Arrests 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces have
busted a bombing network that was linked to the Iraq-based Iranian
opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO), the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Twelve members of the network were arrested, of whom seven
people have been sentenced to death sentences, the report quoted
Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi as saying in the southern city of
Yazd.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified different branches of the network, and some
members of the network whom we know are abroad," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the network had been plotting terrorist bombing attacks
within Iran, but did not specify when and how the attacks were to
be carried out. He also failed to clarify when and where the 12
were arrested and tried.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, in the past two years, the MKO
supported by the Iraqi army and intelligence service has dispatched
terrorist groups to Iran. But most of the groups have been busted.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a famous political-military group which fought against
late shah's regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq
following sharp differences with the clergy brought to power by the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The group has launched numerous cross-border attacks inside Iran
in recent years, including assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Speaker Decries Sharon's Visit to Temple Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestine
Legislative Council (PLC) Ahmed Qurei strongly condemned the visit
by Israeli right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon and some of the
Likud legislators to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is a clear expression of the Israeli designs to
eliminate the Islamic and Arab features of the Temple Mount," Qurei
told the PLC session held in the West Bank town of Ramallah on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The visit testifies to the criminal designs of the Israeli
government against Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a tactical step in the negotiating process and falls in
the framework of coordination between the opposition Likud and the
Israeli government, he added, citing the protection provided to the
visit by the Israeli government and police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qurei praised the position adopted by the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
towards the issues of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Sharon's visit was to show to grass-root Israelis
that the Jewish state should not give up sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, Likud officials said.
</P>
<P>
The visit sparked violent protests, leading to the injuries of
dozens of Israeli soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators, including
two Israeli Arab lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount, located in the walled Old City of East
Jerusalem, is the site of the former Jewish Temple, the most sacred
shrine of Judaism. Muslims call it al-Haram al-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary, which houses Al Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock, the
third holiest shrine in Islam.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty over the holy site is the toughest issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. For now, Muslim clerics have
autonomy in administering the site, although Israeli police remains
in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, a Palestinian demonstration incurred by rumors that
Jewish extremists planned to rebuild the Jewish Temple led to
clashes, in which 19 Palestinians were killed and 140 wounded after
Israeli police opened fire.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
decision to reopen an "archaeological tunnel" just outside the
compound triggered riots, leaving 58 Palestinians and 15 Israelis
dead.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said he regarded Sharon's visit as "a very serious
matter" because of Sharon's role in the 1982 massacre of hundreds
of Palestinian refugees near Beirut. Sharon was the mastermind of
Israeli army's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
He condemned Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount as a grave and
provocative infringement on the Muslim holy sites, and he called on
all Muslim countries to denounce Sharon's conduct and defend the
holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders had warned that Sharon's visit could lead to
a recurrence of the bloody clashes in 1990 and 1996.

CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Thursday
condemned the visit by Israeli right-wing Likud leader Ariel Sharon
and some of the Likud legislators to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab organization in its statement warned of grave
consequences of "continued and deliberate Israeli violations of Al
Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem" as well as using al-Haram al-Sharif (the
Temple Mount) by Israeli politicians for election gains.
</P>
<P>
The statement blamed Sharon's visit for the eruption of violent
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers that ensued.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League is drawing the attention of the international
community, peace sponsors, European Union countries and all peace
lovers to the grave consequences of the aggressive Israeli
practices towards the holy places," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Sharon visited the Temple Mount for 45 minutes, a move which has
sparked demonstrations by Palestinians and clashes with Israeli
soldiers, causing serious injuries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
approved liberalization of the country's petroleum market,
allowing private fuel companies to source and supply petroleum
products according to market price in the country, Secretary of
the Mines and Energy Ministry Nichoals Kitikiti announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's private sector, under the new policy, is to take
over completely the role used to be played by the troubled
National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM).
</P>
<P>
NOCZIM, with tens of millions of U. S. dollars in short to
import enough petroleum for the country, is to play a regulating
role and will be held responsible for managing the country's
strategic petroleum reserves.
</P>
<P>
The new policy is expected to bring an end to the severe fuel
shortages the country has been experiencing since late last year,
Kitikiti told a conference attended by stakeholders of the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government decided at a cabinet meeting on
Wednesday to "take concrete steps" to expand oil importation and
develop a long-term fuel strategy for the country's economic
recovery.

Luisa Diogo Thursday rejected a  widely held saying that the
International Monetary Funds (IMF) and the World Bank are
instruments of the rich countries, arguing the two institutions
are also useful to developing countries, though they need reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We know countries that chose to stop being members (of the IMF

they had when they were members," said Diogo in Prague, capital of

the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
She said some of such countries found that they no longer had
the funds to import basic goods like fuel and medicines.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that these institutions have to listen
to all their members in order to improve their work to the benefit
to all," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, she believes that the new head of
the IMF, Horst Kohler, as well as World Bank President James
Wolfensohn, are genuinely interested in changing the way their
organizations operate so that all their members can benefit from
them.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Social Equality in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela has urged people to act against some
African leaders' self-styled entitlement to social wealth and
state power at the expense of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
"Africa can not renew herself where its upper echelons are a
mere parasite on rest of the society, enjoying a self-endowed
mandate to use their political power and define the use of such
power," Mandela said in a written address while accepting a Doctor
Degree conferred to him by the Open University of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The situation makes Africa remain at "the periphery of the
world economy" and "poor, underdeveloped and incapable of
development," he said in the speech read by South African High
Commissioner to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa's renewal demands that its intelligentsia must
immerse itself in the titanic and all-round struggle to end
poverty, ignorance, disease and backwardness.
</P>
<P>
The senior statesman called for rebellions "against the tyrants
and the dictators, those who seek to corrupt our societies and
steal the wealth that belongs to the people".

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean, DRC Presidents Call for UN Deployment in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zimbabwe here on Thursday called
on the United Nations to quickly deploy the promised peace
keepers to the DRC to help end the civil war there.
</P>
<P>
The call came after a three-hour talks between visiting DRC
President Laurent Kabila and his counterpart Robert Mugabe, with
the war in the DRC as the main topic.
</P>
<P>
"U.N. was probably delaying the deployment because of recent
cease-fire violations in the northern part of the country," said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said the deployment was delayed due to lack of funds
despite his government's recent discussions and an agreement with
U.N. Secretary-general Koffi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has more than 11,000 soldiers in the DRC, who have
been helping Kabila's army to wad off attacks from rebels backed
by Rwanda and Uganda since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi recently told
Parliament that Zimbabwean troops in the DRC would come back home
as soon as the U.N. peace keepers are deployed in that country.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Defends Kwacha as Legal Tender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
warned that it will take stern action against individuals and
business houses in the country refusing to accept kwacha as a
medium of exchange.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said in a statement
released here Thursday that kwacha is still the legal tender and
it is an offense for anyone to refuse to accept it as a medium of
exchange under the Bank of Zambia Act.
</P>
<P>
Any rejection of kwacha should be reported to the police so
that appropriate action can be taken against the erring
individuals and businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kalumba, suspension of exchange controls and
liberalization of foreign exchange means that kwacha is now
convertible and can be converted into other foreign currencies
without any hindrance.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to local, foreign as well as multi-national
companies and non-governmental organizations to protect the
credibility and integrity of kwacha as Zambia's official legal
tender.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba's remarks came in the wake of misrepresentation by some
sectors of the community that there is no legislation in Zambia
which restricts business houses to use kwacha as the only medium
of business transaction as people are free to use any type of
currency to transact.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Announces 2001 Budget Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has
announced that phase two of the 2001 budget process which includes
facilitating civil society participation in drafting the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) has begun and will continue
throughout 2000.
</P>
<P>
Acting Secretary to the treasury Stella Chibanda announced in a
statement here on Thursday that the integration of the budget
process with the PRSP working groups will make the 2001 budget
system the most transparent and most consultative ever,
considering the fact that the PSRP working groups were drawn from
nationals who want to see the real reduction of poverty in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to Chibanda, phase one of the 2001 budget process,
documenting organizational structures and functions, was completed
in June. From the second half of July to mid September, spending
agencies were preparing their work plans for 2001.
</P>
<P>
She assured citizens that the Ministry of Finance in
consultation with Cabinet Office has designed an embracing
framework of the PSRP process, which addresses key economic and
social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chibanda noted that eight PSRP working groups had already been
established covering agriculture, tourism, mining, manufacturing,
health, macro-economics, governance, education and industry.
</P>
<P>
"Transforming an economy is a sensitive process, but the good
performance of the Zambian economy from 1991 to date is remarkable
and requires the full support of the Zambians and the
international community. There is tremendous goodwill from the
international community for the success of the Zambian economy but
the challenge is on ourselves," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chibanda has called on the government ministries and
departments to formulate their work plans within the framework of
the 2001-2003 budget.
</P>
<P>
She said increases in budget allocations for 2001 would be
focused on priority functions, which should have well defined
implementation strategies and performance targets for the 2001
work plans.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Defends Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) Thursday warned that
there would be chaos in the country should President Robert Mugabe
step down as leader of both the ruling party and the government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party would definitely field Mugabe in the 2002
presidential elections despite grumbling by certain quarters
within the ruling party, Secretary for Zanu-pf Administration
Didymus Mutasa told reporters attending a parliamentary reporting
workshop held here.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as Mugabe goes, there will be chaos in this country,"
he said, stressing that the whole country which he described as
divided on ethnic grounds would break up if Mugabe was to leave
the political stage.
</P>
<P>
"Those people who are saying he should step down do not like
this country because Mugabe is a symbol of the unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it would not be wise for Zanu-pf to come up with a new
presidential candidate when only last year the congress in Harare
agreed that Mugabe should continue as President.
</P>
<P>
According to Mutasa, it is unfortunate that Zimbabweans are
being told to hate Mugabe by the enemies of the country and they
are beginning to believe those lies.
</P>
<P>
"We are reluctant to challenge him for the party's presidency
not because we are afraid of him," he said. "The truth of the
matter is that we respect him."

<HEADLINE> Greece Vows to Punish Those Responsible for Sea Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday vowed that it
would bring those responsible for Tuesday night's ferry accident
in the Aegean Sea to justice.
</P>
<P>
It was an obligation and a pledge to shed light on this
incomprehensible tragedy and all those responsible would be
brought to justice regardless of how high they stood, Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis said at a cabinet meeting exclusively held
for the tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that the investigation would go to the
bottom of things regardless of whether they would have to overturn
behaviors and points of view that had been followed for years.
</P>
<P>
Greece's public prosecutor Dimitris Dadinopoulos Thursday
completed a preliminary investigation and the first exploratory
examinations of witnesses, survivors and crew members.
</P>
<P>
The reports would be sent to the Greek Merchant Marine Ministry,
the public prosecutors in charge of the case and Simitis by Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Vassilis Haralambis, the third engineer on board
the ferry when the accident occurred, human error should be blamed
for the accident.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting any talk of engine failure, he said that the accident
was due purely to human error.
</P>
<P>
The 110-meter "Express Samina" has been used for 34 years and
it was due to be withdrawn from service later December.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, some two thirds of the 409 passenger ferries plying
the sea routes are reportedly classed as "old or very old," while
the only one third were built in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Greek Aegean Minister Nikos Sigounakis said Thursday that the
clause allowing ships built over 27 years ago to make regular
trips should be revised, and steps should also be made toward the
training of sailors in the use of rescue means.
</P>
<P>
The "Express Samina," which departed the port of Piraeus for
Paros Tuesday night, hit a rock and sank within 20 minutes off the
Aegean island of Paros.
</P>
<P>
The vessel carried 463 passengers and 61 crew members Tuesday
night and only 452 have so far been rescued, according to latest
reports.
</P>
<P>
At least 66 people have been killed while six others are still
missing.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Agriculture Conference Aimed at Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- About 200 scholars, high-
ranking government officials and industry representatives from the
United States and China met this week at a bilateral agriculture
conference to discuss the challenge of feeding a growing world
population in a way that protects environmental and economic
health.
</P>
<P>
The conference, Cooperation for Progress in the 21st Century,
was held Monday and Tuesday at Riverside, California.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both sides talked about land use, soil quality,
water resources, pest management, biotechnology, traditional plant
breeding, food processing, trade, environmental protection and
labor.
</P>
<P>
They also drew up plans for cooperation to outline ways that
policy-makers and scholars from the United States and China can
work together to solve agricultural issues shared by two of the
world's most agriculturally productive nations.
</P>
<P>
"This conference is not about the past, but about the future,"
said Raymond Orbach, Chancellor of University of California at
Riverside (UCR), who was instrumental in arranging the chance for
an academic exchange with high-ranking U.S. and Chinese
agriculture ministers. "I can think of no more important goal than
feeding the world's population," Orbach said.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, we will be planting the seeds for future
cooperation," said Federici, a UCR entomology professor. "In the
long-run, we are going to find that some of those professional
relationships bear fruit in scientific discoveries."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baowen, Vice Minister of the Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture, and Richard Rominger, Deputy Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture delivered speeches at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference was a joint effort of UCR, the Chinese Ministry
of Agriculture, China Agriculture University, the UC Division of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, the UC Pacific Rim Research
Program, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and the United States Department
of Agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Turkey's Political Will for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday once again
urged neighboring Turkey to show its political will in its efforts
to become an European Union (EU) member.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will have to prove that it has the political will for
the great changes it will have to make, both domestically and in
its foreign policy," said Alternate Foreign Minister Elissavel
Papazoi.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the EU's relations with Turkey must be clear
and Athens would insist on the implementation of last December's
Helsinki summit decisions concerning Ankara's EU membership.
</P>
<P>
She said that Greece would contribute to setting out the
framework of economic and political criteria under which Turkey
would become an EU member.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that there were common rules and respect
for common values, and this was demanded of every country that
wished to be a candidate for the EU.
</P>
<P>
For years, Greece had refused to support Turkey's European
orientation because of the neighboring country's "aggressive"
policy toward Greece, but Athens decided to change its position at
the Helsinki summit with conditions such as Cyprus' accession to
the EU should not be blocked and Turkey must change its unfriendly
stance toward Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have since last June taken steps to improve
their strained bilateral ties by holding several rounds of talks
and signing a number of cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish foreign ministry delegation is to arrive in Athens
Friday for a meeting of the Greek-Turkish "Directive Committee"
monitoring the ratification and implementation of the pacts.
</P>
<P>
On October 15, the foreign ministers of the two countries will
also meet in the southeastern Greek island of Rhodes to discuss
the developments of Greek-Turkish relations.

<HEADLINE> Putin Says France Important Partner of Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin said here Thursday that France is "a traditional, leading
and irreplaceable partner of Russia" and that Moscow attaches
great significance to enhancing ties with Paris.
</P>
<P>
"Developing relations and cooperation with France and the
European Union is a priority of Russia's foreign policy, and we
will push ahead with such a partnership," Putin told a meeting in
the Kremlin with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who
arrived here Wednesday evening for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The French minister's visit to Moscow is the start of a series
of bilateral contacts. "We hope the contacts will promote Russia's
relations with France and the European community," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that he had come to Moscow not only as French
foreign minister, but also as representative of a country
presiding the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Moscow negotiations will help
prepare Putin's first official visit to France and attendance of
the Russia-EU summit, scheduled for October 30-November 1.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Vedrine also held talks with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov. After their meeting, Ivanov announced that
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov will visit France in mid-
December.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed trade and economic ties between the two
states, global strategic stability, the situation in the Balkans
and Iraq as well as the Middle East peaceful process.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov stressed that the stability in Europe and other parts of
the world depends to a large extent on the cooperation between
Russia and France. The two countries' stands on a lot of issues,
such as strategic stability and ways of solving regional conflicts,
are similar.
</P>
<P>
Russia is ready to expand cooperation with France in the fields
of security and defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's visit to Russia "is taking place at the best possible
time." This is a very important moment in Russian-French relations,
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the meeting, Vedrine noted that it
is necessary to "give a more specific meaning to the concept of
partnership" between the European Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to "better coordinate what the EU can
offer Russia and what Russia can offer the EU -- for example, the
cooperation in the sphere of science and technology."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Won't Benefit from HIPC Membership: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Being a "good borrower" and non-
defaulter, Bangladesh didn't apply for the ongoing Heavily-
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative of the World Bank-
International Monetary Fund meeting for debt relief, a top
official said Thursday at a press briefing at the prime minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, Bangladesh is not a heavily indebted country and
poverty is gradually declining here," Principal Secretary to the
Prime Minister S.A. Samad said, adding that Bangladesh would lose
many other benefits including easy-term credit if it becomes a
member of HIPC group.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC initiative was designed to provide exceptional
assistance to eligible countries following sound economic policies
to help them reduce their external debt burden to sustainable
level.
</P>
<P>
Contradicting a press report on the issue, Samad said debt
level of Bangladesh is sustainable and it is no more than 15
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We are a good borrower, we have excellent credit record, and
we never defaulted. So we don't need to be a member of HIPC, which
will cut other benefits," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The countries included in the HIPC initiative will have to
repay their debt quickly while they will be deprived of soft loans
from different World Bank and IMF bodies.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying Bangladesh's position, Samad said debt relief has
been linked with poverty reduction and this creates tension
between quick debt relief and comprehensive strategies.
</P>
<P>
He felt that overload of conditionality should be avoided as
HIPC initiative is not likely to provide a lasting exit from debt
problems unless strong and sustained economic growth is ensured.
</P>
<P>
Tackling growth and poverty effectively would be a much longer
process than debt relief, and would require additional measures,
said the prime minister's principal secretary.

<HEADLINE> Flood Toll in West Bengal Exceeds 600 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the state capital of Calcutta, which has been under red
alert since Tuesday, flood water inundated a number of areas in
the southwestern part of the metropolis, forcing the state
government to shift over 3,000 people to safer places and shut
down a local crematorium temporarily, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
India's Opposition leader Congress President Sonia Gandhi on
Thursday made an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas in several
districts of West Bengal by a private plane, the PTI noted in a
separate report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said here
on Thursday that the central government would provide relief
assistance to the West Bengal government to tide over the
unprecedented floods in the state.
</P>
<P>
A central team would soon be undertaking a tour of the flood-
affected areas in West Bengal to assess the losses, he told
reporters after addressing a police conference.
</P>
<P>
Voicing grief over the loss of life and property in the floods,
the prime minister said the armed forces have been directed to
provide succour and relief to the flood victims on a war footing.
The air force has also been asked to undertake dropping of food
and other relief material by helicopters, he added.

WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased
at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the second quarter of the year,
higher than the 4.8 percent increase in the first quarter, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>

estimated one month ago and the 5.2 percent rate initially
calculated.
</P>
<P>
The major contributors to the increase in real GDP in the
second quarter were nonresidential fixed investment, personal
consumption expenditures for services, inventory investment,
exports, and federal government spending, the government said. The
contributions of these components were partially offset by an
increase in imports.
</P>
<P>
Personal consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
all economic activity, rose a revised 3.1 percent in the second
quarter, slightly higher than the previous estimate of a 2.9
percent gain, but still the smallest increase since the second
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 14.6 percent in
the second quarter, compared with an increase of 21 percent in the
first quarter. Federal government spending rose at a whopping
annual rate of 17.2 percent in the second quarter in contrast to a
decrease of 14.2 percent in the first.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, however, continued to be a drag on
growth. The bloated deficit subtracted 1 percentage point from
growth in the second quarter, compared to a reduction of 0.9
percentage points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times over
the last 15 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control. Many economists believe the Fed will leave interest rates
unchanged at its meeting next week, given more recent signs of
moderating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the current quarter, many analysts believe the economy has
slowed to a growth rate in the 3 percent range.
</P>
<P>
Even with the robust growth in the second quarter, inflation
pressures actually moderated. An inflation gauge tied to personal
consumption expenditures and closely watched by Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan, rose at a revised annual rate of 2.1 percent in the
second quarter, better than the previous estimate and down from a
3.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's GDP report also said that after-tax profits of U.S.
corporations grew by 2.5 percent in the second quarter, up
slightly from the previous estimate of a 2.4 percent increase, but
down from 5.7 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, corporate profits rose a revised 17.5
percent, higher than the initial estimate of a 17.3 percent gain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Influence Yugoslav Election: Indian Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Samata Party, a
member of the ruling National Democratic Alliance, accused
Thursday the United States of "trying to influence" the Yugoslav
presidential elections, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The party, two leaders of which were among the nine Indian
observers to monitor the Yugoslav elections, also criticized the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Cable News Network (CNN)
for their "blatantly biased" coverage of the elections, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Washington Post reported that the U.S. administration
pumped in 77 million U.S. dollars into Yugoslavia to see the end
of President Slobodan Milosevic. Washington has also reportedly
said that sanctions against the country will not be lifted if
Milosevic was re-elected", Samata Party spokesman S. S. Srivastwa
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is certainly trying to influence the voters by such
actions and statements," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the BBC and CNN of "blatantly biased coverage" before
and during the elections on Sunday, the two Samata leaders said: "
We are critical of the role of the BBC and CNN in making truth a
casualty."
</P>
<P>
Contrary to apprehensions that elections would be rigged, "they
were held in a free and fair atmosphere," they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fairness could be judged from the fact that
Milosevic polled only 40.23 percent of votes in the elections
against 48.22 for his rival Vojislav Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
"The free, fair and cheap election (in Yugoslavia) has many
lessons for India to learn," said Brahmanand Mandal, one of the
two leaders and member of Indian parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Syria signed on
Thursday a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the fields
of security and education.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, Turkish Interior Minister
Saadettin Tantan said the document on security cooperation "is
important for the development of relations between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that within this framework, the two sides will carry out
joint struggle against terrorism, organized crimes, drug-smuggling,
false documentation and money-laundering by mutual exchanges of
information and experience.
</P>
<P>
visiting Syrian Interior Minister Mohammad Harba said that Syria
has never been a source which disturbs Turkey, adding "this issue
is over."
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the document will prepare the ground for a
comprehensive security cooperation agreement, which is expected to
be signed within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is currently negotiating with Syria for the release of an
additional statement to follow up the Adana Accord they signed in
October, 1998, under which Syria pledged to stop supporting Kurdish
rebels in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had accused Syria of hosting the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK) which was engaged in anti-Ankara campaign since 1984 for
self-rule in Kurdish-populated southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During their talks on Wednesday, the two ministers agreed to
continue joint fight against the PKK as Turkey reportedly asked
Syria to provide the PKK archives that have been kept in the Syrian
capital Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also asked the Syrian delegation to confiscate the PKK
funds in Syrian banks and to prevent the PKK terrorist activities
in the Bekaa Valley of Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers said that they did not touch upon another
contentious point that blocks bilateral relations -- the sharing of
water of the Euphrates and Tigris, which originate in Turkey and
flow down to drought-stricken Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Iraq accuse upstream Turkey of building dams on
the two rivers that significantly reduce water flow to their
territories, and attempting to use the waters as weapons in case of
crisis, an allegation rejected by Ankara as "unjustified."
</P>
<P>
Syria, together with Iran and other Arabian countries, has been
uneasy at the close ties between Turkey and Israel, notably their
growing military cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Dinar Soars After Foreign Trade in Dollars Halts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi currency dinar
skyrocketed against the U.S. dollar on Thursday amid dollar-selling
spree in the wake of the government's Monday decision to stop using
the greenback in foreign trade transactions.
</P>
<P>
The dinar, which opened at 1,910 dinars to one dollar Thursday
morning, shot up to 1,500 dinars to one dollar before settling down
at about 1,680 dinars against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The soar of dinar also came following government remarks that
the recent foreign flights to Baghdad foretells the decay of the
decade-old international sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government decided on September 25 to replace the U.S.
dollar with other currencies such as the euro in its foreign deals.
Baghdad condemned the dollar as the currency of an "enemy state."
</P>
<P>
A government statement said the move was to confront the "daily
American-Zionist (Israeli) aggression" against the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States, along with Britain, is enforcing two no-fly
zones in Iraq with the claimed aim to protect the Kurds in the
north and Shiite Muslims in the south from possible government
persecution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain are also the only two Security Council
permanent members trying to maintain the crippling U.N. sanctions
on Iraq imposed more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel, a regional ally of the U.S., is an arch foe of Iraq in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The government decision pushed more Iraqis to sell the dollars
they are holding, leading to the dramatic slump of the dollar,
money changers in Baghdad said.
</P>
<P>
However, some money traders expect the fluctuation to calm down
and the dollar prices to settle at a given rate as the government
decision does not concern local markets.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the dinar has experienced such
appreciation since Iraq accepted the U.N. oil-for-food program in
late 1996, when it rose to 450 to the dollar. The dollar peaked at
3,000 dinars prior to the deal, which allows Iraq to sell oil to
buy humanitarian goods including food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The dinar was worth 3.2 dollars before the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, several foreign flights, including three
Russian, one French and one Jordanian, have arrived in Baghdad in
defiance of U.S. and British pressures. More flights are expected.
</P>
<P>
These countries notified the U.N. Sanctions Committee but did
not wait for its approval, which the U.S. and Britain claim to be
required. France, China and Russia, the other three Security
Council permanent members, maintain that the U.N. resolutions do
not cover an air embargo and a notification of flights suffices.
</P>
<P>
Several Iraqi senior officials have said that the U.N. sanctions
will "erode away" in spite of U.S. and British pressures to keep
them.

<HEADLINE> Military Assault vs. Abu Sayyaf Expands to Basilan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
expanded its military operations against Abu Sayyaf extremists
from Sulu province to the nearby Basilan province following
reports that some rebels have fled to the southern province with a
hostage.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN television said Thursday that three battalions from
the Philippine Army's 103rd brigade have positioned themselves in
the town of Sumisip, Basilan, where American captive Jeffrey
Schiling is believed to have been brought by the group of Abu
Sabaya.
</P>
<P>
The television reported that army troopers are scouring four
islands in the town in search for Sabaya's group. The operation is
also aimed at discouraging other Abu Sayyaf members from entering
Basilan.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf holding 17 captives, including American
Schilling, three Malaysians and 13 Filipinos, have been on the run
since the military launched an offensive in Sulu province to
rescue the hostages on September 16.
</P>
<P>
The Official Philippines News Agency reported Thursday that
some 111 Abu Sayyaf members have been killed in the military
offensive. One of those reported killed was Abu Sayyaf leader
Radullan Sahiron who was wound in the leg but died later due to
loss of blood.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted 21 Asian and Western hostages from
Malaysia on April 23, triggering a five-month-long hostage crisis.
As the rebels released some of their hostages reportedly for
ransom money, they continued to abduct new hostages.

<HEADLINE> EU, WHO, U.N. to Jointly Combat Killer Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU), the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS (
UNAIDS) vowed Thursday to jointly fight the diseases of HIV/AIDS,
malaria and tuberculosis in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are suffering from both poverty and the
spreading killer diseases, said President of the European
Commission Romano Prodi at a high-level round-table meeting in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"One of the disease - malaria - we thought we had come near to
eradicating in some parts of the developing world. Another, HIV/
AIDS, has only more recently emerged as a major killer. Associated
with AIDS, tuberculosis is killing more poor people than ever
before," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the EU playing a larger and more effective role
in assisting developing countries to confront these epidemics,"
Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
WHO Director General Gro Harlem Brundtland said the senior
officials met in Brussels at a time of unprecedented international
support for reducing poverty and at a time when health takes its
rightful place at center stage in the development arena.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is important to fight the diseases of HIV/
AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which are major causes of poverty,
aimed at ensuring economic security.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the European Commission, the EU's
executive branch, as a first step in designing a new program for
the EU "to help developing countries to confront the growing
epidemics of the three communicable diseases and break the cycle
of disease and poverty".

<HEADLINE> China Reports Robust Tax Revenue Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed a robust
growth in tax revenue in the ninth five-year-plan period ( 1996-
2000), a top taxation official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The ninth-five-year-plan has been a period characterized by
the strongest tax revenue growth for China," head of the State
Administration of Taxation, Jin Renqing said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that China's tax revenue during the period might
hit 4.67 trillion yuan, which is almost 220 percent over that of
the eighth five-year-plan period(1991-1995), representing an
annual growth rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin, the government's tax revenue has been
increasing at 100 billion yuan per year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the tax revenue hit a record 1 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of tax revenue in China's GDP has been rising
steadily. In 1995, tax revenue made up to 2 percent of the GDP.
The figure is expected to rise to 14 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The central government's share in the tax revenue also surged
from 20 percent in 1993 to the estimated 58 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
A top taxation official attributed the strong growth in tax
revenue to the development of the economy, the crackdown on
smuggling and a strengthened tax collection system, among other
factors.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, ruled out the risk of over taxation.
</P>
<P>
According to his calculation, the annual growth of tax revenue
would be about 8.5 percent during the ninth five-year-plan period,
1 percent higher than the GDP growth.

<HEADLINE> Annette Lu's New Separatist Remarks Slammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua, China's official news
agency, published a signed article today, denouncing the new
separatist remarks made by Annette Lu of Taiwan in her first
overseas visit after taking office.
</P>
<P>
Lu has reiterated her old remarks such as "Taiwan's status is
yet to be set" and "The cross-straits relations are remote
relatives and close neighbors," in an article. She has never given
up her dream of "Taiwan's admission into the United Nations," the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Lu's ugly performances show that her nature as a "Taiwan
independence" element will never change, the article points out,
urging people not to relax their vigilance against her ambition to
split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article reiterates that Taiwan has been an inalienable part
of China and China's sovereignty over Taiwan has been recognized
worldwide, it says.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's attempts to join the United Nations have been defeated
over and over again, the article says, noting that big powers like
the United States, Britain and Russia are all openly supporting
the One-China Principle and opposing Taiwan's position to join the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Without recognizing herself as Chinese, Lu has lost the
qualification to talk about national feelings, the article
stresses. It urges people to be vigilant against the Taiwan
authorities, as Lu has been so daring to openly advocate "Taiwan
independence" in the international arena.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Meets Overseas Chinese From Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen met
here today a delegation made up of overseas Chinese and
foreigners of Chinese origin from Europe, dubbed as "China Tour
for Peaceful Reunification."
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the visitors, the vice-premier reiterated
that "Peaceful Reunification and One Country, Two Systems" remains
the basic principle on the Taiwan Issue for the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"We are exerting every means to achieve the peaceful
reunification, but we'll never commit to giving up the use of
force," he told the delegates. If the commitment is made, a
peaceful reunification will become impossible, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are disputes between the two sides, but ways to solve
them could be found by keeping in touch, Qian said, stressing that
Taiwan will never be allowed to separate from China.
</P>
<P>
According to Qian, by the end of this June, 17.7 million Taiwan
compatriots visited the mainland and the cross-straits trade
topped 174 billion US dollars, while almost 50,000 Taiwan-funded
enterprises have been set up in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The cross-straits exchanges of personnel and trade cannot be
stopped because they are compatible to the fundamental interests
of the people and should be developed with greater effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese origin
for their long-time contribution to the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
This is confirmed through the fact that many organizations
like "the China Council for the Promotion of China's Peaceful
Reunification (CCPCPR)" have been established in many foreign
countries by overseas Chinese, foreigners of Chinese origin, and
people from different circles, in response to the changes in the
island province of Taiwan, according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Qian said it shows that no force can block the reunification of
China which is a great trend and welcomed by the people. "You can
do something by uniting overseas Chinese and foreigners of Chinese
origin who are in favor of the reunification and oppose separatism
and 'Taiwan independence.'"
</P>
<P>
The delegates, who have been here at the invitation of the
CCPCPR, are made up of leaders of over 20 Europe-based groups
similar to the CCPCPR.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting was Chen Yunlin, director of both the
Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in New Zealand Dips Again: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand dipped again last month, according to local National Bank'
s latest business survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, out here Thursday, also found that widespread price
rises are on the way.
</P>
<P>
It also shows a "dazzling display" from exporters with strong
confidence about rising volumes in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows a net 20 percent of firms surveyed expect
business conditions to worsen in the coming year. That is more
pessimistic than the net 14 percent expecting a decline in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
Pessimists accounted for 41 percent of the replies to the
September survey and optimists 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
A net 70 percent of retailers expected to lift prices in the
year ahead, showing a huge jump on the 47 percent recorded last
month in the National Bank survey.
</P>
<P>
Local companies have been hit by rising import prices because
of the low New Zealand dollar and much higher fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows more than half of all exporters surveyed
expected volumes to rise and only a small 6 percent expected a
fall.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture and manufacturing sectors remain the most
optimistic, according to the survey.

<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso dropped
further against the U.S. dollar Thursday amid weaker regional
currencies and higher dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed at 46.270 to one dollar, softer compared to the
previous close of 46.195 pesos.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the peso fell as dampened by weaker regional
currencies and steady strong dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
They said that there are no major dollar inflows into the
market and there is still a lot of dollar demand for month-end and
quarter-end requirements.
</P>
<P>
The news that the government may miss more loans from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to the widening budget
deficit added pressure in the currency market.

Earlier, Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura said the

standby facility with the IMF if it surpasses this year's deficit
ceiling of 62.5 billion pesos (1.36 billion dollars).

DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,448 flood driven
Indians have taken refugee in Bangladesh' southwestern greater
Kushtia district bordering West Bengal of India as the flood
gripped fresh areas of western Bangladesh districts during the
last 24 hours, according to the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
BDR sources in Dhaka said, "we have communicated the influx
issue of the Indian nationals to the Indian side."
</P>
<P>
A Bangladesh Road Transport Authority press release said
Thursday that the flood fed by waters from across the border
forced suspension of road communication and export-import between
Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
Flood Forecasting and Warning Center officials said the floods
continued to inundate fresh areas in the downstream south-western
part of the country, overflowing the banks of the small and dying
rivers which are not capable to contain the onrush of waters from
across the border.

The flood situation in the south-western districts is likely to
aggravate with the onrushing waters coming from adjoining areas of
India, said weather officials.

According to the official statistics, 170,000 families were
affected by the current spell of floods.

HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economy is
projected to shrink by 3.8 percent this year at a time when the
government needs to raise about 800 million U.S. dollars to meet
revenue targets within the next three months, the Business

</P>
<P>
The country's key agriculture, manufacturing, mining and
tourism sectors, are all set to record low growth as the economic
crisis deepens, an economist of the Ministry of Finance Gracious
Nyanguse said at a workshop for parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is projected to grow by about 4 percent,
compared with the previous 8 percent, while the manufacturing
sector will decline by 10 percent, a further decline from 2.5
percent recorded last year, according to Nyanguse.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Economic prospects in the near future will hinge on
putting in place stabilization measures, which will be underpinned
by supportive socio-political positions."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the situation might improve with the introduction of
the Revenue Authority in the first quarter of next year," another
official of the ministry Chido Mhini said.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, inflation has averaged 50 percent, while the
gross domestic product recorded a minus 2 percent and is projected
to decline by up to 7 percent. Moreover, the Zimbabwean dollar has
crushed by 75 percent against the U.S. dollar.

<P>
GENEVA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will be based on the balance between
rights and obligations, a Chinese senior trade official said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept provisions which are detrimental to China's
legitimate rights under WTO," Long Yongtu, China's Chief Trade
Negotiator, said at the 12th session of the Working Party on
China's WTO Accession.
</P>
<P>
"What we care mostly is not the specific timing of accession,
but the terms of accession. The results of the negotiations shall
on the whole ensure China's accession is based on the balance
between rights and obligations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Long's points of view were echoed by Pakistani Ambassador Munir
Akram at the meeting, who told reporters that some member states
were making unreasonable demands which are inconsistent with their
bilateral agreements with China.
</P>
<P>
He urged the multilateral talks on China's entry into WTO to
abide by WTO rules, avoid infringement of China's sovereignty and
observe China's status as a developing country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Working Party Pierre Girard said that the
discussions over the past two weeks marked "another important step
in the process of China's WTO accession".
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the next session, possibly to be held
late October or early November, will achieve substantial
improvement.

ATHENS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The search and rescue efforts
for the victims of the "Express Samina" ferry, which hit a rock
and sank off the Aegean island of Paros Tuesday night, continued
on Thursday as the death toll has reached 66.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong winds and high tides, six Greek naval ships,
four helicopters and other rescue groups were combing the stormy
seas off Paros and its rocky coast for survivors and bodies of
victims.
</P>
<P>
Of the 66 dead, 54 have been identified including an 18-month-
old Greek toddler and a 51-year-old Norwegian woman.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified bodies have been transferred to the capital
city of Athens.
</P>
<P>
A total of 452 survivors have been rescued so far, including 72
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Greek authorities are reportedly unable to accurately
estimate the number of missing persons as the children aboard the
ferry did not buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the number of deaths in the accident will
increase.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Thursday with the ministerial council, Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis ordered an investigation into the
accident.
</P>
<P>
People on the island of Paros Thursday began a two-day mourning
for the victims of the sea disaster.

Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth of Britain and Israeli President
Moshe Katsav extended their condolences and deepest sympathy to

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Gold Dreams Live on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- While Llewellyn Herbert
and Hezekiel Sepeng failed in the gold stakes at the Sydney
Olympics on Wednesday, South Africa's dreams of at least one gold
medal still live on.
</P>
<P>
Herbert, the hot favourite for the men's 400m hurdles title,
had to settle for the bronze medal after his customary final kick
was not enough to overhaul America's Angelo Taylor and unknown
Saudi Arabian Souan Hadi Somayli.
</P>
<P>
Sepeng finished fourth in one of the slowest men's 800m races
of the year to miss out on a medal.
</P>
<P>
However, still hanging in there are Elana Meyer in the women's
10,000m, Hestrie cloete in the women's high jump, Josia Thugwane
in the men's marathon, Okkert Britz in the pole vault and Ruth
Nortje in the canoeing.
</P>
<P>
Meyer did just enough to ensure her place in Saturday night's
final after she finished seventh in her heat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meyer, who clocked a time of 32:35,32, said after the race that
she intended to conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
"It was my plan to run off the pace and just make sure I made
the
final. The final will be very fast and I would not be surprised if
we break an Olympic record," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her silver medal at the Barcelona Olympics eight
years ago, Meyer said it was of little consideration, adding: "
That race is history. I don't even want to think about it."
</P>
<P>
"When I step onto the track on Saturday night all my past
achievements and medals mean nothing. It's only what's in my heart
and my legs that counts," she said.
</P>
<P>
Britz, who has qualified for Friday's pole vault final by
clearing 5.55m, 5.60m and 5.65m all at his first attempt, said he
has fulfilled his goals for the season.
</P>
<P>
"Qualifying for the final was the toughest part. I don't feel
any pressure now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nortje became the first woman on the African continent to
qualify for an induvidual canoeing final as she finished third in
her heat on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nortje gained automatic qualification for Sunday's final with
the third fastest time of all the canoeists.

<HEADLINE> Israel Coalition Hopeful Receives Life Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's secular Shinui
Party leader Yosef Lapid has received threat against his life,
which warned him not to join Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
government.
</P>
<P>
The threat was recorded on Lapid's answering machine, Israel
Radio reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The caller said Lapid would be murdered if he were to join
Barak's government. Lapid has filed a complaint with the police.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Lapid indicated his party was ready to join
the government coalition and said that the party had been promised
two portfolios, one reportedly as head of the Communications
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Shiui's entry into the government was expected to be based on a
promise that Barak can go ahead with his "civil reform," which
includes permitting of public transportation in certain areas on
the Sabbath, civil marriages and the shelving of the Tal committee
recommendations on the delayed conscription of yeshiva students for
army services.
</P>
<P>
Barak has also confirmed that the ruling One Israel bloc has
been negotiating the possibility of four Knesset factions' joining
the coalition, including Shinui, the left-wing Meretz, Roman
Bronfman's Democratic Choice and the One Nation party led by
Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz.
</P>
<P>
Barak has indicated that he would form a narrow coalition
government with 50 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament),
with the support of 10 Knesset members from outside the coalition
in order to survive no-confidence votes expected to be mounted by
the opposition factions as the parliament reconvenes from summer
recess at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government now controls 40 seats in the parliament after
the resignation of coalition partners ahead of the July David Camp
peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister unveiled the social-civil reform agenda in
August, which was seen as a path of escape in the event that the
peace talks failed to yield a peace deal before the opposition
topples his government.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, with drop of charges against former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on alleged bribery, fraud, breach of
trust, the power struggle for the leadership in the opposition
right-wing Likud also escalates.
</P>
<P>
The tour paid by Likud's current leader Ariel Sharon on Thursday
morning to the Temple Mount inside the Old City of Jerusalem, which
is the holiest in Judaism and also home to Islamic shrines, was
seen by the Palestinian officials as Sharon's ploy to show
leadership following the closing of Netanyahu's case and amid fears
that Netanyahu might make a political comeback.
</P>
<P>
With the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks enter a critical stage,
the internal political struggles in Israel are also on the rise. A
peace deal with the Palestinians, which Barak has been striving
for, remains instrumental to the rescue of Barak's political
future.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Claims to be Under Foreign Orders to Hijack Jordanian Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi, who attempted to
hijack a Jordanian airliner flying from Sanaa to Amman on Thursday
morning, claimed that he was under the orders of "foreign enemies"
to take over the plane, Jordanian civil aviation authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Mohammad Yassin Hmeidi, turned himself in
to
Jordanian police when the Royal Jordanian plane touched down in
Amman at 7:55 a.m. (0455 GMT), an hour behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus 310 with 119 passengers aboard was 20 minutes from
Amman when Hmeidi sent a note to the captain via an air hostess,
claiming that he had bombs and had been ordered to hijack the plane
by foreign enemies (of Jordan), civil aviation chief Jihad Rsheidat
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said in the note that he wanted to abandon the hijacking
bid and surrender to the Jordanian authorities, the aviation
official said.
</P>
<P>
Hmeidi's self-claimed bombs were later found to be ordinary
batteries wrapped in newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The alleged "enemies of Jordan" were not identified, but a probe
into Hmeidi's motives was underway.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the incident, which lasted five minutes, and
the passengers of the Airbus were not aware of what had happened.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Youngest Son to be Arrested Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister for
Justice and Human Rights Affairs Yusril Ihza Mehendra confirmed
here Thursday that former president Soeharto's youngest son
Mandala Putra (Tommy) will be jailed soon after being convicted of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra said that within two or three days the government will
send Tommy to the Jakarta-based Cipinang Prison.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said that Tommy would be picked up on
Monday at his residence "as it is impossible for Tommy to
surrender himself," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahendra further said that he has talked with chief
of the Cipinang Prison about "anything needed" in connection with
the imprisonment of Tommy.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year old man was charged in a multi-million-dollars
property deal with the state's logistic agency (Bulog) in 1997.
Prosecutors said that the deal had enriched him, but cost the
government 10.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tommy was sentenced earlier for 18 months in jail and ordered
by the Supreme Court to pay the equivalent 3.5 million U.S.
dollars in fine.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court also said that Tommy's business partner,
Ricardo Gelael, will also be jailed for the same case.

<HEADLINE> Competition Code Takes Effect for Singapore's Telecom Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Code of Practice for
competition in telecom sector, released by the Infocomm
Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) recently, will come into
force with effect from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The code, which sets clear boundaries for competitive behavior
in the marketplace, provides a regulatory framework to facilitate
the rapid entry of new competition in Singapore and a strong
incentive for companies to invest in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Although the code relies primarily on commercial negotiation
and industry self-regulation, it defined minimum requirements to
protect end-users and prevent anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
However, for market segments that are not yet competitive and
where the competitive forces are still absent, the IDA will play
an active role to ensure that the players will not abuse their
dominance.
</P>
<P>
As these market segments become fully competitive, IDA said it
will allow free competition to determine the shape of the market.
</P>
<P>
Singapore fully liberalized its telecommunications sector on
April 1, 2000, expediting by two years an earlier plan, which had
set the freeing-up date on April 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Local Court Drops Soeharto's Corruption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The South Jakarta District
Court here on Thursday dropped corruption charges against
Indonesian former president as the defendant was declared unfit to
stand trial due to his bad health condition.
</P>
<P>
The abolition was made after panel judge chaired by Lalu
Mariyun in the third hearing during which the defendant was absent,
receiving medical report from a newly-established joint medical
team on the health condition of Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Mariyun also asked prosecuting attorney Muchtar Arifin to free
the 79-year-old man from his city arrest status, and "scratch his
corruption cases from the list."
</P>
<P>
"The dossiers of Soeharto on corruption will also be returned
back to the prosecuting attorney," Mariyun added.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the medical team report the former
president was unfit as well as incompetence to stand trial for
good.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's third hearing was opened on Thursday morning at 10:
00 a.m. (local time) and lasted for about four hours with an hour
of suspension.
</P>
<P>
Just like before, many people waited for the attendance of the
former ruler who was forced to step down from his office in 1998,
but they had "to drink bitter pills" as the man they waited for
failed for the third time to appear before trial.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the joint medical team professor M. Zakaria from
the Jakarta-based University of Indonesia, said that after
examining Soeharto, the team concluded that he is not okay both
physically and mentally to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Zakaria added that the medical team which consists of 25
doctors and health experts from various background have examined
Soeharto comprehensively in the Pertamina Hospital last Saturday
for about 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally, Soeharto is suffering a heavy depression as well
as mental disturbance, permanently. He can not understand ideas,
he also has a big problem if he wants to say something," the
medical report read out by Zakaria said.
</P>
<P>
"What he says is different with what he wants to say. So,
mentally, he is unfit and incompetence to stand trial," Zakaria
added, citing that physically Soeharto has also a big trouble as
his cardiovascular system has damaged. "His blood pressure tended
to rise when he was thinking something seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, following the abolition of Soeharto's case, hundreds
of students, who claimed themselves as "anti-Soeharto group,"
staged protest outside the court building.
</P>
<P>
They were involved in clashes with pro-Soeharto's supporters
who also staged protest in the same place. Dozens were reportedly
injured during the clashes including four security personnel and
three local journalists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Xinhua after the trial process, Spokesman of the
Attorney General Office Yushar Yahya said that the AGO will think
about the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said, "that is
an objective decision as it is based on the principle of law under
which the sick can not be tried."
</P>
<P>
But the abolition of Soeharto's corruption case has triggered
more fears over possible riots in the country as many are believed
to have been disappointed by the decision.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Kills 200 Rebels in Three Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense
Forces (UPDF) has killed some 200 rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) and captured a lot of arms and ammunition during the
past three months, Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF had successfully dislodged and dispersed the ADF
rebels from the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda, killing 192
and capturing 24 others during Operation Mountain Sweep, Katirima
told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
He said the army had rescued 284 civilians from the rebels
between November 5, 1999 and June 25, 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the operations in Hoima, Kibaale and Mubende districts
in western Uganda, the UPDF also captured a lot of arms and
ammunition including 36 AK-47 rifles, two rocket-propelled
grenades (RPGs), five RPG shells and nine RPG fuses.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels based in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo are engaged in active anti-government
activities in western Uganda.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Against Suspension of Lusaka Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Attempts to suspend the
Lusaka Peace Agreement on the prevailing civil war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will lead to resume
fighting and impair the operations of the U.N. peacekeeping force,
the European Union has warned.
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper Thursday quoted a statement
issued by the French Embassy, which is holding the rotating EU
presidency, as saying that an initiative to suspend the agreement
will result in a general resumption of hostilities and
consequently jeopardize the United Nations peacekeeping operation
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The EU said that in order to preserve the peace process begun
in Lusaka and to render the agreement operational once again, it
appeals to the government of the DRC and other signatories to the
Lusaka agreement to restore a minimum of mutual confidence by
respecting the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the signatories of the agreement to
implement the withdrawal program provided by the Kampala agreement
and the tripartite agreement reached at Kisangani, the second
largest city in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it believed the Lusaka Peace Agreement remained the
basis for resolution of the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The EU urged the warring parties in the DRC to facilitate the
peace agreement and the work of the humanitarian personnel in the
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
Peace process in the DRC began unraveling soon after the Lusaka
agreement was signed last year. However, there have been repeated
violations of the ceasefire which have increased recently with
intense fighting in Equateur Province and North and South Kivu
provinces between the government and rebel forces backed by Rwanda
and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Receive Loans for Road Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is likely to receive up
to 6.8 billion shillings (about 87 million U.S. dollars) in fresh
loans for road repair and reconstruction, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The money, to be provided by the European Union and other
western donors including the World Bank, is expected to be made
available as soon as certain conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
These conditions include the involvement of the private sector
in the road projects and the use of predominantly local labor
rather than machines to do the work, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to a special supplement on Kenya in the magazine The
Courier, the Kenyan government is also being urged to continue
getting tough on overloaded lorries with regular checks for axle
loads, and to ensure that road repair and maintenance tenders are
above-board.
</P>
<P>
Donors also want guarantees from the government that the money
given towards road repair will be spent on what it is intended for.

<HEADLINE> OAU Envoy, African Leaders Meet Over Conflict in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of
Secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim
Ahmed Salim is currently on a mission to four West African
countries to promote peace process in Sierra Leone, an OAU press
release said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy Kingsley Mamabolo, who left here Wednesday,
has completed his visit to Nigeria, the first leg of his four-
nation mission which is also expected to take him to Liberia,
Guinea and Mali.
</P>
<P>
The four countries are considered to be playing a crucial role
in the efforts to bring peace to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nigeria, Mamabolo exchanged views with
Nigerian Vice-president Alhaji Atiku Abubakar on the situation in
Sierra Leone and on the specific role of the OAU in charting the
way forward.
</P>
<P>
The vice president underlined the areas in which the OAU can
contribute significantly to the advancement of the peace process
in Sierra Leone, the release said.
</P>
<P>
While in Nigeria, Mamabolo also held consultations with, among
others, National Security Advisor General Aliyu Mohammed, and
Acting Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Odedina.

consolidating peace, reconciliation and stability in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Is to Build Indiana Pacers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Coach Isiah Thomas of the
Indiana Pacers wanted to build the team.
</P>
<P>
Since Thomas became coach of the Indiana Pacers in July, the
team that came within two games of the NBA championship has lost
four veteran players, three of them starters.
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson signed with Toronto as a free agent, Dale Davis
went to Portland in a trade, little-used Chris Mullin was given
his release, and on Wednesday, after years of playing through foot
pain, Rik Smits retired.
</P>
<P>
Only Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose, the team's top scorers, will
return to Indiana's starting lineup next season.
</P>
<P>
Thomas said: "What we have to do is try to develop an identity
for our young players and scrape out some wins and see where we
end up.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is still to win an NBA championship. Let's not
confuse what happened last year with winning the championship. We
didn't win it. Our quest is to build a team that's good enough to
finish the job."
</P>
<P>
The Pacers won the Eastern Conference and reached the NBA
Finals for the first time, losing in six games to the Los Angeles
Lakers. Smits, who first considered retirement last year, took
some time off to decide whether to come back for a 13th season,
and his decision will have a big effect on the team, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
Smits averaged 14.8 points and 6.1 rebounds per game for his
career. At 2.23 meters, he often demanded double-teams, and he
would just kick the ball back outside to an open teammate.
</P>
<P>
Smits, 34, had surgery to repair nerve damage in both feet in
1996. He missed 30 games during the 1996-97 season and nine games
in the 1997-98 season because of problems with his size-21 feet.
In recent years, Smits would wrap his feet with ice after games
and get foot massages from the trainer. He also was allowed to
skip occasional practices.

<HEADLINE> Fu Mingxia Twists and Turns to Join Diving Legends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Fu Mingxia snatched
her fourth Olympic gold medal on Thursday, joining Americans Pat
McCormick and Greg Louganis as the only divers to win four gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who trailed teammate Guo Jingjing by 5.88 points, overtook
her synchronized partner by 1.68 points and scored 77.43 points on
her last dive -- reverse 1-1/2 somersaults and 2-1/2 twists.
</P>
<P>
The score of 609.42 points and an edge of 11.61 over Guo won Fu
a back-to-back springboard gold. Her winning total was 35.07
points over Germany's Doerte Lindner, who got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure if I would get the gold, I feel fortunate to get
another chance," said the queen of the split-second arts.
</P>
<P>
"My training time was short, I had injuries so I had a lot to
overcome. I'm very happy to win a gold at my third Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Fu became a world champion at age 12, first took Olympic gold
at age 13, and then retired at age 19 after winning another two
golds at the 1996 Games. When she appeared in Sydney, Fu was
older, wiser and, her coaches said, a better diver than ever.
</P>
<P>
The girl who captured hearts at the 1992 Olympics with her
nearly perfect dives from the perilous heights of the 10m platform
is now a woman with an easy laugh. At 23, she's also the grand ol'
dame of a team where the other three women are still in their
teens.
</P>
<P>
After she became the first woman in 36 years to win the

became a student, studying economic management and learning
English at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University, and gaining
so much weight "I didn't want to put on a swimming costume," she
said last year.

"It's practically unheard of, especially for a female athlete,
to stop for two years and get back to such a high level," Zhou

"Mentally, and in other areas, she has improved, she's even-

SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Dagny Mellgren netted in a
golden goal in extra time to award Norway a 3-2 victory over the
United States in the final of the Olympic women's soccer
tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans opened the account first in the fifth minute
through Tiffeny Milbrett before Gro Espeseth hit in an equaliser
one minute before halftime for Norway.
</P>
<P>
With 12 minutes remaining, Ragnhild Gulbrandsen put Norway
ahead by beating American goal keeper Siri Mullinix with a header.
</P>
<P>
When Norway was going to celebrate their victory, Milbrett
headed in her second of the game from deep into injury time to
make it 2-2 and force extra time.
</P>
<P>
With another 12 minutes into the extra time, Mellgren, a second-
half substitute, beat Mullinix for Norway's first gold medal of
the Sydney Games.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A gallant and courageous
Norway beat the defending Olympic champion the United States 3-2
in extra time to win the Sydney Olympic Games women's soccer gold
medal at the Sydney Stadium on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans set the pace and opened the scoring in the 5th
minute from Tiffeny Milbrett following good work by her striking
partner Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
For the remainder of the half, the Americans dominated with
Norway pinned back in its own half, defending desperately against
some highly technical play from the U.S. women.
</P>
<P>
Then, against all the odds, Norway equalised in the 44th minute
when Gro Espeseth outjumped the American keeper Siri Mullinix to
head home.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Norway rolled up their shirt sleeves and
came out fighting. In the 78th minute, Ragnhild Gulbrandsen put
Norway ahead with another header and the result seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
But the United States refused to die and Milbrett snatched the
equaliser in injury time in the 92nd minute, again following good
lead up work by Hamm.
</P>
<P>
With the Sydney Football Stadium no place for faint hearts,
Norway caused the upset of the tournament when it snatched the
winner through substitute Dagny Mellgren in the 102th minute.
</P>
<P>
"It's great, I'm glad to be a match winner," said Gulbrandsen,
"It's so much like a dream, I didn't think it would end up like
this."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Germany collected the bronze medal by beating Brazil 2-
0 with strikes by Renate Lingor and Birgit Prinz.

<HEADLINE> China's Mining Industry in Good Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- After four years of
rectification and improvement nationwide, the mining industry in
China has been brought back in good order, said a leading official
from the Ministry of Land and Resources here today.
</P>
<P>
Checks have been put in place to minimize illegal mining and
the waste of mineral resources to protect and develop China's
mineral resources, Jiang Chengsong, vice minister of land and
resources said at a news briefing held by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, a total of 735 disputes on mineral
prospecting and over 12,000 quarrels on mining were settled, some
1,800 persons were punished and 253,000 tons of illegal mineral
products were confiscated, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
 Waste of resources and environmental pollution were once
again pressing issues in China's mining industry. The State
Council issued a circular at the end of 1995, requiring
strengthened control in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Jiang explained that the controls are aimed at pushing forward
sustainable development of the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's mineral enterprises are small and China
encourages the merger of the small mines. By the end of June, more
than 3,000 small-sized mines had been merged.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China regulates the mining industry through
granting mining licenses. Dangerous small mines causing serious
pollution were forced to shut down. To date, about 99.6 percent of
state-owned and 98 percent of private mineral enterprises have
mining licenses.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, over 53,300 small mines were closed,
and the number of China's mining enterprises fell to 172,183.

making a lot of efforts to creating a trustworthy environment and
provide a secure infrastructure for the conduct of electronic

</P>
<P>
The government's efforts in this regard include the

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Visit to Temple Mount Causes Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Israeli
policemen and 10 Palestinians were wounded Thursday morning as
clashes erupted in a disputed holy site in East Jerusalem due to
the visit there by a right-wing opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Ben-Ruby, spokesman for Jerusalem District of Israel
Police, told reporters that the Israeli policemen were injured by
stones hurled from Palestinian demonstrators, but he claimed only
two Palestinians were hurt in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
One of his aides also rejected claims that the police used tear
gas and fired rubber-coated metal bullets at the protesters against
the visit of Likud leader Ariel Sharon and his parliamentary
colleagues to the Temple Mount, holy to both Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
However, the Voice of Palestine radio reported that at least 10
Palestinian demonstrators, including a 60-year-old man, were
wounded by batons, tear gas and rubber bullets fired by the police.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arab lawmakers Abdul-Malik Dehamshe and Ahmed Tibi, and
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of the
Jerusalem affairs, were injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount, located in the walled Old City of East
Jerusalem, is the site of the former Jewish Temple, the most sacred
shrine of Judaism. The site is known to Muslims al-Haram al-Sharif,
or Noble Sanctuary, which houses Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest
shrine in Islam.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty over the holy site is the toughest issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. For now, the Wakf, a Muslim
religious trust, has autonomy in administering the site, although
Israeli police remains in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 Israeli policemen, armed with riot shields and some
in full battle gear, were deployed around the site to protect
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians shouted "God is Greatest" and "
Murderer, get Out" at Sharon and his team during the heavily
guarded one-hour tour, as some even tried to break through the
police's cordon to reach lawmakers. Clashes erupted between the
protesters and policemen at the end of Sharon's visit.
</P>
<P>
David Baker, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's foreign media
coordinator, refused to comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told Palestinian Radio that
he regarded the visit as "a very serious matter" because of
Sharon's role in the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees near Beirut. Sharon was the mastermind of Israeli army's
invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount as a grave
and provocative infringement of the Muslim holy site, and he called
on all Muslim countries to denounce Sharon's conduct and defend the
holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders said Wednesday as Sharon planned the visit
that the hawkish opposition leader wanted to show Israeli
sovereignty claim over the contested holy site by the tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Environment Minister Dalia Itzik also told
Israel Radio that in her opinion, Sharon made this visit without
good intentions, and only wanted to ignite hatred and violence
between the two ethnic sides.
</P>
<P>
She stated that Sharon now began making trouble at the most
sensitive site in Jerusalem, in order to harm the ongoing peace
process with the Palestinians. She further called on Barak to
reject the possibility that he will form a national unity
government with Sharon's Likud.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon argued that his only aim was to show grass-root
Israelis that the Jewish state should not give up sovereignty over
the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his intentions were not to provoke a conflict
as was alleged by the Palestinians, and a Jew wishing to visit an
area in Jerusalem may do so without having to explain his
intentions.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the holy city as its "eternal and undivided"
capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied by force in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told reporters following the visit that he too wants
peace, but does not agree to the path being taken by Barak and his
government.
</P>
<P>
He accused the prime minister of lacking the political
experience to navigate the negotiations involving the Palestinians
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We came with a message of peace," Sharon said. "I was more
affected than anything by the hatred, and that creates hard
feelings in the future about what will happen if Barak manages to
divide Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders had warned that Sharon's visit could lead to
a recurrence of the bloody clashes in 1990 and 1996 between the
Israelis and the Palestinians at this site.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Dies of Injuries After Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier, who
sustained grave head injuries in a roadside bomb attack in the
Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip overnight, died Thursday at Soroka
Hospital in southern Israel, hospital staff announced.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was seriously injured in the head by the blast late
Wednesday night when he and his teammates were escorting a Jewish
settlers' car convoy to the Netzarim Jewish settlement in Gaza. Two
roadside explosive devices were detonated and following the blasts,
terrorists fired on the convoy.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether the soldier was wounded by gunfire
or by the bomb. But the hospital listed the condition of another
soldier who was also lightly wounded in the leg as moderate.
</P>
<P>
All settlers on the cars, including women and children, were
safe.
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if those who detonated the bombs managed to
escape to the Gaza Strip. Israeli security forces suspected that
either Palestinian militant Hamas or Palestinian security forces
were involved in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had condemned the attack and
urged the Palestinians to arrest and punish those responsible for
the "severe" terrorist attack and those who had sent or instigated
terrorists on the mission, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
"The event was very serious," the radio quoted Barak as
saying. "We will know how to find the assailants, wherever they
are."
</P>
<P>
The area around the Netzarim settlement has recently become a
hotbed of clashes between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, a Palestinian car collided with an Israeli vehicle
near Netzarim, in which four Palestinians were wounded. The
Palestinians claimed that the Israelis intentionally produced the
accident, which was denied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Molotov cocktails and stones were hurled at Israeli
army's vehicles in protest.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's bomb attacks reportedly were the fourth blast
which took place around Netzarim in the past year, according to
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo Accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, traffic to and from Netzarim, which is still under
Israeli control, should be in convoys and all civilian cars are
escorted by military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claimed that the Netzarim area and other Jewish
settlements in Gaza should be handed over to them after a final
peace deal with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash With Israeli Soldiers, No Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian demonstrators clashed
with Israeli soldiers Thursday near the West Bank city of Ramallah,
but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinians hurled stones at Israeli soldiers, who
responded with firing tear gas and rubber-coated metal bullets to
break up the protesters, reports reaching here from Ramallah said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came hours after Israeli hawkish opposition
leader Aerial Sharon visited the disputed holy site, the Temple
Mount, in the walled Old City of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount to Jews, or al-Haram al-Sharif to Muslims,
houses holy sites to the two ethnics. Sovereignty over the site is
the toughest issue in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's visit Thursday morning has led to violent clashes
between the Palestinian protesters and Israeli police, in which 25
Israeli policemen and 10 Palestinians were injured.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has labelled Sharon's visit to the holy
site as "a provocation" and regarded as a step to claim sovereignty
over the shrine.

<HEADLINE> 10 Killed in Clash in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed as
Philippine government troops clashed with a group of Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas in the southern Philippines
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the ABS-CBN Television, the casualties
include six MILF guerrillas, a government soldier and three
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted military sources as saying that government
forces were patrolling between boundary of Carmen and Aleoan towns
in North Cotabato province when they encountered a group of MILF
rebels, who retreated after a brief gunbattle with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Military sources also said that an Army trooper, three
militiamen and an undetermined number of MILF rebels were killed
in a two-hour gunbattle in Carmen, North Cotabato on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu confirmed Thursday the
declaration of jihad by MILF chairman Hashim Salamat in July after
government troops overran most of the rebel group's camps in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"The military has overrun our camps, but the MILF cause lives
on. The whole of Mindanao is our new camp," said Kabalu in an
interview during MILF's clandestine general assembly in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Kabalu said the assembly also affirmed the MILF's central
committee's recent decision to indefinitely suspend peace
negotiation with the government.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF is the Philippines' largest rebel group
which has been fighting for more than two decades for an
independent Muslim state in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urges EU to Lift Ban on Fish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Rural
Development Maalim Mohammed has appealed to the European Union (EU)
to lift the ban on Kenya fish export since the country has met all
the EU requirements, the East African Standard reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said the sanitary and hygienic standards have been
improved in the fish-landing beaches and the processing facilities
updated to the required standards.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during a meeting with Peter Raburu,
commissioner of Nyanza Province, at Kisumu city in southwestern
Kenya on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a ban on Kenya's fish exports three years ago,
citing unhygienic handling of fish at the beaches and lack of a
centralized authority to certify quality, which has led to a 66
percent drop in Nile perch exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Kenya had established a competent
authority to deal with fish quality and streamlined the
documentation.
</P>
<P>
He described as mere politics claims that Kenya has not met EU
conditions to facilitate the lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Kenya loses some 4 billion shillings (about
520 million U.S. dollars) every year due to the EU ban.

Fu, who made her Olympic debut with a platform gold at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics and swept the two women's events four years
later at the Atlanta Games, joined Greg Louganis of the United
States as one of the greatest divers in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who came out of retirement for the 2000 Sydney Olympics,
proved she still the diver to beat in the springboard. She
totalled 609.42 points from the semifinal and final, beating
teammate Guo Jingjing to the second place at 597.81. Doerte
Lindner of Germany took the bronze medal at 574.35.
</P>
<P>
Fu entered the final six points behind Guo Jingjing and
collected 70.20 and 64.17 points, all behind the points Guo
Jingjing garnered from her dives.
</P>
<P>
But Fu Mingxia was not at all worried about the deficit and
appeared very relaxed. She got 74.70 points from her third dive,
a backward 2 1/2 somersaults with a degree of difficulty of 3.0.
</P>
<P>
Pressured by Fu, Guo Jingjing could not hold her nerve. She
had only 72.54 and 67.50 points from her last two dives while Fu
Mingxia had 80.10 and 77.43, the two highest scores in the final.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia said she didn't feel any pressure in the contest:"
Not a bit. I just feel fortunate to get another chance and I was
not sure if I would get the gold."
</P>
<P>
"My training time was short, I had injuries so I had a lot to
overcome. I'm very happy to win a gold medal at my third Olympics.
" said Fu.
</P>
<P>
Ioulia Pakhalina of Russia, who finished fourth, said she was
very disappointed:"I don't know what happened. I'll try to do my
best for the next session. I'm very happy for the Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Pakhalina said right now it was impossible for her to beat her
Chinese opponents:"Now they are best everywhere, maybe next time."

<HEADLINE> World's Major City Leaders Gather in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The mayors of famous cities
around the world gather in the Chinese capital to discuss the
development of cities against the backdrop of economic
globalization in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"The future of humanity lies in cities," Kofi A. Annan,
secretary-general of the United Nations, said in a message to the
Beijing 2000 World Major Cities Summit which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that cities are engines of growth and crossroads of
ideas. They can also be models of democracy and multicultural
coexistence, but the very same cities can also be places of
exploitation, disease, violent crime, unemployment,
underemployment and extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the last gathering this century for mayors from
developing and developed countries, and it is the first time for
Beijing to sponsor such a conference.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji attended the opening ceremony and
gave a speech. He said that "big cities as national or regional
centers are playing an unreplaceable role in a country's
prosperity and world development."
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that it is significant that so many mayors gathered
in Beijing to discuss cooperation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, there are 400 million city dwellers in China
enjoying modern civilization, and the development of Chinese
cities will enter a new stage in the 21st century when China's
modernization drive accelerates.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "21st Century: Cities'
Development and Cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Mayors will discuss the building of more livable cities, the
impact of globalization and information technology on cities,
cooperation between cities with different cultural and social
systems and the future of cities famous for their historical
associations.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization is now a general trend worldwide. In 1900 only 160
million people, or 10 percent of the world's population, lived in
cities. Currently, half the world's population are city dwellers.
Within 25 years, two-thirds of the population will live in cities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that urbanization will develop at the fastest rates
in developing countries. Cities are home to 1.5 billion poverty-
stricken people worldwide and various urban diseases are
threatening social cohesion and stability.
</P>
<P>
Mayors or deputy mayors from 33 cities attended today's opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The summit was first held in Tokyo in 1985 and has so far been
staged five times.

<HEADLINE> Casino Magnate in Macao Ready to Face Opening of Gaming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to the press on a public occasion, Stanley Ho, general
manager of the Macao Tourism and Amusement Company (STDM), said he
"is ready to cooperate with the government."
</P>
<P>
The aged casino tycoon noted that he likes meeting challenges
and is confident in vying for new casino license under the
circumstances of fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Income from the gaming industry takes up about one half of
government revenue. According to the budget this year, the
government plans to collect 5.2 billion patacas (650 million U.S.
dollars) from gaming taxation.
</P>
<P>
STDM has been running franchise casino business in Macao for
decades. Its franchise contract with the government expires at the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the monopoly used to cause severe public security
problems and losses of taxation. With the founding of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), there has been strong appeal
that casino business should be opened up.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August this year, the SAR government invited a
trans-national consulting company to act as an advisor in working
out future strategies on the gaming industry.

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Visit to Temple Mount Causes Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Israeli
policemen and 10 Palestinians were wounded Thursday morning as
clashes erupted in a disputed holy site in East Jerusalem due to
the visit there by a right-wing opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Ben-Ruby, spokesman for Jerusalem District of Israel
Police, told reporters that the Israeli policemen were injured by
stones hurled from Palestinian demonstrators, but he claimed only
two Palestinians were hurt in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
One of his aides also rejected claims that the police used tear
gas and fired rubber-coated metal bullets at the protesters against
the visit of Likud leader Ariel Sharon and his parliamentary
colleagues to the Temple Mount, holy to both Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
However, the Voice of Palestine radio reported that at least 10
Palestinian demonstrators, including a 60-year-old man, were
wounded by batons, tear gas and rubber bullets fired by the police.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Arab lawmakers Abdul-Malik Dehamshe and Ahmed Tibi, and
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of the
Jerusalem affairs, were injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount, located in the walled Old City of East
Jerusalem, is the site of the former Jewish Temple, the most sacred
shrine of Judaism. The site is known to Muslims al-Haram al-Sharif,
or Noble Sanctuary, which houses Al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest
shrine in Islam.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty over the holy site is the toughest issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. For now, the Wakf, a Muslim
religious trust, has autonomy in administering the site, although
Israeli police remains in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 Israeli policemen, armed with riot shields and some
in full battle gear, were deployed around the site to protect
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians shouted "God is Greatest" and "
Murderer, get Out" at Sharon and his team during the heavily
guarded one-hour tour, as some even tried to break through the
police's cordon to reach lawmakers. Clashes erupted between the
protesters and policemen at the end of Sharon's visit.
</P>
<P>
David Baker, Barak's foreign media coordinator, refused to
comment on the incident.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat told Palestinian Radio that he regarded the visit
as "a very serious matter" because of Sharon's role in the 1982
massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees near Beirut. Sharon
was the mastermind of Israeli army's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount as a grave
and provocative infringement of the Muslim holy site, and he called
on all Muslim countries to denounce Sharon's conduct and defend the
holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders said Wednesday as Sharon planned the visit
that the hawkish opposition leader wanted to show Israeli
sovereignty claim over the contested holy site by the tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Environment Minister Dalia Itzik also told
Israel Radio that in her opinion, Sharon made this visit without
good intentions, and only wanted to ignite hatred and violence
between the two ethnic sides.
</P>
<P>
She stated that Sharon now began making trouble at the most
sensitive site in Jerusalem, in order to harm the ongoing peace
process with the Palestinians. She further called on Barak to
reject the possibility that he will form a national unity
government with Sharon's Likud.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon argued that his only aim was to show grass-root
Israelis that the Jewish state should not give up sovereignty over
the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his intentions were not to provoke a conflict
as was alleged by the Palestinians, and a Jew wishing to visit an
area in Jerusalem may do so without having to explain his
intentions.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the holy city as its "eternal and undivided"
capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied by force in the 1967 Mideast war, as the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
Sharon told reporters following the visit that he too wants
peace, but does not agree to the path being taken by Barak and his
government.
</P>
<P>
He accused the prime minister of lacking the political
experience to navigate the negotiations involving the Palestinians
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We came with a message of peace," Sharon said. "I was more
affected than anything by the hatred, and that creates hard
feelings in the future about what will happen if Barak manages to
divide Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders had warned that Sharon's visit could lead to
a recurrence of the bloody clashes in 1990 and 1996 between the
Israelis and the Palestinians at this site.

<P>
ANKARA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Ambassador to the U.S. Baki Ilkin on Wednesday sent a
letter to the U.S. House International Relations Committee members,
who will vote Thursday a bill recognizing accusations that Ottoman
Turks conducted "genocide" of Armenians in 1915, calling on them to
reject the bill.
</P>
<P>
Ilkin warned that the passage of the bill will jeopardize the
strategic partnership between Turkey and the U.S. as well as a
possible rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish State Minister Edip Safter Gaydali Wednesday arrived
in Moscow for a visit to Russia in a bid to seek opportunities for
cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
Gaydali will hold talks on Friday with Russian Atomic Energy
Deputy Minister Bulat Adamov to discuss two deals to be signed on
the "Usage of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes" and "Early
Warning of Nuclear Accidents."
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer said on Wednesday that
the security cooperation between Turkey and Syria will pave the way
for the improvement of bilateral economic, cultural and commercial
relations.
</P>
<P>
Sezer made the remarks while meeting with visiting Syrian
Interior Minister Mohammad Harba.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Harba said that Syria is determined to continue to
cooperate with Turkey in fighting against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Wednesday that
the security issue had been settled to the largest extent in
Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia, where the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK) has been engaged in an armed struggle since
1984 for self-rule.
</P>
<P>
But he accused the anti-Ankara Kurdish rebels of committing
separatist activities abroad. "Those who say that they want peace,
are still armed abroad. Those who want peace should first of all
lay down their weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that the government was exerting efforts to rapidly
solve the problems from which workers and farmers in the war-torn
region have suffered.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Defense Industry Urged to Increase Product Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian defense
industry has been asked to increase its product base and embark on
quality-driven growth through skills upgrading, capital deepening
and research and development to uplift its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Making the call, Defense Minister Najib Tun Abd Razak said
Thursday the survival and modernization of the defence
capabilities of any armed forces depended largely on a strong and
developed local defence industry to provide technology injection
and continuous logistics support.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of globalization, it has become imperative for
Malaysia to adopt a global strategy in upgrading its defence
industry and this can only be done through genuine defence
partnership which will help the country chart a proper strategy to
achieve its own niche market, the minister said at the Malaysia-
French seminar on Defence Research and Technology in Bangi near
here.
</P>
<P>
About 40 representatives from the French defence industry are
here for the seminar.

"The rapid industrialization process that Malaysia has chosen
to adopt cannot exclude the development of our own defence
industry and for this to materialize, industry players should make
a very serious effort," Najib said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as a new player in the defence industry, has been
able to make headway in certain niche areas of technology like
weapons and munitions, and is also making inroads into other areas
such as communications, weapons systems control and detection, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Loan 600,000 Tons of Food to Pyongyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will loan 600,000
tons of food to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
before the end of this year to help ease its food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The food consists of 300,000 tons of Thai rice and 200,000 tons
of Chinese corn in the form of loan which the DPRK is to repay on
the basis of 1 percent interest rate for 30 years with a 10-year
grace period, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea will also offer 100,000 tons of corn
through the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
The total amount for the 600,000 tons of food is estimated at
110 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
All of the proposed food aid will be able to reach the DPRK
before the end of this year, with 20,000 tons of Chinese corn
arriving at the DPRK's Nampo Port around October 5.
</P>
<P>
At the inter-Korean working-level economic meeting held in
Seoul Monday, the two sides also reached an agreement that the
DPRK will allow on-the-spot inspections of the distribution of the
food by representatives of South Korea and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's decision of the food loan came after the DPRK
made an emergency request during the second round of ministerial
talks.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Export-Import Bank and the DPRK Foreign Trade
Bank will sign a contract on the food loan at the end of this
month.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- As she has shown before,
Marion Jones of the United States is in league of her own. With
her bitzing win in the 200m, she now has two of the five gold
medals she seeks.
</P>
<P>
After a good start, she built up a 2m lead around the bend.
The closest chaser was five-time Olympian Pauline Davis-Thompson
of Bahamas, but Jones ran hard all the way down the straight and
doubled her lead.
</P>
<P>
She went to finish in 21.84, her fastest time of the year. All
seven athletes chasing her home also ran season's bests.
</P>
<P>
Davis-Thompson was second in 22.27, knocking 0.11 off her
personal best. 1997 world silver medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe
of Sri Lanka was a breath away in third at 22.28.
</P>
<P>
The medal is Sri Lanka's second in the Olympic track and field,
after Duncan White won the silver in the 400m hurdles at the 1948
Games.
</P>
<P>
Women's 400m Olympic champion Cathy Freeman of Australia
finished seventh.

<HEADLINE> Day for China in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese "Dream Team" were
poetry in motion on Thursday, twisting and turning with near
perfection to sweep three Olympic diving titles, while pre-race
underdog Liu Hongyu ended China's gold drought in athletics with a
dramatic race walk victory.
</P>
<P>
China raised its gold tally to 26, 10 more than its best haul
in previous four Games, keeping second in the medal table to the
United States for seven straight days.
</P>
<P>
China has virtually secured an enviable standing in the "
Olympic Top Three", which used to be the United States, former
Soviet Union or Russia, and Germany in non-boycotted Games.
</P>
<P>
Chinese divers swept three springboard titles with disciplined
performances which left their rivals far behind and gaping.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia won her fourth Olympic gold in the 3m springboard
with 609.42 points, beating her synchronized partner Guo Jingjing
by 11.61 points and bronze medalist Doerte Lindner of Germany by
35.07 points.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, Li Na and Sang Xue scored 345.12 in the
women's synchronized diving, well in front of the 312.03 by
Canadians Emilie Heymans and Anne Montminy.
</P>
<P>
An hour later Xiao Hailiang and Xiong Ni took the men's
synchronized springboard ahead of Russia's Alexander Dobroskok and
Dimitry Sautin.
</P>
<P>
It was Xiong Ni's second gold in Sydney and his third overall,
coming two days after he retained his 3 meter springboard title.
</P>
<P>
Xiong is the first diver since Klaus Dibiasi to win diving
medals at four Olympics and has now matched the Italian in bagging
a total of five Olympic diving medals. Dibiasi won three golds and
two silvers between 1964 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who retired after winning the 3 meters springboard title
at the 1996 Games, came back in 1998 but said this would be his
last Olympics and he expected to retire for good after next year's
Chinese National Games.
</P>
<P>
"I felt great pressure after I came out of retirement," Xiong,
27, said. "My physical condition had deteriorated. My body weight
had increased by half a dozen kilos, so I really spent a lot of
time training hard to get back into shape."
</P>
<P>
"I have competed in four Olympics, I have come a long and
difficult way. What I gained most is that I kept my calm."
</P>
<P>
China's first athletics gold of the Games came from Wang Liping,
who took the women's 20km walk gold after the three walkers in
front of her were expelled in the closing stages.
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud for my country," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jane Saville headed into the Olympic stadium tunnel
with a huge lead, awaiting the roar of an excited home crowd.
Instead, she left the tunnel in tears.
</P>
<P>
Saville already had been given two white warning cards, and
knew a third "lifting" infraction -- not maintaining contact with
the ground -- would invite a red card and automatic
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
The woman walking with her in the final stages of the race,
Elisabetta Perrone of Italy, already had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
As she headed into the tunnel, a judge suddenly fished out a
red card. Saville threw her arms in the air and looked up in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
"No, No, not me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Yes. You," said the judge.
</P>
<P>
Wang got more than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
Trailing Saville by an unbeatable 50 meters, Wang, who had
received one warning for infraction, kept a steady stride in an
aim for a silver.
</P>
<P>
"I raced for a silver but finished with a gold. What a surprise!
" said Wang.

SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Konstantinos Kenteris of
Greece stunned all the competitors and audience to take the men's
200m Olympic gold medal here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kenteris, 27, outbeat a field of seven, including Ato Boldon,
to cross the finish line first in 20.09 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Finished second was Britain's Darren Campbell in 20.14 and Ato
Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago only got a bronze in 20.20, while
the American sprint duo of Coby Miller and John Capel trailed home
in seventh and eighth spot.
</P>
<P>
Kenterbis looked stunned before grabbing his national flag from
a spectator, Campbell simply collapsed on the track and sobbed,
while Boldon walked around the edge of the track in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
Boldon was strongly tipped to take the gold in the absence of
Maurice Greene and world record holder and defending champion
Michael Johnson.

</P>
<P>
"I felt great pressure after I came out of retirement," Xiong,
27, said. "My physical condition had deteriorated. My body weight
had increased by half a dozen kilos, so I really spent a lot of
time training hard to get back into shape."
</P>
<P>
"I have competed in four Olympics, I have come a long and
difficult way. What I gained most is that I kept my calm."
</P>
<P>
China's first athletics gold of the Games came from Wang Liping,
who took the women's 20km walk gold after the three walkers in
front of her were expelled in the closing stages.
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud for my country," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jane Saville headed into the Olympic stadium tunnel
with a huge lead, awaiting the roar of an excited home crowd.
Instead, she left the tunnel in tears.
</P>
<P>
Saville already had been given two white warning cards, and
knew a third "lifting" infraction -- not maintaining contact with
the ground -- would invite a red card and automatic
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
The woman walking with her in the final stages of the race,
Elisabetta Perrone of Italy, already had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
As she headed into the tunnel, a judge suddenly fished out a
red card. Saville threw her arms in the air and looked up in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
"No, No, not me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Yes. You," said the judge.
</P>
<P>
Wang got more than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
Trailing Saville by an unbeatable 50 meters, Wang, who had
received one warning for infraction, kept a steady stride in an
aim for a silver.
</P>
<P>
"I raced for a silver but finished with a gold. What a surprise!
" said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Konstantinos Kenteris pulled off a stunning upset in
the Olympic Stadium when he took the men's 200m title.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old dashed home in 20.09 seconds, heading Britain's
Darren Campbell and Trinidad's Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
American Marion Jones, already the 100m champion, dominated the
women's 200m from the start for the gold.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Pedroso of Cuba won the long jump on his last leap.
</P>
<P>
On the Olympic waves, Australia won both the men's and women's
470 dinghy class, their greatest sailing success in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Armstrong and Belinda Stowell took the 11th and final
race of the 470s to become the first Australian women to win
sailing gold.
</P>
<P>
Then world champions Tom King and Mark Turnbull won the men's
470 gold with a second placing behind the United States after
leading over the closing stages of their series.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Suggests Jerusalem as Two Capitals: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has said for the first time Jerusalem and Al-Qods, the Arabic
name for the Holy city, will be side by side as the capitals of
Israel and a future Palestinian state if a peace agreement is
signed between the sides, the Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a Rosh Hashana (Jewish New Year) interview with the paper on
Wednesday, Barak said he did not know whether there will be an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"But if there is an agreement it will include an end to the
conflict, permanent borders for Israel recognized by the world, 80
percent of the settlers in Judea and Samaria (biblical names for
the West Bank) under Israeli sovereignty in settlement blocs,
security arrangement, principally along the eastern border, and
Jerusalem bigger than ever since King David - with a solid Jewish
majority for generations, united under our sovereignty, and
recognized by the world as the capital of Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The final result, the prime minister said, will be Jerusalem
that will include such large blocs of Jewish settlements in east
Jerusalem as Givat Ze'ev, Ma'aleh Adumim, Gush Etzion and almost
all Jewish neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
But at the same time Barak reiterated rejection of a transfer of
sovereignty over the disputed Temple Mount holy site to the
Palestinians or to an Islamic body.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount, also known as al-Haram al-Sharif to Muslims,
is sacred to Jews as the site of their destroyed temples and to
Muslims because it houses the Al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest
shrine in Islam. The sovereignty dispute over the holy site in
Jerusalem is the sticking point in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks and it also aborted the July Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Barak also raised for the first time his
conception of a partial agreement with the Palestinians, leaving
out Jerusalem in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to be one of the issues tackled in the current
separate talks of Israeli and Palestinian negotiators with U.S.
officials in Washington, said leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Barak suggested both sides reach an agreement on all issues but
Jerusalem or the Temple Mount. Those issues, according to Barak,
would be set aside and dealt with "under a timeframe and mutually-
agreed procedure."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are
expected to return home on Thursday night to brief their leaders on
the talks. The Americans have so far refrained from presenting
their bridging proposals for an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks Philippines to Help Lift Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq asked the Philippines
Thursday to join a clamor for the lifting of the embargo so that
it can normalize oil production and help ease worldwide fuel
shortage.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Salah Al-Samarmad, Iraq ambassador
to the Philippines, said his country is prevented from helping
poor countries that rely heavily on oil imports because of the
economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Iraq 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"By insisting on the sanctions upon the pressure of he United
States and Britain, the UN is actually unjustly punishing not only
Iraq but the poor countries which are heavily relying on oil
imports," said Samarmad.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that since the oil production of Iraq has
been curtailed for the last 10 years, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will have to allow Iraq to produce
to the country's full capacity of six million barrels of oil per
day once the sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the International Monetary Fund warned that the
current oil prices could thwart global growth and harm the world's
poorest countries. There have lately been widespread protest

laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises were re-employed.
</P>
<P>
From 1996 to the end of 1999, the number of workers in the
primary industry had reduced by 1.04 million, and those in the
manufacturing industry and the service industries had increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of workers have shifted from state-owned
and collectively-owned sectors to private firms. In 1999, there

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Visit to Temple Mount Causes Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Israeli soldiers
and two Palestinian demonstrators were injured Thursday morning in
clashes caused by opposition party leader Ariel Sharon's visit to
disputed Temple Mount, an Israeli spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Israeli Police, Jerusalem District, Shmuel Ben-
Ruby said that the Israeli police who were deployed around the holy
site in East Jerusalem to protect Sharon did not fire tear gas and
rubber-coated metal bullets, and the soldiers were hurt by stones
and the Palestinians by police clubs.
</P>
<P>
Several protesters, including Israeli Arab lawmakers Abdul-Malik
Dehamshe and Ahmed Tibi, were also injured. Faisal Husseini, a
senior Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem, was struck
in the leg by a policeman's club.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called the visit by Sharon, the leader of
hawkish Likud, "a provocation."
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount, located in the walled Old City of East
Jerusalem, is the site of the former Jewish Temple, the most sacred
shrine of Judaism. Muslims call it al-Haram al-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary, which houses Al Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock, the
third holiest shrine in Islam.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty over the holy site is the toughest issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks For now, Muslim clerics have
autonomy in administering the site, although Israeli police remains
in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
The police, armed with riot shields, with some in full battle
gear, arrested several Jewish right-wing extremists and Palestinian
activists.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Sharon's visit was to show to grass-root Israelis
that the Jewish state should not give up sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, Likud officials said.
</P>
<P>
The angry Palestinian protesters shouted "God is great" at
Sharon and his colleagues. Some even tried to break through the
police cordon, which led to scuffles. About 1,000 Israeli police
were deployed around the shrine.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, a Palestinian demonstration incurred by rumors that
Jewish extremists planned to rebuild the Jewish Temple led to
clashes, in which 19 Palestinians were killed and 140 wounded by
fire from Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
decision to reopen an tunnel just outside the compound triggered
riots, leaving 58 Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead.

AMMAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- An attempt to hijack a Jordanian
airliner flying from Sanaa to Amman was foiled Thursday, with the
plane landing safely at its destination and the hijacker
surrendering to the police, Jordanian civil aviation authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, who was not identified, turned himself in to
Jordanian police when the Royal Jordanian Airbus 310 touched down
at 7:55 a.m. (0455 GMT), an hour behind schedule, the authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been told by an unidentified "outside agency" to
take over the plane, they added. However, the motivation behind the
hijacking is not known yet.

<HEADLINE> Barak Condemns Bomb Attacks Near Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak condemned a roadside bomb attack against Jewish settlers' car
convoy near Gaza Strip overnight, which wounded two Israeli
soldiers, Israel Radio reported Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the Palestinian side to arrest and
punish those responsible for the "severe" terrorist attack and
those who had sent or instigated terrorists on the mission, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place at late Wednesday night, when Israeli
soldiers were escorting a settler convoy to the Netzarim Jewish
settlement in the Palestinian self-rule city of Gaza. Two roadside
explosive devices were detonated and following the blasts,
terrorists fired on the convoy.
</P>
<P>
One soldier was lightly wounded in the leg and a second
sustained grave head injuries, but all settlers, including women
and children, were safe.
</P>
<P>
It appeared as if those who detonated the bombs managed to
escape to the Gaza Strip. Israeli security forces suspected that
either Palestinian militant Hamas or Palestinian security forces
were involved in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The area around the Netzarim settlement has recently become a
hotbed of clashes between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, a Palestinian car collided with an Israeli vehicle
near Netzarim, in which four Palestinians were wounded. The
Palestinians claimed that the Israelis intentionally produced the
accident, which was denied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Molotov cocktails and stones were hurled at Israeli
army's vehicles in protest.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's bomb attacks reportedly were the fourth blast
which took place around Netzarim in the past year, according to
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, traffic to and from Netzarim, which is still under
Israeli control, should be in convoys and all civilian cars are
escorted by military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claimed that the Netzarim area and other Jewish
settlements in Gaza should be handed over to them after a final
peace deal with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Local Court Decides to Cancel City Arrest for Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The South Jakarta Court
decided here Thursday to cancel the city arrest for former
President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during the third court session held at
the Agriculture Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
On September 5, the local court extended the city arrest status
against Soeharto for 60 days. The city arrest was firstly imposed
on August 9, following the imposition of the house arrest on him.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto failed to attend Thursday's hearing like before with
the same reason that the defendant's health condition was bad.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of Soeharto, the court only heard the result of
the medical check on Soeharto's health which was conducted by an
independent medical team last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court also proposed to abolish the trial of
Soeharto on the charges of stealing 571 million U.S. dollars from
the state by funneling money from the tax-free charity foundations
he ran into the businesses of his family and friends.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The anti-AIDS vaccine
developed by a leading British research institution will
officially commence its trials in Kenya in December this year.
</P>
<P>
Richard Muga, director of Medical Services, announced at the
media executives seminar held here Wednesday that all the
modalities and strategies have been put in place to counsel and
guide any Kenyan willing to volunteer during the vaccine trials,
the government-run newspaper Kenya Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Three ethical committees have been established by the
government to identify, counsel and check on the volunteers before
they are given consent to participate in the exercise which will
be undertaken in late December, the director said.
</P>
<P>
He assured members of the public that their interests are well
protected, saying measures have been put in place to ensure that
only those cleared by the government are allowed to participate in
the exercise.
</P>
<P>
According to Ibrahim Mohamed, manager of Kenya's National AIDS
Control Program, currently 14 percent of the entire Kenyan
population is infected with the virus, causing the country with a

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tribunal Launches Victim Support Initiative in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has launched a support program
to help victims of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, an ICTR statement
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony of the Support Program for Witnesses
and Potential Witnesses, Registrar of the tribunal Agwu U. Okali
said that the program will assist victims of the genocide by
providing facilities such as legal guidance, psychological
counseling, physical rehabilitation and reintegration assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The restitutive justice program will facilitate national
reconciliation and peace in Rwanda, since a victim who has
received the requisite assistance towards recovery will be better
disposed to reconciliation than one who has not," Okali said,
adding: "The idea of restitutive justice is thus the future
direction of international criminal justice."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the program will be implemented by five Rwandan
non-governmental organizations which were selected because of
their presence at the community level and their capability to
extend the program to various prefectures where the tribunal has
identified witnesses or potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Rwanda's Minister of Justice congratulated the
tribunal on the program, saying that it is bound to have a
positive impact on the Rwandan people's perception of the
relevance and reality of the tribunal's justice for the genocide.
</P>
<P>
Based in Arusha, northern Tanzania, the ICTR, which was created
on November 8, 1994 in accordance with the United Nations Security
Council resolution 955, has the mandate to try persons suspected
to be responsible for genocide and other serious violations of the
international humanitarian law committed in the territory of
Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Universities Allowed to Set up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign universities will be
allowed to set up campuses in Kenya, according to a newly-
published Universities (Amendment) Bill 2000.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which seeks to amend the Universities Act of 1986,
requires foreign universities to apply only for a letter of
recognition from the government before setting up campuses once
the bill is passed by the Parliament, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the new bill is to make legitimate the current
practice by foreign universities to offer degree courses through
local institutions or through distance learning, and to enhance
and liberalize the provision of university education in the
country.
</P>
<P>
By having more foreign universities establishing campuses
locally, Kenya will save money spend on sending students abroad,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The new bill also seeks to strengthen the Commission for Higher
Education to coordinate all aspects of tertiary education,
including admission and disbursement of funds to public
universities.
</P>
<P>
At present, a number of middle-level colleges in the country
such as the School of Professional Studies and the Kenya College
of Accountancy are offering degree programs from foreign
universities.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany defeated Brazil 2-0 to
take the bronze medal of the women's soccer tournament at the
Sydney Olympic Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Renata Lingor fired in a free kick in the 64th minute before a
sparse crowd at Sydney Football Stadium and Birgit Prinz netted
her third goal of the campaign in the 79th to clinch the third
place for the Germans.
</P>
<P>
Brazil left joint top scorers Raquel and Katia on the bench
while the Germans dropped defender Tina Wunderlich, whose own goal
in the semifinal against Norway cost them a place in the final.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians almost scored in the 13th minute when Maicon
sent Formiga clear down the left but the midfielder's well-struck,
angled shot was blocked by goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg at the near
post.
</P>
<P>
Germany replied with a 30-meter free kick from Sandra Minnert
that shaved the crossbar, a 25-meter shot from Maren Meinert that
flew past the angle and a lobbed corner from Birgit Prinz that
bounced off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Inka Grings had a great chance to give the Germans the lead
early in the second half but slipped when a left wing cross found
her unmarked in front of goal.
</P>
<P>
But the Germans broke the deadlock in the 64th minute when
Lingor curled a 21-meter free kick around the defensive wall and
inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
Grings had a chance to increase the lead but, with two players
supporting and in better positions, she opted to shoot and Andreia
saved. Then Prinz got clear of the Brazilian defense only to pull
her shot wide with the 'keeper beaten.
</P>
<P>
Pretinha should have leveled in the 75th minute when she
dribbled past a defender but shot feebly goalward from barely six
meters and the Germans were able to clear.
</P>
<P>
But the Germans made it 2-0 in the 79th minute when Prinz
collected a through ball on her left knee and outpaced Juliana
before firing home with her left foot.
</P>
<P>
The gold medal match between the United States Norway will be
held later Thursday.

</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, deputy director of the Development Research
Center of the State Council, said earlier this month that marine
industrial undertakings will become a theme for the 21st Century.
They include items as diverse as fishing, aquatic processing,
tourism, bio-medicine, transportation and so on.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, the finest
ports and 40 percent of China's 1,500 aquatic species, the Hainan
SEZ is one of the best to develop the industry in China by opening
more areas of the sector to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Under its strategic development plan, the province will build
four marine industrial centers by 2010 for aquatics processing,
oil and gas refining, tourism and deep-sea biological resources
processing, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the strong trend, more than 150 companies from
southeastern China, like Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, Shanghai,
Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as Canada and Japan flocked to the
island, which has brought in over 1.2 billion yuan (about 144
million US dollars) of investment to the industry since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Looks to South China Sea Resources (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Facing the South China Sea,
China's largest tropical island, Hainan Province, has been newly
designated to create a comprehensive strategy to tackle its marine
resources.
</P>
<P>
In term of its land, Hainan is the smallest province in China,
but taking into consideration its 2.2 million square kilometer of
sea territory, it is the largest.
</P>
<P>
As the country's largest special economic zone (SEZ), Hainan is
now looking beyond its land and now wants to tap into the sea. The
development of its marine industry, however, is still in its
primary stage and is limited to offshore fishing and aquatic
breeding.
</P>
<P>
With the industry designated as the province's most hopeful
component to boost the economy, it will be expanded to more areas
than before, according to the Tenth Five-Year Plan of the province
(2001-2005).
</P>
<P>
Located in the South China Sea and Beibu Gulf and occupying 44.
6 percent of the country's sea territory, Hainan has abundance of
marine resources, of which natural gas and marine biological
resources are the most appealing investment areas to big overseas
investors, said Chi Fulin, director of China (Hainan) Institute
for Reform and Development.
</P>
<P>
The industry can effectively increase Hainan's international
reputation, said the economist.
</P>
<P>
A report from the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC)
shows that the South China Sea, known as the second "Middle East"
for its oil and natural gas reserves, has three of China's five
most productive natural gas pools. The exploration over the past
two decades helped verify 5.17 trillion cubic meters of natural
gas reserve.
</P>
<P>
The US company, Chevron, was among the first group of foreign
oil firms to become involved in Sino-foreign oil offshore
exploration in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The managing director of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc's Asia
Business Unit, Wes Lohec, said earlier this year that the company
hopes to get more involved in the development of the offshore
natural gas in the sea area, because the market potential for
clean energy in China's inland alone is good.
</P>
<P>
China has pledged to lift the consumption of natural gas in the
share of the non-renewable energy from 2 percent to 8 percent by
2010. By then, Hainan, the closest processing center for offshore
energy, will become a crucial energy supplier for provinces on the
southeastern coast to help sustain dynamic economic growth. The
energy-stringent region has witnessed the fastest economic growth
in the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Visit to Temple Mount Causes Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- At least one Israeli soldier
was injured Thursday morning in clashes between Israeli police and
Palestinians protesting against opposition leader Ariel Sharon's
visit to the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount, which is also known to Muslims al-Haram al-
Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary, is located in the Old City of
Jerusalem and a disputed site holy to both Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators called the visit by the
right-ring Likud party leader "provocative" as the Palestinians and
Israel are wrestling over the sovereignty over the site in their
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Several protesters, including Israeli Arab lawmakers Abdul-Malik
Dehamshe and Ahmed Tibi, were injured in the accident, as nearly 1,
000 armed Israeli police escorted Sharon and his Likud colleagues
into the Temple Mount compound.
</P>
<P>
The police also arrested several Jewish right-wing extremists
and Palestinian activists, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Sharon's visit was to show to grass-root Israelis
that the Jewish state should not give up sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, Likud party officials said.
</P>
<P>
The police escorting him were armed with riot shields, with some
in full battle gear, while angry Palestinians shouted "God is
great" at Sharon and his convoys. Some Palestinians tried to break
through the police's cordons, which led to scuffles with Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount issue was the deal-breaker at last July's Camp
David summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton as the
Palestinians demands full sovereignty on the site, which houses
Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosques, the third holiest site in
Islam.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Giant Enters Thai Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange has acquired 34 percent of Wireless Communications
Services (WCS) Ltd, the mobile phone arm of CP. But the two
companies refused to say the value of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition is Orange's first equity investment in
Southeast Asia and reflects the company's international expansion
strategy, David Holliday, international business development
manager of Orange, said at a joint press conference with the CP
Group.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Thailand market presents a tremendous
opportunity. Penetration of the mobile market is low - less than
five percent - and the recovering economy bodes well for the
future," Holliday said.
</P>
<P>
The CP-Orange syndicate will become a significant telecom
player providing quality service to Thai public, said Sarasin
Viraphol, executive vice president of CP at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
WCS has received a concession from the Thai government to
operate 1800 Mhz mobile phone services early this year.
</P>
<P>
WCS has a registered capital of 18 billion baht (428.5 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Orange is one of the world's most advanced and fastest-growing
mobile communications companies. In the United Kingdom, Orange has
over seven million customers.
</P>
<P>
The company was taken over by France Telecom for about 35
billion dollars last May.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the U.S. investment banking company
Merrill Lynch, the penetration rate of the Thai cellular phone
industry is projected to grow from its current 4.8 percent to 14.5
percent by the end of 2005.

<HEADLINE> Manila Weighing Options to Protect Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Thursday reassured the public that it continues to weigh the
options available to the government to help the peso recover vis-a-
vis the strong U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said, however, that the
government is not likely to intervene to prop up the value of the
peso by drawing extensively from its gross international reserves.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank of the Philippines can use other instruments
available to it as an independent authority," Zamora said in a
statement issued by the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government's financial managers are working
closely with the central bank in finding ways to prop up the peso
without violating the bank's constitutional independence.
</P>
<P>
One of the options available to the central bank, he said, is
to raise interest rates, but not too high lest it hurt business
and investments.
</P>
<P>
Another option, Zamora said, is to intervene the open market
but not on a sustained basis.
</P>
<P>
"In previous experiences, it is so easy to spend up to 4
billion dollars in four days without any real effect. So the
central bank, if you've noticed, has been using market
intervention only to provide additional liquidity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, such intervention should not be implemented
too expensively as levels of transactions in the Philippine market
are relatively low.
</P>
<P>
"Our market is not that big. Total transactions are at the 100-
million-dollar level. We need only about 10 to 20 million dollars
to maintain liquidity there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, the peso has lost more than 13
percent of its value from 40.313 pesos to a dollar. The currency
was traded around 46-peso-to-one-dollar level in the last few days.

<HEADLINE> Contribution of Sub-Sahara's Manufacturing to GDP Reduces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is among a number of
countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the contribution of
manufacturing to the gross domestic product (GDP) has reduced
drastically since 1987.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) obtained by Thursday's Times of
Zambia newspaper, the relative importance of manufacturing in
Africa has been comparatively low when compared to others in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
The share of manufacturing value (MVA) in GDP in developing sub-
Saharan Africa and North Africa decreased from 11 to 10 percent
and 15 to 14 percent respectively. This compares with an increase
from 23 to 25 percent in the developing countries as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Zambia, the share of MVA in GDP declined in 1997
to 12 percent from 26 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe dropped from 20 to 16 percent, Angola 7 to 4 percent,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) 13 to 8 percent, Ghana
10 to 9 percent and Malawi from 15 to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the share of MVA was less than 10 percent in 30
countries while it was equal to over 25 percent in only two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This positive but rather weak relationship between MVA/GDP
ratio and per capita GDP among Africa's developing countries is
probably due to their diverse nature in terms of size, natural
resources and market accessibility," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that in the early stages of economic
development, the share of MVA increases and after a certain point
it starts decreasing gradually.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of developing countries in Africa, most of which
are still in the early stages of development, the correlation
coefficient between MVA/GDP ratio and per capita GDP for 1997 is
positive but not significant as it is a mere 0.07," it said.

<HEADLINE> Annan: "we must do more to make our cities safe and livable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Kofi A. Annan, secretary-
general of the United Nations, called on the world to build safer
and better cities.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the Sixth Major Cities' Summit Beijing 2000,
which opened here today, Annan said cities may become terrible
places for humankind if efficient measures are not taken.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "cities can be places of exploitation, disease,
violent crime, unemployment, underemployment and extreme poverty."
</P>
<P>
"The message is clear: we must do more to make our cities safe
and livable places for all," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
He said humankind has entered the urban millennium. Half of the
world's people are city dwellers. Within 25 years, two-thirds of
people will be city dwellers, with the largest amount of change
occurring in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that measures be taken to enable cities to become
engines of growth and crossroads of ideas. They can also be models
of democracy and multicultural coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Annan pointed out that urban problems can be solved only by
strong and effective local authorities. Local authorities also
have a global role to play, as markets, communications, movement
of goods, funds and people are all increasingly global. Cities
today must manage problems and opportunities that used to be the
sole domain of national government.
</P>
<P>
He said the future of humanity lies in cities. In Istanbul,
four years ago, the City Summit, organized by the United Nations
Center for Human Settlement, adopted the Habitat Agenda, setting a
positive vision of sustainable urban development and good urban
governance. "We must bring that vision to life," he concluded.

NANJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Police in Nanjing, capital of

<HEADLINE> China Develops Water-proof, Oil-proof Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a new
technology that will keep textile goods from getting wet, tainted
or dirty by such liquid material as water and oil.
</P>
<P>
The new nanometer technology, developed by Zhongshang
Centennial High-tech Company, could be used on textile fabrics,
leather, oil pipelines, metal surfaces, building material and many
other solid surfaces.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Lei, vice chairman of the company board, said that the
technology can help textile material, such as cotton, hemp, silk,
nap, mixed spinning and chemical fabrics from getting wet or dirty
by water, oil, ink and juice.
</P>
<P>
The technology could also be used to coat the surfaces of metal
material and oil pipelines to produce higher speeds, improve rot-
proofing and reduce liquid leakage, according to Jiang, also
professor with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Clothes treated using the technology need no washing, which
will save water and will be environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
A nanometer is equal to one millionth of a millimeter.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Board of
Investment (BOI) has attracted 715 million U.S. dollars in foreign
direct investment during the five years ending September 30, 2000,
representing a 20 percent growth over the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The net 202 million U.S. dollars recorded in 1999 was the
highest ever for a single year.
</P>
<P>
The share of total industrial exports by BOI enterprises as a
percentage of total industrial exports of the country grew from 70
percent to 80 percent during the past five years. Direct exports
by BOI enterprises showed a 40 percent increase from 2,093 million
U.S. dollars to 2,916 million U.S. dollars during this period.
</P>
<P>
The BOI says that private foreign and local investment
committed to infrastructure projects such as power, telecom and
ports was the highest ever recorded during a five year period.
Investment in the powers sector was 12.96 billion rupees, the
telecom sector 22.3 billion rupees and the port sector 4.9 billion

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Dispute Over Stickers For Polling Cards Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A petition filed against the
printing of stickers for polling cards before Sri Lanka's Human
Rights Commission(HRC) was withdrawn Wednesday, ending the
controversy over the action of the Elections Commissioner, the
official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-at-Law J. C. Weliamuni who appeared for the Elections
Commissioner Dayanada Dissanayake told the HRC that Dissanayake
had announced over the electronic media on Monday that the polling
card with or without the sticker was not mandatory for voting.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed by Ananda Gunathilaka, a nominee in the
National List of the ruling People's Alliance. His Attorney-at-Law
D. P. Mendis said Gunathilaka would be satisfied if the HRC made a
legal statement that it is enough to have the name of the voter
without a polling card on the electoral list to use his or her
vote with or without a sticker.
</P>
<P>
The HRC declared that the complaint was withdrawn following the
clarification of the legal situation.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the stickers arose when the Criminal
Investigations Department raided a private printing press where
the stickers were being printed, following a complaint that some
documentation for the October 10 general election was being
printed without any security measures adopted.
</P>
<P>
The government alleged that the elections commissioner should
not have contracted a private printing press for the job but
handed it over to the government press.
</P>
<P>
The elections commissioner had taken the stand that he had been
empowered by the law to take any measures he thought necessary to
prevent fraud at the election and this was one of the measures he
had thought of implementing.

<HEADLINE> India Pledges Fresh Credit for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to provide
Bangladesh with an additional state credit amounting to 2 billion
rupees (43.5 million U.S. dollars), the Daily Star newspaper
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was communicated to Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria by
his Indian counterpart Yashwant Sinha during a meeting held in
Prague Wednesday when they are in the Czech capital to attend the
55th annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for fresh state credit from India is expected to
be signed in late October or early November when Sinha visits
Bangladesh, the newspaper quoted meeting sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the WB-IMF annual meeting, Kibria and Sinha discussed
different issues of bilateral interest and matters of regional and
global concern.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister thanked the Indian government for pledging
state credit to Bangladesh, underlining the need for enhanced
cooperation between the two countries in trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
He particularly emphasized the potentials of joint venture
investments in the industrial sector. An additional credit
agreement of a similar amount is likely to be negotiated and
signed during the Indian finance minister's forthcoming visit to
Bangladesh, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Sinha, assuring Kibria of continued cooperation for the mutual
benefit of the two countries, hoped that the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation Finance Ministers' Meeting
will be held without further delay.

<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Injured in Gaza Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
wounded, one seriously, in the Gaza Strip when a Jewish settlers'
convoy they were escorting were bombed Wednesday night,
Palestinian police said early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The road leading to the Netzarim settlement south of Gaza City
has been sealed temporarily by Israeli soldiers and an
investigation was under way, a Palestinian policeman told Xinhua
on the site of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Two home-made bombs exploded as the convoy approached the Erez
checkpoint. Two Israeli soldiers were wounded by the second
explosion when they were checking the surrounding areas after the
first blast.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers on the scene told Xinhua that they were also
shot at by unidentified gunmen hidden in the roadside bushes.
</P>
<P>
Blood stains were seen on the road.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been rushed to the Be'ersheva hospital in
Israel, 60 kilometers from the Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
No organizations have claimed the responsibility for the attack
so far.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak condemned the bomb attack,
calling on the Palestinian Authority to "act with a strong hand
against those who carried out the attack from its territory," the
Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The isolated Netzarim Jewish settlement and the road leading to
it have been a venue of high tension between settlers and
Palestinians, who demand the removal of all Jewish settlements
from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at a critical time when negotiators
from Israel and Palestine are in Washington holding talks with U.S.
mediators for a final settlement to their 52-year conflict.

SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former world number one
Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia needed five sets to defeat Germany's
Tommy Haas in the men's tennis singles final at the Sydney Olympic
Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The marathon match lasted three hours 35 minutes before
Kafelnikov finally sealed the title at 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 6-2, 4-6

</P>
<P>
Haas, 22, went into the final set looking the more likely
winner but just as victory looked within his grasp he stumbled.
Two unforced errors in the eighth game of the final set handing
Kafelnikov the chance to serve out for the match.
</P>
<P>
The big Russian, who had failed to reproduce the blistering
form he displayed en route to the final, made no mistake,
powerfully killing off the match to secure an Olympic gold medal
he has said will mean more to him and his country than his 1996
French Open and 1999 Australian Open titles.

<HEADLINE> Dell Cuts Prices For PCs, Servers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp., the
world's second largest personal computer maker, said it was
cutting prices on a wide range of computers and servers in the
United States, according to a news release on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dell said it cut prices by 15 percent on Dimension desktop PCs
and 12 percent on Inspiron notebook computers for small businesses.
It also cut prices up to 47 percent on its line PowerEdge servers,
which are computers that run networks of other computers.
</P>
<P>
Under the new price list, the PowerEdge servers are priced from
1,199 U.S. dollars. Dimension desktop PCs start at 599 dollars and
Inspiron notebooks from 1,099 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe the change in component pricing is
partly because of a fall in the pricing of DRAM, or the memory
chip.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that has been happening is that two months
ago DRAM pricing was pretty high, and that's usually when computer
companies set their prices," said Vadim Zlotnikov, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein. "The easing of availability would account
for some of the decline in price," he added.

<HEADLINE> Text of Court Decision on Romanian Gymnast Raducan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Following is the text of the
statement on the Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan case by the
Court of Arbitration for Sport:
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)
has dismissed the appeal filed by the Romanian gymnast Andreea
Raducan.
</P>
<P>
On 26 September 2000, Andreea Raducan filed an application with
CAS to set aside the decision made by the IOC Executive Board to
disqualify her from the women's (artistic) individual all-around
event and to withdraw her gold medal arising from her positive
doping test to pseudoephedrine. Raducan underwent this doping test
after the event on 21 September.
</P>
<P>
The CAS Panel composed of Dr. Tricia Kavanagh (Australia),
President, Dr. Stephan Netzle (Switzerland) and Dr. Maidie Oliveau
(United States) confirmed that Andreea Raducan tested positive for
pseudoephedrine and therefore committed a doping offense pursuant
to the Anti-Doping Code of the Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Article 3-3 of the Anti-Doping Code provides that "Any case of
doping during the competition automatically leads to invalidation
of the result obtained (with the consequences including forfeit of
any medals and prizes) irrespective of any other sanction that may
be applied."
</P>
<P>
A strict liability test must thus be applied, consequences
being automatic disqualification as a matter of law and in
fairness to all other athletes. This is why factors such as the
athlete's age (She will be 17 on 30 September), her weight, the
need for medication (there are other medicines available as well
as procedures to be followed if one need medication with a banned
substance for health reasons), the fact the drug may not have
enhanced the performance and the reliance on the team's doctor are
irrelevant. This is in line with the case law of CAS where it is
consistently held that:
</P>
<P>
"It is the presence of a prohibited substance in a competitor's
bodily fluid which constitutes the offense irrespective of whether
or not the competitor intended to ingest the prohibited substance.
"
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Export Turnover Up in First Nine Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's export turnover
valued at 10.49 billion U.S. dollars, in the first nine months of
this year, representing a 28 percent increase over the
corresponding period last year, local daily Vietnam News (VNS)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of which, the country's domestic enterprises exported goods
worth of 6.76 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 76.3 percent of
the total nation's export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is expected to export 14 billion U.S. dollars worth of
goods by the end of the year, a 21.3 percent increase over last
year, VNS said.
</P>
<P>
The newly revised forecast of 14 billion U.S. dollars in export
is largely due to a leap in crude oil sales, with the total export
in the first three quarters this year jumping 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars over last year's figures.
</P>
<P>
The country's other export items experiencing a high growth
rate include seafood, footwear, and electronic products. Exports
of fruits and vegetables (180 million U.S. dollars) and handicraft
and fine art products (250 million U.S. dollars) both posted a 100
percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 2000, Vietnam imported commodities
worth 11.002 billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of 33.
3 percent against the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the national trade deficit in the last nine
months was just 513 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 4.9
percent of the country's export turnover.

<HEADLINE> Bush Reclaims Momentum in Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush has reclaimed some momentum
in the presidential race with his renewed appeal to female "swing
voters" and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
A new Los Angeles Times poll published on Wednesday gave Bush a
48-42 lead against his Democratic rival Al Gore. The poll found
that seniors supported Bush slightly more than Gore, 47 percent to
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 694 likely voters, conducted September 23-25,
suggested Bush has reclaimed an edge on such personal traits as
trust and likability, but Gore retained the advantage on such
issues as health care, education and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
The campaign appeared to be moving in the direction of Vice
President Al Gore after the Democratic national convention held in
Los Angeles during August 14-17. Gore led Bush in most national
polls.
</P>
<P>
The shift toward Bush in recent days is largely caused by a
bloc of swing voters not affiliated with either party, a majority
of them women, said Republican pollster Linda Divall.
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gore are currently about even in other national polls,
showing the presidential race is very close.
</P>
<P>
Two new tracking polls, by CNN-USA Today-Gallup and Voter.com
Battleground, showed the race nationally within the margin of
error.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Inc., the
world's second-largest mobile phone maker, unveiled next-
generation mobile phones on Wednesday in Chicago, where the
Personal Communications Industry Association Conference is being
held.
</P>
<P>
Timeport 270, Motorola's first Bluetooth-capable mobile phone,
uses a new short-distance wireless technology that eliminates the
need for cables between electronic devices, including personal
computers, mobile phones, headsets, handheld computers and
printers, according to a news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
The new phones, to be made available in December, will allow
consumers to use their phones to access the Internet from their
portable computers up to nine meters away, without having to find
a physical data connection.
</P>
<P>
The Timeport 270 also features a large graphical display and a
hands-free speakerphone that can be used up to three meters away.
The battery life for the phone is four hours of talk time, or nine
days of stand-by time.
</P>
<P>
Motorola expects the phones to retail for 300 to 400 dollars.
They may be packaged with Motorola's Bluetooth PC cards and Smart
Module accessory, both of which are needed in order to establish a
connection between Bluetooth phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
Motorola also introduced two other phones at Chicago conference
that combine the functions of a mobile phone and a short-messaging
device.
</P>
<P>
The company said the V100, which has a stylish look, is
targeted toward fashion-conscious consumers, while the Accompli
009, which comes with a color display, e-mail capability, Internet
access and a programmable operating system, is meant to serve as a
remote office for professionals.

SANTIAGO -- The personal computer (PC) sales in Chile reached
187,171 units in the first half of 2000, up 46.8 percent from the
same period of last year, International Data Corporation Chile (

considerable increase of 38 percent in the first quarter of 2000,
while the growth rate soared to 54.3 percent in the second quarter
compared with the corresponding period of 1999. The swift growth
of PC sales was attributed mainly to the fast growth of Internet
service in the Andean nation from last year, especially in
Internet access and e-commerce fields, Alejandro Prieto explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese "Dream Team" divers
were poetry in motion on Thursday, twisting and turning with near
perfection to sweep two Olympic gold medals, while pre-race
underdog Liu Hongyu ended China's gold drought in athletics with a
dramatic race walk victory.
</P>
<P>
China raised its gold tally to 25, 10 more over the best haul
of previous four Games, only trailing the United States for seven
straight days.
</P>
<P>
The world most populous nation has virtually secured an
enviable standing in the "Olympic Top Three", which used to be the
United States, former Soviet Union or Russia, and Germany in non-
boycotted Games.
</P>
<P>
China took both the men's and the women's synchronized 3m
springboard diving golds with disciplined performances which left
their competitors far behind and gaping.
</P>
<P>
Li Na and Sang Xue scored 345.12, well in front of the 312.03
by Canadians Emilie Heymans and Anne Montminy.
</P>
<P>
An hour later Xiao Hailiang and Xiong Ni took the men's title
ahead of Russia's Alexander Dobroskok and Dimitry Sautin.
</P>
<P>
It was Xiong Ni's second gold in Sydney and his third overall,
coming two days after he retained his 3 meter springboard title.
</P>
<P>
Xiong is the first diver since Klaus Dibiasi to win diving
medals at four Olympics and has now matched the Italian in bagging
a total of five Olympic diving medals. Dibiasi won three golds and
two silvers between 1964 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who retired after winning the 3 meters springboard title
at the 1996 Games, came back in 1998 but said this would be his
last Olympics and he expected to retire for good after next year's
Chinese National Games.
</P>
<P>
"I felt great pressure after I came out of retirement," Xiong,
27, said. "My physical condition had deteriorated. My body weight
had increased by half a dozen kilos, so I really spent a lot of
time training hard to get back into shape."
</P>
<P>
"I have competed in four Olympics, I have come a long and
difficult way. What I gained most is that I kept my calm."
</P>
<P>
China's first athletics gold of the Games came from Wang Liping,
who took the women's 20km walk gold after the three walkers in
front of her were expelled in the closing stages.
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud for my country," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Jane Saville headed into the Olympic stadium tunnel
with a huge lead, awaiting the roar of an excited home crowd.
Instead, she left the tunnel in tears.
</P>
<P>
Saville already had been given two white warning cards, and
knew a third "lifting" infraction -- not maintaining contact with
the ground -- would invite a red card and automatic
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
The woman walking with her in the final stages of the race,
Elisabetta Perrone of Italy, already had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
As she headed into the tunnel, a judge suddenly fished out a
red card. Saville threw her arms in the air and looked up in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
"No, No, not me," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Yes. You," said the judge.
</P>
<P>
Wang got more than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
Trailing Saville by an unbeatable 50 meters, Wang, who had
received one warning for infraction, kept a steady stride in an
aim for a silver.
</P>
<P>
"I raced for a silver but finished with a gold. What a surprise!
" said Wang.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has made arrangements
to put over 6.5 million hectares of land under paddy, including
monsoon and summer paddy, to produce 21.67 million tons of the
crop in the present fiscal year 2000-01 which began in April, said
Thursday's official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Up to now since the start of the fiscal year, over 4.4 million
hectares have been placed under monsoon paddy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that a total of 15.67 million tons of
paddy is enough to feed the country's present 50-million
population.
</P>
<P>
In 1999-2000 fiscal year which ended in March, Myanmar
cultivated about 6 million hectares of paddy and produced 19.9
million tons of the crop, the largest output in the country's
history of paddy production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar exported 53,700 tons of rice in 1999-2000,
registering however a fall of 55.39 percent from 120,400 tons in

Paddy is designated as one of Myanmar's four main agricultural
crops. The other three are beans and pulses, cotton and sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has since January 1999 reclaimed 467,370 hectares of
vacant, virgin, fallow and wetlands in the country's six divisions
and states for cultivation by private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has abundance of cultivable land stretching 18.22
million hectares, of which only 9.31 million are under cultivation
while 8.91 million remained utilized.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Summit Opens Amid Worldwide Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) President Ali Rodriguez said Wednesday
that OPEC has grown out of its adolescence and entered its
maturity as a major player to help stabilize world oil market
prices.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, also the Venezuelan minister of energy and mines,
made the remark at the OPEC Summit in Caracas, which started
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said that a steady and
affordable supply, together with a just profitability for oil
suppliers, should be the fundamental basis for the work of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Chavez went on to say that the affordable price of oil for
consuming countries doesn't mean that oil prices should be
excessively low. Instead, the prices should be as fair for
producers as for consumers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit is celebrating OPEC's 40th anniversary amid mounting
pressure from the western oil consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
With oil prices on the world market jumping to a ten-year high,
pervasive tensions have emerged across major oil-consuming
countries. Politicians in oil-consuming countries are faced with
furious domestic protesters, including throngs of truckers
blocking roads and demanding lower fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
As the leading oil-producing and exporting cartel, OPEC is
exposed to criticism and pressure from western countries to ease
the oil shortage and bring oil prices down.
</P>
<P>
The reference oil price band of OPEC is 22-28 U.S. dollars per
barrel, which is believed by OPEC member countries to be a
suitable and sustainable price range. As the world oil prices are
still over 28 dollars per barrel, the OPEC Summit in Caracas is
being closely-watched by oil consuming countries, and it is
expected to come up with a solution to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, OPEC countries blame high taxes, problems in the areas
of refining, transportation and market speculators for high oil
prices, which have sparked widespread protests, which may indicate
that they have no intention to raise oil production.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are calling for more cooperation with oil
consuming countries. In this regard, a final declaration from the
summit was approved at Wednesday's meeting, which will be signed
by the heads of state on Thursday. The declaration aims to
strengthen multi-lateral cooperation in order to stabilize world
oil market prices.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC summit was attended by heads of state, ministers from
11 OPEC countries, as well as energy ministers of Angola, Norway,
Oman and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Mental Focus Key in Olympics, Says Indonesian Shuttlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- In high-level competition
like the Olympics, mental resilience and ability to focus
differentiates between winners and losers, Indonesia's Olympic
badminton medal winners Tony Gunawan and Hendrawan said.
</P>
<P>
Reveling to his key to success, Tony, who won the men's doubles
title with Candra Wijaya, said he consulted psychologist Andrie
Wongso to boost his morale prior to the final match.
</P>
<P>
"When playing in a major event, motivation is important to help
me ease the enormous pressure. It worked and I won," Tony was
quoted by Wednesday's Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia hired Andrie to motivate
the Thomas Cup team in May. They won the trophy for a record 12th
time.
</P>
<P>
"In the Olympics, technical skills are not the most important
factor. The most crucial factors are our physical fitness and
mental strength, especially during critical moments. We must have
a strong determination to win, something which I believe has
helped us on the court," Tony said.
</P>
<P>
The world number one pair of Tony and Candra defeated South
Korea's Lee Dong-soo and Yoo Yong-sung in the final. In the semi-
final the day before, they beat another South Korean due, Kim Dong-
moon and Ha Tae-kwon.
</P>
<P>
Tony said prior to the semi-final match, he recalled the
moments when he and Candra beat the Koreans in the past.
</P>
<P>
"I remembered how we beat them at the 1999 Grand Prix Final in
Brunei Darussalam and during the 1998 All England. I didn't want
to recall the time we lost to them because it would make us feel
down," he said.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles player Hendrawan agreed with Tony.
</P>
<P>
But Hendrawan said psychological consultation could only help
athletes if they were open to the experts. "Sometimes, athletes
prefer not to talk to the psychologists for unclear reasons. On
the other hand, some psychologists lack initiative and are not
close to the athletes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hendrawan lost to Ji Xinpeng of China in the men's singles
final.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally after every championship, athletes must be given their
psychological profile on their defeat. It will serve as a valuable
lesson for the athletes when preparing for future tournaments," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Speed of Urbanization in China's Countryside Above World Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 28, (Xinhua) -- The number of small
administrative towns in China has reached 19,000 up from 3000 20
years ago, with an average annual increase of 0.63 percent, or
nearly double of the world average in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The news was announced at the Symposium to Promote Healthy
Development of Small Towns, being held in Hangzhou, capital of
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that the country's urbanization level has
increased about 13 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Countryside urbanization is a strategic method employed
worldwide to promote economic and social development in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Compared to developing countries with a similar economic level
to China, the nation's urbanization level is still 10 percent
lower, which hinders development of tertiary industries and
creation of new jobs, and lowers consumption investment in
infrastructure in rural areas and hence has a negative impact on
national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening up and reform of China, small towns have
emerged at rapid speed. According to official statistics, about
100 million villagers have realized their dreams of living in
cities, and their quality of life has also gone through great
changes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show township enterprises produce 61 percent of
added value in the rural areas, 28 percent of China's GDP, 20
percent of national taxes and 32 percent of revenue from China's
farmers.

<HEADLINE> China to Foster World-Class Cities in Next 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 20 years
upgrading one to three selected Chinese cities into world-class
metropolises.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the relevant Chinese government department
during the ongoing Sixth Major Cities Summit Beijing 2000 said
that China lacks international cities that are strong competitors
in both Asian and the global economy, so it is imperative to make
greater efforts in this regard to foster more.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that a lack of international metropolises will
not be conducive to China's economy in global competitions and is
also not proportionate with China's international status.
</P>
<P>
Historically, China used to have world-class cities such as
Kaifeng, Chang'an and Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Judging from factors such as economic strength, infrastructure,
and the degree of internationalization, Shanghai and Beijing have
more potential than other cities to become the future world-class
cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China is determined to use about 20
years to build Shanghai and Beijing into international
metropolises.
</P>
<P>
However, before 2010, the country will concentrate efforts on
fostering and developing Shanghai, turning it into one of the
major international centers of economy, finance, trade and
shipping.

<HEADLINE> Four Hundred Million Chinese Live In Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearly four hundred million
Chinese out of 1.2 billion, or 30.9 percent, live in cities, a
document released today by China's authoritative department said.
</P>
<P>
China's urbanization speed has increased at an average of 0.63
percent per annum over the past 20 years, double the world average,
experts said during the on-going Sixth Major Cities' Summit
Beijing 2000 here.
</P>
<P>
Although China has possessed the world's largest cities in its
several thousand year feudal history, it was renowned for being a
big agricultural nation. China's urbanization level was only 17.9
percent before its opening and reform in the late 70s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has 668 cities and 19,000
administrative towns. Yet the country's urbanization level is
still lower than the world average of 42 percent, experts said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to lift the level of urbanization to 40 percent by
2010 and make itself an industrialized country with the majority
of the population living in urban societies by the middle of the
next century.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Rules On Hong Kong Dollar Check Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The detailed rules on Hong
Kong (HK) dollar check settlements were announced yesterday by the
Guangzhou Branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC).
</P>
<P>
The new check settlement business will be formally started from
October 1, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Guangzhou and Hong Kong decided to cooperate
with each other in settlements of HK dollar checks.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, all HK dollar checks that need to
be settled will be firstly collected by a settlement center in
Guangzhou and then be cleared jointly by the PBC's Guangzhou
Branch and the Hong Kong Monetary Administration.
</P>
<P>
"This will save half the time and will help promote further
economic cooperation between Guangzhou and HK, two economic giants
in south China," a local bank official commented.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the joint settlements of HK dollar
checks by Guangzhou and HK will change the former cross-border way
of settlements into local settlements and thus will decrease the
bankroll's entry time from four days to two days.
</P>
<P>
At present there are about 600 items of HK dollar settlement
business in Guangdong, involving some 50 million HK dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors Set to Take Former President's Son to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Head of the South Jakarta
Attorney's Office Antasari Azhar said he will order prosecutors to
arrest former President Soeharto's son Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala
Putra.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Supreme Court has ruled that Tommy and a business
colleague Ricardo Gelael be jailed for 18 months over a land scam
involving the National Logistics Agency (Bulog).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 18-month term of imprisonment, Tommy has
also been fined 30.6 billion (3.8 million U.S. dollars) in
compensation to the state.
</P>
<P>
"Once he is formally notified of the decision and the warrant
for his arrest is served on him, he will be taken to prison within
two or three days," Azhar was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, prosecutors can ask police to arrest the
convicted person only after the documents have been returned to
the lower court which tried the case.
</P>
<P>
The South Jakarta prosecutor's office will execute the writs,
head of the South Jakarta District Court Lalu Mariyun said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's September 22 verdict overturned an earlier
decision by the South Jakarta district court, and declared Tommy
guilty of corruption in a 95.4 billion rupiah (11.2 million U.S.
dollars) barter deal with the Bulog.
</P>
<P>
If jailed, Tommy would be the first member of the Soeharto
family to be put behind bars for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Tommy's lawyer Nudirman Munir said that although he had not
obtained a copy of the verdict, he would immediately lodge an
appeal and seek a retrial.
</P>
<P>
If the court agrees to a review, the arrest of Tommy would be
suspended pending the appeal.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis is still
gripping Indonesia, with the number of poor families rising from 6.
9 million last year to 7.7 million this year, according to the
results of a new survey.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor families make up over 16 percent of the
estimated total number of families in the country, the National
Family Planning Board (BKKBN) announced on Wednesday based on a
census it held from February to April.
</P>
<P>
The census also shows an increase in the total number of
families in the country from 45.7 million to 47.3 million this
year, the Jakarta Post daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The board's deputy for planning and analysis, Mazwar Noerdin,
said that the indicator used to measure a poor family is its
ability to satisfy food consumption and provide for health,
housing and clothing needs.
</P>
<P>
According to Mazwar, as a result of the crisis, participation
in the government's birth control program is also down from 25.2
million participants to 24.5 million.
</P>
<P>
In the education sector, the census shows that the older the
children get, the fewer go to school.
</P>
<P>
For a total of 47.5 million children in the country aged
between seven to 12 years old, 94.16 percent of them are enrolled
in school.
</P>
<P>
But for young teenagers aged between 13 and 15, only 81.14
percent go to school. No exact figures were released on the total
number of children in that age group.
</P>
<P>
As for the teenagers aged from 16 to 18 years old, only 59.5
percent from a total of 11.58 million go to school.
</P>
<P>
This means that some 4.6 million teenagers of that age do not
go to school, an increase of about 1.68 percent from last year's
census.
</P>
<P>
The government has initiated several programs to help the poor,
and according to Mazwar, the board itself has launched a program
called the Campaign to Increase Family Income to help housewives
establish their business.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar
Akayev signed a military agreement with his visiting Uzbek
counterpart, Islam Abduganievich Karimov, on Wednesday in Kyrgyz,
capital of Bishkek, Kazakh media reported.
</P>
<P>
Akayev told the press that this is the first military
cooperation accord signed between two Central Asian nations. The
accord shows the willingness of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to
maintain national and regional stability and security. The accord
will enhance both countries' military strength.
</P>
<P>
Because both states have recently been troubled by
international terrorism, the presidents' discussion focused
largely on security. According to a joint communique released
after their meeting, the two countries will cooperate in their
fight against international terrorism, religious extremism, drug
trafficking and weapons smuggling. They will offer mutual support
to defend each other's independence, territorial integrity and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Karimov began his two-day visit to Kyrgyzstan on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Stresses Importance of South American Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign
Minister Adalberto Giavarini stressed the importance of political
and economic integration in South America on Wednesday, saying
that integration could help Latin American countries keep up with
the development of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Over a working breakfast organized by the Institute for the
Development of Entrepreneurs of Argentina (IDEA), Giavarini noted
that the cohesion of the Latin American countries is an essential
and decisive element in plans to catch up with the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the South American Common Market (Mercosur),
comprising Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay with Chile and
Bolivia as associate members, would play a fundamental role in the
integration process between South American regional blocs and the
creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Giavarini reaffirmed his commitment made last summer at a
summit of Mercosur and the Andean Community to establish a free
trade zone between the two regional economic organizations before
January of 2002. The Lima-based Andean Community comprises
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the primary interest of the Argentine
government led by President Fernando de la Rua is to create a
world with less protectionism and fewer commercial distortions.
</P>
<P>
Protectionism is a form of political discrimination that not
only affects specific economic sectors, but also damages equity
and brings about exclusions, Giavarini pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, regional economic blocs in South America, such
as Mercosur and the Andean Community, have been seeking
integration with each other and within themselves by eliminating
tariffs, unifying laws and establishing a free trade zone within
the continent and perhaps one day within the western hemisphere.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediators on
Wednesday held separate talks with Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators near Washington to seek breakthroughs in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. State Department official said that this was, in
fact, the second day of such talks because U.S. special envoy
Dennis Ross had met separately with the two delegations on Monday
upon their arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The delegations, led by Israeli Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, have not yet
had a face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department officials refused to characterize the
talks which are taking place at a hotel near the Pentagon, which
is about 10-minute drive from downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, U.S.
President Bill Clinton said that he can not tell whether a peace
deal could be reached before his term expires in January.
</P>
<P>
He said that a deal would require "a remarkable convergence of
both sides willing to make difficult decisions and kind of leap
off in the future together."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China will forbid the
use of foreign languages in place name signs and will set up
united-standard place name signs in all its cities, according to
sources with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jin Ergang, director of zoning and place names under the
Ministry of Civil Affairs, said that this is to promote the
application of the phonetic annotation of Chinese characters,
which is legalized internationally as the only standard annotation
for place names in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin, the related departments have issued a joint
circular banning the incorrect spelling of place names so as to
avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid expansion of cities in China, the inconsistent
spelling of place name signs in recent years has caused many
complaints among both residents and tourists.

<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Six U.S. big companies agreed
that China becomes an attractive place to set up their research
and development centers, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The six member companies of the US-based Industrial Research
Institute (IRI), including Motorola, Ford, Lucent Technologies and
Procter &AMP; Gamble, made this statement on IRI's four-day Chief
Technology Officer (CTO) Forum, which closed Wednesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
IRI is a non-profit association composed of 270 international
industrial and service companies, whose mission is to enhance the
technological innovation of the industry.
</P>
<P>
About 25 of IRI's member companies have set up research and
development sites in China and the figure is expected to double in
the next five years, said Charles F. Larson, president of IRI.
</P>
<P>
China's strong push toward a market-driven economy and
impending membership in the WTO makes it an excellent location for
tech research and development, said Larson.
</P>
<P>
A second CTO Forum in China will be convened in 2001, perhaps
in Shanghai.

SEOUL, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Star striker Ahn Jong-hwan was
one of several surprise omissions from South Korea's squad for the

The 24-year-old became the first South Korean to sign for an
Italian club when he joined Serie A side Perugia in August this
year.

World Cup veterans Hwang Sun-hong, Ko Jong-soo and Kim Byung-ji
are also missing from coach Huh Jung-moo's squad for the
tournament which begins in Lebanon on October 12.
</P>

Huh was under pressure to succeed after South Korea failed to
advance any further from the gruop stages at the Olympic Games in
Sydney. It prompted the former PSV Eindhoven midfielder to offer
for resignation right after returning home.

The Korean Football Association refused to accept Huh's offer.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the squad in fact put an end to a proposal
to send a team with players from both North and South Korea.

to improve the public awareness of environmental protection, and
encourage the use of clean vehicles.

<HEADLINE> PC Sales in Chile Soared in First Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The personal computer (PC)
sales in Chile reached 187,171 units in the first half of 2000, up
46.8 percent from the same period of last year, International Data
Corporation Chile (IDC) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Prieto, an official of Chilean Trade, Service and
Tourism Chamber, said that country's PC sales registered a
considerable increase of 38 percent in the first quarter of 2000,
while the growth rate soared to 54.3 percent in the second quarter
compared with the corresponding period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The swift growth of PC sales was attributed mainly to the fast
growth of Internet service in the Andean nation from last year,
especially in Internet access and e-commerce fields, Alejandro
Prieto explained.
</P>
<P>
Another favorable factor was the successive drop of computer
prices in the Chilean markets. The official statistics show that
the computer retail price was reduced by 31.8 percent from June,
1999 to June, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian diving superstar
Dmitri Saoutine will be hoping to win his first gold medal of the
2000 Sydney Olympic Games in the men's 10m platform diving which
begins on Friday and concludes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In what many thought was a shock result, Saoutine had to settle
for a bronze medal behind Xiong Ni of China and Fernando Platas of
Mexico in the 3m springboard earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The reigning world champion and Olympic defending champion will
be looking to make amends in his favorite event at the Sydney
International Acquatic Center this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The gold medal is far from a foregone conclusioon, however, as
China's Tian Liang defeated the 26-year-old Russian at the recent
World Cup event in the Olympic pool, and could upset the Russian

<HEADLINE> Nine Medals to Be Awarded on Super Thursday of Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Super Thursday is set for
the Olympic diving with three medal events -the synchronized
events of the men's 3m springboard and women's 10m platform, and
the finals of the women's 3m springboard.
</P>
<P>
Eight teams of two divers will compete in each of the
synchronized events. China has the best chance of sweeping both
events. Sydney 10m platform silver medalist Li Na and Sang Xue
won this event comfortably at the 2000 World Cup in Sydney, while
3m springboard champion Xiong Ni and Xiao Hailiang won their event
at the same meet by over 30 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, who have already won one gold in the Olympic
diving tournament, also qualified the top two divers into the
finals of the women's 3m springboard. Defending champion Fu
Mingxia and Sydney World Cup champion Guo Jingjing look unbeatable
in the preliminary and semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia will be seeking her fourth career Olympic gold medal,
after winning the 10m platform in Barcelona and sweeping both
boards in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Canada should challenge the Chinese in everything, particularly
the women's 10m synchronized platform. Anne Montminy and Emilie
Heymans placed third and fifth in Sunday's individual platform
final and have focused their training towards claiming CAnada's
first Olympic diving gold medal since Sylvie Bernier's 3m
springboard title in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Blythe Hartley of Canada is also in contention for a medal in
the women's 3m springboard event.
</P>
<P>
Laura Wilkinson of the United States will be hoping to win her
second gold medal of the Games when she teams up with Sara Reiling
in the synchronized 10m platform. Troy Dumais and David Pichleer
from the United States will also vie for a medal in the other
synchronized event.

<HEADLINE> Russia Favored to Wins Synchronized Swimming Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia is the firm favorite to
win the team event in the synchronized swimming at eh Sydney
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
As reigning world champions, the Russian team were unbeaten at
the 2000 Olympic qualifying tournament and have dominated
international competitions in recent years. Among their team
victories are the 1997 FINA World Cup, 1998 World Championship,
1998 Goodwill Games and 1999 FINA World Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the defending champions of the event, the U.S. team, should
not be ruled out. Until Tuesday they had won a medal in every
synchronized swimming event in the sport's history.
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Canada and Japan have an identical record. Japan
was the silver medalists in Tuesday's duet final and were runners-
up at the 1998 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing 13th at the 2000 Olympic qualifying
tournament, Australia received an automatic bid into the team
competition as the host nation. France, China and Italy make up
the field and are ranked in corresponding descending order.

desire to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador expressed appreciation for the constant
efforts by the Egyptian government and the Egyptian-Chinese
Friendship Association to bolster cooperation relations with China.
</P>

CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- About 1 million Israelis travelled abroad during
the months of July and August, according to the Israeli Central
Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the number was about 13 percent higher than that
during the same months of the previous year, and that since 1997,
there has been a constant increase in the number of Israelis
travelling abroad.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- About 258,000 foreign visitors came to Israel
during August, with a total of 2,014,300 entering the country from
January through August, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Tourism Ministry said that about 4 percent more
visitors entered the country during August compared with the same
month last year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The average gross monthly salary in the Israeli
industrial sector will reach 8,940 shekels (about 2,230 U.S.
dollars) in 2000, with the high-tech industry once again leaving
the traditional industries far behind.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 6.5-percent real-term increase, as opposed to
1997-1999, when salaries went up 5.6 percent.

ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates' Dubai Municipality has
decided to allow local fishermen to use the traditional "Al Helag"
fishing system for seven months, from October to April 2001, to
catch the migrating fish.
</P>
<P>
"Al Helag" system is a traditional fishing method in which
special nets are used to surround and trap the pelagic (found in
the surface of the water) migratory species.
</P>
<P>
The nets are different from drift nets which are still banned in
the UAE.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The number of Jordanian expatriates has reached about
400,000, mostly in the Gulf countries, particularly Saudi Arabia.
Their remittances helped increase foreign currency reserves of the

billion dollars in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Peace Keeping Force in Sierra Leone to Be Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 Kenyan soldiers
now on the peace-keeping mission in Sierra Leone are to be
replaced, Kenya's defense spokesman Bogita Ongeri said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri said the change-over would be carried out in December
this year, adding that the fresh deployment to the war-torn
western African country is a routine rotation, and soldiers on a
peace mission are normally recalled after one year.
</P>
<P>
Like their predecessors, he said, the new battalion would
assist in disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating Sierra Leone's
warring camps and protecting U.N. buildings and installations in
that country.
</P>
<P>
In May, Kenya's Chief of General Staff Daudi Tonje threatened
to pull out his soldiers from the mission when the rebels in
Sierra Leone killed four of the Kenyan soldiers and held 18 others
as hostage. The captured soldiers were later released.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 200 Kenyan soldiers are in East Timor on
another U.N. peace-keeping mission.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Continues to Cull Infected Animals in Foot and Mouth disease Area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teams would continue with the destruction of 700 pigs,
about 150 cattle and a small number of sheep and goats on Thursday,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, leaflets were dropped from a light aircraft
to explain the situation to communities in areas nearby. The
pamphlets contained information on the reasons for the quarantine
zone and other control measures.
</P>
<P>
The decision to cull the animals followed a risk assessment by
the control center, scientists and an epidemiologist from the
Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"It was felt that a low risk area had to be created around the
infected farms by depopulating them of cloven-hoofed animals in a
radius of between 3km and 4km," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The locality selected for depopulation was based on aerial
reconnaissance, taking into account natural geographic and other
features that separate it from adjoining ones," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the teams visited 282 farms and examined 2,034
cattle, 2,828 pigs, 412 sheep and 531 goats.
</P>
<P>
"Diagnostic tests in the area surrounding the infected farms
continue to yield negative results, raising hopes that the disease
might be contained. It is, however, too early at this stage to
make any firm conclusion," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges More Intensive CIS Military-Technical Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Security Council
Secretary Sergei Ivanov called Thursday here for creating a
special institution to boost military-technical cooperation among
the signatory countries to the CIS Collective Security Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Increasing multilateral military-economic and military-
technical cooperation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (
CIS) can be "the core and a material component" in improving the
use of funds and cutting the time for producing new weapons and
technical equipment, Ivanov said at the first conference of CIS
security chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Such an institution will help resolve a number of financial,
scientific, technical and organizational problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also urged the CIS security heads to join hands to fight
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"International terrorism activity is growing at a threatening
rate.... The events in Central Asia, the recent bandit barbarities
in Chechnya and the military-political situation in Afghanistan
that has been worsening of late are in fact elements of the same
combination aimed at the social-political destabilization of the
whole Central Asia and North Caucasus region," Ivanov warned.
</P>
<P>
It is important to prevent terrorism spread by joint
international forces, the Interfax news agency cited Ivanov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the conference agreed that the presidents
of the CIS Collective Security Treaty states will meet in the
Kyrgyzstan capital of Bishkek on October 11 to discuss ways to
implement the treaty and set up cross-border structures for
coordinating joint actions.
</P>
<P>
The security chiefs of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan gathered in Moscow for the high-level forum
Thursday. A Ukrainian delegation led by National Security and
Defense Council Secretary Yevgeny Marchuk is attending the forum
as an observer.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation is headed by Security Council Secretary
Sergei Ivanov, and includes Federal Security Service Director
Nikolai Patrushev, First Deputy Foreign Minister Vyacheslav
Trubnikov, head of the armed forces General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin
and head of the General Staff's Main Intelligence Department
Valentin Korabelnikov.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum will focus on joint efforts to increase
security and forming regional security systems. The delegates will
exchange views on measures against international terrorism and a
number of other challenges to the security of the treaty member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tajik Security Council Secretary Amirkul Azimov has proposed
that "the ominous situation" on the Tajik-Afghan frontier be
another topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The situation taking shape in that region is complex and
requires our discussion, in order that the situation does not get
out of control," Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov
said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Conducts Two More National Missile Defense Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
conducted two more tests designed to improve its controversial
National Missile Defense (NMD) system over the Pacific Ocean, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
"The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization ... have completed
two risk reduction flights, which are not intercept flights, but
are designed to test various components of the national missile
defense system that's currently under development," Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
Each flight involved firing a Minuteman III from Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California into the Kwajalein missile test range in
the Central Pacific Ocean, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Minuteman missiles were fired at 1:
01 a.m. and 3:01 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time (0801 GMT and 1001 GMT)
.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the first flight was design to test
the radar's ability to discriminate among objects in space, and 20
objects were released from the payload, and the ground-based radar
then tried to discriminate among them.
</P>
<P>
The next flight was designed to test some of the components of
integrated flight test six which will take place sometime early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said that the tests were still being analyzed and the
results were not yet available.
</P>
<P>
The tests highlighted the fact that "the testing of the system
and the development of the system continues apace, and we're on
our normal schedule to continue development of a national missile
defense system," he noted.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the Pentagon to conducted NMD
related tests since President Bill Clinton opted on September 11
to leave a final decision on NMD deployment to his successor.

<HEADLINE> World Air Freighter Fleet Expected to Double, Says Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 28 (Xinhua) -- During the next 20 years,
the world's freighter airplane fleet is expected to double, with
greatest growth taking place in widebody freighters, Boeing said
Thursday in an industry forecast report.
</P>
<P>
That means the number of freighter airplanes will increase from
1,676 in 1999 to nearly 3,200 by the year 2019. During that time,
the report said, the worldwide air cargo industry is expected to
add more than 2,600 freighter airplanes, as nearly 1,100 current
freighters will be retired. Of the new freighters, about 1,800
airplanes will come from passenger-to-freighter modifications and
800 airplanes will be new production freighters.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle aircraft manufacturer said that the increase in the
world air cargo fleet will be predominantly Boeing airplanes. In
addition to producing the only complete line of new freighters,
more than 75 percent of the existing world jetliner fleet is
comprised of Boeing airplanes, including the models built in Long
Beach, California.
</P>
<P>
Today's world air cargo industry is a business of 45 billion U.
S. dollars, Boeing said, and it continues to grow at a rate
exceeding that of air passenger travel. This trend is expected to
continue, with a long-term growth rate of average 6.4 percent
annually for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Boeing sees particularly robust growth in Asia. Compared to the
world average annual growth rate of 6.4 percent, intra-Asia will
average 8.6 percent, while Europe-Asia and North America-Asia
average 7.2 percent and 7.7 percent respectively during the
forecast period, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
World air cargo traffic rebounded last year, increasing by 5.7
percent, after a disappointing 1998, in which traffic rose less
than one percent as a result of the Asian economic crisis, Boeing
said.

<HEADLINE> Second OPEC Summit Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC wrapped up its
summit here Thursday in the midst of brotherhood and cordiality.
</P>
<P>
Six heads of state and five high-ranking officials of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' 11 members attended
the summit, the first in 25 years. The cartel represents 40
percent of the world's oil production and 75 percent of proved
reserves of the planet.
</P>
<P>
Present at the summit as observers were representatives of
independent oil producing countries like Mexico, Angola, Russia,
Oman and Norway.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended with the approval of the Caracas Declaration.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, leaders agreed to the need to strengthen the
organization's unity, tighten relations between members, defend
fair prices and guarantee an efficient oil provision. "United we'
re unbeatable," said Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias.
</P>
<P>
The wish to maintain dialogue with consumer countries was
expressed in order to gain the oil market's stability and impulse
the world's economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a call was made to industrialized countries
to make their own contribution to oil price stability, solve
refinery problems, end speculation and revise high taxes applied
to the final consumer, instead of blaming the OPEC as the only one
responsible for high prices.
</P>
<P>
The second OPEC summit has fomented heads of member countries a
scenario to exchange opinions, coordinate positions and design
strategies to face the new century's new challenges, leaving aside
past disagreements, and sending out to the world a message from an
organization of even further strengthened developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC, which was founded on September 14, 1960, has 11
member countries now: Saudi Arabia, Algeria, the United Arab
Emirates, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Kuwait, Nigeria, Qatar,
and Venezuela. Venezuelan Mines and Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez
is the rotating chairman of the cartel.

Its first summit was convened in the Algerian capital of
Algiers in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Growth Slow in Most Developing Countries: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the majority of developing countries, "growth is a very
slow or even elusive process," said the report.
</P>
<P>
GDP or gross domestic product per capita doubles in 35 years if
it grows at an annual average of 2 percent. Out of the 95
countries monitored by the U.N. Department of Economic and Social
Affairs, 74 failed to reach this benchmark over the period.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the report said, 39 of the 74 have per capital GDP
below 1,000 U.S. dollars (in 1995 dollars) in 1999, and 38 of
these were in the same situation in 1964.
</P>
<P>
No developing country achieved an annual growth rate above 3

double GDP per capita at such a growth rate, said U.N. economists,
citing the experience of the last half century.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth record of the developing countries improved
during the 1990s, with GDP per capita up 2.3 percent annually,
against a 0.1 percent growth in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Satisfied With Relations With DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to a statement from the prime minister's office, Baek
Nam Sun stressed the appreciation of his government for the
leading role played by Italy, the first country of the Group of
Seven to establish ties with DPRK in January this year, in easing
the policies of his government of opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The two officials expressed the hope that the bilateral
relations will intensify in all fields, while Amato voiced his
government's appreciation for the inter-Korean dialogue that has
recently started with the eventual aim of reconciliation and
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Also on hand was Industry Minister Enrico Letta, who accepted
an invitation to visit DPRK with a business delegation to assess
prospects for joint ventures and industrial and commercial

<HEADLINE> Petrol Strike Called in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian industry ministry immediately announced that it
would call the station managers to a meeting on Tuesday to try to
avert the strike by forging a fresh deal between station managers,
fuel companies and the government.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the rationalization scheme has already
been set in motion and many small stations have disappeared across
the country, being replaced by more accessible and larger stations.
</P>
<P>
Italy has the highest fuel distribution costs in the European
union, now the green petrol costs about 2150 lire per liter.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Italy's taxi drivers also threatened to strike
against rising fuel costs.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Confident of Euro After Danish Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European Commission President Romano Prodi told reporters at
the EU headquarters in Brussels that the commission regretted the
decision made by the people of Denmark not to adopt the euro.
</P>
<P>
"But I certainly believe that the polity votes have been in our
common interests. I know that the Danish authorities don't plan to
modify the condition on the crown's participating in the (euro)
exchange mechanism," he said.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 97 percent of the votes counted, the anti-euro "no"
vote was put at some 53 percent against 47 percent for a "yes" in
Danish referendum.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is also that Denmark will maintain its
commitment to economic policy based on macroeconomic stability,
which is closely set out by euro area policies and objectives,"
the European Commission president added.
</P>
<P>
When recalling the euro's achievements after its launch in
January 1999, Prodi said the euro's development was not affected
by the countries outside the 11-nation euro-zone of the 15-
countries EU.
</P>
<P>
"The euro has established itself in the financial market as a
global currency...so the deepening of economic union will remain
our task," he said.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Denmark is a small
nation and a "no" result posed "no problem" for the euro.
</P>
<P>
The euro fell below 87.80 U.S. cents as the "no" count stacked
up, but economists said the currency's downside was limited by the
threat of central bank intervention.
</P>
<P>
As the current EU presidency holder, France also said the euro
zone group respected the Danish vote, which did not close the door
to the Nordic EU member to joining the euro in the future.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for monetary affairs Pedro Solbes also said he
saw no impact on the euro from the vote in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said the euro zone would
move ahead with the "irreversible" process of European integration.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said a Danish "no" would not
hijack Britain's euro debate. Britain is currently facing a
possible general election next year that could be dominated by the
European issue.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Sweden are the only other two EU members outside
the euro zone core. Both have pledged to let voters decide
whether to adopt the euro in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson blamed the weak euro for
the Danish result and said he did not expect any knock on effect
in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts in Europe believe the result in Danish
referendum is likely to dent confidence in the beleaguered single
currency and could reshape Europe's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
The Danish vote on euro was almost the same with the shock
results of a 1992 Danish referendum when Danes rejected the EU's
Maastricht Treaty -- the blueprint for European monetary union.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Calls to Establish Dialog regarding Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said in a written message sent to the second OPEC summit
held in Caracas, made known at the conclave's Press Office
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Muammar Khaddafi, represented at the international meeting by
member of Revolutionary Council of Socialist Popular Lybia Arab
Yamahiria, Mustafa Al-Kharroubi, recommended OPEC members to
tighten cooperative relations with oil producing countries that do
not belong to the organization, to favor common objectives and
interests.
</P>
<P>
The Lybian leader supported the strengthening of relations
between OPEC member countries and rejection of differences between
them, in order to protect the organization's credibility and have
oil become the basis for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no more space for confrontation and
fighting, he said, but rather efforts must be joined toward a
common objective like cooperation so as to achieve an economic
system whose benefits cover all the planet's inhabitants going
beyond race, religion or nationality.
</P>
<P>
Khaddafi proposed oil producing regions to stay aside of
tensions and fighting that could influence the channeling of this
vital material on consumer markets and to take away from them any
foreign military forces.

<HEADLINE> National ISPs Gain Lion's Share in U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 7,785 Internet
service providers (ISPs) are competing in the U.S. market,
expecting to generate revenues of 32.5 billion U.S. dollars this
year, according to a research report released this week.
</P>
<P>
These represent a 36 percent growth in the number of ISPs and a
37 percent growth in revenues compared to 1999, said the report
from market research firm Cahners In-Stat Group. ISPs, a total of
5,775 of them, generated revenue of 23.7 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
While only 20 percent of U.S.-based ISPs currently operate
nationally such as AOL, MSN Internet Access, Earthlink and Juno
Online Services, the report noted, they generate 80 percent of
total revenues in 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all business revenues are generated from
Internet access, In-Stat found. But the migration of business
activities to the Web has increased the importance of hosting,
which now account for close to 30 percent of all business revenues.
But consumers are still unwilling to pay for value-added services.
Access subscriptions account for nearly 70 percent of all consumer
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Consumer-oriented ISPs are no longer relying on just one access
technology, but are instead moving toward offering multiple access
technologies, including wireless, DSL and cable.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report by marketing information service
J.D. Power and Associates, small ISPs are using their strategy of
offering high-speed Internet access options to threaten the
dominance of the six largest ISPs. In the past year, smaller ISPs
accounted for 52 percent of the new household subscriptions, led
in large part by their DSL or cable modems options.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rebound From Big Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. stock market
rebounded from a big fall, driving blue chips and tech issues
higher Thursday despite uncertainty about profit earnings
remaining.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 195.70 at 10,824.06
points, recovering most of the 219-point decline in the previous
three sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 122.02 at 3,778.32 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 31.72 at 1,458.29.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rallied broadly as investors rushed into the market to
hunt for the bargains. Technology, banking and other sectors were
all up.
</P>
<P>
Among the old-line stocks, Procter &AMP; Gamble rose sharply after
the consumer products maker said its third-quarter earnings would
meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
Financial services stocks also moved higher. Among them were
Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Dain Rauscher, a regional brokerage
firm.
</P>
<P>
In the tech sector, Internet and telecom stocks climbed higher.
Cisco Systems was up despite a downgrade by a Sanford Bernstein
analyst while Nortel Networks, Lucent Technology, Hewlett Packard
and Yahoo! were also higher.
</P>
<P>
The market has been down for most of September as investors got
concerned with corporate profits. A number of companies have
warned that their earnings in the third quarter would be below the
Wall Street's expectations because of the higher costs and the
lower product demand in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The high oil prices and the weak European currency, euro, added
to the earnings worries, hitting the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 11.70 at 667.75 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 11.37 at 939.80. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 15.68 at 523.81.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,897 up, 973 down and 476
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.19 billion shares from 1.16 billion
in the previous session.
