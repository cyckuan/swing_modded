dollars from a few cents. The university withdrew the plans soon
afterwards but the students refused to end the strike.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Closing of Erez Checkpoint to Palestinian Trucks Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Minister of Finance Mohammad Zuhdi Nashashibi said the PNA
was opposed to the Israeli decision to close Erez checkpoint in
northern Gaza Strip to Palestinian trucks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of truckers who staged a sit-in before Gaza
municipality building in protest against the decision, Nashashibi
said the PNA can by no means accept Israeli restricts and hegemony
over the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has decided to deny Palestinian trucks
access to Mentar checkpoint through Erez checkpoint, the only trade
outlet of Gaza Strip. It did not give clear reasons but the
decision will be enforced as of March 1.
</P>
<P>
Mentar checkpoint is located at the beginning of the safe
passage between Tarqomia town, northwest the West Bank town of
Hebron, and Gaza Strip. The Palestinians and Israel signed an
agreement on the safe passage in October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is part of the stranglehold policy pursued by
Israel against our people," Nashashibi added, pointing out the
necessity of informing all Arab and international organizations and
urging them to take counter measures.
</P>
<P>
A number of Palestinian businessmen, traders, and
representatives of official economic and people's institutions took
part in the protest in solidarity with the truckers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gaza Governor Mohammed Al-Qodwah told the protesters
that the decision does not serve the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"With this decision the Israeli government tries to impose its
hegemony over the Palestinian economy and abort every success made
by our national economy in terms of its independence and freedom,"
Qodwah added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attempts will be met by a firm stand from all
economic sectors as it harms all industries, he vowed.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed regret that the decision could constitute
a blow to the Palestinian economy and the Palestinian transport
fleet into which the Palestinian put a great deal of their
investments.
</P>
<P>
Qodwah asserted that the PNA would sent messages to
international and diplomatic institutions including the European
Union in order to put an end to such practices and lift "the
Israeli restrictions on the Palestinian market."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Expert Predicts Price Rise in World Oil Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 7 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Oil Ministry official
said on Monday that oil prices in the world markets are expected to
rise in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sadalar Fathi, an oil expert in the ministry, said that as long
as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) stick to the prices agreed upon in last year's OPEC
ministerial meeting, oil prices in the world markets will continue
to rise. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency as saying that
because some oil consumers are still storing large quantity of oil,
OPEC members need to maintain reduction level in oil production by
1.7 million barrels per day and non-OPEC members 400,000 barrels
per day as agreed upon last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is reasonable for oil prices in the world
markets to maintain at the level of 24-25 U.S. dollars per barrel.
Last week oil prices rose to 27 dollars per barrel in the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Fathi said the average oil prices per barrel dropped to 17
dollars in 1998, and plunged to as low as 12 dollars per barrel for
some time.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the OPEC ministerial meeting to be held in Vienna
in April would evaluate measures to be taken for balancing supply
and demand.
</P>
<P>
He added that these measures will hopefully lead to further
reduction in oil stockpile and more reasonable oil prices in the
world markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hoped that non-OPEC members would support
resolutions that will be adopted by OPEC members and continue to
maintain the current reduction level in oil production.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Concerned Over Increase of Iraq's Applications on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Monday expressed his concern over the steady increase of Iraq's
applications for humanitarian supplies placed on hold.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council Monday morning,
Benon Sevan, executive director of the United Nations Office of
the Iraq Program, said there was persistent high level of holds
placed on Iraq's applications for humanitarian supplies and
especially on oil sector equipment.
</P>
<P>
"There continues to be a steady increase in both the number of
applications placed on hold and their value," he told the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
"In phases IV to VI there are currently 1,068 applications on
hold with a total value of 1.596 billion U.S. dollars. This is 23
percent of the dollar value of all applications circulated in
these three phases," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A small number of high value applications dominate this
picture -- 25 applications on hold, mainly in the electricity
sector, account for over 800 million dollars or half of the total
value of holds," Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has appealed to delegations around this
table to review this situation with a view to lifting holds
wherever possible in order to improve the implementation of this
program. To date, there has not been a significant response to
those appeals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to implement the oil-for-food
program for Iraq in 1995 which was aimed to ease the suffering of
the Iraqi people caused by the stringent U.N. sanctions against
the country. The sanctions have been in place since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The program began to be implemented in late
1996. Under the program, Iraq is allowed to export an amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
necessities for its people.

<HEADLINE> WTO Members Agree to Hold Special Sessions on Services, Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) agreed here Monday to hold special sessions on
the organization of negotiations to further liberalize services
and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Today's decisions show that the WTO is very much in business,"
WTO Director-General Mike Moore told reporters at the end of
Monday's meeting of the General Council. "The members reached
agreement with a tremendous amount of goodwill. This is the result
of a lot of serious and constructive preparation."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the services talks will take place in
special negotiating sessions of the Council for Trade in Services,
the first of which will be held in the fourth week of February.
The Agriculture Committee will hold similar special sessions with
the first starting in the week from March 20.
</P>
<P>
"The decisions provide a platform, not only for the mandated
negotiations and reviews, but also for other issues which members
would like to see included in the WTO's program," Moore said. "
With work underway constructively in agriculture and services,
discussions on the other issues can also progress."
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank's latest figures, half of the world
's workforce, 52 percent of the female workforce and 46 percent of
the male workforce, are in agriculture, and 29 percent work in
service industries.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture and services are vitally important for the
prosperity of people all over the world," said the WTO head. "Both
sectors are already going through fundamental reform and
liberalization under the WTO, and the launch of the new
negotiations will provide WTO member governments with the
opportunity to thrash out their differences and continue with the
reforms in a way that best serves their priorities and their
interests."
</P>
<P>
Moore admitted that the talks would no doubt continue to be
difficult in the coming years as they were in the past. But he
said that he is confident that WTO members will reach important
agreements as they did six years ago in the Uruguay round.
</P>
<P>
Many of the topics discussed Monday remain on the table
following failure to reach agreement at the WTO's ministerial
conference in Seattle from November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's ruling General Council will meet again Tuesday to
discuss issues like the follow-up to the Seattle ministerial
conference, five-year review of the exemption provided under GATT
1994, and election of the chairperson of the General Council
itself.

<HEADLINE> Continuity IRA Claims Responsibility for Hotel Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Continuity IRA, a republican
splinter group, formally claimed responsibility Monday for a hotel
bombing in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it would continue its "war effort" until
Britain agreed to end its rule of the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast at a hotel in Irvinestown Sunday night was a
further blow to the province's endangered peace process. Police
evacuated 80 people from the hotel and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The Continuity IRA is a small group of republican militants who
believe the peace process will entrench British rule rather than
lead to their goal of an all-Ireland republic.
</P>
<P>
In a statement phoned to The Impartial Reporter weekly
newspaper in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, it said "the Fermanagh
Brigade of the Continuity IRA claims responsibility" for a bomb
attack at a hotel in the nearby town of Irvinestown and a hoax
warning at another hotel.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to continue to progress our war effort regardless of
how British rule in the six occupied counties (Northern Ireland)
is remodeled," the organization said.
</P>
<P>
"This progression shall continue until such time as there is a
British declaration of intent to withdraw."

LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets all
lost ground Monday as a weak open on Wall Street and wider equity
market weakness intensified selling pressure on key telecom and
financial shares.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 closed down 66 points at 6,118.60, its lowest
since October 27, as utility and cyclical stocks suffered the
sharpest falls.
</P>

The FTSE Eurotop 300, a broader index of the largest European
stocks, ended 0.7 percent lower at 1,539.11, with its telecom
segment losing 2.2 percent and chemical shares off 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy shares were the biggest decliners amid uncertainty over
the regulatory regime. British Energy challenged a ruling by the
industry regulator that would widen the scope of the regulatory
body's powers.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Power was worst hit as its shares fell almost 9
percent. Powergen fell 7 percent and National Power lost 4.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Increases U.N. Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Monday voted unanimously to expand the U.N. peace-keeping
mission in Sierra Leone, known as the UNAMSIL, and extend the
mission's mandate for another six months to help the Sierrra
Leonean government to push forward the peace process in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at the end of the meeting, the
Security Council said that the UNAMSIL shall be expended to a
maximum of 11,100 military personnel, including the 260 military
observers already deployed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mandate of the UNAMSIL shall be extended for a
period of six months as of Monday, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also authorizes the increases in the
civil affairs, civilian police, administrative and technical
personnel of the UNAMSIL proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in his January 11 report to the 15-nation body, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed the importance of "a smooth transition"
between West African peace-keepers, called the ECOMOG, and the U.N.
peace-keeping force for the successful implementation of the Peace
Agreement and the stability of Sierra Leone, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting, Shen Guofang, the acting Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council
that China supported the expansion of the UNAMSIL. He stressed the
importance of an early implementation of the resolution and an
early completion of the smooth transition between the UNAMSIL and
the ECOMOG, which will be withdrawn from the West African nation
after its great effort to help the government to maintain the
stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
But Shen said that despite the fundamental implementation of
the Peace Agreement, there are lot of uncertainties in Sierra
Leone, and the situation there remains fragile.
</P>
<P>
The civil war broke out in 1991 in Sierra Leone and in its
later stages pitted the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the
former rebel movement and now represented in the government after
the Peace Agreement was signed in Lome, Togo, in July 1999, and
renegade soldiers against the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG is now withdrawing, and a 10,000-strong UNAMSIL will
police the peace process. It is deploying soldiers to key mining
areas still controlled by former rebels.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Campaign Against Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops blocked
two villages at the Argun gorge in Chechnya as clean-up operations
continued Monday in Grozny and other areas liberated from rebels
of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
Rebel units trying to break away to the west of Grozny, the
Chechen capital, have been encircled near the village of Samashki,
the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a source with the
united federal command.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas are bracing themselves for a lengthy resistance
in the Argun gorge, building defenses and attacking federal
positions on strategically important heights, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops unleashed aerial and artillery strikes on rebel
positions, killing some 300 militants in the past two days near
the villages of Katyr-Yurt and Shaami-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
In Grozny, federal troops and pro-government Chechen militia
units are repeating mop-up operations in the Zavodskoi and
Chernorechye suburbs to root out rebels disguised as civilians.
</P>
<P>
As the federal campaign against rebels moved ahead, more
refugees are returning to their homes. Over 102,000 people have
returned to Chechnya, Interfax reported, citing the press service
of the Emergency Situations Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Protest Rally Staged Outside Austrian Embassy in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Coalition of the Left
and Progress and its youth wing staged late Monday a rally outside
the Austrian Embassy in Athens to protest the participation of the
extreme-right Freedom Party, led by Joerg Haider, in Austria's new
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Shouting slogans such as "Stop fascism in Europe," the
demonstrators stressed that the European Union's progressive
citizens would again find themselves in the front line of the anti-
fascist struggle and the victory of the concepts of democracy,
equality and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Michalis Papayiannakis, a Euro deputy of the Greek coalition,
said the reappearance of the right-wing totalitarianism in Europe
was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Greek government Monday made it
clear that governments of European Union (EU) countries should
respect in practice the principles and values which led to the
creation of the union.
</P>
<P>
"We have stated from the start that the governments of EU
countries should respect, at the level of practice and not the
level of words alone, the principles and values which led to the
creation of the EU," Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
stressed at a press briefing.

<HEADLINE> UN Pledges $1.1 Million Aid to Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) has pledged 1.1 million U.S.
dollars to help Ghana boost its industrial competitiveness, a
Ghanaian official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Trade and Industry Dan Abodakpi said the
souring price of crude oil and plummeting price of cocoa and gold
pose serious threats to the west African country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Abodakpi was speaking at the presentation of Government of
Ghana/UNIDO Integrated Program to donors and development partners.
</P>
<P>
The program is a collaborative effort between the government,
UNIDO and the private sector to revitalize the industrial sector
for growth and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the program is about seven million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Abodakpi said UNIDO has pledged to contribute 1.1 million
dollars in support of the program.
</P>
<P>
Abodakpi called on donors to grant concessionary credits to be
used to give leverage to investment activity in the country,
particularly agro- processing and value added production.
</P>
<P>
He said this should go hand-in-hand with the granting of
greater access to markets of developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Turabi Slams Bashir's Declaring of State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Dismissed Sudanese Parliament
Speaker Hassan al Turabi has lashed out at President Omar el-
Bashir's decision to declare a three-month state of emergency and
dissolve the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of state of emergency was a trick to expel my
supporters from the government," the Political Street daily on
Monday quoted Turabi as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I will lay all cards on the table at the Holy Quran University
on Wednesday," Turabi said, referring to a speech to be delivered
at the university before a public rally.
</P>
<P>
Turabi was considered the ideologue of the ruling National
Congress Party, of which he is the powerful secretary general.
Bashir holds the ceremonial post of party chairman.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-emptive move to stop Turabi's attempt to curb
presidential power, Bashir declare a state of emergency and
dissolve the parliament on December 12.
</P>
<P>
In his first appearance since the imposition of the state of
emergency, Turabi told a public rally at the Khartoum University on
Sunday that the government was fully responsible for the
resignation of Riefk Mashar Teny-Dhurgon, chief of the Coordination
Council of Southern Province Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Turabi said that Sudan was under some pressure from the north,
hinting at Egypt that did not favour a national referendum on self-
determination for southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan was torn by a 16-year-long civil war during which the
rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army has been fighting the
government for an independent state in the mainly Christian and
animist south.
</P>
<P>
Turabi also expressed pessimism over the role played by the
Advisory Council of the ruling party in healing the rift between
him and Bashir which triggered a government crisis last December.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests against Iraq over MKO Mortar Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday lodged a strong
protest against Iraq over Saturday's mortar attacks by the outlawed
Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on Iranian government buildings
in the capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi charge d'affaires to Tehran Abd al-Satar al-Ravi was
summoned to the Foreign Ministry to receive a protest note, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the note, Iran accused the Iraqi government of breaching
international norms and the U.N. Charter by hosting the MKO members
in its territory and allowing them to launch military attacks on
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The note warned that the Iraqi government should bear the
consequences of these actions and Tehran reserves the right to take
actions to preserves its legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ravi said that he would convey Iran's stance to his
government in order to seriously follow up the issue.
</P>
<P>
MKO members fired seven mortar shells into an area close to the
Iranian government buildings, including the office of the supreme
leader, the presidential office and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that three of the mortar shells exploded near the
office of Hashemi Rafsanjani, former president and current chairman
of the powerful advisory State Expediency Council.
</P>
<P>
At least one person was killed and five others injured in the
attack, but no government officials were hurt.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place as Iran's rival political factions were
engaged in white-hot campaigns in the run-up to the February 18
parliamentary elections, a hyper-sensitive event that could change
the country's power distribution.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO claimed responsibility for the attack. Once
an active political and military group fighting against the former
shah regime, MKO was announced illegal in 1981 as its wranglings
with the ruling clergy flared up.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, MKO launched a slew of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country. Iran retaliated
by air-raiding MKO bases near Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Phone Service Active Linking Greek and Turkish Parts in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Telephone is playing an
increasingly active role in linking the two Cypriot communities in
Cyprus, according to a report issued on Monday by the U.N.
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
In 1999 a total of 354,647 completed calls were made between the
two communities on the island, with 228,663 calls from the Greek
Cypriot area in the south to the northern Turkish Cypriot area and
125,984 visa versa.
</P>
<P>
The number of calls increased from 17,607 in January to a peak
of 44,652 in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the increasing use of the telephone link, possible
expansion of the system's capacity is under consideration," UNFICYP
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus introduced the automated telephone service on May 26,
1998 and a total of 126,536 calls were made between June and
December that year.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the launch of the service, operator assisted calling
averaged about 100,000 calls per year.
</P>
<P>
The switching equipment, with a capacity of making 20 calls
simultaneously, is located at UNFICYP headquarters in Nicosia,
where the lines are automatically connected.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force in Cyprus was established in 1964
and more than 1,200 peacekeepers are patrolling the 180-kilometer
dividing line across the island country.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Terms Talks with Syrian Counterpart Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa described his talks with Syrian counterpart
Faruk Shareh as "fruitful and positive."
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters after the talks, held here on Monday, that
their discussions focused on the developments of the Middle East
peace process on the Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese tracks as
well as Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
There was a state of mistrust and stagnation on the Syrian track
of peace making and a state of hesitation on the Palestinian track,
said Moussa, who arrived here earlier in the day on a brief visit.
The third round of Syrian-Israeli talks, originally slated for
January 19, had been postponed indefinitely after Israel turned
down a Syrian request for a complete withdrawal from the Golan
Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian-Israeli final status talks failed to
make any significant progress so far.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa said his optimism over the peace process was
still there.
</P>
<P>
"I have talked about it with Shareh and with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat yesterday and there is a general feeling of this sort
among all of us," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the results of the recent talks between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, he said "It is
natural that we convey to the Syrian side our impressions on the
talks and try to revive the Syrian track."
</P>
<P>
And "we hope to activate the positive aspects but this needs
major changes in the Israeli peace policy."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Moussa conveyed a message from President Hosni
Mubarak to Syrian President Hafez al Assad on the peace process.
The content was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal for holding an Arab summit, Moussa said "We are
talking of Arab consultation and coordination as much as we are
talking of an Arab summit that we hope will be finally
materialized."
</P>
<P>
"Until the summit is held there must be a continuous Arab
coordination in the face of the reality of the Israeli peace policy
on the various tracks of talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been a key mediator in the negotiations between the Jewish
state and other Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Over 300 Billion Dollars in Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday proposed a 305.4-billion-U.S.-dollar national defense
budget, up 14.4 billion dollars from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget proposal for fiscal 2001, which begins on
October 1, would authorize 291.1 billion dollars for the Defense
Department, and most of the remaining 14.3 billion dollars would
go for the Energy Department's nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
This would be the second increase in U.S. military spending
since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Pentagon is expected to spend 60 billion dollars for
new weapons and equipment to help modernize the force -- a
procurement level its planners had been hoping to reach for years.
The money represents a one-third increase over 1998 spending.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposes a 3.7 percent military pay raise, increased
health benefits and 5 billion dollars in additional housing
subsidies for military personnel living off base.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks 2.2 billion dollars in the 2001 budget for the
National Missile Defense (NMD) system to "defend all 50 states
against limited ballistic missile attack." An additional 2.6
billion dollars is sought for other missile programs.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo are fully funded,
with 2.2 billion dollars in the 2001 budget and a request for 2
billion dollars to cover expenses in the current year.
</P>
<P>
The budget provides for several advanced aircraft, including
the F-22 fighter and the V-22 tilt-rotor plane. For the Navy, it
includes building DDG-51 destroyers, a new attack submarine and
the final Nimitz-class aircraft carrier -- the most expensive
single piece of equipment in the budget at over 4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hijackers Release 3 More Hostages in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Hijackers of the Afghan airliner
Monday afternoon released three more hostages, bringing the number
of passengers freed at London's Stansted airport to eight.
</P>
<P>
The latest release came as negotiations reached what police
said was a critical stage.
</P>
<P>
It leaves 157 passengers and crew on the plane.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, two men, a woman and two children were allowed
off the jet.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from Britain's special forces are believed to be at
the airport, keeping a close watch on the tense situation.
</P>
<P>
Supplies of food, drink and medicines have been delivered to
those being held captive.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 was hijacked Sunday by at least six armed men
during an internal flight in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Hijackers are believed to be demanding the release of an
opposition leader, Ismail Khan, held by the Taleban authorities.
</P>
<P>
But Taleban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar said in the Afghanistan
capital of Kabul that they will not give in. He said that while
the British authorities were free to negotiate with the hijackers,
the Taleban itself would not give in to any of their demands.
</P>
<P>
The Ariana plane touched down at Stansted shortly following
0200 GMT, after flying from Moscow, where it had spent four hours
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
At Stansted, the plane is sitting in a secure area to the north
of the airport, about half a mile away from the main terminals.
</P>
<P>
It had been on an internal Afghan flight Sunday from Kabul to
the city of Mazar-e-Sharif. But, after being seized, it landed
twice in Central Asia, where at least 10 passengers, including
women and children, were released, and the plane was refueled.
</P>
<P>
Akhtar Mohammad Mansoor, the Taleban's minister for civil
aviation and tourism, said the UK authorities should end the
hijack by storming the plane.
</P>
<P>
"They can do it as they have past experience. They can separate
the crew and the passengers and bring the hijackers to their knees.
If not, then they should allow us to do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mansoor said the Taleban did not know who the hijackers were,
or their demands, and said it would not negotiate with the
hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Stansted, which has been the scene of several similar incidents
in the past, has well-rehearsed procedures for dealing with hijack
situations.
</P>
<P>
British police said it was still too early to be optimistic on
the situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon to talk about any demands. The policing
priority is the safe release of everybody on board the craft.
Lives are at risk here," said Charles Clark, deputy chief
constable of Essex who is in charge of the case.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes More Spending in New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday send Congress a 1.835 trillion dollar budget that would use
much of budget surpluses on new government programs.
</P>
<P>
The budget includes a major expansion of health care while
promising to eliminate the publicly held debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
"This budget upholds my policy of fiscal discipline and
promises new opportunity for our nation," Clinton said in his last
budget message to the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton offered what he called his fourth straight balanced
budget for fiscal year 2001, which begins next Oct. 1. The 1.835
trillion dollars set a spending request record, but the White
House said it was the smallest as a share of the economy in 34
years.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton envisioned a 184 billion dollar surplus, 160
billion dollars of that from the Social Security retirement system.
He proposed using the Social Security surplus toward paying off
the federal debt by 2013, and using the interest savings on the
debt to extend the solvency of Social Security until 2050.
</P>
<P>
Clinton laid out his plans for spending what he projects will
be 746 billion dollars in budget surpluses not generated by the
Social Security program. Both the Democrats and Republicans have
pledged to use the 2.2 trillion dollars in Social Security
surpluses to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides differ drastically on the non-Social Security
surpluses with Clinton pushing to reserve nearly half the 746
billion dollar projection for additional debt reduction. The
document will serve to set the debate over the size and scope of
government for this year's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Much of the new spending would give Clinton a policy legacy
extending far beyond the expiration of his term next January.
</P>
<P>
The new budget request includes numerous new spending programs,
including a prescription-drug insurance plan for Medicare patients,
subsidies for retirement savings and rent subsidies for low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also proposed a 305.4 billion dollar defense budget, up
14.4 billion dollars from the previous year and the second
increase in U.S. military spending since the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The White House portrayed the budget as responsible and
realistic in an era of surpluses that it projects at 2.9 trillion
dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 167 billion dollar surplus it projected Monday for fiscal
2000, which ends Sept. 30, would be the third consecutive annual
surplus.
</P>
<P>
In 2001 budget, spending request is 4 percent higher than the 1.
765 trillion dollars Clinton sought last year, significantly more
than his projected inflation rate. It forecasts revenues of 2.019
trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But government spending as a share of the economy would fall to
18.3 percent in 2001, which is down from 18.7 percent in 2000 and
the lowest figure since 1966, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
It foresees U.S. economic growth of about 2.6 percent in 2001,
down from 4 percent in 1999. Growth would moderate further to 2.5
percent for the following couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The White House projected a consumer price inflation rate of 2.
5 percent in 2001, edging up to 2.6 percent afterward. The
unemployment rate was projected to grow from a 30-year low of 4.0
percent in January to 4.5 percent in 2001, 5 percent in 2002 and 5.
2 percent after that.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's budget projects the Social Security system will
generate 2.2 trillion dollars in surpluses over the next 10 years,
and the rest of the budget will generate 746 billion dollars in
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The president would pour 432 billion dollars over 10 years into
the Medicare system. Some 299 billion dollars of the anticipated
budget surpluses over the period would go to extending the
financial health of the system to 2025.
</P>
<P>
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that
the non-Social Security surplus could reach 1.9 trillion dollars
over 10 years if spending were frozen -- thus giving Republicans
more room for tax cuts than Clinton sees. But the White House has
said a spending freeze is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
In his budget, Clinton proposed to cut tax by 350 billion
dollars over 10 years, largely for low and middle income Americans.
To defray the cost, he would raise other levies by 100 billion
dollars, including a 25-cent-a-pack boost in cigarette taxes.

People think the current list is definitive, but "this is just
the tip of iceberg," he said.

<P>
Canada has some 70,000 known species, with another estimated 70,
000 yet undiscovered, according to the COSEWIC.
</P>
<P>
Only 500 species have been assessed as a result of the
biological bottleneck caused by critical shortage of money and
manpower, the agency said, urging more funding from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
The Species at Risk Act of the country also warned last
December, "While science predicts that species will disappear due
to natural causes at a rate of about one every 1,000 years, in
recent years species have been disappearing much more rapidly."
</P>
<P>
Of the 340 species listed in Canada, 12 are extinct, 15 are
extinct in the wild, 87 are endangered, 75 are threatened and 151
are vulnerable.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Turkey to Show Goodwill Gestures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday called on Turkey
to show goodwill gestures for the further improvement of relations
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigoris Niotis when he was addressing a business forum in the
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Greece had taken its goodwill steps and now it was time for the
neighboring country to show that it truly wanted to see before its
European prospect, following a course which was in step with peace,
peaceful dialogue, cooperation and the development of friendship,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced satisfaction with the current dialogue between the
two countries, saying that such a dialogue was developing at a
steady rate and both countries had achieved all they had predicted.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for the two countries to work
together substantively and decisively to find points of common
interest on the very important and major issues between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their territorial dispute in the eastern Aegean Sea and
the Cyprus problem, but the two neighbors have since last June
taken some positive steps to improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
The latest positive development is that Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem paid last week an official three-day visit to
Greece, the first by a Turkish foreign minister in 40 years and a
return visit to his Greek counterpart, George Papandreou, who
visited Turkey late January.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also signed a total of nine agreements
in recent months for bilateral cooperation in a variety of sectors.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Warns Likely Oil Production Drop in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N official
on Iraq warned Monday that Iraq's production of oil was likely to
drop due to the lamentable state of its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council Monday morning,
Benon Sevan, executive director of the United Nations Office of
the Iraq Program, said that unless key items of oil industry
equipment were made available and commissioned within a short time,
Iraq's production of oil was likely to drop.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's oil industry continues to be in a lamentable state," he
told the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The independent experts contracted by the United Nations have
always noted that their predictions on Iraq's export capacity
depend on the timely arrival of spare parts and equipment. That is
not happening -- to date around 250 million U.S. dollars of oil
sector equipment has actually arrived in Iraq while 288 million
dollars worth remains on hold," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sevan urged the Security Council to increase the oil revenues
that Iraq could use to buy spare parts and equipment from 300
million dollars to 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution in early 1998 ,under
which Iraq is allowed to use 300 million dollars from the oil
revenues to import the urgently needed spare parts and equipment
for its oil industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Angolan armed rebels have
attacked a village in the south province of Cunene, killing 24
residents and injuring 31, official radio station RNA reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the 100-strong rebel group made the
raid on Sunday night upon the village of Santa Clara, on the
southern border with Namibia and 40 kilometers south of the
provincial capital of Ondjiva. Most dwellings in the village have
been looted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the massacre, the rapid-reacting groups of the Armed
Forces of Angola (FAA) and the National Police rushed to the site
and smashed the rebels. At this moment, the government troops are
still pursuing the rebels in flight.
</P>
<P>
All the victims are civilians, said RNA, adding that the
injured villagers are being treated in a Namibian hospital.
</P>
<P>
The village of Santa Clara is considered as an important
trading post along the Angolan-Namibian frontier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the northwest province of Zaire, the government
officials and FAA officers held an emergency meeting at last
weekend, discussing the increasing rebel attacks against the
civilians in the province, including robbery and abduction.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Zambia Sign Protocol on Bridge Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Zambia signed here
on Monday a protocol for the construction of a bridge between the
two countries funded by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
"The new bridge at Chirundu will bring development to both our
economies in particular and the region in general. The bridge
will help ease traffic and reduce the man hours spent at the
border," Zambian Works and Supply Minister Godden Mandandi said.
</P>
<P>
"It forms a vital link connecting the Beira Corridor and South
African ports through Zimbabwe and Zambia to other countries to
the north. The movement of the public in either direction is also
going to be facilitated," Zimbabwean Transport and Energy Minister
Enos Chikowore said.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic benefits would be immense as the existing
Otto Beit Bridge between the two countries, which was opened to
traffic 39 years ago, could no longer cope with the increased
traffic.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Hiromu Nitta said the Japanese
government has decided to extend a grant of 29.5 million U.S.
dollars to the Zimbabwean and Zambian governments for the actual
construction of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was expected to be completed by the end of 2003
while all border facilities are expected to be in place by 2010.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's First Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya said here
Monday that ties, especially economic ties, between Uganda and
China are being strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting a china production and food processing project
aided with Chinese fund, the senior Ugandan official hailed it as
a model of economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The products to be manufactured would not only be sold in
Uganda, but find their way to foreign countries. So it would
surely boost Uganda's economic development in the long run, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda would never forget the generous aid China has extended
to his country over the past decades, he said, adding that the
bilateral ties would be further strengthened with the growth of
bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Volume of bilateral trades now stands at over 10 million U.S.
dollars, a big step forward than a few years ago, Kategaya said.

<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of unemployed
Zimbabweans are to benefit from the Small Enterprises Development
Corporation (Sedco) micro- finance scheme this year, an official
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sedco General Manager Joseph Nyamunda told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that about 15 million Zimbabwean dollars (400,000 U.S.
dollars) would be used as expansion or working capital in small
business ventures such as crocheting, vegetable growing and flea
market vending.
</P>
<P>
"We are not concerned much about the type of business. What we
need most are people who have viable projects and lack the
financial resources to implement ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the lending policy of the scheme had been slightly
changed to give more priority to youths and women groups.
</P>
<P>
An individual was allowed to borrow a maximum of 5,000
Zimbabwean dollars (131 U.S. dollars) while a group could receive
a maximum of 10,000 Zimbabwean dollars (262 U.S. dollars) per
individual.
</P>
<P>
Sedco was set up in 1983 as a finance lending institute whose
mandate was to assist the development of small and medium
enterprises by offering training and financial assistance.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi met with the delegation of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Monday at State House in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Press Service (PPS) said that Moi had lengthy
talks with the IMF officials over renewed lending to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team, which is on a fact-finding mission for the past
two weeks, is looking into Kenya's balance of payments position,
monetary policy and governance.
</P>
<P>
The PPS noted that the mission was happy with the fiscal and
monetary developments in Kenya and also appreciated President
Moi's initiative in the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moi urged the mission to accelerate its discussions with Kenyan
 officials so that his country's economy could grow at a faster
rate to reduce poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials will review their finding in Washington,
which could lead to further talks in Nairobi in March before any
conclusive agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan to Kenya in
July 1997, citing poor governance and corruption.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Cultivate Strong Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We must not forget our past as we embrace the future. We must
continue to cultivate our roots through knowledge of our mother
tongues, our traditions and the heritage which we hold dear," Tan
Keng Yam said while addressing the Sembawang Chinese New Year
celebration this evening.
</P>
<P>
Reconsign that Singaporeans, particularly younger Singaporeans,
should be encouraged to strike out on their own to realize their
dreams and aspirations instead of being stifled, Tan said "the
emphasis on individualism which we see in the U.S. cannot work in
Singapore".
</P>
<P>
Tan said Singaporeans must not lose the reliable guideposts
guiding their way in life, the value standing them in good stead
and the sense as a people.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remember that we are Asian people and that we have
strong roots in civilizations which are thousands of years old,"
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"If we forget these strong roots, our people, in particular
our children, will not have the self-confidence and moral strength
to be able to judge wisely and to do the right things when they
face difficult circumstances," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that three big challenges face Singapore in the
coming years: how to embrace the future without forgetting the
past, how to ensure the society remains cohesive and united and
how to build a modern, sophisticated, open, competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
Tan also said that the multi-faceted and more complex
challenges in the 21st century can not be overcome in the same way
as in the past when the government identified the confronting
challenges, proposed the solution and then rallied the people to
support the implementation measures.
</P>
<P>
"To try and overcome the challenges by issuing a set of
government directives is to court failure," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The government should continue to set the direction and the
overall framework but, increasingly, national initiatives and
policies will be influenced, shaped and modified through a process
of consultation, discussion and dialogue with the people,"
concluded.

<HEADLINE> S. African Gold Producers Adopt Wait-and-See Attitude on Hedging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South African gold
producers on Monday welcomed Canadian gold producer Placer Dome's
decision to suspend hedging but adopted a wait-and-see attitude
before deciding whether to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"It looks good. I am hoping for a quite a lot higher gold
price," said Chris Thompson, chairman of Gold Fields, the second
largest gold producer in the world. Thompson last week criticized
gold producers for the size of their hedge books.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the gold price to reach 350 dollars an
ounce.
</P>
<P>
Thompson told the press here that he was especially encouraged
to see that Australian producers had not used bullion's strength
to expand their hedging activities.
</P>
<P>
"They have tended to jump on every rise (as an opportunity to
hedge), but this time they haven't and that's very encouraging,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Placer Dome said on Friday that it had suspended its gold
hedging activities on expectations of improving market sentiment
and reduced hedging by other gold producers. Another Canadian
producer, Barrick Gold Corp, is expected to announce similar
plans.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Gold Fields would use the current stronger gold
prices to close out its remaining hedges, Thompson said: "No, I
don't think so."
</P>
<P>
 The group wound up some 1.6 million ounces of forward
production at a cost of 8 million US dollars during the quarter
ended September 30 last year, but its Beatrix mine in Free State
province southwest of Johannesburg holds some 600,000 call
options. These were in the money by some 12 million rand (6
million dollars) on a mark-to-market basis last week, when the
gold price was around $285 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
The group also has about 200,000 ounces of forward sales
commitments at its Tarkwa gold project in Ghana, but this is
called for by banks that are providing finance for the project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Ashworth, finance director at the Randgold
group, emphasized that his company did not hedge for speculative
or earnings enhancing purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude to hedging is that we will never willingly or
voluntarily hedge. The only reason we are in the business of
hedging is to secure project finance for our Syama and Morila
mines in Mali as requested by the banks that stand behind the
projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our hedges are only for the period of the loans." a spokesman
of Avgold, another gold producer, said. Avgold has hedged 49
percent of the next 42 months of its gold production.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said no decision had been taken yet on whether
or not to review its forward sales contracts.
</P>
<P>
"We are digesting the whole thing at present," he said. "We
don't have all the details of the Placer Dome announcement and
are looking into the matter. No formal decision has been made as
yet."
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Anglogold, the biggest gold producer in the
world, and Western Areas Ltd, which jointly runs the South Deep
mine (formerly known as Western Areas) with Placer Dome, were not
immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
On the spot market, bullion was last trading at 313.50 to
316.50 dollars an ounce after closing at 310.30 dollars an ounce
in New York on Friday after the Placer Dome news.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches Strategy for Jobs in Knowledge Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), launched an ambitious
new strategy on Monday to promote job creation and skills for the
new knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the new strategy is designed to overcome
the gap with the United States in access to the Internet and the
use of information and communication technology.
</P>
<P>
Network access rate in Europe today is much lower than that in
the U.S., and at the same time, Internet users are mainly
restricted to higher income groups, to men and geographically in
northern part of Europe, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
In its strategy report, the commission sets out 18 specific
recommendations in four main areas: learning, work, public
services and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for linking all schools to the Internet by
2002 while ensuring that all the teachers are competent in
information society skills, all workers have the opportunity to
achieve the key new skill of information society and that flexible
frameworks are established for tele-working to meet the new needs
of business and employment.
</P>
<P>
Calling for concerted action across Europe, EU Commissioner for
Employment Anna Diamantopoulou said the goal of the 15-nation
union is to build an inclusive knowledge-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only route to create jobs and growth in Europe in
coming years. If we can combine competitiveness and cohesion in
the new knowledge economy, Europe will act as a model to the world,
" said Diamantopoulou.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also pointed out that the next generation of
the work force - the "net generation" - is in school today.
</P>
<P>
"Our actions today in equipping this generation and in grasping
the challenges and opportunities of the knowledge society are
vital to our future economic and social development," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I call on European governments - and the social partners - to
take on board the recommendations put forward by the European
Commission today," Diamantopoulou added.

PARIS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will meet an Indian envoy who is in Paris for a session of
strategic dialogue with France, French officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Brajesh Mishra, advisor to Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee, is leading an Indian government delegation for the
fourth session of the Franco-Indian Strategic Dialogue, which was
launched in January 1998 by Chirac when he visited India.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mishra held talks with Gerard Errera, who is both
the personal representative of Chirac and representative of the
government. Mishra will also hold talks with Defense Minister
Alain Richard.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's initiative for regular strategic dialogue with India
was followed up by visits to Paris by Vajpayee and Indian Defense
Minister George Fernandes last year.
</P>
<P>
Both Vajpayee and Fernandes called for "very close"
consultations with France over defense issues after France
expressed its "understanding" with India's nuclear tests in May
1998.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Richard also expressed satisfaction over the
achievement made in analyzing regional strategic situation and
promoting cooperation between France and India.

NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. drug-maker Pfizer Inc.
announced here Monday that it is acquiring Warner-Lambert Co. for
90 billion U.S. dollars in stock, creating the second largest
pharmaceutical company in the world.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition ended a three-month battle of takeover. The
deal will close in four to six months.
</P>
<P>
The medicine chest of the combined company includes impotence
treatment Viagra and the blockbuster cholesterol fighting drug
Lipitor. The newly merged company will have an annual revenue of
28 billion dollars, including 21 billion dollars from prescription
drug sales.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer offered a hostile bid for Warner-Lambert last November
after Warner-Lambert announced a 58.3-billion-dollar merger with
American Home Products Corp. Now Pfizer will pay American Home
Products 1.8 billion dollars for the breakup.
</P>
<P>
The combined company will keep Pfizer's name and headquarters
in New York. Pfizer is expected to cut hundreds of jobs from the
combined work force of 87,400 as the two companies unite their
sales and research teams as well as consolidate administration
jobs.

<HEADLINE> EU Imposes Anti-Dumping Duties on Iron and Steel Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
decided on Monday to impose definitive anti-dumping and anti-
subsidy measures on the imports of hot-rolled coil iron and non-
alloyed steel from Bulgaria, India, Yugoslavia, South Africa and
the Taiwan region.
</P>
<P>
The measures consist of both classical anti-dumping and anti-
subsidy duties and price undertakings guaranteeing a minimum price
below which the classical duties will apply.
</P>
<P>
The level of the duties proposed ranges from 2.1 percent to 37.
8 percent, said the commission, which is the executive body of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping duties imposed are 7.5 percent for Bulgaria,
9 percent for India, 15.4 percent for Yugoslavia, 24.9 percent for
Taiwan and 37.8 percent for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, duties as low as 2.1 percent have been set for
individual companies which cooperated with the commission's anti-
dumping investigations in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that undertakings from one exporting
producer in South Africa, the sole exporting producer in Bulgaria
and two exporting producers in India have been accepted.
</P>
<P>
Anti-dumping proceedings against Iran were terminated because
the commission concluded that imports from Iran were negligible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anti-subsidy duties of 13.1 percent are imposed on
Indian exports and 4.4 percent on those from Taiwan. Anti-subsidy
proceedings against South Africa were terminated because subsidies
there were found below the minimum threshold, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Exports from the above five countries and regions concerned by
both proceedings accounted for around 11 percent of the European
Union market in 1998, which was 696 million euros (some 730
million U.S. dollars) in value.

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of the DA Edgardo Angara said the DA will start
implementing the distribution of certified seeds, the repair of
damaged irrigation systems, the construction of post-harvest
facilities and the rationalization of research and development
efforts of the department.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four priority programs of the DA, Angara
also noted the department will promote technology transfer to
revitalize the agriculture and fisheries sector and maximize
credit facilities for agriculture and fisheries enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The six-pronged program of the department is aimed at making
Philippine agriculture and fisheries not just competitive and
productive, but also world class, able to service and excel in the
global economic arena," Angara said.
</P>
<P>
In rice, for example, Angara said the DA is targeting an
increased use of certified seeds from the current 15 percent to 20
percent before the year ends. "The use of certified seeds will
assure an increase in yields," he said.
</P>
<P>
The DA is also promoting various financing schemes to provide
appropriate post-harvest equipment to reduce post-harvest losses,
which amount to 15 percent for grains and 20 to 40 percent for
perishables such as high-value crops and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Angara said ensuing the smooth implementation of these
priorities would enable the Philippine agriculture to sustain is
impressive growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country's agricultural output expanded by 6.49 percent in
1999,overshooting the 6 percent growth target and almost wiping
out the 7.18 percent production drop recorded in the El Nino and
La Nina-stricken year of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Over 100,000 Poor Filipino Students Get Jobs in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that over 100,000 Filipino students belonging to poor
families were given jobs by the government under several special
employment programs implemented in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said
it has provided jobs to 100,924 poor students nationwide in 1999,
under its Special Program for the Emplyment of Students.
</P>
<P>
DOLE Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma noted in the report that
another batch of 14,017 poor students were also given jobs through
the Work Appreciation Program.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said the DOLE has also provided sizeable job
placements for workers under special programs assisting the
disadvantaged sectors in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE also made use of the Internet to post some 17,571
vacancies in cyberspace, bridging the gap between job seekers and
potential employers, said Laguesma.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by the DOLE's Bureau of Labor and
Employment Statistics said 418,705 people were provided jobs in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said a bill institutionalizing the Public Employment
Service Offices (PESOs), which is expected to be signed into law
by President Joseph Estrada soon, would further boost the
effectiveness of the job placement programs of the DOLE.
</P>
<P>
He said that an additional 123 PESOs were established from
January to November last year, bringing to 1,851 the total number
of PESOs operated jointly nationwide by the labor department, in
cooperation with local government units and other agencies.

<HEADLINE> Five Hostages Released by Afghan Plane Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Hijackers of an Afghan passenger
plane Monday released five more hostages at Stansted airport north
of London as negotiations reach what police say "a critical stage".
</P>
<P>
Two men, a woman and two children have been allowed to leave
the jet as negotiators continue their dialogue with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
The number of people on board the Boeing 727 is now 160,
according to figures given by British police.
</P>
<P>
A huge security operation involving hundreds of police and
security officers has been put in place, as the standoff continues.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from Britain's special forces are also believed to be
at the airport, keeping a close watch on the tense situation.
</P>
<P>
Police experts are discussing deliveries of essential supplies
of food, drink, medicines to those still on board.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked on Sunday during an internal flight from
the Afghan capital, Kabul, to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 passengers were released on Sunday -- 10 in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, 10 in Moscow and three in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Pakistan, the hijackers, whose
identity remains unclear, are demanding the release of Ismail Khan,
a key opposition figure who has been in Taliban detention since
1997.
</P>
<P>
But in Afghanistan, the ruling Taliban movement said that while
the British authorities were free to negotiate with the hijackers,
the Taliban itself would not give in to any of their demands.
</P>
<P>
The plane owned by Afghan national carrier Ariana touched down
at Stansted shortly after 0200 GMT, after stopovers in Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
At Stansted, the plane is sitting in a secure area to the north
of the airport, about half a mile away from the main terminal.
</P>
<P>
British authorities earlier Monday vowed to negotiate an end to
the incident and threatened not to allow the plane to take off
again.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Dragons Rule, but What About Tigers? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- In this most auspicious
Golden Year of the Dragon, equally majestic creatures like tigers
are getting short shrift, and Wang Fenling is plenty miffed about
it.
</P>
<P>
At this lunar New Year season in China, dragon images are
everywhere: in people's homes, in public parks, in supermarkets,
on stage in the shape of costumed dancers, and floating through
the sky as kites, and Spring Festival good wishes are offered to
lucky dragon babies born across the country.
</P>
<P>
So who cares about tigers? Seventy-five-year-old Wang Fenling,
who is trying to change the new year's theme.
</P>
<P>
"People have forgotten the tiger, which has the same mystery
and power as the dragon in Chinese culture, but is becoming
extinct," said the professor of folk culture from Northeast Normal
University in Changchun.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to wake a sleeping dog, Wang published her book Research
on China's Tiger Culture on the eve of the lunar new year to
challenge superiority of the dragon, which is fictitious, urging
that more attention be given to the tiger, which is real.
</P>
<P>
Chinese have worshipped the tiger longer than the dragon, Wang
insists. Archaeologists have discovered some 8,000-year-old rock
painting depicting tigers, while the oldest artistic
representation of a dragon is just 6,000 years old, carved on a
clamshell during the Yangshao Culture of the Neolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are more idioms and daily expressions using
tiger as the key word, such as "a tiger's head and a snake's tail"
and "be saved from a tiger's mouth," as well as folk stories
telling of people who married benevolent tigers and loyal tigers
who guard the entrances of their masters' homes.
</P>
<P>
Rivaling the dragon, the tiger is regarded as another heavenly
god who takes an important seat in China's 12 years zodiac cycle.
But, to Wang's regret, it is the dragon that finally beats the
tiger hands down in the race for recognition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese regard themselves as the offspring of the dragon, and
for thousands of years, every emperor regarded himself as a "
dragon king" and their gowns were called "dragon robes."
</P>
<P>
That's not good news for the big cat, whose bones were soaked
in wine and pulverized to be used as traditional medicine for
curing rheumatism. To the Chinese, any man capable of killing a
tiger is a hero.
</P>
<P>
One of the most distinguished heroes in this regard was Emperor
Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty in the 18th century, who killed 350
tigers in his lifetime. His bravery has been the stuff of Chinese
writers and historians for generations.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the slaughter of the tiger has found its way into modern
day life, as the smuggling of tiger skins has become a profitable
trade in some areas. So far, the number of tigers in the wild in
China has shrunk to less than 100.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, major conflicts exist between human beings
and animals who compete for the planet's limited natural resources.
The tiger, the most powerful beast in populous Asia, thus wins as
much animosity as respect.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been many books on the dragon's glory, Wang
says her book is the only one that gives the true story of "tiger
culture."
</P>
<P>
She views her work as more than just an environmental analysis,
saying that an old and great nation like China should be more
tolerant and provide space for different creatures.
</P>
<P>
"Paying more attention to the tiger culture will enable us to
be more aware of an endangered species' right to survive," Wang
said.

the visit.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, both sides underscore the need for
stepping up bilateral trade which has gone down 1.50 billion U.S.
dollars to some 1 billion dollars annually after the economic
crisis hit Indonesia since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Not to Talk With Hijackers: Omar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban authorities of
Afghanistan will not negotiate with hijackers who have taken over
an Afghan Ariana airliner.
</P>
<P>
The stand was made clear by Taliban supreme leader Mulla Omar
in a letter to the British authorities. Taliban Ambassador to
Pakistan Maulvi Muhammad Haqqani today delivered the letter to the
British High Commission in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the Taliban government has always condemned terrorism
and, "we will neither negotiate with hijackers nor will accept
their demands."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the British government is free to hold talks
with the hijackers, "if they want to do so."
</P>
<P>
Omar blamed opposition commander Ahmed Shah Masood for the
hijacking of the Boeing plane with more than 160 passengers and
crew on board.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani told the local press that Taliban would try to secure
safe release of the passengers. He said the Taliban authorities
has contacted the authorities of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Russia
and now Britain to find ways to ensure the safety of the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
He saidd Taliban have not received any demand from the
hijackers formally.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said that investigations have been launched into the
hijacking of the plane. However, he said, so far the Taliban
authorities have not arrested anybody in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan airliner was hijacked on Sunday after it took off
from Kabul. It has arrived at an airport near London after making
stops at Tashkent of Uzbekistan and Moscow of Russia.

Lagos, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Nigerian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Tribune:
</P>
<P>

patrol of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, following the recent
increasing robbery attacks on motorists and commuters along the
road.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Twenty-four of Nigeria's 36 state governments have
advocated private investment to boost water supply in the country,
said a four-day seminar in Abuja last week.
</P>
<P>
New Nigerian:

<P>
-- Nigeria's Federal Government has set up an Education Sector
Analysis network monitoring committee in order to pursue the

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Unlikely to Accept EU Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Officials in Brussels and
Pretoria fear that there is little chance of South Africa
accepting the latest formula from the European Union (EU) for
resolving the dispute over the production and labelling of grappa
and ouzo spirits.
</P>
<P>
The formula, under which South Africa would agree to a
staggered phase- out of the two names, was resented to EU
ambassadors by the European Commission last week.
</P>
<P>
However, it had not been formally presented to the South
African side because Germany insisted that the proposal also cover
korn, a highly alcoholic German liquor.
</P>
<P>
The same formula was accepted for the two spirits of port and
sherry, but the South Africans have already made it clear that
they do not intend to phase out the new names -- even though South
Africa makes very little grappa and no ouzo at all, said an EU
official quoted by the South African Press Association on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Italy are opposed to South Africa labelling its
wines and spirits with grappa and ouzo which, Greece and Italy
claim, soly belong to Greek and Italian wines.
</P>
<P>
The dispute put on hold a trade agreement signed by South
Africa and the EU last year. If not for the Greek and Italian
opposition, the deal would have been put into effect in January 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which wants to strike a separate deal on grappa
and ouzo, has offered to involve prominent labelling of all non-EU
ouzo and grappa sold in South Africa to indicate its origin, but
Greece and Italy have refused the offer.
</P>
<P>
Unless there was an unexpected breakthrough this week, the
issue would go before the 15 EU foreign ministers meeting on
February 14.
</P>
<P>
However, it was becoming increasingly likely that a targeted
deal, concerning only ouzo and grappa, was not the way forward.
</P>
<P>
"What is most likely, and this was the formula both sides
agreed to in October, is that there will be an overall accord in
the framework of the separate EU-South Africa wines and spirits
agreement, the unidentified EU official said.

<HEADLINE> S.African Parliament to Adopt Anti-Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South African Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete said
on Monday at a news briefing at the Parliament that
prosecution-led and intelligence- driven investigations were key
elements in the fight against crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
"All prosecutions are being brought into line with the
national strategy around crime and crime prevention."
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions unit will direct its energies towards priority
crimes, including vehicle hijackings, syndicated drug and arms
dealing, transnational crimes, money laundering and corruption,
Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
"Cases are given priority according to clear guidelines, and the
 resources and services of several departments are being brought
together, where required, in a structured manner."
</P>
<P>
An improvement in intelligence-gathering methods and closer
cooperation between the intelligence arms of the state, the
police, Scorpions, and customs and immigration services would lead
to an improvement in investigations.

<HEADLINE> Five Hostages Released by Afghan Plane Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Five hostages have been released
from the hijacked Afghan airliner landed at Stansted Airport
outside London, leaving 160 people still on board the plane,
British police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The released were two men, one woman and two children.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth time hostages have been released since the
drama began on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ten people were released when the Boeing 727, which was on a
domestic flight from the Afghan capital of Kabul to the northern
city of Mazar-i-Sharaf, landed unexpectedly in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan, on Sunday. The plane was landed there for refueling.
</P>
<P>
It then landed at Aktyubinsk airport in northwestern Kazakhstan,
reportedly suffering from fuel leaks. Three more hostages were
allowed to leave the aircraft when the plane left Kazakhstan for
Moscow later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ten more people were released at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport.
The hijacked plane arrived at Stansted Airport at 0200 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Chief Constable John Broughton, one of the British
police officers in charge of this case, said negotiations between
police and the hijackers are still under way.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a very critical stage in our negotiations," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The exact number and identity of the hijackers are still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
British authorities earlier Monday vowed to negotiate an end to
the incident and threatened not to allow the plane to take off
again.

<P>
The IOC said in a statement released in Sarajevo that athletes
from all the territory would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
An IOC official said Bosnia-Herzegovina teams had competed at
the 1996 Atlanta Games and the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics but had
comprised athletes from Sarajevo and surrounding areas only.
</P>
<P>
"The launching of the Bosnia and Herzegovina potential Olympic
team formed with athletes from all the territory of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and supported with a special financial and technical
assistance of the IOC has been decided and will be implemented,"
the IOC said.
</P>
<P>
"This global process received today the formal signed support
of the three representatives of the Bosnia and Herzegovina
presidency. The selected 19 athletes have now the chance to

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Travelers at Haikou Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Spring Festival travelers helped
break records at Haikou's Meilan International Airport yesterday
when 299 aircraft carrying a total 40,000 passengers flew in or
out during the day.
</P>
<P>
The high figures of both flights and passengers are attributed
to the sharp rise in the number of tourists coming to this
southernmost province to spend their week-long holiday on sunny
beaches.
</P>
<P>
According to the airport administration, an additional 100
flights per day have been added to the schedule during the holiday
period, which runs from February 5-12.
</P>
<P>
The airport now handles 300 flights daily, carrying an average
30,000 passengers, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
This shows that more and more Chinese people are abandoning the
tradition of spending the lunar New Year at home with family, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Between January 21 to February 4, the airport handled an
average 157 aircraft and 13,000 passengers every day, up 50
percent compared to the days before the season, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- One Israeli soldier was killed and seven others were wounded
in a combined roadside bomb and mortar attack by Hezbollah
guerrillas Sunday in the western sector of the Israeli security
zone in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged to strike back at Hezbollah,
but stressed that he does not want to lose sight of his goal:
reaching agreements with Syria and Lebanon which will ultimately
ensure the peace and security of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Weapons shipments from Iran to Hezbollah, which pass through
Damascus, have been stepped up recently, apparently with the aim of
preparing Hezbollah for a spate of several weeks of intensive
fighting in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated pace of arms shipments would be impossible
without Damascus' authorization and blessing. Israel has not yet
succeeded in hitting these hiding places or in intercepting the
trucks carrying the arms and ammunition from Damascus to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The permanent peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians
were called off Sunday and it was unclear when they will resume,
officials in the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, following the unsuccessful meeting
last week between Barak and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat, the talks on all tracks, including those on interim
issues, have now ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The cabinet Sunday expressed "deep concern" over the
establishment of the new government in Austria with the
participation of Joerg Haider's ultra-nationalist Freedom Party,
but refrained from taking additional concrete action beyond
recalling the Israeli ambassador, who returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet communique warned against "such a grave phenomenon" of
a Western European government that includes neo-Nazi elements,
adding that the historical lesson of the Holocaust teaches that
such phenomena are unacceptable.

ANKARA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu said on Sunday
that Turkey wanted to play an important role and take on more
responsibilities in shaping the new European security concept.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Munich security conference in Germany, the
minister said that Turkey had from the very beginning of
discussions with regard to the European Security and Defense
Identity (ESDI) been welcoming the new concept but European Union
countries had been trying to exclude the country in the formation
of this entity.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish and Greek police carried out for the first time an
operation against drug smugglers jointly on Sunday, seizing four
kilograms of heroin in Istanbul and capturing three suspects in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
This move signalled that rapprochement between the two countries
has resulted in cooperations in the field of security.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- 70 percent of the Turkish factories that were damaged in the
earthquakes of last summer restarted production in full capacity in
the last six months.
</P>
<P>
New factories are being constructed in place of those totally
collapsed. The beams and columns are reinforced by concrete to
increase the stability of the factory buildings against
earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Not to Change Stand on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
not change the basic assumptions which have been used to work out
the draft state budget for fiscal year 2000, a senior official
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A basic change will affect the elements of the budget itself,
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo told legislators at the
parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Sudibyo said all assumptions that have been made by the
government in the draft state budget for the fiscal were
conservative.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the change of basic assumptions without strong
reasons should be avoided," the minister said in reaction to a
proposal of some major factions in the House of Representatives (
DPR) to make such a change.
</P>
<P>
On January 20, the government submitted to the DPR a draft of
the state budget for the fiscal year, which envisages a budget
deficit of 45.373 trillion rupiah (6.5 billion U.S.dollars) or 5
percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The macroeconomic indicators, used as basic assumptions in
drafting the budget, are an economic growth of 3.8 percent, an
inflation rate of 4.8 percent, a rupiah exchange rate of 7,000 per
U.S. dollar and a crude oil price of 18 dollars per barrel on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
But some factions in the DPR expressed the view last Thursday
that such assumptions were too optimistic and asked the government
to change them.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to pay more attention to
national security affairs to attract more foreign investors and
thus step up the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
However Sudibyo pledged that the government will create
security and political stability to realize the objectives set in
the draft budget.
</P>
<P>
"The government will also create macroeconomic stability,
accelerate the national banking restructuring program and speed up
the private sector's corporate debt restructuring program,"
Sudibyo added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Won't be Allowed to Continue its Journey: Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The position we adopt in this country is that we don't allow
them to take off again," Essex police Deputy Chief Constable
Charles Clark, who is in charge of the case, told a press
conference held at Stansted airport, north of London, where the
plane was parked.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators are continuing to talk to the hijackers while armed
police have surrounded the Boeing 727, which landed with 165
passengers and crew on board early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
No demands have been made public yet but the hijackers, thought
to be armed with grenades and pistols, are believed to want the
release of an Afghan opposition leader, Ismail Khan, held by the
ruling Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
To help make the passengers comfortable, the hijackers had
requested drinks and negotiators had agreed to deliver a generator
and allow some of the plane doors to be opened.
</P>
<P>
British armed police sealed off the area around the plane,
parked well away from Stansted's perimeter fence and main terminal
building.
</P>
<P>
Stansted was chosen because it is less congested than London's
main airport of Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
Police said they practised regularly for this type of event at
Stansted, which saw its last hijack four years ago after six
Iraqis seized an Airbus between Sudanese capital Khartoum and
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators secured the release of the crew and 197 passengers
that time.
</P>
<P>
But the Taliban urged Britain to end the hijack by force.
</P>
<P>
"Our demand from Britain is to sort out the issue by storming
the plane," a Reuters report quoted Akhtar Mohammad Mansoor,
Taliban minister for civil aviation and tourism, as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mansoor said Taliban did not know who the hijackers were and
denied the Taliban had received a demand for Khan's release.

<HEADLINE> UK Athletics to Name Two More Drug-taking Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is understood the British governing body for the sport are
following their traditional and discreet communications route by
informing all parties concerned before making any statement.
</P>
<P>
British sprinters Linford Christie and Doug Walker have already
fallen foul of the steroid, and their cases will shortly be heard
by the International Amateur Athletic Federation.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF ordered their own arbitration panel to carry out a
review after a UK Athletics disciplinary committee cleared them of
their offenses last year along with former international 400
meters hurdler Gary Cadogan.
</P>
<P>
The latest two offenders are understood not to be household
names.
</P>
<P>
But they will be afforded the same respect and confidentiality
given to Christie.
</P>
<P>
David Moorcroft, UK Athletics chief executive, said: "It is our
policy on doping matters neither to confirm nor deny any issues
until all of the appropriate parties have been informed."
</P>
<P>
Reports suggest in one of the latest alleged cases the athlete
had 700 nanogrammes per millimeter (ng/mm) of nandrolone in his
urine sample.
</P>
<P>
Only 2ng/mm is necessary to be discovered to have it announced
as a positive test, although normally - as a safety valve - an
accredited testing laboratory would want it to be higher.
</P>
<P>
If true this latest allegation could have far-reaching
consequences considering the raised eyebrows at the excessive
amount produced in Christie's sample after a meeting in Dortmund
12 months ago where the former Olympic 100m champion's reading was
100 times over the accepted level.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Sunday held a tete-a-tete
session of talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
The talks focused on the Israeli credibility regarding peace with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa inaugurated Sunday
evening the second meeting of the ministerial committee on
displaced Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The panel includes foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will last for four days.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Mubarak Sunday received the Greek chief of staff who is
currently visiting Egypt and discussed ways of enhancing military
cooperation between Cairo and Athens.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the recent rapprochement between Greece
and Turkey, he said the political leadership of his country was

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Soldier Killed, Seven Wounded in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
and seven were wounded Sunday in a combined roadside bomb and
mortar attack staged by Hezbollah guerrillas in South Lebanon,
Israel Radio announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was killed and four others were wounded by mortar
fire while they were evacuating three soldiers wounded by a
roadside bomb during a duty patrol, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The death was the fifth Israeli fatality in an Israeli-occupied
border zone in Lebanon in the past 10 days. Three Israeli soldiers
were killed there last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said during a visit to Jordan that
Hezbollah, which is fighting to oust Israeli troops from the
occupied zone, would "pay a heavy price" for any attack on Israeli
soldiers. He made the response before Israel officially announced
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Barak will convene the security cabinet later Monday to discuss
the Israeli reaction.
</P>
<P>
The latest flare-up in South Lebanon coincided with a new
impasse in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed last
December after a 45-month break. A scheduled round of talks was
postponed last month following a dispute over the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Israel has called on Damascus, regarded as the main power broker
in Lebanon, to restrain Hezbollah activities in south Lebanon in
order to create an environment for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak has kept a relatively restrained policy regarding the
mounting tension in Lebanon. Last week, his cabinet rejected an
army proposal to launch harsh response to Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
A local daily, Haaretz, said Monday that Barak wants to avoid
any escalation that could result in Hezbollah rocket attacks on
northern Israel and nullify the prospects of renewing negotiations
with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Sign Peace Treaty With Russia in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi pledged Monday that his government will work for concluding
a peace treaty with Russia by the end of this year and solving a
long-standing territorial row over a group of Russian-held islands
off Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a Tokyo convention seeking return of the islands,
Obuchi said Japan aims to sign the treaty with Russia based on
bilateral accords reached in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Tokyo Declaration called for concluding a peace treaty
after the territorial dispute has been resolved in accordance with
the basic principles of law and justice, while the 1997 accord
reached in Siberia's Krasnoyarsk set 2000 as the target year for
signing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation, Obuchi stressed that "steady progress in Japan-Russia
relations is a historical trend."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was Russian president when the two accords were signed.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also pointed out that acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin has said he will follow agreements that have been reached by
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Normalization of bilateral relations would contribute to peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific, the Japanese prime minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia have not yet signed a peace treaty due to the
decades-long territorial dispute over four islands, Etorofu,
Kunashiri and Shikotan and Habomai group of islets.

LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- London's Stansted airport has
been able to resume a limited service Monday following the arrival
of a hijacked Afghan plane earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The airport reopened for limited departures as negotiators
continued to talk with hijackers holding more than 160 passengers
aboard as hostages.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked jet was parked well away from the airport's
perimeter fence and main terminal building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British police confirmed that there were a total of
165 people on board the Boeing 727 plane from Afghanistan's
national carrier Ariana.

delivered for the 122 men, 20 women and 23 children on board the
aircraft, including 14 crew members as well as an unknown number
of hijackers.
</P>
<P>
A generator to provide power and air-conditioning has also been
delivered, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The plane is being held in a secluded spot on a runway at the
north of the airport, about two miles from the terminal.
</P>
<P>
It was hijacked early Sunday during an internal flight from
Kabul to the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The plane had stopped at Moscow and released some hostages
there before arriving in London.
</P>

and the hijackers, thought to be six men armed with pistols and
grenades.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Indonesia Reach No Accord on VAT: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- No agreement was reached
between Singapore and Indonesia in their latest negotiations on a
value added tax (VAT) to be imposed by Jakarta on investors
located in Batam, an Indonesian island within the Growth Triangle,
The Business Times here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said in its front-page report that the two sides have
been engaged in intense high-level negotiations over the past 10
days and Singapore is now pushing hard for Indonesia to exempt
investors located in Batam from paying the VAT which Jakarta will
implement for the island from April this year.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations between the Singapore Economic
Development Board (EDB) and the Batam Industrial Development
Authority and the Riau provincial government of Indonesia, EDB
wanted Jakarta to honor an agreement signed when the concept of
the Growth Triangle linking Johor of Malaysia, Singapore and Batam
of Indonesia was first proposed to keep the Indonesian island a
tax-free zone, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1998 the then Indonesian President Soeharto signed
a presidential decree to lift the VAT exemption for the island and
the tax became law the same year.
</P>
<P>
After he came to office, Soeharto's successor, B.J. Habibie,
postponed the implementation of the VAT, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Drops in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate of the
Philippines slowed down to 2.6 percent in January 2000 from 11.5
percent a year ago, the National Statistics Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 2.6-percent inflation is the lowest year-on-year growth
since the 2 percent posted in May 1987, the office said.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, inflation rates for all commodity
groups except for fuel, light and water (FLW) slowed down in
January.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for food alone was a negative 1.4 percent in
January, lower than the 0.2 percent last December. However, the
rate for the FLW picked up to 8.4 percent from 8.2 percent in
December.
</P>
<P>
The office also said the slowdown of the inflation has been
affected by the high base of the January 1999 inflation of 11.5
percent which was the highest since the December 1991 rate of 13.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
By region, the inflation rate for Metro Manila went down to 2
percent in January from 3 percent last December.
</P>
<P>
For other regions, the inflation rate slowed down to 2.9
percent in January from 7 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the inflation rate in the country this year will
remain stable at last year's 6.6 percent if there is no major
weather disturbance or a drastic cut in the food supply.

<HEADLINE> Paraffin Shortage Hits Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Lack of foreign currency has
caused a critical shortage of illuminating paraffin in Harare,
long queues are now common at the few service stations and forced
most of the people to use firewood instead.
</P>
<P>
Paraffin, a major source of fuel for many households in the
southern African country, has now joined petrol and diesel on the
shortage list as the country experiences its worst fuel crisis in
years.
</P>
<P>
Although petrol supplies have been "stable and constant" over
the last few days, diesel is still scarce, with most of the
service stations out of supply for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zimbabwe News Agency on Sunday, the critical
shortage of fuel in Zimbabwe has worsened, spilling into the
supermarket shelves as some of Harare's supermarkets reported
unavailability of some commodities because deliveries were not
being made.
</P>
<P>
In some supermarkets with bakeries, production of bread had
been drastically reduced because of the decreased frequency of
delivery of ingredients needed in the make of bread.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated assurances from the government that the
shortage of fuel was being corrected, the situation indicated
otherwise as snaking queues were witnessed at filling stations
with fuel, especially diesel.
</P>
<P>
The fuel crisis began in last December when the national
procurement agency, the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe failed to
secure enough foreign currency to import fuel.

<HEADLINE> Victoria Falls Beauty under Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- If Zambia is to maintain its
tourist name as the +real Africa+, with its untamed and staggering
beauty, then there is urgent need, to conserve the biodiversity of
the Victoria Falls, a Zambian government newspaper said Monday
while reporting that the beauty of the falls is under threat.
</P>
<P>
The Victoria Falls, one of the world natural wonders, is
threatened by people, Zambia Daily Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
A housewife from Lusaka, was found uprooting the natural
flowers from the surrounding area of the falls and quoted as
saying that "I want to go and plant these flowers at my house.
They look nice and I hope they can adapt to the climatic
conditions in the city."
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the first one to do this. My neighbour also came here
with her husband during Christmas time and they got many of the
flowers," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Parks and Wildlife Act it is an
offence for anyone to get flowers or shrubs out of the falls area
or a designated national park.
</P>
<P>
They do this in utter disregard of the warning inscription
which stands out at the entrance of the falls area and reads:
"removing flowers or shrubs not permitted. Trading, littering
prohibited. Offenders may be fined 40,000 Kwacha (about 16 U.S.
dollars) or imprisoned for three years or both. "

<HEADLINE> Car Thefts Worry Kenyan Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Increased carjacking and
vehicle thefts in Kenya have worried insurance companies as
compensation claims pile up, the East African weekly reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Isaac Kuria, technical manager of the Association
of Kenya Insurers, the grave concern to the industry is that the
recovery rate of stolen vehicles remains poor as the number of
thefts escalates.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1998, 800 vehicles were stolen and most
were not recovered. However, by June 1999, the insurers had
dealt with 850 cases of stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police spokesman Indidis Dola admitted that 305 car were
stolen in October last year, 313 in November and 100 in the first
half of December,
</P>
<P>
saying over 50 percent o the car thefts took place in the
capital Nairobi and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Kuria said in 1998, the insurance industry gave out 6.7 million
U.S. dollars in compensation payments and the figure is expected
to double in the 1999-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Dola said the police are winning the war against carjackers as
the cartels run a cross border business and stolen vehicles are
resold in Uganda, Tanzania and even South Africa, adding that "we
have recovered
vehicles which were stolen in these countries."

<HEADLINE> Kenya and IMF to Continue Aid Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will hold more talks with the Kenyan government in next two
months to review the findings of the current mission before
possible resumption of aid to the country.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly said Monday that the IMF mission, which
has been holding talks with government officials and company
leaders in Nairobi for the past two weeks, would return to the
U.S. on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission, led by Jose Fajgenbaum, is looking into
Kenya's balance of payments position, monetary policy and
governance.
</P>
<P>
The IMF officials will discuss their finding in Kenya in
Washington, which could lead to further talks in Nairobi in March
before any conclusive agreement is reached, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Kenya could hope to qualify for the
Poverty Reduction Growth Facility at the end of April or the
beginning of May.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Kenyan government is preparing a
"poverty reduction strategy paper", agreeable to the IMF and the
World Bank as a condition to qualify for loans from the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan to Kenya in
July, 1997, citing poor governance and official corruption.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Visits Ghana to Promote Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Envoy for
Democracy, Jesse Jackson, arrived in Accra on Sunday heading a
20-member private trade and investment delegation on a three-day
investment promotion mission.
</P>
<P>
 The delegation, made up of representatives of major U.S.
companies, is on a three-nation African investment tour
including Nigeria and South Africa under the theme "Connecting
telecommunications and media market through U.S. minority and
African business partnership."
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to the press at the airport, Jackson said the visit
is a follow-up to that of President Bill Clinton to Africa two
years ago, according to reports from the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
 It is also to further strengthen U.S. trade links with the
continent.
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the visit is focusing on information technology
because Africa never got the foundation for the take-off in
telecommunications, which is retarding development, and there was
 the need for Africa to catch up.
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. special envoy, who is also the Chief Executive
Officer of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Incorporated based in the U.S.,
said the trade mission will also explore the financial and
insurance sector and assist Ghana in its AIDS eradication
campaign program. Welcoming the delegation, John Mahama,
Minister of Communications, said he was delighted that it was
exploring the telecommunications market in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
 He said Ghana is at a critical stage of AIDS control program
because of the rate at which it is spreading and that any form of
assistance in this area was welcome.
</P>
<P>
 The delegation will pay a courtesy call on President Jerry
John Rawlings, hold meetings with officials of the Ghana
Investment Promotion Centre and visit historical places of
interest.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Rehabilitate Used Mines into Farm Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 LUSAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government will
introduce an environmental protection fund to compel all mines in
Zambia to rehabilitate their used mines into farming land.
</P>
<P>
Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye said in Kitwe,
Copperbelt Province, at the weekend that the fund would ensure
that all abandoned used mines were rehabilitated and made
available for other types of projects, according to a Monday's
Times of Zambia newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
 The report quoted the minister as saying that once
operational, the fund would see all mines making a certain
contribution to the scheme where funds for rehabilitating an old
mine would be drawn.
</P>
<P>
 Projects such as filling up open pit mines and planting trees
or using the pieces of land for agriculture would be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye said although Zambia currently seemed to have huge
and massive pieces of open land, time would come in future when
land would not be enough due to the growing population.
</P>
<P>
"This is why rehabilitation of used mines is such a good
idea," he said.
</P>
<P>
 A team of 30 participants drawn from various organizations
including Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the
Environmental Council of Zambia and non-governmental organizations
were recently trained in environmental management systems and
auditing training by two consultants from Australia, the report
said.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda, the country's

</P>
<P>
The BOU would bring the vehicles under the hammer on February
15-16 at the bank's basement and another auction site in the
industrial areas respectively, according to a New Vision daily

It was the first exhibition game for the U.S. players who
signed a new contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation and ended a
boycott that had kept them from a tournament in Australia last
month.
</P>
<P>
Mia Hamm scored her 115th goal, extending her record for
international goals by a man or woman. Kristine Lilly scored
another goal for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Norway's victory came in the first minute of injury time when
Dagny Mellgren sent in a long shot into the left corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
Hege Riise opened the scoring for the visitors in the 19th
minute with a penalty kick. But the Americans levelled the mark in
the 25th minute through Hamm.
</P>
<P>
Lilly led the U.S. squad to 2-1 in the 71st minute with an
unassisted goal. But 10 minutes later, Norway tied the score with
an own-goal by Carla Overbeck.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Reports More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region approved well over 200 overseas invested
projects with contracts involving 404 million U.S. dollars of
overseas capital in the first 11 months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the regional bureau of foreign trade and
economic cooperation shows that the actual inflow of overseas
investment totaled 541 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though this southern Chinese autonomous region aimed high for
foreign funding earlier last year, it suffered a double-digit
plunge in the use of overseas financing in the first several
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the regional bureau of foreign trade and
economic cooperation said that to stop the declining trend, they
stepped up efforts to attract more overseas funds and held six
large-scale investment fairs which resulted in the signing of 248
contracts for foreign-backed projects.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the regional government also took pains to
improve its investment environment by stopping miscellaneous fees
in violation of regulations and helping relieve local overseas-
backed enterprises of financial burdens.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Children's Status Hardly Improved: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepali children's health and
nutrition status has hardly improved in the past 25 years,
according to child health experts.
</P>
<P>
"Our children are still dying due to preventable diseases and
malnutrition. This is one of the main problems that the children
are facing," said Gauri Pardhan, president of Child Workers in
Nepal, at an interaction program on "Present Situation of Children
in Nepal and Aspects for Reform" held here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day program was organized by the Child Development
Society of Nepal, a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
Annual Health Report of 1997-1998 observed that as high as 50
percent of children under five years old were malnourished and
underweight.
</P>
<P>
The experts participating the program claimed that much could
have been achieved if the plans formulated by the government had
been implemented more effectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, although Child Mortality Rate (CMR)
has declined during the past decade, it is more a result of on-
going socio-economic changes than effective programs.
</P>
<P>
Family Health Survey (FHS) conducted in 1996 showed that CMR
declined by 45 percent than a decade ago while the infant
mortality rate decreased 38 percent. CMR is 24 percent higher
among girls than boys.
</P>
<P>
"Our policies do not address the most crippling problems and
even if they do, we fail to implement them effectively," said Dr.
Ramesh Adhikari, a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
The problem lies in the lack of skilled manpower, supervision
of the programs and inefficient coordination between the
organizations working in the same field, according to the experts.

<HEADLINE> British Police Contact Afghan Plane Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Armed British police early
Monday took up position around an Afghan plane carrying 160
hostages and began negotiating with the hijackers on the ground at
Stansted Airport, north of London.
</P>
<P>
"Things seem to be pretty calm at this moment. Contact has been
made from the control tower by one of our trained negotiators,"
said Charles Clark, Deputy Chief Constable of Essex Police, who is
currently in charge of the case.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed conditions on board were calm, adding that
it was not yet time to be optimistic about the situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is too soon to talk about any demands. The policing
priority is the safe release of everybody on board the aircraft.
Lives are at risk here. This could be a long drawn-out operation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police and security officers are at Stansted, as
well as interpreters ready to liaise with the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
Stansted Airport at present is closed to all inbound and
outbound flights.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan plane was hijacked by about six men armed with
pistols and grenades during an internal flight from the Afghan
capital Kabul, to the city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the aircraft landed twice in Central Asia -
first in Uzbekistan and then in Kazakhstan where at least 10
passengers, including women and children, were released, and the
plane was refueled.
</P>
<P>
Emergency service vehicles were scrambled as the plane touched
down at Stansted Airport shortly after 0200 GMT, escorting the jet
to a secure area to the north of the airport, about half a mile
away from the main terminals.
</P>
<P>
The airport, which has been the scene of several similar
incidents in the past, has well-rehearsed procedures for dealing
with hijack situations.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers have so far made no demands, though according to
one report, they are seeking the release of Ismail Khan, a
military commander of the anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are hoping for a peaceful solution to this
situation. At this stage, we are not aware of any demands or
requests from those on board the aircraft," a Home Office
spokeswoman said.

DHAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings
during the July-December period of the current fiscal year (1999-

<HEADLINE> Mexican Police End Ninth-Month Campus Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexican police forces
raided strikers on the campus of a leading academic institution
Sunday, ending a nine-month strike in a rather peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
At 6:40 a.m. local time, federal police officers marched into
an all-night meeting of the strike's governing council and sealed
off 430 students, including eight leading organizers of the strike.
</P>
<P>
In the swift and sudden attack which lasted about four hours,
about 2,260 police officers, armed with batons and shields,
arrested a total 632 strikers with no resistance or injuries.
</P>
<P>
The strike began in April when students in the National
Autonomous University, the largest university in Latin America,
protested plans to raise annual tuition.
</P>
<P>
The university administration gave in, but a small number of
students continued to occupy the campus. As the strike dragged on
with sometimes violent protests, vandalism of university buildings
and adverse impact on the traffic, the general public also lost
their sympathy for the strikers.

<HEADLINE> Internet Users in Indonesia Expected to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of internet users in
Indonesia is expected to increase from approximately 1 million in
1999 to 1.45 million in 2000 and 1.98 million in 2001, a report
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The number of local Internet domains surged by nearly 80
percent throughout 1999, hitting 4,685 sites in December from only
2,624 sites in January," the Jakarta Post daily quoted data
released by the Association of Indonesian Internet Service
Providers as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said that corporate domains recorded the most dynamic growth
last year with sites rising by about 75 percent to reach 3,544
sites in December from 2,042 in January.
</P>
<P>
The International Data Corporation, a U.S.-based telecoms and
IT research firm, estimated the number of Internet users in
Indonesia will grow from approximately 70,000 in 2000 to 600,000
by 2003, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Internet and e-commerce had become more and more attractive to
business enterprises due to their potential gain.
</P>
<P>
"The potential gain offered by Internet and e-commerce
businesses have also made them favorite choices for stock market
players, a condition which I consider a natural consequence,"
Indra M. Utoyo, general manager of multimedia division at the
state-owned telecoms company PT Telkom, was quoted by the daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Utoyo said that it was a very good decision for companies
interested in the Internet and e-commerce sectors to immediately
establish their infrastructures and embark on the business.
</P>
<P>
But it was possible that the predicted increase in e-commerce
users would not be achieved due to the fact that Indonesia was
still lacking in telephone lines and computer access, Utoyo warned.
</P>
<P>
Data from PT Telkom at the end of September last year showed
there was only 5.94 million fixed lines available for Indonesia's
population of over 200 million.
</P>
<P>
Whereas only about 250,000 of approximately two million
computer users in Indonesia last year actually possess computers
in their homes.

Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
This is the first hijacked plane being allowed to land at a

Stansted was the usual choice for this type of incident because
it was less congested than the British capital's main airport of

Police at Stansted said regular exercises were conducted at the
airport for this sort of incident.

LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A hijacked Afghan plane with
more than 160 people on board landed early Monday at Stansted
Airport, north of London, hours after leaving Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at the airport shortly after 0200 GMT
following a flight from snowy Moscow where the hijackers had
released 10 of their hostages after landing there on Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest stop for the hostages who spent four hours on
the ground in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
British police in the airport had already begun to negotiate
with the hijakers, a spokeswoman in the airport said.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet what the hijakers were demanding from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked on Sunday by about six men armed with
pistols and grenades during an internal flight from the Afghan
capital, Kabul, to the city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the aircraft landed twice in Central Asia --
first in Uzbekistan and then in Kazakhstan, where at least 10
passengers, including women and children, were released, and the
plane was refuelled.
</P>
<P>
This is the first hijacked plane being allowed to land at a
British airport.
</P>
<P>
Stansted was the usual choice for this type of incident because

</P>
<P>
The hijackers have so far made no demands, though according to
one report, they are seeking the release of Ismail Khan, a
military commander of the anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by Taliban and Afghan aviation
authorities, the plane left Kabul with 186 people on board -- 21
children, 11 infants, 140 adults and 14 all-male crew.
</P>
<P>
Ariana is banned from flying abroad by United Nations sanctions
which have also been imposed against the Taliban movement for its
refusal to extradite or expel Saudi-born dissident, Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban in turn accuses Moscow of arming and training anti-
Taliban fighters.

Russia and central Asian states including Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan suspect the Taliban of backing rebels involved in the

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The hijacked Afghan passenger
plane that left Moscow early Monday has landed in Stansted Airport
outside London, Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 took off at 01:20 local time (22:00 GMT Sunday)
from the Sheremetyevo-1 airport in Moscow after receiving food and
fuel.
</P>
<P>
Ten passengers were released following negotiations with
Russian security services and Afghan diplomats.
</P>
<P>
When the Ariana airliner landed in Moscow, there were 181
people aboard the plane, including 20 women and 23 children, a
spokesman of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was flying a domestic flight from the capital
Kabul to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, was first diverted
to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for refueling.
</P>
<P>
Ten passengers, including two children, were released in
Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
The plane then flew to the Aktyubinsk airport of Kazakhstan,
where three more passengers were released, before heading for
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 hijackers aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers were reported to be armed with pistols and
grenades.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen announced that the plane was hijacked about 10-15
minutes after take-off, but refrained from disclosing their plan
and demands.
</P>
<P>
However, the independent Afghan Islamic Press reported earlier
that the hijackers were demanding the release of the former
governor of an Afghan province held by the ruling Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Coalition-backed Candidates Win Osaka, Kyoto Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Candidates backed by Japan's
ruling coalition parties on Sunday won two local elections in
Osaka and Kyoto, both in western Japan.
</P>
<P>
In Osaka, Japan's second-most populous prefecture, Fusae Ota, a
former senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI), defeated her two main rivals in a gubernatorial
election to become the country's first female governor.
</P>
<P>
Ota was supported by all three parties of the ruling coalition,
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Liberal Party (LP) and the
New Komeito party, as well as the Reformers Network, a
parliamentary ally of the New Komeito party and the main
opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).
</P>
<P>
The election was held for the seat vacated by former governor
Knock Yokoyama, who resigned in last December just prior to his
indictment on charges that he sexually molested a female campaign
worker during the previous gubernatorial race last April.
</P>
<P>
In the ancient capital of Kyoto, Mayor Yorikane Masumoto was
reelected for a second term, beating a long-time contender backed
by the Japanese Communist Party (JCP).
</P>
<P>
Masumoto was jointly supported by six political parties,
including the LDP, the LP, the New Komeito and the DPJ.
</P>
<P>
The election results broaden Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
options over disbanding the House of Representatives for a snap
election, Japanese political observers said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi has reportedly been exploring the timing of disbanding
the lower house, which must be done by mid-October when the
members' four-year term expires.
</P>
<P>
The election results are also likely to influence the ongoing
Diet(parliament) session, which the opposition group, the DPJ, JCP
and Social Democratic Party, has been boycotting since late last
month to protest the ruling bloc's issuing of a bill to reduce the
number of seats in the lower chamber, the observers said.

<HEADLINE> Finland Elects First Female President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Minister and
Social Democrat Tarja Halonen beat her centrist rival candidate
Esko Aho on Sunday in the second round of vote to become Finland's
first female president.
</P>
<P>
With 99.9 percent of the vote counted, Halonen pocketed 51.6
percent of the votes to 48.4 percent for Aho, a former prime
minister and candidate of the largest opposition party -- the
Center Party.
</P>
<P>
The presidential race was held peacefully at a time when
Finland enjoyed a stable domestic situation and enhanced
international status.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the election on January 16, none of the
seven candidates won more than half of the votes. Halonen and Aho,
the first two lead-takers, entered the second round of the race.
</P>
<P>
In the second round of the vote, the two candidates began a
tougher tug-of-war on domestic and foreign policies and value
judgments. Holding quite close policies and ideologies, the two
were in a very close match till the last minute of the race.
</P>
<P>
About 3.184 million or 80.2 percent of the voters turned out
for the second round of the vote, higher than the 76.9 percent
turnout in the first round, reflecting the voters' concern and
expectation for the new head of state, a largely ceremonial but
highly respected post.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results released Sunday night showed that Halonen
captured 1.6438 million votes, or 51.6 percent of the total, to
win the election and become the third Social Democrat president
in the country and the 5th female president in the world.
</P>
<P>
Halonen, 56, is one of the most experienced statesman in
Finland. She entered the political circle in the 1970s and served
as minister of social health and minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
Halonen, foreign minister since 1995, upholds Finland's current
foreign policies, military non-alignment and the maintenance of an
independent and reliable defense system. She also supports the
country's active involvement in Europe's integration process and
peace-keeping efforts and stressed the importance of maintaining
and developing the neighborly ties with other North European and
Baltic states, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
On domestic polices, she emphasizes the traditional social
welfare, full employment and the fair and just allocation of
wealth. She also underscores democracy, rule of law and respect
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Halonen will be sworn in on March 1 to replace the outgoing
President Martti Ahtisaari as the 18th president in Finland's
history.

<P>
YINCHUAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 exquisite
statues of Buddha and pagoda molds were recently unearthed at the
mausoleum of the Xixia emperor in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of the statues are well-preserved. The most
noteworthy was a statue of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, who
sits in the lotus position.
</P>
<P>
The clay molds for making pagodas range in height from five to
15 centimeters. Some were painted with colorful designs and gilded.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists have also found the remains of a 1.8-
meter-tall man at the northwestern corner of a pit outside the
mausoleum. He was found with his head just inside the mausoleum
and both legs stretching out from the pit. Archeologists believe
he was a gravedigger.

<HEADLINE> New Road Brings More China-Russia Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 7 (Xinhua)-- With the opening of a new road
today, trade exchanges between China and Russia will become more
convenient.
</P>
<P>
The new route runs directly between the city of Hegang in
eastern Heilongjiang Province in northeast China, and the
neighboring city of Birobidzhan, in Russia's Yevreyskaya Ao (
Jewish Autonomous State).
</P>
<P>
China has invested more than 300 million yuan (over 35 million
U.S. dollars) to build this direct freight access to Russia. A 60-
kilometer-long highway, optical fiber cables for communications, a
6,000-square-meter trade market, and a large warehouse have
already been constructed to serve business between two countries
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Mingshan Border Port, the starting point of the new road,
has also been renovated to bring transport capacity up to one
million tons annually. The border port is also Heilongjiang's
largest coal export facility with a coal-loading capacity of 400
tons per hour.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mingshan Port, China has two other border
ports, the Suifen River Port and the Dongning Port, with direct
trade access to Russia.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have signed a contract to build two trade
exchange centers at their own port sites, local sources revealed.
A project to build a bridge in Heilongjiang is also presently
under negotiations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China's First Tiger Monograph Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The biggest wish of Wang
Fenling's life has come true with the publication of his
comprehensive "Research on Chinese Tiger Culture."
</P>
<P>
Wang, 75, a famous folklorist and professor at Northeast China
Teachers University, completed a definitive anthropological,
sociological and biological review of tiger-based culture in China
and America in the process of completing his work.
</P>
<P>
Another veteran folklorist, Professor Chen Qingjian, said, "
Chinese cultural history will change with the birth of this book."
</P>
<P>
Duan Baolin, renowned folklorist and professor at Beijing
University, said, "This is a comprehensive work on tiger-based
culture in China, and much of it is highly original."
</P>
<P>
The tiger has existed for over one million years, Wang said,
and in China it has long been alive in many forms of art, folklore,
conventions, and even religion. Throughout history, mankind's
attitude toward the tiger has experienced three major phases:
worshipping, taming, and protecting the tiger.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Orders Three Insurance Firms to Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Three comprehensive insurance
firms in China have been ordered to split their property and life
insurance businesses within the year, Xinhua has learned.
</P>
<P>
The three firms are the Pacific Insurance Company, the Ping'an
Insurance Company, and the Xinjiang Construction Corps Insurance
Company.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), a plan for the firms to split into separate
entities engaged solely in the business of property or life
insurance has been submitted to the State Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance laws do not allow a firm to engage in life
and property insurance at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guoliang, the general manager of Pacific Insurance,
recently told reporters that his firm's property insurance
division will become a new company to be known as the Pacific
Property Insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
The company's life insurance division would then be taken over
by a joint venture with a foreign insurance firm, negotiations for
which are going on right now, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Group A second-placed Ghana was
ousted off the 22nd African Cup of Nations on Sunday by Group B
leader South Africa in a 1-0 quarterfinal game in Kumasi, the
second largest city of the Co-host Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian star Kwame Ayew had the best opportunity to give his
team an early lead in the 18th minute but he failed to get on the
end of a well-placed cross pass.
</P>
<P>
After that, the South Africa was entirely dominant, and
Siyabonga Nomvete headed in the only goal of the game for South
Africa's victory in the 41st minute.
</P>
<P>
But the South Africans were stunned when they had to play 10-
men after Eric Tinkler being sent off in the 50th minute for a
second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked Ghana into life but unfortunately their
relentless attacks failed to capitalize on their one-man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the eagerly-awaited clash in the packed
Kumasi stadium, the two sides observed a minute's silence in
memory of those who died in the recent Ivory Coast plane crash.

<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Group A leader Cameroon Sunday
took a 2-1 victory over Group B second finisher Algeria in a
quarterfinal game of the 22nd African Nations Cup held in Ghana's
capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon took an early lead when its star striker Samuel Eto'o
picked an hole in the Algerian defense to scored the first goal
for the "Indomitable Lions" in the seventh minute of first half.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st minute of the first half, Marc-Vivien Foe headed
the ball into the back of the net taking the lions to a 2-0 lead,
which was hold till the last minute of the match.
</P>
<P>
The second half produced a strong show from Cameroon, but a
tighter performance from the Algerians and the Lions'
unwillingness to take risks initially took the pace of the match
down a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
With just over 10 minutes remaining, Abdelhafid Tasfaout's
successful header won back one goal for Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon won Group A on goal difference after finishing level
on points with Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo.
</P>
<P>

expectations in recent years. But its French coach Pierre
Lechantre has shown his confidence repeatedly during this cup
tournament.
</P>

"None of the squad has tasted success at the African Nations
Cup and this has heightened the desire to bring the cup back to
Cameroon," he said before today's match.

<HEADLINE> Israel Says Committed to Pullout from Lebanon by July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting tension in south
Lebanon, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Monday that Israel remains committed to a troop withdrawal from a
border zone there by July.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Barak's national security advisor, said that Israel
would prefer to conduct the troop withdrawal under a peace
agreement with Syria, perceived in Israel as the main power broker
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement was reached by then, however, a unilateral
pullout would take place, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yatom made the remarks one day after an Israeli soldier was
killed and seven others wounded in a combined roadside bomb and
mortar attack staged by Hezbollah guerrillas in the so-called
security zone Israel carved out in 1985 in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The casualties brought to five the number of Israeli soldiers
killed in the security zone and 11 wounded in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak convened a special meeting of his security cabinet Monday
to discuss response to the surge in Hezbollah guerrilla attacks in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Facing mounting cry for a harsh response to the attacks, Barak
has kept a relatively restricted policy in order to avoid harming
the chances of resuming the troubled talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved air raids on suspected
Hezbollah guerrillas bases in the security zone but rejected an
army proposal of massive and in-depth retaliation such as striking
civilian infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
break of nearly four years, ground to a halt last month over a
dispute on the fate of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. A
scheduled third round of talks was postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Damascus said the talks could not be resumed without a written
Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal from the strategic plateau
seized by Israel in 1967. Israel has rejected the precondition.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to pull Israeli troops out of Lebanon by July
this year, which would require the consent of Syria. A unilateral
withdrawal without an agreement would risk the danger of expanding
the conflict in south Lebanon to northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials blamed Syria for the worsening situation in
Lebanon. Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Monday that Damascus
would not succeed in pressuring Israel to make concessions on the
negotiating table by backing Hezbollah activities in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz reported Monday that Hezbollah had sped
up receiving arms and ammunition from Iran in the last few weeks.
All the weapons shipment passed through Damascus, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Yatom said that Israel has sent several messages to Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad via the White House over the past several
days but has not received any response indicating that Damascus was
doing all it could to bring an end to Hezbollah attacks in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But he said that an agreement would have to be reached
ultimately with Syria, adding that it was unlikely that the answer
to south Lebanon would come about only by a military initiative.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Government Forms Economic Stimulus Plan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti government has
finalized a mechanism to revive the national economy by enlarging
the role of the private sector in state economic activity, a senior
official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah told local press that the economic stimulus plan,
worked out in coordination with experts from state and private
institutions, would be effective very soon.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said the government-proposed plan would encourage
the private sector to invest in housing, health and educational
projects.
</P>
<P>
The new economic development mechanism apparently came amid
government determination to reactivate the weak economy, in which
some structural problems are increasingly cropping up.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited plan is also believed to be a reaction to
constant criticism leveled against the government by local press
for lack of concrete action in mapping out effective economic
reform scheme.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's present cabinet, formed last July with a strong
economic team, has been trying to work out a comprehensive reform
package. But only some symbolic reforms, such as raising fuel
prices and imposing registration charges on expatriates visiting
public hospitals and clinics, have been executed.
</P>
<P>
As individual investors showed less confidence in government
policy, especially the monetary policy, Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)
has also been affected. The KSE index has now dropped below the 1,
400-point level, whereas it once surged to over 2,600 points in the
end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although local press and dealers have been urging the Central
Bank to intervene by injecting capital into the stock market, the
government is still reluctant to invest large sums.

a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Potential Olympic
Team, formed with athletes from all the territory of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and supported with a special financial and technical
assistance of the IOC, has been decided and will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The selected 19 athletes have now the chance to qualify for

Zetra after the handover of the facility to the Canton of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said that it wanted to express its satisfaction with
the successful result of the works so far, commending the efforts
invested by the NOC of Bosnia and Herzegovina, more assured now of
the final success of the global process.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Asia Forum
conference opened Monday in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki with the participation of delegations from more than
30 Asian, European and the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
During the political and business meeting, which is organized
by the newly-founded "Asia Forum 2000," the participants will
review the opportunities, forms and conditions of economic
cooperation among their countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to result in the establishment of
permanent Eurasian institutions in Thessaloniki, such as a tourism
chamber and a Eurasian banking center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Wang Mengkui, President of China's
State Council Development and Research Center, praised Greece's
active role in the reconstruction of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the conference would open the way for the
strengthening of the economic and trade relations between China
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece could act as an intermediary for the Chinese companies
that wanted to become active in southeastern Europe, but more
specific results were expected in this field in May when
businessmen from China would attend the second Asia Forum event
that would also take place in Thessaloniki, the largest city in
northern Greece, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The "Asia Forum" is the first major attempt in Greece to link
up with the business potential of the 90 countries in Asia, the
European Union (EU), the Black Sea, eastern Mediterranean and
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> A German Train Accident Kills Nine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers began work early
Monday to reach the last of four mangled carriages of a train
which derailed near Cologne on Sunday morning, killing at least
nine people and leaving 96 injured, ten of them critically.
</P>
<P>
22 people were still missing after the train accident,
although it was presumed that many had left the spot of the train
crash, said a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The night special express D 203 of the German Railway (
Deutsche Bahn AG) from Amsterdam to Basle, Switzerland, with
nearly 300 passengers aboard, derailed early Sunday at a switching
point near the station in Bruehl town, south of Cologne. The
engine and several carriages toppled down an incline and crashed
into a house.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old engine driver had passed through Bruehl
station at a speed far exceeding the limit according to an
investigation by the railway company, police and government
transportation officials.
</P>
<P>
Reports on Sunday said that the train was traveling at more
than 120 kilometers an hour just before the accident happened. The
track in Bruehl station can carry a limit of 40 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
The driver was unhurt but shocked sharply. As the train
crashed into a house the occupants of the house ,an elderly couple,
were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
German newspapers said on Monday that it is the biggest train
accident since the last one happened on June 3rd 1998 in Eschede
near Hannover. During that accident 101 people were dead. Since
the train accident in Eschede there were many small accidents, but
this time the crash in Bruehl aroused general criticism.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was much shocked by the
news about the train crash in Bruehl.
</P>
<P>
The train accident touched off nationwide censures in Germany .
It is the first train accident since the chief of Deutsche Bahn AG
Hartmut Mehdorn assumed office in mid December last year. The
urgent task for Mehdorn is to avoid from such train accidents.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Probes Controversial Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
investigating the charges of corruption in connection with the
controversial 30 billion rand (about five billion U.S. dollars)
arms deal, South African Press Association reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal with international weapons suppliers was signed and
sealed in Pretoria last December by Defence Minister Mosiuoa
Lekota. However, the opposition Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)
accused some government officials, who were responsible for
negotiating and signing the contract, of taking bribes from the
western weapon companies and urged the government to investigate
the charges.
</P>
<P>
The Auditor-General Office confirmed on Monday that following
allegations of irregularities, it had decided to include the arms
procurement deal as part of its regulatory audit of the Department
of Defence.
</P>
<P>
Wallie Van Heerden of the Auditor-General's Office said the
audit started four weeks ago and would hopefully be completed in
mid-March, and the investigation report would be tabled in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Office for Serious Economic Offences was
also involved in a separate "preliminary investigation" and the
two offices were cooperating with each other.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government's anti-corruption unit confirmed it
was still probing allegations of corruption made by PAC member of
parliament Patricia de Lille concerning the deal.

<HEADLINE> Famine Worsens in Northwest Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Four more divisions in
northwest Kenya's Turkana District have joined the list of
drought-hit areas requiring urgent relief food, local officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lokori, Lokichar, Lokitaung and Kalokol have been classified as
 emergency zones joining Kaaleng, Kerio and Lapuro, district
officer Alloys Otieno said on behalf of District Commissioner
Peter Mooke.
</P>
<P>
Even more depressing news from Turkana is that all the 17
divisions in the district will be declared disaster zones by the
end of this month if it does not rain soon, according to Alloys
Otieno.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the Turkana District have not had rain in the past
three and a half years and the drizzles which have been
experienced in other areas have not been adequate to provide
enough pasture for livestock.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies estimate that the district has lost half of its
pre- drought livestock population through rustling and lack of
pasture.
</P>
<P>
Early this month the United Nations World Food Program sounded
an alert that about 2.7 million Kenyans would face famine in the
next five months due to the drought.
</P>
<P>
Of the areas hit by drought, Turkana is the worst affected,
according the World Food Program.

The meeting between the American commander with minister

<P>
The majority of the funds will go toward narcotic fighting,
reinforcing military units in the country's south, where is under

LOS ANGELS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Business-to-business (B2B)e-

models for conducting e-commerce, including auctions, aggregators,
big systems and exchanges. By 2004, Forrester expects these e-
marketplaces to capture 53 percent of all online business trade.
</P>
<P>
Forrester's business e-commerce forecast is based on a model of
B2B trade in 13 hard-goods supply chains and draws upon data from
the U.S. government, industry and interviews, and its own research.
The research firm defines B2B e-commerce as inter-company trade in
which the final order is placed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. businesses are universally preparing to buy and sell
online, leveraging the Net to build deeper relationships with
their business partners," said the report. "But the rampant growth
of online trade through these one-to-one business connections will
taper off after 2001, as firms more actively participate in e-
marketplaces to connect with a wide universe of buyers and sellers.
"
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years, according to the report, e-
marketplaces will spring up within most industries, attacking
outdated business practices and inefficient trading relationships.
Using the e-marketplace opportunity index (eMOI) the firm created
to determine where Net marketplaces will thrive, Forrester
predicts that e-marketplaces will ultimately account for between
45 percent and 74 percent of e-commerce in a supply chain.
</P>
<P>
The largest impact will be in the computing and electronics,
shipping and warehousing, and utilities and industries where more
than 70 percent of online trade will go through e-marketplaces,
according to the report. By contrast, heavy industry and aerospace
and defense will find less than 50 percent of their e-commerce
flowing through e-marketplaces. As firms hook into e-marketplaces
and adopt more dynamic trading practices, existing business
practices and supply chain relationships will get pulled apart,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier study by Boston Consulting Group, also
a research firm, one-fourth of all U.S. B2B purchasing will be
done online by the year 2003. Between 1998 and 2003, U.S. B2B e-
commerce will grow by 33 percent each year and reach 2.8 trillion
dollars in transaction value.

<HEADLINE> aaa020715--U.S. Consumer Borrowing Rises 9.7 Percent in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Americans' borrowing leaped
ahead in December led by strong demand for loans for everything
from autos and boats to education and vacations, the Federal
Reserve reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt,
increased at a 9.7 percent annual rate in December to a seasonally
adjusted 1.39 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
All told, consumers borrowed 11.2 billion dollars more in
December than during the month before, much more than the 7-
billion-dollar gain many analysts were forecasting.
</P>
<P>
In November, consumer debt rose at a 13.8 percent annual rate,
slightly stronger than the government previously estimated.
Consumers borrowed 15.8 billion dollars that month than in October,
ringing up the largest monthly increase in debt since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Demand for non-revolving loans, including loans for autos,
mobile homes, boats, trailers, education and vacations, in
December rose at a 10.6 percent annual rate, following a whopping
17.3 percent rate the month before.
</P>
<P>
Consumers also used their credits cards freely in December.
Revolving credit, primarily credit cards revolving loans, grew by
a 8.4 percent annual rate, down from a 9 percent rate in November.
</P>
<P>
Americans continued their spending spree after Christmas,
boosting retail sales to surprisingly strong levels in January,
the nation's retailers reported last week. That helped stores
finish their fiscal year with the biggest gains since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates by a quarter of a
percentage point last week, the fourth increase since June, in an
effort to cool the economy. The action made borrowing more
expensive for consumers and businesses.

<HEADLINE> aaa020721-- Plan for world's Biggest Magnetic-levitation Railway abandoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany cancelled last Saturday
plans to build the world's biggest magnetic-levitation railway, a
space-age train system that flies a couple of centimeters above
its tracks at half the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 on, the designers began to plan the railway route.
The futuristic railway was to have been built between the port
city Hamburg and the capitol Berlin. The engineers have succeeded
in testing an experimental version.
</P>
<P>
The magnetic-levitation was known in Germany as the Transrapid.
The reason why the plan aborted is that the German government said
that it would spend some 6.1 billion marks (3 billion U.S. dollars)
in taxpayers's money to subsidize it. And the fares could never
have repaid the cost of the building it.
</P>
<P>
The magnetic-levitation railways use electromagnets to lift
the train cars off the tracks and accelerate the train to run with
a speed of more than 400 kilometers an hour. Germany has already
built a working 10-kilometer magnetic-levitation railway in the
Emsland region in the northwest.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Plane Hostage Crisis "Could Go On For Days": Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- British police warned on Monday
that the hostage crisis involving an Afghan passenger plane at
Stansted airport, north of London, could "go on for days."
</P>
<P>
Police Assistant Chief Constable Joe Edwards said the release
of eight hostages earlier in the day could be seen as a good sign.
</P>
<P>
"It would very much tie in with the nature of a goodwill
gesture," Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "It could go on for days."
</P>
<P>
The eight hostages were freed on Monday from the hijacked plane
held at Stansted airport by a gang believed to be armed with
grenades and pistols.
</P>
<P>
The latest release came as negotiations reached what police
said was a critical stage.
</P>
<P>
Some 157 hostages remain on board the jet, which remained
standing on the tarmac as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
Police officers did not give details of the terms of the
releases, and said they were unaware of any demands made by the
hijackers or of any political motives.
</P>
<P>
Supplies of food, drink, medicines and other supplies have been
delivered several times to those on board since the jet landed at
the airport at 0200 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Chief Constable John Broughton said: "We are seeking
to enhance and improve the welfare of those on board in the hope
that we can achieve a successful resolution."
</P>
<P>
The hijackers are still holding about 150 people on board the
Boeing-727, which is parked on a runway at Stansted airport,
northeast of London. The plane was hijacked in the Afghan capital
Kabul on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no idea of the number of hijackers and
could not confirm reports by hostages released earlier in
Uzbekistan that they were armed with pistols and grenades.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 7 (Xinhua)-- Venezuela's President Hugo
Chavez expressed Monday his wish that Brazil and Venezuela be a "
pair" on the South American continent, upon receiving Brazil's
Foreign Minister Luis Felipe Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
Chavez considered "vital" relations between both nations,
because besides historic, cultural, geographic and economic
reasons uniting them, they have a common concept of a need for
equity and integral human development at a world level.
</P>
<P>
"For Latin American and Caribbean peoples, all that's left to
do is to truly unite", Chavez said at a function at Miraflores
palace, seat of the government, where two documents were signed
between the Venezuelan republic and group Petroleum of Venezuela (
PDVSA) with private Brazilian firm "Constructora Norberto
Odebrecht".
</P>
<P>
The memorandum for understanding signed by the Brazilian
building company and Venezuela supposes a financing offer, at
preferential and reimbursement rates in twelve years, for building
works of national interest.
</P>
<P>
The second document signed was a letter of intention whereby
which Odebrecht will present a financing plan, with facilities
similar to the previous accord, for carrying out tasks that
requires the project "System of gas compressing at national level".
</P>
<P>
PDVSA's president, Hector Civaldini, explained the project in
which Odebrecht has been interested in participating is "quite
ambitious" and implies the building of thirteen compressing plants
of gas whose cost may rise to 1.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Leaders Call for International Action Against AIDS in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. leaders Monday
again painted a shocking picture on the impact of AIDS disease in
Africa and called for international action against the killing
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Town Hall Meeting on AIDS in Africa, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "Let me be clear: AIDS is a
world-wide problem. There are many countries outside Africa,
especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, where it is spreading at an
alarming rate."
</P>
<P>
"But no where else has AIDS yet reached such emergency
proportions, nowhere else has it become such a threat to the very
foundations of society as it has in Africa's southern and eastern
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The southern and eastern Africa, with less than five percent
of the world's population, is home to more than 50 percent to
those living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS disease, Annan
said. "It is where 60 percent of all AIDS deaths have happened so
far."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the 54th General Assembly session,
Theo-Ben Guirirab who is also the Namibian foreign minister, said,
"Only last year, this dreaded disease killed 2 million victims and
also orphaned 10 million African children."
</P>
<P>
Mark Malloch Brown, administrator of the United Nations
Development Program, said, "The catastrophic dimensions of the HIV/
AIDS crisis have settled heavily on the shoulders of sub-Saharan
Africa. The burden on individuals, families, communities and
nations is unparalleled."
</P>
<P>
"By cutting deep into all sectors of society HIV/AIDS is
undermining vital economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa," he said.
"By some projections, the disease could reduce national GDP across
the region by one-third over the next 20 years."

<HEADLINE> aaa020714--World Bank: East Asia Shows Recovery, But Remains Uneven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- East Asia enters the new
millennium as the world's fastest growing emerging market, a
remarkable turnaround from the devastating crisis that began in
1997, according to the World Bank's recently issued regional
quarterly brief.
</P>
<P>
The report provides detailed analysis for seven of the region's
most important economies, including China, Indonesia, South Korea,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that in 1999, the region's economy grew by about 5
percent. South Korea, China, and Malaysia led the group with
growth rate of 10.2 percent, 7.1 percent, and 4.9 percent.
Although Indonesia lags behind, it too shows signs of positive
growth.
</P>
<P>
This economic turnaround brings the region back from rising
poverty, falling standards of living, and the systemic crisis in
its productive and financial sectors, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank, However, noted that incomes to low and middle class
citizens have yet to be restored, and the 15 million or so people
that the crisis pushed below the poverty line remain unaffected by
these improvements.
</P>
<P>
"East Asian economies are clearly on the mend, but a good deal
of challenging work remains to be done," said Jean-Michel Severino,
vice president for World Bank's East Asia and Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
The update projected that real gross domestic product for the
region should remain at around 5 percent in 2000, and exports
should continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
"The external environment continues to provide a favorable
context for East Asia's recovery, though not without risk. The
global economy has picked up its pace, led by the United States'
strong fourth quarter performance and Europe's gathering momentum,
" said Richard Newfarmer, lead specialist in the World Bank's East
Asia and Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, East Asia is beginning the new year with enviable
prospects, and equally impressive challenges," he said.
