<HEADLINE> European Parliament Leader Urges Rapid EU Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament President
Klaus Hansch today urged all the European Union (EU) leaders to
give the EU reform process "a fresh boost".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the EU summit, he said that
the European Parliament congratulates Ireland, the current EU
presidency, on preparing a "general outline for a draft revision
of the (EU) Treaties."
</P>
<P>
The Irish draft, as "a good basis", must be negotiated to a
level that provides an appropriate response to the challenges
which enlargement, the single currency, unemployment, the
globalization of the economy and internal and external security
pose for the Union, he told the participants.
</P>
<P>
"The European Council should give the negotiations a fresh
boost," he added.
</P>
<P>
On fighting against drugs and other serious crimes, he said
that Europe must take concrete measures to defend itself with
effective joint action against drug-trafficking, money-laundering,
car-smuggling and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, the Parliament leader said:
"The introduction of the single currency extends well beyond
monetary union, fiscal policy or economic policy. It will set the
course for political union."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the EU countries to conclude the "stability
pact" on the single currency as soon as possible, saying
"uncertainty would be exploited in public debate by those who want
to destroy the whole project."
</P>
<P>
However, EU finance ministers at the moment remain locked in
their heated discussions on the pact.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus To Go Ahead With Purchase of Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will go ahead with
the signing of contracts for the purchase of anti-aircraft
missile system S-300 from Russia, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a visit to Moscow next Tuesday by
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller,
who will reportedly raise the issue of the purchase of Russian
weapons by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Ciller's trip to Russia might succeed in
canceling the deal, Cassoulides said "the government is at an
understanding with the Russian government for the signing of
purchase contracts."
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding the purchase of missiles, Cyprus Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides said in London today on his way to Dublin, that
"Cyprus cannot remain defenseless if attacked by air."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Inal Batu said at the
end of his two-day visit to Turkish-controlled northern part of
Cyprus Thursday that Turkey will not remain silent in the face of
the Greek Cypriot side's buying of arms of an offensive character.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer
Akbel also said that the stationing of offensive missiles in
Cyprus can be "a threat to the security of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the Turkish threats, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos warned Thursday that "as Greece has repeatedly
stated, any threat of an attack against Cyprus will be a
cause of war and will be answered in the manner that any
attack is faced."
</P>
<P>
Greece together with Turkey and Britain were guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of
the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over the
eastern Mediterranean strategic island of Cyprus, which has been
divided since Turkish invasion in 1974.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: WTO MC Successful, But Adjustment Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The first World Trade
Organization Ministerial Conference (WTO MC) closed here today
with a balanced declaration featuring hard-won compromises mainly
between the developed and developing members on a number of
controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
Given the agreements reached, the conference was described by
some analysts here as a "milestone" in the process of global trade
liberalization, and Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the
European Union (EU) Commission, said it was "a huge international
success."
</P>
<P>
But analysts pointed out that the WTO can not afford to ignore
the growing role the developing countries are playing in global
trade, and must act now to adjust itself to it.
</P>
<P>
A delighted Yeo Cheow Tong, Singapore's Minister for Trade and
Industry and Chairman of the just-concluded conference, said in
his closing remarks, "I am very proud to say that we have
delivered. We have accomplished the task set upon us at the
beginning of the conference."
</P>
<P>
"We are now ready to carry out the tasks that the ministers in
their collective wisdom have entrusted to the WTO in pursuance of
its mandate to liberalize trade and promote development,
employment, stability and prosperity in all the members," he
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the newly-adopted Singapore Ministerial
Declaration, Yeo said that as a whole, it "has a number of very
significant components which provide the necessary balance of
interests."
</P>
<P>
In the first place was the most contentious issue of the
relationship between trade and the observance of core labor
standards. Yeo said that the WTO members had agreed on a text
which set out a balanced framework for how this matter should be
dealt with, and the relationship between trade and core labor
standards was not inscribed on the WTO Agenda.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of developing countries strongly opposed, before
and during the conference, the West's attempt to link trade with
the observance of labor standards, criticizing it as a disguised
form of protectionism on the part of certain Western countries.
Therefore, they maintained that the labor clause should not be
mentioned in the declaration.

<TEXT>
<P>
After five days of intensive negotiations, entirely behind the
closed doors, the ministers finally agreed that the members renew
their commitment to the observance of internationally recognized
core labor standards, while acknowledging that the International
Labor Organization is the competent body to set and deal with
these standards.
</P>
<P>
However, they also made it clear that they reject the use of
labor standards for protectionist purposes, and agree that the
comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-wage
developing countries, must in no way be put into question.
</P>
<P>
As was reflected in the declaration, the ministers also reached
consensus on such issues as trade and investment, competition
policy, and government procurement during the conference, which
started on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement at the conference was the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA), which was described by Sir Leon
Brittan as the "biggest tariff-busting deal since the Uruguay
Round."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which was initially proposed by the United
States, the current 28 signatory economies will have to reduce
their tariffs on more than 100 information technology products to
zero by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But some developing countries were not happy with the fact that
the conference, originally intended to review the implementation
of the Uruguay Round agreements, on agriculture and textile and
clothing in particular, was sort of "hijacked" by "new issues"
such as the ITA.
</P>
<P>
A Thai journalist said people were just wandering why the
agriculture and textile issues, which had substantial bearings on
the exports of some developing countries, seemed to have
disappeared from the conference discussions.
</P>
<P>
More developing countries, in addition, complained to WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero and Chairman Yeo about what they
referred to as a lack of transparency in the process through which
some provisional agreements, like ITA and the Investment
Agreement, have been struck, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told a
press conference.

<P>
The US-proposed ITA was first agreed upon between the US and
the European Union (EU), and then, among the "Quad countries,"
namely the US, the EU, Japan and Canada, before it was put into
the Ministerial Declaration of the Conference.
</P>
<P>
Both the chairman and the director-general admitted the
justification for these developing countries to voice their
concerns and the two men pledged to work toward improving the
transparency of the system without rendering it any less
efficient, Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that these complaints and concerns reflected
a fundamental problem with the WTO, or in other words, the need
for the WTO to adjust itself to the ever increasing role the
developing countries are playing in the global trade activities.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator in the Geneva-based WTO,
said at the conference that all the subject matters, including the
Investment Agreement, should be fully discussed among all parties.
</P>
<P>
He urged the WTO to "seriously" cope with the changes of the
composition of its membership, and pay more attention to the
interests of developing countries in the multilateral trading
system.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing economic interdependence among countries
today, the negligence of the interests of developing countries
might end up in damaging the interests of developed countries,
Long observed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, over-emphasis on trade liberalization, in
disregard of the current stages of economic development of
developing countries, might lead to a situation where one finds
open but non-existing market.
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, it would be the biggest failure of the
trade liberalization, he warned.

<HEADLINE> Video-Phone Conference Held on Agricultural Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Council today
sponsored a national video-phone conference on the first national
survey of agriculture, which is due to be launched January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua spoke on behalf of the State Council,
China's cabinet, while Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun presided over
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two vice-premiers both called on local governments and
agricultural survey departments at all levels and other
participants to do their best to make the survey a success.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou said that the survey is a major measure taken
by the Communist Party of China and the State Council in
conformity with the necessity of the agricultural and rural work
in the present period.
</P>
<P>
Zou asked localities to make sure that registration work
on-the-spot investigation will not add burdens to rural farmers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the survey will help serve the government's macro
decision-making work and should not impose additional levies on
farmers, he said, noting that farmers should actively assist the
the work of surveying.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Vice-Premier Jiang demanded that local
governments at all levels, rural survey departments and relevant
State Council, competent authorities in particular, fully
understand the problems involved and complexity of the work and
strive to make all preparations carefully.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials should be present on the spot, making strict
check-ups step by step and setting up a perfect system for quality
control and approval, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Vows Retaliation Against Israel to Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) today marked the 9th anniversary of its establishment,
vowing to avenge the killing by Israel of its chief bomb-maker
Yehya Ayyash nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Gaza, Hamas' military wing Izzadin
Hassim Brigades said it remained committed to carrying out the
policy of resistance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Referring to its relative silence since conducting four
suicide bombings from late February to early March that killed 58
people in Israel, Izadin Hassim said it was adjusting itself
after the Palestinian Authority's (PA) crackdown.
</P>
<P>
"In the future the cowards will find united ranks, solid
forces and firm armor," the statement warned.
</P>
<P>
The statement vowed retaliation against the assassination of
Ayyash last January, believed to be carried out by Israeli special
agents.
</P>
<P>
The retaliation "will be very strong, painful and hurting," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the basic obstacle to its new start of military
attacks in Israel was merely technical issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 25,000 Hamas activists held demonstrations in
Gaza today, many of whom shouted anti-Israeli slogans and calling
for retaliation to mark the first anniversary of Ayyash's death.
</P>
<P>
Today's demonstration was approved by the PA, which wants to
send Israel a strong warning message about the current deadlock in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The PA has launched a widespread crackdown on the Hamas
movement and its support infrastructure in the territories since
March, thus greatly weakening its ability to carry out attacks in
Israel.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR, Tanzania Trying to Persuade Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- UNHCR and Tanzanian authorities
are trying to persuade refugees back to camps and Rwanda after
hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the camps in fear that they
might be killed back home, UNHCR spokeswoman Pam O'Toole said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Rumors were spreading in the refugee camps that mass graves had
been dug in Rwanda and children had been murdered there, O'Toole
said at a press briefing. She told reporters that people remained
in the camps were either sick or elderly and a large number of
children might have been left in the camps. UNHCR, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is trying "to find the
situation of these people to offer them aid", she said.
</P>
<P>
"High Commissioner Mrs Sadako Ogata is continuing her contact
with Tanzanian authorities on the movement of the refugees at
local level and up to the president's office," O'Toole said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR staff in Tanzania, O'Toole said, "Refugees are
moving through forested areas, where they can't be followed by
truck. They do have food, but forest is full of testy flies, which
could cause problems."
</P>
<P>
She said, "The Tanzanian authorities are holding meetings at
highest level Friday morning to decide how to respond to the
situation. They are confident that they can intercept the
refugees. When they reach clear ground and they can get them
return back towards camps without the use of force."
</P>
<P>
"We would hope they could separate the refugees from the
intimidators," O'Toole pointed out. "We intend to be there to
monitor the situation. We want to set up aid stations to assist
these people. The camps could be used as such. We eventually want
them to return to Rwanda. But there has always been the
possibility of screening those who really feel unable to return
and see if there is good reason for them to be extended
international protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a statement made on Wednesday, United Nations
High Commissioner fo Human Rights Jose Ayala-Lasso said, "I am
deeply disturbed by the deteriorating human rights situation in
Burundi", where more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of Hutu
refugees, were killed by the army in two months between October
and November.
</P>
<P>
Ayala-Lasso appealed to the authorities in Burundi and to all
parties concerned "to assure maximum respect for all rights and
fundamental freedoms and put and end to killings, arbitrary
arrests and destruction of property".

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Leaves for Aid Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri left here this afternoon for Washington to attend an aid
conference for his country's postwar reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
On his way to the U.S. capital, Hariri will have a one-day stop
in Paris where he will be joined by Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz, who left Beirut Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited some 30 countries, as
well as leading international lending organizations like the
World Bank, to attend the one-day conference of Lebanon's Friends
in Washington on December 16.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, in a telegram sent to his
U.S. counterpart Clinton today, said the holding of the conference
"constitutes an axial event in the relations between Lebanon and
the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Its occurrence in the present circumstances indicates
Washington's commitment to make Lebanon retrieve its independence,
prosperity, democracy and free it from the Israeli occupation
through the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution
425," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from a 1,100-square-kilometer border strip the Jewish state has
occupied in south Lebanon since late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president believed that the conference will
"succeed in providing new helps for Lebanon's achievement of
rehabilitation and stability."
</P>
<P>
The conference was called for by the United States, as part of
a limited cease-fire arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, in
the wake of a 17-day Israeli blitz against Muslim guerrillas in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon seeks 5 billion dollars from the conference to finance
31 projects. But senior officials have played down the
expectations of achieving the target figure.
</P>
<P>
"I would stress the political side of the conference rather
than just the financial aspect," Yassin Jaber, the minister of
trade and economy, was quoted by Beirut's English Daily Star
newspaper Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We may not receive five billion dollars from countries
attending the conference, but we will get financial support,"
said the minister, who is a member of the Lebanese official
delegation led by Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The Washington conference will be opened jointly by
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Hariri and at the
end of the conference, the participants will issue a statement,
declaring their commitments to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 65 Lebanese companies will also attend
the conference where they are expected to back the government's
fund-raising drive and outline investment opportunities in
Lebanon.

<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwen Vice-President Simon
Muzenda today criticized the growing indiscipline within ZANU
(PF) which he said, is causing divisions and undermining the
party's organisational capacity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the party's national conference in Bulawayo which
is being attended by 5000 delegates, Muzenda said indiscipline
had permeated the party so much that even the party's leader,
President Robert Mugabe, is now a victim of personal attacks by
members.
</P>
<P>
''Where is the party's discipline here? How many of us
assembled here are free of engineering these attacks?'' Muzenda
asked, adding that it is no wonder the party haS lost some
elections to independents.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed the widely held view that the growing
movement of party rebels who became independents are getting
active support from within ZANU PF.
</P>
<P>
''It is such factionalism that leads to some party leaders
campaigning for independents against party candidates,'' said
Muzenda.
</P>
<P>
He said some ZANU PF members of parliament have set themselves
up as the official opposition by attacking party policies and
government ministers who presented the policies.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the delegates that ZANU PF had been sucessful
during the armed struggle because of discipline and sound
structures.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Says No Violence on Peaceful Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic has promised not to resort to violence to crack down the
peaceful demonstrations in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"No violence whatever will be applied against peaceful
demonstrators in Yugoslavia," Milosevic said Thursday in a letter
to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in reply to
Christopher's letter of December 9 concerning recent situation in
Serbia. The letter was released by official Tanjug news agency
early Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Peace and democracy, along with economic development,
constitute the basis of our policy and the highest interest of our
citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been large-scale peaceful demonstrations in Belgrade
over the past four weeks, organized by opposition coalition
Zajedno, to protest the annulment of results of second round of
election on local authorities in which the opposition claimed
victory in most cities.
</P>
<P>
However, Milosevic said the claims of the opposition parties
that the Serbian authorities have annulled local elections was not
true and "is a fanciful invention."
</P>
<P>
The Serbian president explained that in Serbia there were more
than 10,000 polling stations, voting was completed in 96.5 percent
of the stations without repetition, and was repeated in only 3.5
percent due to irregularities established exclusively by electoral
commissions or regular courts of justice.
</P>
<P>
"At repeated elections, at the same polling stations, with the
same candidates and the same voters, candidates as well as parties
stand the same chances. We do not know of anything in world
practice that would be more democratic. Consequently, the claim

DUBLIN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that his government supports the Irish
version of a new European Union (EU) draft treaty but ruled out
the possibility of making serious decisions at the EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Dublin for the

differences with other EU countries on many issues.
</P>
<P>
"There are some issues where we clearly have a different view
from our European partners and we have very clear-cut positions
and we will stick to them," Major said.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is opposed to greater EU integration, holds
quite different views with its continental partners over the
issues on the single currency, institution reform and common
security and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a summit in which serious decisions are
going to be taken. What I expect is that we will endorse the
Presidency text as the basis for negotiations during the
Inter-Governmental Conference," Major said.

<HEADLINE> US Business Inventories Up Sharply in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. business inventories
rose by 0.5 percent in October, the biggest growth in three
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that inventories totaled a seasonally
adjusted 1.011 trillion dollars in the month, up from 1.006
trillion in September when they edged up just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest increase since an identical 0.5 percent
advance in July. The largest increase in business inventories so
far this year was a 0.6 percent jump in January.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 724.2
billion dollars in October, compared to 722.7 billion in
September. The growth rate was a small 0.2 percent in the month,
much slower than the 0.7 percent pace a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.4 in October,
up slightly from 1.39 a month earlier. The ratio means it would
take 1.4 months to exhaust stockpiles at the October sales rate.
</P>
<P>
Retailers piled up the biggest backlog of goods in October, a
0.7 percent increase as the holiday shopping season approached.
</P>
<P>
Inventories were up by 0.6 percent at the wholesale level and
0.3 percent at factories.
</P>
<P>
Both retailers and wholesalers rang up 0.3 percent gains in
sales in October, while manufacturers registered a mere 0.1
percent advance.
</P>
<P>
Although inventory buildups boost the U.S. economic growth at
the time, they also threaten a slowdown if not matched by sales.

<HEADLINE> EU Fails to Strike Eve-of-Summit Deal on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) finance
ministers today failed to strike an agreement on the single
European currency ahead of the EU Summit, leaving the hard nut to
presidents and prime ministers who are to meet later today.
</P>
<P>
Despite some improvement in the wording of the pact, which is
aimed to ensure stability of the single European currency, the
ministers' 11-hour marathon talks failed to resolve the
differences over details of the implementation of euro, the common
currency due to be launched in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which ran into 3 a.m., approved the whole package
except for the leverage to be given to nations slipping in holding
to strict economic criteria after the monetary union is initiated,
such as running national budget deficits in excess of 3 percent
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Germany, backed by the Netherlands, Austria and Luxembourg,
insisted on automatic fines of up to 0.5 percent of GDP against
the fouling countries, saying flexibility in monetary discipline
would weaken the euro and trigger inflation.
</P>
<P>
However, most other EU countries, considering it too harsh to be
complied, argued for certain conditions for exemption.
</P>
<P>
A compromise deal was sent to EU leaders to decide on how
seriously a nation must be hit by a recession before they can be
exempted from the punishments.
</P>
<P>
Bonn, the paymaster of the 15-nation bloc, has been firmly
opposed to any lowering of standards nations need to meet to
qualify for the common currency.
</P>
<P>
It sought the "stability pact" to assure an euro as strong as
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn, who chaired the talks and
whose country is holding the rotating EU presidency, told
reporters early this morning that his EU colleagues have failed to
agree on the precise economic figures regarding the stability act.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to comment on the prospects of the EU leaders reaching
a final agreement on the issue, Quinn said they have 48 hours to
do so.
</P>
<P>
He said Ireland, whose presidency ends on December 31 of this
year, is determined to get a deal done on the single European
currency, EU cooperation on fighting drugs and on employment.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit, the EU leaders will also discuss an
unfinished reform program on the bloc's expansion into eastern and
central Europe.

<HEADLINE> Nkomo Quashes Speculation Over Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-President
Joshua Nkomo today tried to quash speculation over his early
retirement from active politics due to advanced age and ill
health.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo, 80, has been widely expected to step down from party
politics and government service after he fell ill most of this
year and would receive specialists' treatment from South Africa
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the on-going ruling ZANU PF national confernce in
Bulawayo, Nkomo said : ''I have not been active for most of this
year due to my ill health. However, i would like to assure all
of you that i am well on my way to full recovery and will soon be
up and about."
</P>
<P>
His speech is an indicator of his intention to continue active
politics and help resolve some of the problems, especially
factionalism, that threatened the party's support base.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo promised that he will continue to highlight the economic
imbalances between the majority blacks and the minority whites
and the high rate of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
''This conference should try to come up with proposals on how
these problems can be controlled or indeed prevented,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Protesting Greek Farmers Open Northern Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Movement to and from Bulgaria
through the Promachona border station in northern Greece was
restored today after a roadblock set up dismantled by farmers,
who entered their 16th day of nationwide blockades of national
highways and rail links.
</P>
<P>
A huge convoy of stranded lorries began crossing the border to
and from Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The dismantling of the border blockaded in effect opened up a
channel of communication between thousands of Greek enterprises in
Bulgaria and Romania with Greece, from where they procure
merchandise and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
However in Thessaly in central Greece, the heart of the revolt,
dozens of tractors swelled the roadblocks. According to reports,
people leaving some of the roadblocks in the north were going to
man more important posts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Farmers began setting up roadblocks with their tractors
throughout the country on November 28, demanding cheaper
fertilizer and fuel for agricultural use, higher produce prices,
increased subsidies and favorable debt settlements.

<HEADLINE> Osteoporosis Affects Middle-aged Women: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Half of all middle-aged women
will suffer from an osteoporotic fracture of the vertebral column,
hip or wrist in their later years, scientists has told a medical
congress in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greek professor of pathology Socratis Papapoulos told
participants at the congress which ended here Thursday that
osteoporosis was a serious condition, also known as "brittle
bone" disease, which affects 40 percent of women and 15 percent
of men over the age of 40.
</P>
<P>
"What we should realize is that this problem keeps on growing
and that the only way to stop it is through a safe and efficient
therapeutic method," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, medical surveys recorded over 1.7 million cases of of
osteoporotic fracture worldwide. About 1.66 million were hip
fractures. It is estimated that by the year 2025, the number of
osteoporotic patients who fracture their hips will rise to 3.94
million and in 2050, it will reach 6.26 million.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that about 20 percent of patients who fracture
their hip die due to complications within a year. The remaining 80
percent need to be hospitalized for a long period in special
clinics, while 50 percent never fully recover.
</P>
<P>
Papapoulos, current head of the research department on bone
metabolism at the university hospital of Leiden, in Holland, said
the disease affected women more than men because the former lose
bone mass faster after menopause.
</P>
<P>
He said it is hard to diagnose osteoporosis because there are
no apparent symptoms in its early stages. That's why it is
important for women over 40 to have regular check-ups.
Additionally, people who do not exercise, smoke heavily, consume
alcohol, don't have a sufficient calcium intake or are underweight
are more likely to develop osteoporosis.

<HEADLINE> Extension of Amnesty Application Deadline Announced in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinha) -- South Afrcian President
Nelson Mandela announced today that the dealine for amnesty
applications to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
will be extended to May 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Mandela also announced that
the cut-off date for acts which qualify for amnesty will extend
to May 10, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the announements after meeeting Freedom Front
leader Constand Viljoen and TRC deputy Chairman Alex Boraine,
both of whom said they were delighted about the concession.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was formed by the government to charge with human
rights violation cases left over by the apartheid South African
regime.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the decision is one of the most difficult tasks
he has to take becuase those qualifying for amnesty had caused
much pain and suffering through their deeds.
</P>
<P>
"But...on balance I am persuaded that it will help further
consolidate nation-building and reconciliation in a manner that
is all-inclusive."
</P>
<P>
Prior to Mandela's announcement, the deadline for amnesty
applications is the midnight of December 14, this year.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he will sign a proclamation to put the extended
deadline for amnesty applications into effect. The new cut-off
date for acts which qualify for amnesty will require parliament's
approval as the orignial date is contained in the interim
constitution, he added.

LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Defense Staff
College is expected to recruit foreign students in the sub-region

This was revealed by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba here
today when he officiated the first graduation ceremony of the
college.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the recruitment of foreign students will
complete the defense training exchange program in the sub-region
which had been one sided because Zambia is only sending military
personnel for training abroad without training foreign students
at home.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chiluba commended the Zambian defense force for
the unity exhibited in upholding the national integrity at home
and its commendable job in peace-keeping missions abroad.

<HEADLINE> Amsterdam Defends Its Position among European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Amsterdam is one of the six
best known business centers in Europe. London holds top position,
followed by Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt and Milan. The Dutch
capital occupies third place in terms of distribution facilities,
after Frankfurt and Paris.
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings of a recent survey of senior
executives and directors of 509 businesses in nine European
countries, conducted by the British Harris Research Center.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release, quoting the results of the
survey, from World Trade Center Amsterdam, the Dutch capital
belongs to the top five cities regarding a company's choice of
location, together with London, Paris, Frankfurt and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the best fiscal climate, Amsterdam again
scores well, taking fourth place.
</P>
<P>
Brussels and London take the top two places in terms of
multilingualism, followed by the traditionally cosmopolitan
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Office costs in Amsterdam are at the same level as in
Dusseldorf, but are below those in Paris, and far cheaper than in
Vienna, Oslo or Zurich.
</P>
<P>
The press released noted that while the Dutch capital is not
yet one of the top financial centers in Europe(London and
Frankfurt being the leaders of the field), the merger as of 1
January 1997 of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Europe
Option Exchange to form Amsterdam Exchanges(AEX) is likely to
bring Amsterdam into close contention with Berlin and Paris,
numbers three and four in Europe.
</P>
<P>
While the overall score of a number of cities(Dusseldorf,
Dublin, Stockholm and Rome) has fallen since last year, Amsterdam
has managed to sustain its position, with improvements in the area
of market accessibility(up from position seventh to sixth),
transport(from fifth to fourth) and telecommunications(from
seventh to sixth).

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched
construction of a strategic railway, which will shorten the
surface transport distance between the central Asian republics and
the Persian Gulf by nearly 800 kilometers.

JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Supreme
Court today turned down the ruling African National Congress

The ANC suggested that Free State Premier Patrick Lekota be

Board Chairman Ivy Matesepe-casaburri as the only candidate to
Lekota's premiership, South African Press Association (SAPA)

</P>
<P>
However, the Supreme Court overtuned the ANC suggestion and
ruled in favor of an application by Edmund Qhali of Rocklands,
Bloemfontein.
</P>
<P>
The application, opposed by the ANC, was logged on the grounds
that Matesepe-casaburri's name does not appear on the ANC's
candidate list, nor is she a member of the Free State
legislature, SAPA said.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Recovers Arms from Foreigners' Homes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peacekeeping Force
in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, has recovered a "large number" of arms in
the homes of foreigners in Monrovia, capital of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The weapons included "assault rifles, pistols and several
others," said Major-General Malu, Commander of the force, quoted
by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, which followed a tip-off and search by ECOMOG of
the residences of some foreigners in Monrovia, "was made a few days
ago". And the names of the foreigners involved have not been
disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Malu called on "expatriates and
other non-Liberians living in Liberia to surrender arms in their
possession as part of the on-going disarmament exercise desgined to
rid Liberia of all weapons" in line with a peace agreement signed last
August in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to him, ECOMOG has found that some foreigners in Liberia are
harboring a large quantity of arms and ammunition in their houses,
thus the call became "imperative".
</P>
<P>
"All foreigners are therefore advised, in their own interest, to
hand over the ECOMOG any weapon in their possession not later than
January 31, 1997," the deadline for the voluntary disarmament of
combatants under the Abuja peace accord.  enditem

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- An International Peace
Academy (IPA) opened a seminar on peace-making and peace-keeping at
the conference center of the United Nations Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the opening session, Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) said
that according to the mandate of the Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution, the OAU should have as its
main focus, the prevention of conflicts and related activities.
</P>
<P>
Given the diversities and challenges of dealing with actual
conflict situations on the continent, the whole question of
peace-making and peace-keeping constitutes an important area of
major interest and preoccupation for the OAU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to African peace-keeping capacities, Salim said,
''Over the decades, Africa has gained a lot of invaluable
experiences and produced personnel with credible expertise
comparable to what exists in other parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
''Many outstanding African military officers have successfully
led U.N.mandated military operations in different parts of the
world and in the continent,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
D.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary of the ECA, said in the past
three decades there have been nearly 30 cases of civil strife in
sub-Saharan Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
According to Amoako, since the early sixties, an estimated 10
million people, the vast majority of whom are civilian, have lost
their lives as a result of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said at present, over half of the world refugees are found
in Africa. In Rwanda, the humanitarian costs during the first two
weeks of the recent emergency refugee relief operation was nearly
2 billion U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
''In sub-Saharan African alone, military spending rose from
less than one percent of GNP in 1960 to more than three percent
in 1990," Amoako added.
</P>
<P>
The 9-day seminar is organized by the IPA in cooperation with
the OAU with support from the government of Denmark. Participants
are from the OAU secretariat, diplomatic missions in Addis Ababa
that are members of the OAU central organ, and a number of
Non-Governmental Organizations based here.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of Uganda has
expressed regret to learn that Zaire intends to table a
resolution in the Security Council of the United Nations accusing
Uganda of invading its territory.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
here today said contrary to Zaire's allegations, forces
originating from inside Zaire territory invaded Uganda on
November 13 this year and occupied Uganda's towns of Bwera,
Karambi and Mpondwe, where a lot of property was looted and
innocent Ugandans were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army repulsed the attackers who retreated in
disarray to their bases in Zaire, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that on November 19, the Ugandan border
town of Mpondwe was shelled by forces in the Zairean border town
of Kasindi and the Ugandan army responded by destroying the
positions of the invading forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Uganda categorically rejects
Zaire's claims that the Ugandan army participated in the fighting
in Beni and other towns in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It added that Zaire should acknowlege the fact that the
problem in eastern Zaire is a result of its own oppressive
policies against a section of its citizenry. enditem

<HEADLINE> Philips Likely to Sell Cable-Operator Unit: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Philips Electronics NV was
considering selling or spinning off its half of Europe's largest
cable-television, it was reported by the International Herald
Tribune today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated that the Dutch electronics company's
interest in United and Philips Communications(UPC) could fetch 1.2
billion guiders(694 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cor Boonstra, who became president of Philips in October, has
repeatedly said he would do virtually anything to enhance value
for the company's shareholders and would not wait for unprofitable
units to rebound.
</P>
<P>
Selling Philips's interest in UPC would dissolve the Philips
Media business built up in the past two years by Jan Timmer, Mr.
Boonstra's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
But the report said it was not clear who might be interested in
buying access to UPC's 2.1 million customers in 14 European
countries.

express his "personal assurance of friendship and solidarity"
after France cast its vote for Ghanaian Kofi Annan at the United

LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has provided
137.9 million US Dollars for Nigeria's environmental management
programs in its 36 states, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
As counterpart funding, the Nigerian government has equally
paid 1.3 billion Naira (about 1.63 million Dollars) to these
states, the government-owned agency said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an environmental expert as saying that the Nigerian
government used to focus on economic and physical development,
while paying little attention to the lack of the environmental
component.
</P>
<P>
Therefore "most national and sectoral plans in the past had
failed," said Professor Cladele Osibanjo, a consultant of the
World Bank and Nigeria's Federal Environmental Protection Agency
on the state environmental action plan for three southeastern
states, at a workshop.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop held at the port city of Calabar in
southeastern Nigeria today is chiefly aimed at creating more
awareness, seeking inputs and guidance, as well as developing a
vision for sustainable environmental development in the future.

including four NATO members, will be set up to monitor Iraq and
protect Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
The air reconnaissance force comprising of U.S., French,
British and Turkish forces, will replace the Operation Provide
Comfort (OPC) which ends as of December 31, Erbakan told reporters
before attending a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The OPC force, also made up of the four countries' forces, was
established in line with a Turkish parliamentary decision made on
January 17, 1991 and deployed at the Incirlik air base of Adana,
southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to provide air protection to the Kurds living
in northern Iraq against any possible action by the Iraqi
government in the wake of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that Turkish and U.S. military officials
are expected to meet Monday or Tuesday to discuss the demise of
the OPC and define the new rules for the coalition air force which
will be stationed on Turkish soil.
</P>
<P>
The new air force would be allowed to monitor Iraqi military
buildup and its mass destruction weapons, they said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that this issue will be presented to the
Turkish parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has voiced his opposition to the extension of the OPC
mandate in view of the recent developments in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israel Attacked by Katyusha Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A number of Katyusha
rockets were fired this evening into the western Galilee in
northern Israel, causing no injuries and damages, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Katyusha attack on northern Israel since
the April ceasefire agreement that ended Israel's Grape of Wrath
military operation against Hezbollah targets in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The operation came in response to Katyusha attacks by the
Hezbollah guerillas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army spokesman told Israel Radio that the Katyusha
rockets were fired from the Khalah area in south Lebanon, an
outrage violation of the truce, which forbids any attack on
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
No groups have yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Officers of the Israeli army's Northern Command cannot tell
whether the rockets were fired by Hezbollah or other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The rocket attack is believed to be a retaliation for an
Israeli army shelling incident in south Lebanon, in which seven
Lebanese civilians were wounded a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army has claimed that the shellings were directed at
Hezbollah gunmen during an exchange of fire after an Israeli
soldier was killed by a roadside charge in the Israeli
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Electric Corporation Raises Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's main electricity
supplier has announced that it has raised 600 million
U.S. dollars in an overseas offering of debentures, the largest
private offering ever carried out by an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post reported that the capital was raised at
the end of a nine-day road show in six cities in the U.S., headed
by Gad Ya'acobi, chairman of the Israel Electric Corporation
(IEC), and general manager Rafi Peled.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the offering will be used to help finance the
company's development plans for the next three years, which
amount to about 4.5 billion shekels (some 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
The debentures were purchased by large U.S. institutional
investors through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers, Solomon
Brothers served as the secondary underwriter, while the Bank of
New York was the trustee for the offering.
</P>
<P>
IEC offered debentures for 10, 30 and 100 years, and this is
the first time debentures for 100 years were offered.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important breakthrough for the Electric
Corporation and a show of confidence in the company by the
largest capital market in the world," IEC said in a press
release.

<HEADLINE> US Bank Profits Reach 13.2 Bln Dlrs in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Bank profits hit 13.2
billion dollars in the third quarter despite a continued worsening
in credit card loans, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
(FDIC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The profits of U.S. commercial banks were down by 4.3 percent
from second quarter earnings of 13.8 billion and down from the
all-time record earnings of 13.83 billion in the third quarter of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline resulted mainly from a one-time 650-million-dollar
special assessment to revive the thrift deposit insurance fund.
Banks contributed to the Savings Association Insurance Fund
bailout because they acquired S&AMP;Ls and their deposits during the
industry's crisis in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1996, bank earnings in the U.S.
totaled 38.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
By numerous measures, the nation's 9,586 FDIC-insured
commercial banks enjoy record health, with the highest capital
levels since 1941, the FDIC said.
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman Ricki Helfer forecast that "bank earnings remain
on track to surpass 50 billion dollars in annual earnings for the
first time at year end."
</P>
<P>
The percentage of delinquent credit card loans rose to 4.5
percent in the third quarter, up from 4.1 percent in the prior
quarter, the FDIC report said.
</P>
<P>
Delinquencies are approaching the peak levels in 1991, the most
recent recession, and U.S. banks continued to charge off bad credit
card loans at a high rate.

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Mandate of Tajikistan Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
today decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission
of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) until next March 15.
</P>
<P>
By its unanimous adoption of resolution 1089, the council
decided that the UNMOT extension was subject to the proviso that
the 1994 Tehran Agreement on a cessation of hostilities remained
in force and the parties demonstrated their commitment to a
cease-fire, to national reconciliation and to the promotion of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon the parties to comply fully
with the Tehran Agreement which called for a cease-fire, and the
cessation of other hostile acts on the Tajik-Afghan border and
within the country for the duration of the peace talks, and to
cooperate with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
in resuming inter-Tajik talks in order to achieve a comprehensive
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The council condemned violations of the cease-fire by the
parties, terrorist acts against members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States Peacekeeping Forces and of the Russian Border
Forces, and the mistreatment of members of the UNMOT by both
parties.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOT, consisting of 96 military observers and civilian
staff, was established on December 16, 1994 by the Security
Council. Its mandate includes assisting the Joint Commission to
monitor the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, to
investigate reports of the cease-fire violations, to provide
good-offices, and to maintain close contact with the parties to
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council on the situation
in Tajikistan, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali noted that
the overall situation in Tajikistan has deteriorated in the last
three months. The cease-fire has been frequently violated by both
the government forces and opposition.
</P>
<P>
As Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov and United Tajik
Opposition leader Abdullo Nuri were ready to meet in northern
Afghanistan and Moscow by the end of the year, he recommended an
extension of the UNMOT.

<HEADLINE> US Opens Removal Proceedings for Algerian Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States opened
proceedings today to exclude an exiled Algerian opposition figure
from the country after denying his request for asylum in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Anwar Haddam, head of the Washington-based Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) Parliamentary Delegation, was appearing before an
immigration judge this morning for a closed-door "master calendar"
hearing.
</P>
<P>
The judge will make a determination on the case after a series
of hearings and the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS)
will begin deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
If he is deported, it is up to Haddam to designate the country
to which he will be returned. That country has 90 days to respond
to his request, and if there is no response, or the response is
negative, the U.S. government will make a designation for him.
</P>
<P>
Haddam entered the United States in April 1993 and filed a
request with the immigration services for asylum. But the INS
denied his request on October 3 this year and took him into
custody last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Haddam' wife and child, who are in the United States with
him, are also facing deportation, but are not being detained, an
INS spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Said Lahlali, vice president of the Paris-based FIS
Parliamentary Delegation, confirmed Haddam's arrest in a
communique and said the arrest took place under "inhuman
conditions." And he held the United States responsible for
Haddam's security and physical and mental well-being.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will host a summit between the United States and the European
Union (EU) at the White House Monday, during which the two sides
are expected to show their differences in the transatlantic trade
and try to reach some agreements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said today that
the major issue will be a review of progress in implementing the
new transatlantic agenda, which Clinton and his European
counterparts signed in Madrid a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The summit will also discuss global trade, collaboration in the
fight against drugs, aid programs in Central and Eastern Europe
and Africa, and economic reconstruction in Bosnia, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, the dispute between Cyprus and
Turkey and the U.S. and EU relations with Cuba will also be on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
On the transatlantic trade, U.S. officials expect some
agreements on the high-technology and medical industries, but they
put little hope on significant progress on the major U.S.-European
trade dispute involving agricultural subsidies.

<HEADLINE> UK Teachers Rush for Early Retirement, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- One in six teachers in Britain
over 50 is rushing to retire next Easter to beat the government's
restriction on pensions, according to a union survey.
</P>
<P>
Figures released recently by the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers suggested more than 11,700
teachers want to take early retirement on March 31, nearly 3,000
more than those who usually opt to go early in a year.
</P>
<P>
Union General Secretary Nigel de Gruchy warned of a "crisis of
teacher supply" in the summer term of 1997 in the wake of
predicted mass departures.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government's attempt to keep older, more
experienced teachers from leaving by making early retirement
harder had backfired.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will come into force on April 1 if approved.
Local education authorities say they will make early retirement
for teachers prohibitively expensive and warn that some of the
staff will now be forced to stay on until they are 60.
</P>
<P>
Teaching unions claim the deadline will cause particular
problems because it falls in the middle of the academic year,
leaving some classes with a change of teacher just before exams.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest the long-term effect of the changes will be a
build-up of older, more costly staff in schools -- draining
budgets and ultimately blocking posts which could have gone to new
teachers entering the profession.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declines Endorsement on Bombing Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President bill Clinton
today declined to endorse Saudi Arabian evidence that said Iran
was behind the June 25 truck bombing on a U.S. military barracks
in Dhahran air base, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Clinton said, "The investigation
is not completed." "I have not been presented with any
conclusions, I have not reached any final conclusions myself," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian government recently presented its evidence to
FBI Director Louis Freeh, saying it shows Saudi Shiites backed by
Iran were responsible for the June 25 bombing of the Khoar Towers
military housing complex in Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the United States was planning possible
retaliations against Iran, including strikes on military targets,
in the event Iranian responsibility is proved.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Anything I say about what we might do if we knew
what had happened would only give rise to an inference that I had
really concluded someone was guilty of something that I don't know
they're guilty of yet."
</P>
<P>
"So I can't say more, except to say that we are on top of
this, and we're going to stay on top of it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran denied involvement in the truck bombing, saying it has
become "the target of suspicions based merely on confessions
made by shady and anonymous figures."

<HEADLINE> UK to Carry Out Extra Cattle Cull to End Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A selective cull of up to
125,000 extra cattle will be announced by the British government
next Monday in a last-ditch attempt to ease the European Union's
(EU) worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said that EU farm ministers are
expected to discuss the scheme at a two-day meeting in Brussels
starting the same day.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke
has approved the estimated 150-200 million pounds (247-330 million
US dollars) needed for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The cull of cattle thought to be at most risk of developing
BSE, or mad cow disease, will be implemented early next year, and
is the only one of the conditions set by the Florence EU summit
last June for easing the ban on British beef that has not been
met.
</P>
<P>
Farmers welcomed the move Thursday night, but Douglas Hogg, the
agriculture minister, is reportedly to be concerned that the new
cull will not be enough to persuade Germany and other sceptical EU
member states to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
In September, Hogg indicated that Britain would not carry out
the selective cull, pointing to new scientific evidence that the
disease would die out from the national herd by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Brussels has made it clear there can be no progress
on lifting the export ban until the selective cull is carried out.

DUBLIN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Dutch central bank governor Wim
Duisenberg was confirmed at the European Union (EU) summit today
as the next president of the European Monetary Institute (EMI)
from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the bloc's 15 member states attending the two-day
summit formally approved Duisenberg to succeed Alexandre
Lamfalussy of Belgium as the EMI chief.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg, widely regarded as the architect of the
Netherlands' strong economy, is one of the favorites to head the
important EU financial post.
</P>
<P>
The EMI, the forerunner of the European Central Bank, is
expected to govern the EU's monetary policy from the beginning of
1999 when the single currency, Euro, is formally launched.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EMI formally unveiled today in Dublin the first
Euro banknotes, which is featured with generic European
architectural designs and bridges.
</P>
<P>
However, European monetary experts are very much likely to
leave room for each EU member state to put a national symbol on
the Euro banknotes.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
criticized Israel's decision to grant tax breaks for Jewish
settlers so they can expand housing in areas claimed by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it's troubling. When one side does something that
seems to preempt the outcome of negotiations, it makes it more
difficult," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Burns showed some differences to what the United
States routinely used in response to the Israeli settlement
expansion. In the past, U.S. remarks on the expansion of
settlement often were "unhelpful" and "complicated" the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the State Department's new phrasing showed
the Clinton administration's patience with hard-line Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not limitless.

<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Britain was stable
in November after October's sharp rise, with the headline rate
staying at 2.7 percent, while the underlying rate, targeted by the
government to get to 2.5 percent or less, stuck at 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Thursday by the Office for
National Statistics, retail prices rose 0.1 percent between
October and November.
</P>
<P>
The price of clothing and footware rose by 1.1 percent in
November, the biggest rise for the time of year since records
began, after rising by a record-breaking 5.2 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
There were also large rises in the price of oil and petrol and
leisure goods while prices for household goods increased by 1
percent during the month.
</P>
<P>
The main downward pressures on inflation came from lower food
prices, which fell 0.4 percent during November to a level only 1.5
percent above a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said that record low factory gate prices would
soon be seen on the high street, easing upward pressure on retail
prices.
</P>
<P>
However, most economists believe that interest rates should go
up if the government wants to hit its underlying inflation target
of 2.5 percent or less.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Seeks to Privatize Telecommunications Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian
government has sent the parliament a general telecommunications
law project setting conditions for the privatization of the
telecommunications sector, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Sergio Motta delivered Thursday the
telecommunications privatization project to the presidents of the
two legislative chambers, Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, of the Chamber
of Deputies, and Jose Sarney, of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The sale of state-run telecommunications enterprises will
produce 100 billion U.S. dollars for the government in five years,
said Motta was quoted as saying by the local press.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian telecommunications enterprises had been privately
owned before the decade of 1960, but the government acquired the
property of them on a gradual basis.
</P>
<P>
The government started to privatize State-run enterprises at
the beginning of this decade. Steel industry began to be
privatized and the sale of state-run electricity companies started
last year.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said recently the
government would accelerate the privatization process next year.

<P>
WUHAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The president of the New Zealand
Chinese Scholars Association said during an ongoing lecture tour
that more and more overseas Chinese scholars are willing to
conduct academic exchanges and cooperation with China, as the
prosperity of their motherland has a direct bearing on them.
</P>
<P>
Li Minru and his colleagues are lecturing at some leading
universities in China, including Wuhan University, Nankai
University, Tianjin University and Sichuan United University.
</P>
<P>
Li teaches at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Chinese scholars in New Zealand
have organized a multi-subject lecture tour to China.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the mission is to introduce the development of
overseas culture and technology to China, and to seek
opportunities to cooperate with Chinese universities and research
institutes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese univerities welcome this move.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pioneering undertaking, and Chinese students welcome
it," commented a leading official at Nankai University.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission launched a project this July to
encourage overseas Chinese scholars to conduct more academic
exchanges with China.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Agricultural Enterprises Suffer Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 13 (Xinhua) -- At least half of Ukraine's
agricultural enterprises were unprofitable, the Statistical
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the nation's 6,642 unprofitable agricultural
enterprises would report a total loss of more than one billion
hrivnas (about 541 million U.S. dollars) at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
It blamed declined output and increased production cost for the
loss.
</P>
<P>
An expert with the ministry said production cost in this sector
grew faster than prices. For example, the production cost of beet
was twice higher than that of last year, but its price went up
only by 1.6 times. So many farms had to cut beet production.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the output of beet sugar declined accordingly. It
was 2.8 million tons this year, 20 percent lower than 1995, said
the expert.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said most of the unprofitable enterprises
were collectively owned.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows More Filipino Women Now Work Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- From a mere 12 percent of the
total number of overseas Filipino workers 21 years ago, women now
comprise half of the four million migrant workers, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a study by the Institute of Labor Study as
saying that women workers who are usually subject to exploitative
terms and conditions abroad are also becoming younger.
</P>
<P>
The same study also showed that foreign employers prefer young
and married women as about half of the two million female workers
belong to the 20-29 age bracket.
</P>
<P>
The institute, an attached agency of the Department of Labor
and Employment, also noted some alarming factors affecting these
women workers particularly those hired as domestic helpers and
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
There is an apparent de-skilling of the female overseas workers
as manifested by mismatches between their jobs and education since
most of them have acquired degrees but were forced to seek jobs
either as house maids or "overseas performing artists", the study
said.

WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A California state law that
bans racial and sex preferences in public jobs and education has
become a controversy with national implications in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The nation's most populous state approved in last month's
election a ballot measure, the Civil Rights Initiative or
Proposition 209. The measure against race- and gender-based
federal affirmative action plans was endorsed by 54 percent of
Californian voters.
</P>
<P>
But Chief District Judge Thelton E. Henderson issued a
temporary restraining order in late November barring the
enforcement of the ballot measure until December 16, when the
court will hear arguments for a preliminary injunction against the
enforcement of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Henderson cited a "strong probability" that the proposition
might be "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, while awaiting the final recommendation
from the Justice Department and White House advisers on whether to
file a court brief supporting a ban on the initiative, called the
proposition a "bad policy of California people, and a bad example
for America."
</P>
<P>
The suit might eventually go to the Supreme Court. But
whatever the result is, the controversy has already caused
wide-spread concern around the country, as there are people in
nearly two dozen other states who want preferences banned in such
areas as hiring, contracting and college admission.
</P>
<P>
In Congress, some are considering anti-Affirmative Action moves.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative Action is a formal effort by the federal government
to provide increased employment opportunities for women and ethnic
minorities to overcome past patterns of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 209 argued that the measure seeks to
prohibit discrimination of all kinds, including "reverse"
discrimination, which they said have resulted from the granting of
special preferences to certain groups.
</P>
<P>
But civil rights lawyers said that the proposition should be
declared unconstitutional because it singles out women and
minorities at a time when discrimination still exits, seeking to
preclude them from attaining constitutionally guaranteed rights,
like jobs and schooling.
</P>
<P>
And there is no denying that discrimination does exit, as
illustrated by a recent string of high-profile race and sex bias
cases.
</P>
<P>
In November, Texco, one of the country's leading oil
corporation, settled a racial discrimination lawsuit with 1,400
current and former minority workers for 176.1 million
U.S. dollars, the biggest-ever lawsuit of this nature. The
two-year-old lawsuit claimed Texco practices racism, reserving the
best promotions and biggest pay raises for whites.
</P>
<P>
In early December, a jury in Richmond, Virginia found a pattern
of intentional racial discrimination at Circuit City Stores Inc.,
one of the country's largest retailers of home electronics and
appliances. The jury awarded two black employees of the company
nearly 300,000 dollars in damages, though Circuit City said the
company will appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
of the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to a 5.9-million-dollar
settlement in a discrimination lawsuit brought by 198 current and
51 former bureau black agents in November 1990. The plaintiffs
said the bureau discriminated against blacks in hiring, promotion
and evaluation, and sought back pay for black agents.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the nation was shocked by the burning of a
string of black churches in the South. At least dozens of the
burnings have been confirmed as racially motivated. Officials of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded that "racial
tensions are a major problem in the states in which the burning
took place."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports of women being harassed in corporations and
even at military bases kept propping up in the media. The Senate
Armed Service Committee has reportedly agreed to hold hearings on
sexual harassment in the military.
</P>
<P>
All the stories go to indicating that discrimination remains a
major problem in the United States. The impact of the struggle
over Proposition 209 may go well beyond the initiative itself.
</P>
<P>
When Deval Patrick, assistant Attorney General of the Justice
Department's civil rights division, resigned last month as a civil
rights chief, he said: "The whole issue of tolerance seems to be
in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
However, Patrick said he was not without hope. "There is a
tremendous reservoir of goodness in the American people, but it
has to be called forth by parents over the breakfast table and by
our leaders."

<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are
business-news-in brief in the Philippines:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Commercial and International Bank (PCIBank),
one the country's biggest universal banks, is eyeing a 100 percent
buyout of the Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCom), said an
industry source who requested anonymity. The source said merger
talks between the two banks are now underway. PCIBank would first
acquire an initial 30 percent of PBCom in the next few months. The
source said PBCom, one of the smaller commercial banks, would have
difficulty raising its capital to 4.5 billion pesos (171 million
U.S. dollars), the new capital requirement of the Philippine
Central Bank. Banks have until 1999 to meet the new capital
requirements.
</P>
<P>
-- Personal consumption expenditures in the Philippines rose by
4.53 percent in the first three quarters of the year to 472.05
billion pesos (18 billion dollars) from 451 billion (17.2 billion
dollars) in the same period last year. Data from the National
Statistical Coordination Board likewise showed that at constant
1985 prices, the share of personal expenditures in gross national
product from January to September this year, however, shrank to
73.97 percent from the year-ago figure of 75.77 percent. At
current prices, personal expenses in the first nine months of the
year totaled 1.16 trillion pesos (44.2 billion dollars), up 14.25
percent from the year-ago figure of 1.01 trillion pesos (38.5
billion dollars), and 28.89 percent higher than the comparative
1994 level of 905.92 billion pesos (34.57 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Nationalists Call for Rally to Mark U.S. Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A Panamanian nationalist
group today called for a demonstration to mark the U.S. invasion
of Panama in 1989 and to demand the end of U.S. military presence
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for the Rescue of Panama's Sovereignty said the
demonstration will be held on December 20, the seventh anniversary
of the invasion.
</P>
<P>
President of the organization, Benjamin Colamarco, said the
march will start at 16:00 local time from the historical Plaza
Porras in downtown Panama City, and will go through the capital's
main avenues till the end in the El Chorrillo neighborhood, which
was destroyed by U.S. bombing during the invasion.
</P>
<P>
There is a monument to heroes and martyrs resisting the
December 20 invasion on a main plaza in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Colamarco said they are also demanding the end of U.S. military
presence in the country after the sovereignty of the Panama Canal
was returned to Panama.
</P>
<P>
"The Committee for the Rescue of the Sovereignty of Panama will
assume on the seventh anniversary of the tragic and criminal U.S.
invasion of the country the central slogan of 'No to the presence
of the U.S. military bases beyond the year 2000'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Another purpose of this march will be to bring back to life
the nationalist sentiment of Panamanians who love their
motherland," Colamarco said.
</P>
<P>
Colamarco also said the Panamanian government should demand the
United States of a war indemnity for the country and for the
Panamanians who were victims of the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Some 27,000 U.S. troops broke into the Central American country
on the night of December 20, killing hundreds of Panamanians,
mainly civilians.
</P>
<P>
The then Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega was
arrested by the Americans and taken to the United States for
trials on drug-trafficking charges. He was later sentenced to 40
years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government Accuse Opposition of Breaching Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government today
accused the opposition of violating the newly-signed cease-fire
accord, saying that the rebels continued to fire at the government
troops, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The rebels opened fire this morning at the Tajik Interior
Ministry's special battalion in Garm, some 150 kilometers east of
the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, four government servicemen were killed and
14 others wounded. No information about the casualties of the
rebels was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Since about 200 rebels captured Garm at the beginning of
December, the government troops have been in a state of siege,
short of water and electricity supplies.
</P>
<P>
The government troops refused the rebels' demand for
disarmament and unconditional capitulation despite the threats of
complete elimination.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government protested against the violation of the
cease-fire accord by the opposition, warning that the opposition
would be responsible for all possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the government forces retain the right to take
measures in response to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Council Secretary Yuri Baturin, who is in
Dushanbe now to mediate between the conflicting sides, said
today that anything possible should be done to avoid any violation
of the cease-fire accord and the protocol on the settlement of the
conflict in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov
and Tajik opposition leader Said Abdullo Nuri during their meeting
in northern Afghanistan on December 11. On the same day, they
signed the cease-fire memorandum in Dushanbe, which took effect as
from midnight of December 12.
</P>
<P>
Baturin said he hoped that the continuing fighting in eastern
Tajikistan would not thwart a meeting between Rakhmonov and Nuri
scheduled for December 19 in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the purpose of his visit to Dushanbe,
which began on Thursday, was to "conduct political consultations
in the run-up to this meeting."

BONN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Dariusz Michalczewski
and Ralf Rocchigiani kept their world titles in Hannover Friday.
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten Michalczewski staged a successful ninth defence of his
World Boxing Organisation (WBO) light-heavyweight title when the
referee stopped his contest against French challenger Christophe
Girard in the eighth of a scheuled 12-round bout.
</P>
<P>
Rocchigiani kept his WBO cruiserweight crown when he
unanimously outpointed Swiss opponent Stefan Angehrn over twelve
rounds.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the 28-year-old Michalczewski, who has
now notched up 33 wins since turning professional, had beaten
Girard. He scored an unconvincing points win over the Frenchman
in a first bout in Cologne in June.
</P>
<P>
This time, however, he took charge from the first bell and soon
had Girard covering up and retreating.
</P>
<P>
Rocchigiani, 33, was defending his title for the fifth time. He
has now won 40 of 54 contests.

<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Zamalek of Egypt lifted a record
fourth African Champions' Cup on Friday when with a 5-4 victory
over 10-man Shooting Stars of Nigeria on penalties in the final.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian side, trailing 2-1 after the first leg in Ibadan,
Nigeria, two weeks ago, won the second leg 2-1 in front of 80,000
crowd to make it 3-3 on aggregate and force the penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
Zamalek had seemed to be on course for a clear-cut win after
going 2-0 up but a lapse in concentration in the dying stages
allowed Stars to draw level on aggregate as substitute Gbenga
Okunowo sneaked a last-minute goal for the outclassed Nigerians
at the end of a bruising encounter.
</P>
<P>
When the final went immediatly into spot-kicks -- African
competitions do not allow for extra time in an aggregate draw --
both teams scored four out of their five regulation penalties
before Ossama Nabil put Zamalek 5-4 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Stars' substitute Ademola Johnson then blasted the ball
against the underside of the bar, and saw it bounce out to give
Zamalek victory.

Codelco authorities said the figure is 43 percent less than the
1.76-billion-dollar profit last year.

and papers.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil's trade deficit will hit 3.8 billion dollars

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua and Honduras will
start border demarcation in the Gulf of Fonseca on the Pacific
coast, Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to fix a specific date in the next
few days to begin the placement of 25 buoys in the gulf that will
mark the maritime border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The placement of demarcation signals in the Gulf of Fonseca,
bordering Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador, will contribute to
solving the problems of illegal fishing in the zone and to
relieving tensions between the two countries, Nicaraguan officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Illegal fishing has caused frequent conflicts, even exchange of
fire between Nicaraguan and Honduran naval forces.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the demarcation will help diminish the capture of
fishing boats, because fishermen will not be able to allege they
do not know the boundaries," said Noel Rivas, Nicaraguan
ambassador to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua and Honduras also have border disputes in the
Atlantic. Both governments have expressed their willingness to
solve their conflicts in a peaceful way.

SOFIA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed workers
in Bulgaria reached more than 460,000 in November, up 8.1 percent
from that in October.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare, among the 460,000 unemployed, those who were not entitled
to unemployment benefit and social allowance totaled 300,000 in
November, 4.2 percent higher than that in October.

<P>
Only 24.6 percent of all the unemployed were entitled to
unemployment benefit, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Labor experts predicted that over 20,000 people would be

</P>
<P>
The ministry said it has opened 385 job training companies to
prepare the unemployed for reemployment.
</P>
<P>
The trade union newspaper "Trud" reported that the anticipated
sharp devaluation of the national currency Lev will prompt another

<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai police chief Pote
Boonyachinda has been transferred to an inactive post at the
government house, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on

conflicts.
</P>

Pote will retain the title of director-general, while Pol Gen
Pracha Promnok, has been assigned as acting director-general.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Khamnung Thammakasem, chief of the crime

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Restrict Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Amnuay
Viravan Friday urged the Thai government to restrict spending
following a Revenue Department report that forecast a dip in tax
revenue in fiscal 1997, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay quoted the report as saying that revenue in the year
ending September 30, 1997, would fall 10.7 billion baht (428
million US dollars) below the 973 billion baht (38.9 billion US
dollars) target. The government's budget for the year has been set
at 984 billion baht (39.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Academics have warned that the department's figures may be too
conservative, saying the revenue shortfall could exceed 10.7
billion baht (428 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But, Amnuay said he was confident the Thai government could
match its budget to the available revenue by putting a strict cap
on spending.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the stalled real-estate sector, Amnuay said he has
already requested several state agencies, such as the transport
and telecommunications ministry, to start economizing.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said the Thai Defense Ministry shows a clear intention
to reduce its budget and would not attempt to make unnecessary
weapon procurements.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
has recommended to the General Assembly that Kofi Annan of Ghana
be appointed U.N. Secretary-General from 1 January 1997 to 31
December 2001.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Friday in a closed-door session after
France dropped its opposition to the 58-year-old African, who is
heading the U.N. peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council has taken an action of great historic
significance," said Chinese Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Qin Huasun to reporters. "By recommending Kofi Annan for
the 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations, the council
fulfilled its sacred responsibility under the U.N. Charter," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the process of the Secretary-General election,
Ambassador Qin said China has been firmly supporting the claim of
African countries that they have the right for a second term.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current world situation, a Secretary-General
selected from the African countries will not only help the
international community to have a better understanding of Africa,
but will also help Africa to contribute more to the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated both Kofi Annan and the African countries for
the desirable result, saying Annan is a remarkable representative
of the African continent, both energetic and experienced.
</P>
<P>
"Under his leadership," he said, "we believe the United Nations
can develop in a healthy and smooth way, thus making greater
efforts in safeguarding world peace and promoting world economic
and social development."
</P>
<P>
In a separate resolution, the council also acknowledged the
contribution of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to
international peace, security and development, his exceptional
efforts to solve international problems in economic, social and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
"During his five-year tenure," Ambassador Qin said,
"Boutros-Ghali has made strenuous efforts for and achieved great
results in adapting the United Nations to the changed post Cold
War situations and strengthening its role in the current world."

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Determined to Defeat No-Trust Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party is
determined to defeat a no-confidence motion against the coalition
government while the opposition is busy garnering support for the
motion in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A central working committee meeting of the main ruling Nepali
Congress (NC) Friday unanimously decided to defeat the
no-confidence motion expected to be tabled at a special session of
the Lower house from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NC party has appealed to all its Lower House MPs to vote
against the motion jointly filed by the main opposition the
communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) and
former coalition partner the National Democratic Party (RPP).
</P>
<P>
The main ruling party also called on MPs of ruling partners and
other parties in the House to vote against the motion.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs of the second ruling partner RPP early this week
withdrew their support for the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
They requested King Birendra to call the special House session
to discuss the no-confidence motion by submitting a petition
signed by 102 MPs claiming they had lost confidence in Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the CPN-UML and the RPP would formed a new
coalition' government led by RPP parliamentary leader Lokendra
Bahadur Chand if the present government is overthrew through the
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of the main opposition CPN-UML party these
days were busying persuading a small leftist party in the Lower
House to support the no-confidence motion, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of Nepal, A no-confidence motion could
be passed only with the support of 103 MPs in the 205-seat Lower
House.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Political Uncertainty Blamed for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The political uncertainty in
India and insensitiveness in macro-management by decision-makers
are widely blamed for a sustained slowdown in economic growth that
has been plaguing the country in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the government led by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda
assumed office in June, there has been general concern about
whether the new government, consisting of "rainbow" small parties
with different policy orientations, would and could further the
country's economic reforms initiated by the former government.
</P>
<P>
Although the reform process has survived in the past few
months, the government's every step forward was challenged by
difficulties and setbacks, which triggered fears for an all-round
economic recession and deepened the concern over the future of the
coalition minority government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistics Organization, India's
export growth in April-September 1996 declined sharply to 9.91
percent from the year-ago level of 26.37 percent, and the import
growth, even more dramatically, to 5.2 percent from 32.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the April-August period, 24 major industries accounting for
50.37 percent of the industrial index registered a growth rate of
5.6 percent, compared with 12.6 percent one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure sector grew by only 3.5 percent as against
11.7 percent in the corresponding period last year, with the
growth of electricity segment falling from 11.7 percent to 2.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made by the Gowda administration included privatizing
public sector enterprises, seeking more foreign direct investment
and developing infrastructure industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has not been able to speak in one voice
in the past few months in office.
</P>
<P>
The general elections in April and May produced a seriously
fractured parliament with none of the major political forces
winning a simple majority needed for a stable government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling United Front of 13 parties, with only 190 out of the
545 seats in Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament), has formed a
minority government heavily dependent on outside support from the
Congress party.
</P>
<P>
The inherent discord and dependence on the Congress party made
it difficult for the new government to carry out a clear-cut
reform policy and make firm and speedy decisions.
</P>
<P>
The Left parties in the United Front have been opposing the
main themes of the economic reforms -- privatizing public sector
enterprises, encouraging foreign direct investments and opening
the insurance market to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
As the Finance and Industry ministries are working hard to woo
foreign investors, the Civil Aviation Ministry has sworn to drive
foreign investors out of the country.
</P>
<P>
All these undoubtedly undermine the government's credibility
and scare away hesitant foreign investors, thwarting the bid of
the Gowda administration for a strong inflow of foreign
investments into the infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
As a result, although the government approved a large number of
agreements with foreign investors, only some 900 million U.S.
dollars of foreign investments flowed into the country as of
September 23, still a long way from the targeted 10 billion U.S.
dollars by March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty in India has also led to tendencies
towards instant gains and insensitiveness to macro-management.
</P>
<P>
To contain inflation, the former Congress party had implemented
a tight money policy, which caused a serious cash crunch and huge
stocks of inventories.
</P>
<P>
Local economists have repeatedly warned that the chain reaction
is leading to a slower pace of economic growth, but it was not
until October 19 that the government announced a delayed cut in
interest rates to ease control on the cash flow.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it would take at least two to three
months before the interest rates cut can influence the economy in
any effective way.
</P>
<P>
They said that the economic prospects of India appear rather
doubtful as the growth slowdown stems more from political reasons
than from economic reasons.

<HEADLINE> Bundestag Okays Ground Mission of German Forces in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Bundestag (Federal
Assembly) today gave the green light to a ground mission of German
soldiers in a new Bosnia peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for German combat troops to take
full part in a ground mission alongside Western allies.
</P>
<P>
The present 4,000-strong German peace-keeping troops are
stationed in Croatia instead of Bosnia to carry out medical aid
and logistic tasks to avoid the revival of bad memories of the
Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Bundestag voted 499-93 with 21 abstentions today to send
3,000 troops to join the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
The German contingent will include 2,000 infantry and armored
vehicle-borne reconnaissance forces that could face combat
situations.
</P>
<P>
Germany will become the fourth largest foreign military force
in Bosnia after the United States, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
The decision is seen as a success of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
efforts to get public acceptance for overseas deployment of German
troops. But a poll showed that more than 50 percent of the
respondents are opposed to the Bosnia mission.

<HEADLINE> Iran Vows to Retaliate if Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ali
Khamenei today warned the United States that the Gulf region will
not be safe if Iran is attacked.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded statement, Khamenei said that Washington
was considering an attack against Iran in retaliation for last
June bombing in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign press reports hinted that Iran was involved in the
bombing, which killed 19 people and wounded more than 200 others
at an American military base in Khobar, near Dhahran. However,
Tehran has repeatedly denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence shows that the present government in the United
States is apparently planning to teach Iran a lesson," said the
Iranian leader, who is also in charge of the country's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a group of Islamic revolutionary guards here,
Khamenei said, "Foreigners must not think that they can make Iran
 unsafe while the region remains safe. If the mischief-makers do
something in this regard, the Iranian nation will not leave any
attacks unanswered."
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio quoted him as saying "Washington's
accusation of the Iranian involvement in the bombing of the
U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia is prelude to the American
move to destabilize Iran."
</P>
<P>
In an indirect reference to Arab rulers, he warned that "they
are living in glass houses" and that their interests would be
endangered as well. "If enemy is ... attacking the Iranian nation
with the propaganda and with allegations that Iran has been
involved in the bombing," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. press last week accused Iran of having a hand in the
last June's bombing.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, have reacted against the charges by the U.S. press,
denying that Tehran has been directly or indirectly involved in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian forces have been on red-light alert over the
possible military attack by the American forces. IRGC Deputy
Commander Rahim Safavi said that his forces were closely
monitoring the military situation in northern Iraq, Turkey,
Afghanistan and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Some countries outside the region, especially the United
States, sell billion of dollars worth of arms to the southern
states of the Gulf and deploy dozens of military vessels in the
Gulf along with other military bases in the region. This has
turned the area into a crisis center.

<HEADLINE> Greater Efforts Urged for Yangtze Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts are needed to
accelerate soil erosion treatment on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion there has been put under preliminary control, but
some localities are still damaging the environment, the
Environment and Resources Protection Committee under the National
People's Congress announced after inspecting Yunnan and Sichuan
provinces, on the river's upper reaches, last month.
</P>
<P>
The upper reaches cover some one million sq km, or about 55
percent of the river valley's total area. The river washes away
1.6 billion tons of soil from the upper reaches annually, and soil
erosion affects 35.2 percent of the river area. The State Council
designated the upper reaches as under key protection in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Some counties have not set up water and soil preservation
organizations as are required, and soil erosion remains severe
because of the construction of railways, power projects, mines and
cities, the inspection team said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is that some departments do not abide by the
law, they said, urging that the building of relevant supervisory
organizations be strengthened and the law concerning the
preservation of water and soil be carried out in earnest.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province reinforced its unemployment insurance system in 1996.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Provincial Labor Council said that about
26,000 enterprises have joined the unemployment insurance system,
covering 72 percent of the total enterprises, with 4.15 million
employees, accounting for 78 percent of the total employees.
</P>
<P>
The total unemployment insurance fund of 400 million yuan
(about 48.2 million US dollars) raised in recent years will
benefit 90,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment insurance has been extended to cover state-owned
enterprises, collective enterprises, private businesses and
foreign-backed enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The insurance fund raising is shared by the government,
enterprises and employees. The provincial government will set
aside one percent of the county-level fiscal revenue for the
unemployment insurance fund, and list it in the provincial fiscal
budget this year.

<HEADLINE> China's First Wetland Sewage Treatment Project Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first large-scale
sewage treatment pilot project for wetland has passed experts'
appraisal in this north China port city.
</P>
<P>
The Dagang Oilfield near here is located on saline or alkaline
land, where freshwater is scarce and grass hard to grow. Domestic
sewage produced at the oilfield has in the past polluted the Bohai
Bay.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers studied how to desalinize the alkaline soil
and restore the afforestation in the pilot project. The result
showed that the techniques for wetland sewage treatment could help
improve the alkaline soil and restore afforestation ability while
purifying the polluted water.
</P>
<P>
The research has reached the advanced world standards,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The investment in the basic construction of the project was
half the cost of that for customary treatment method, and the
operational cost is only one third that of the customary method.
</P>
<P>
The saline content in the soil decreased from seven percent to
2.5 percent after the treatment, and the amount of reeds grown
increased by over ten times.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Official Discusses Problems in Bosnia's Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The controversial rights of
refugees and displaced persons to vote in places other than their
original residence will still be honored in Bosnia's local
elections, a senior OSCE official said today.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, head of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation In Europe (OSCE), which is in charge of all elections
in Bosnia, said that guiding principles for the local elections
should be those spelled out in the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton accords, refugees and displaced persons
are generally expected to vote in municipalities of their
residence before the war, and such persons can, however, also
apply to vote elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Frowick said that the two contradictory principles were the
compromise agreed by the warring factions and therefore should be
honored and serve as the "point of departure" for the local
elections.
</P>
<P>
The so-called P2-form, or the rights of refugees and displaced
persons to vote in places other than their original residence, has
been so controversial that local elections have been twice
postponed from the original date of September 14 to sometime next
June.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs allegedly manipulated the form to concentrate
refugees in the towns of the Serb republic where they were
minorities before the war so as to consolidate their control,
leading to strong protests and threats of boycott by the Muslim
side.
</P>
<P>
To avoid future abuse of the P2-form, there would be a "very
substantial buildup of OSCE capabilities to deal with the
application forms" and the election provisional commission would
have final say on the eligibility of voters to cast their ballots
elsewhere, Frowick said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Investigate Katyusha Attack on Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government
decided today to conduct investigations into a Katyusha attack on
northern Israel Friday night, which provoked fear in Beirut of a
possible Israeli military strike in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources, speaking on a condition of
anonymity, said that the government decided to investigate
the event in order to find out "who launched the attack."
</P>
<P>
Three katyusha rockets fired from an area close to the south
Lebanese port city of Sour (Tyre) landed in the Galilee area in
northern Israel at about 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), without causing
casualties or damages.
</P>
<P>
Israel charged that the attack violated a cease-fire
understanding brokered by Washington between Lebanon and the
Jewish state in April, which prohibits guerrilla groups
operating in south Lebanon from firing katyusha rockets onto
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The understanding also bans the belligerent parties on the last
battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict from targeting attacks
at civilians on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which
spearheads a guerrilla campaign against the Israeli occupation
in south Lebanon, and which has won for itself a reputation
for a skillful use of katyusha rockets, categorically denied
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Raad, a Hezbollah deputy in Lebanon's parliament,
denied today any link of the attack with the Islamic Resistance.
</P>
<P>
Raad reiterated Hezbollah's commitment to the April cease-fire
understanding, mediated by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher for putting an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz against
Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hezbollah deputy warned against any Israeli
military operation against Lebanon, saying that his party "will
not stand with hands tied in face of any Israeli aggression
in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Popular Front for Liberation of
Palestine and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
issued a similar statement,
 denying their involvement in the Katyusha offensive.
</P>
<P>
The two Damascus-based Palestinian organizations are firmly
opposed to the peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Beirut newspapers linked the event with an upcoming conference
of donor countries in Washington on financial aid to Lebanon, and
a recent Israeli war warning against Lebanon and Syria. Many
people in Lebanon fear that an Israeli military strike is imminent.
</P>
<P>
As-Safir, the Beirut leftist daily, said that the Israeli
announcement on the katyusha attack "has prompted speculation
that Israel is ready to launch a new aggression in order
to frustrate the Washington conference."
</P>
<P>
The attack was the first of its kind since the end of
Israel's April "Grapes of Wrath" operation in south Lebanon
which killed some 200 Lebanese.

<HEADLINE> MD-90 Planes Performing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of three
MD-90 airplanes introduced by China have given good performances
over the past four months of service for China Northern Airlines,
one of the leading air carriers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The airliners, which made their maiden flights on August 8 this
year, have flown for more than 1,800 hours, carrying some 100,000
passengers. Serving 13 airports including Beijing, Ningbo and
Shenzhen, the planes have completed 574 flights.
</P>
<P>
China Northern Airlines sent more than 30 of its employees in
six groups to the Mcdonnell-Douglas Company of the United States
to acquaint themselves with the operation of these planes, and
then set up a special flight team.
</P>
<P>
Most of the airline's planes are 26 MD-82s, the first of which
was introduced in 1985, and MD-90 planes are expected to be
imported. Then, MD planes will become the mainstay craft of the
China Northern Airlines in the future, according to airline
authorities.
</P>
<P>
MD-90 airplane is cited as one of the most advanced airliners
in the world, with the lowest noise and the least environmental
damage. China Northern Airlines plans to introduce eight more such
planes by 1999.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on Reform of Economic, Criminal Laws (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a question on what reforms are being carried out
in China regarding the enactment of economic and criminal laws,
Qiao Shi said that China attaches great importance to the
enactment of economic and criminal laws.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said, first of all, China's economic legislation is for
the purpose of ensuring and accelerating the establishment and
perfection of a socialist market economy. He said that the Eighth
National People's Congress and its Standing Committee should
strive to establish a system of laws for the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
He went on, "We have enacted the Company Law, the Labor Law,
the Law Against Unfair Competition, the Law on the Protection of
Consumer Rights and Interests, the Budget Law, the Law of the
People's Bank of China, the Commercial Banking Law, the Insurance
Law, the Guaranty Law, the Negotiable Instruments Law and the Law
on Village and Township Enterprise. "All of these laws are
designed to standardize the economic activities of the market,
maintain market order, and improve the systems of macro-control
and social insurance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition," he said, "we have amended the Law on Economic
Contracts, the Individual Income Tax Law and the Accounting Law,
with a view to meeting the requirements of the socialist market
economy. We can say that we have made great headway in introducing
a series of laws concerning the socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
In formulating its own economic laws, he explained, China has
taken into account generally accepted international practices and
given fully consideration to international practices in
formulating and amending a large number of economic laws involving
foreign interests. These include the Law on Foreign Enterprises,
the Law on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures, the Law on Economic
Contracts involving Foreign Interests, the Patent Law, the
Trademark Law, the Law on Foreign Trade and the Arbitration
Law.

<TEXT>
<P>
Quai Shi noted that, with regard to the enactment of
criminal laws, China stresses that it should not only focus on
punishment for crimes but on protecting citizens' rights as
well. In formulating and improving its laws China attaches great
importance to being realistic. It examined and approved the
decision on amending the Criminal Procedure Law at the Fourth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress held in March
1996, and effected major reforms in the criminal procedure and
judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
These reforms include the following:
</P>
<P>
Ameliorating coercive measures and abolishing the practice of
detention for questioning; requiring lawyers to take part in the
investigation of cases soon after a criminal case is placed on
file; protecting the legitimate rights of parties to a lawsuit;
abolishing exemptions from prosecution; improving court procedures
for handling cases; and defining the types of cases which people's
procuratorates can investigate and resolve by themselves.
</P>
<P>
"In amending the Criminal Procedure Law," Qiao said, "we have
proceeded from China's realities and have drawn on the experiences
of other countries. All these reforms are of great importance in
improving the performance of our judicial work, ensuring strict
and fair enforcement of the law, appropriately punishing law
violators, and especially in safeguarding the rights of our
citizens. At present we are engaged in modifying the Criminal
Law."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland will take
decisive measures to stamp out corrupt policemen allegedly
dealing in drugs, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a year-end police conference in Mbabane on Friday,
Swazi Police Commissioner Edgar Hillary told Prime Minister
Sibusiso Dlamini that he would dismiss police officer caught
making drug deal.
</P>
<P>
Senior Swazi police officials, however, believed that the purge
would prove difficult as many high ranking officers were involved in
illegal drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Hillary has transferred more than 50
policemen, including police station and border post commanding
officers, after they were accused of having committed
international drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, encircled by South Africa, is a country where drug
dealers haunt about. International drug syndicates often make use of
Swaziland as a route to smuggle drugs into South Africa and other
neighboring countries, informed sources said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on NPC's Role in the Future (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to a question on whether or not the NPC was more
dynamic in the 1980s than it is today, and whether it will play a
still greater role in administering state affairs in the future,
Qiao Shi said that the NPC and its Standing Committee will play a
still greater role on administering state affairs in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC was established in 1954. The NPC and its
Standing Committee played an important role in the state's
political life until the early part of the 1960s. By that time
they had examined and approved over 130 laws and decisions. But
during the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976) the system of the
people's congresses was seriously undermined.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1978, after the "cultural revolution" was over,
the CPC held the Third Plenary Session of its Eleventh Central
Committee. The session summed up experiences and lessons gained
since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
particularly those from the "cultural revolution", and decided to
shift the focus of their work to socialist modernization, thus
effecting a great historic change.
</P>
<P>
He said that the session held that "China should strengthen the
socialist legal system and institutionalize democracy by giving it
legal sanction so as to ensure people's democracy and the
stability, continuity and the supreme authenticity of the legal
system and laws. Laws must be observed and strictly enforced, and
violators brought to account." At the same time, the session
pointed out, "From now on, legislative work should be placed at
the top of the agenda of the NPC and its Standing Committee".
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, the system of the people's congresses has
been improved and the NPC and its Standing Committee have made
fresh progress in their work, playing an increasingly important
role in state affairs.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on NPC's Role in the Future (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said the NPC and its Standing Committee will play a still
greater role in administering state affairs in the future. The
practice of the National People's Congress over the past 40 years
or so since its establishment has fully demonstrated that this
system of people's congresses, China's fundamental political
system as stipulated in the constitution, accords with China's
realities and hence enjoys the support of the people throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to turn our country into a prosperous, strong,
democratic, culturally advanced and modern socialist country. To
this end, we should give full play to the role of the National
People's Congress, which is an objective requirement for the
development of Chinese society, and we should work hard to attain
this goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Deng Xiaoping as stating that "in the reform of the
political structure, one thing is certain: We must adhere to the
system of the people's congresses." The Party too has stressed
many times in its resolutions that we should adhere to and improve
the system of the people's congresses.
</P>
<P>
"The outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic
and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives to the Year
2010 adopted at the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress stressed that 'we should manage state affairs according
to law and turn our country into a socialist country with a sound
legal system' and that 'we should continue to improve the system
of people's congresses in accordance with the Constitution'," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to perform the
duties entrusted to them by the constitution and the law, act
in accordance with the constitution and the law, and strive to make
still greater contributions to strengthening democracy and the legal
system as well as the modernization drive, Qiao noted.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on the relationship of the NPC to the CPC (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a question on the relationship of the NPC to the
CPC, Qiao Shi the leading position and role of the Chinese
Communist Party took shape through a long historical
process. Keeping to the principle of integrating the basic tenets
of Marxism with the realities of China, The Party led the people
in an unrelenting and persistent struggle, carrying on when others
had fallen, and established New China.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic, Qiao said, CPC
sought ways to build socialism in China. In the late 1970s, the
Party, led by Deng Xiaoping, embarked onto road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which won the heartfelt
and firm support of the people of the whole country. Just as Deng
Xiaoping pointed out, without the Part's leadership nothing much
can be achieved in modern China and it will be impossible for
China to modernize.
</P>
<P>
He noted, CPC is the leading nucleus of the Chinese socialist
cause. State organs work under the leadership of the Party. Under
the Party's leadership, the NPC and its Standing Committee
exercise their functions and powers according to law, implement
the line, principles and policies of the Party and wholeheartedly
serve all the people of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Party exercises leadership over state organs, but this does
not mean that it should replace these organs and do their work.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping clarified this point at the Eighth National
Congress of the Party in 1956, Qiao said. Deng noted that the
Party had assumed the leading role in all state affairs and public
activities. At the same time, Deng pointed out, "Of course, this
does not mean that the Party should be directly in command of the
work of state organs or discuss questions of a purely
administrative nature at Party meetings, thus overstepping the
necessary line of demarcation between Party work and the work of
state organs."

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on the relationship of the NPC to the CPC (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao said that what is meant by the leadership of the Party is
mainly political, ideological and organizational leadership. The
party exercises leadership over state affairs mainly by deciding
political principles and political direction, making major policy
decisions and recommending important cadres to state organs. The
important policy decisions made by Party organizations concerning
state affairs that are to be decided by the NPC or its Standing
Committee should then be established by the Congress or its
Standing Committee as the will of the state through legal
procedures.
</P>
<P>
He said Party organizations at all levels and all Party
members must strictly observe the constitution and ensure the
implementation of the constitution and of laws adopted by
the organs of state power.
</P>
<P>
The Party constitution stipulated that "the Party should
conduct activities within the limits permitted by the constitution
and the law" and the constitution stipulates that "no organization
or individual may enjoy the privilege of being above the
constitution or the law". Having led the people in formulating the
constitution and the law, the CPC is leading the people in
implementing these things, he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that China has always stressed that the
constitution and the law are concentrated expressions of the
people's will, as well as being propositions of the
CPC. Therefore, the implementation of the constitution and the law
means both acting on the people's will and carrying out the
Party's line, principles and policies.
</P>
<P>
China has always stressed that Party organizations and all
Party members must abide by the law, conduct their affairs
according to the law and uphold the authority of the
constitution. "The overwhelming majority of Party organizations
and Party members have done a good job in this regard," said
Qiao.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Literary Creation Prospering (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's creative literature
has entered a new prosperous and active era, according to local
critics.
</P>
<P>
They explained that this era is marked by a growing number of
writers, varied writing styles, maturing writing skills and a
number of profound works that reflect reality.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the membership of the China
Writers' Association (CWA) has increased from 2,525 eight years
ago to 5,200, and includes some 30,000-plus members of local
writers' associations.
</P>
<P>
According to the commentators, Chinese writers in the period
view the life of the ordinary people as their main topic, in
accordance with the requirements of the 14th Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China that "healthy and artistic spiritual
products, in particular those that pay attention to the reform and
opening up and modernization drive, are encouraged."
</P>
<P>
They devote far-reaching thought to the times and the essence
of the contemporary life, and have created a batch of novels,
poems, prose works and documentaries that are closely related to
reality and have profound meaning.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 saw the publication of 790 novels, three times
the number in 1980, as well as 280 medium-length novels, 400
collections of short stories and 350 works of literature for
children. A number of influential novels featuring China's
resistance to Japanese aggression appeared around the 50th
anniversary of the victory of the War of Resistance to Japan
(1937-1945) and the War against fascism the world over.
</P>
<P>
During this period, literary creation and publication by ethnic
groups also became increasingly prosperous. All the 55 ethnic
minority groups in the country have brought forth their own
writers -- some 3,000 in all. They write in various languages and
styles. In addition, 483 writers from 52 ethnic groups have won
prizes in four consecutive awards for ethnic minority literature.

<TEXT>
<P>
The CWA has held several influential seminars on novels,
children's literature and documentaries over recent years as part
of its effort to advocate seeking truth from facts and exchanging
ideas in a healthy manner, and oppose criticism that aims at
personal favor or benefit.
</P>
<P>
The CWA has also organized talks and symposiums to seriously
deal with various tides of thinking in Western literature. Writers
are asked to sort out and absorb healthy and beneficial elements
from Western thinking and discard harmful elements to advance
socialist literature theory with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
At present, the exchanges between Chinese and foreign literary
circles are very active. Chinese writers are making pen-pals
around the world, and their exchanges with Chinese writers in Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan are increasing.
</P>
<P>
Literature at the turn of the century in China will witness a
healthy and prosperous situation, according to
commentators. Literature prizes have been helping this trend
along. The CWA has set up five major prizes: the Lu Xun Literature
Prize, the Mao Dun Literature Prize, the Children's Literature
Prize, the Youth Literature Prize and the Literature Prize for
Minority Ethnic Groups.
</P>
<P>
The recent Sixth Plenum of the 14th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) urged that the building of
socialist ethics and cultural progress be strengthened and
stressed that "lofty works must be created to stimulate the
people's thinking."
</P>
<P>
This has set a high standard for the contemporary literature
creation in China and will create opportunities for its further
prosperity and development, critics said, predicting that the
literature circles in China will consider "the creation of more
superb works" as their top task and bring about in the coming
century a healthy, prosperous and vigorous literature.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on Role of NPC and its Standing Committee (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, said that the NPC
plays a very important role in China's public activities.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark during an interview Friday at the Great
Hall of the People with Gertrude Rubin, a columnist of the US
newspaper "Philadelphia Inquirer".
</P>
<P>
He answered questions on the role of the NPC and its Standing
Committee in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
He said the role played by the NPC and its Standing Committee
in Chinese society is stipulated in the country's constitution,
according to which all power in the People's Republic of China
belongs to the people, and the people exercise state power through
the NPC and through local people's congresses at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The constitution also stipulates that the NPC is the highest
organ of state power. The permanent body of the NPC is its
Standing Committee. Qiao added that the State Council, the Supreme
People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and other state
organs are set up under the NPC, to which they are responsible and
by which they are supervised.
</P>
<P>
Qiao noted that, according to China's Constitution, the NPC and
its Standing Committee exercise supreme state power. On this
premise, the administrative, judicial and procuratorial powers of
the state as well as leadership over the armed forces are clearly
defined, so that the highest organ of state power and the other
organs of state power perform their specific functions in
harmony.
</P>
<P>
He discussed briefly the role played by the NPC and its Standing
Committee in Chinese society from the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
First, the constitution provides that the NPC and its Standing
Committee shall exercise the legislative power of the state. The
NPC and its Standing Committee maintain the work of legislation as
their top priority, Since 1979 they have formulated 304 laws and
decisions on legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, a legal system with the constitution as
the core has taken basic shape, and laws now exist to serve as a
paradigm for the basic and major aspects of the country's
political, economic and social activities. Notable achievements
have been scored in building socialist democracy and a socialist
legal system. The NPC will continue to further strengthen
legislation so as to safeguard democracy and improve the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Second, the constitution stipulates that the NPC and its
Standing Committee shall supervise the enforcement of the
constitution and other laws, as well as the work of the
administrative, judicial, procuratorial and other organs of the
state. The Standing Committee of the NPC inspects issues
concerning law enforcement in a planned and selective way and
reports the results to the plenary sessions of Standing
Committee. The quarters concerned attach great importance to these
inspections and are striving to improve the enforcement of laws in
accordance with the opinions of the NPC.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on Role of NPC and its Standing Committee (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
People's Procuratorate make reports on their work at sessions of
the NPC. In examining their reports the delegates not only affirm
their achievements but also set forth their candid opinions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, leaders of the State Council, its relevant
departments, the Supreme People's Court and the supreme People's
Procuratorate attend meetings of delegations to answer
questions. The departments concerned carefully study the
proposals, criticisms and opinions put forward by delegates, and
give them prompt replies. The Standing Committee of the NPC holds
plenary meetings every two months to listen to and examine the
reports made by the State Council, its relevant departments, the
Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate on
their work.
</P>
<P>
Before the NPC and its Standing Committee officially listen to
and examine these reports, and while the reports are being drafted
or revised, the NPC and organs concerned may exchange views of
some of the issues under consideration in order to achieve a
consensus. After the special bodies of the NPC carefully study
opinions from all quarters, they may put forward suggestions to
the organs concerned so that the reports officially submitted by
the latter for examination and approval are comparatively-
well-founded.
</P>
<P>
In addition, after these sessions NPC do research on the
implementation of the decisions made at the sessions. Practice has
demonstrated that the above-mentioned procedures greatly assist us
in supporting and helping the organs concerned and in urging them
to do a good job. The local people's congresses and their standing
committees have utilized good practices for exercising their right
of supervision. NPC are now reviewing and studying experience so
as to gradually institutionalize and guarantee through law this
work of supervision.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Constitution stipulates that the NPC and its
Standing Committee shall examine and decide major matters of
overall importance to the state. These matters include plans for
national economic and social development, state budgets, the
establishment of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities
directly under the Central Government and special zones.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the NPC examined, approved and adopted
decisions on the construction of the Three Gorges Project on the
Yangtze River, which drew world attention, and on the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
the Macao Special Administrative Region. The Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and the long-objectives for year 2010, which is in
now progress, were examined and approved at the Fourth Session of
the Eighth NPC in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the constitution provides that the NPC shall elect the
president and vice-president of the state, elect the chairman of
the Central Military Commission and the president of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, approve the choice for premier of the
State Council upon nomination by the president of the state and
approve the choices for the vice-premiers of the State Council,
state councilors and ministers nominated by the premier.
</P>
<P>
Qiao concluded that, in accordance with the provisions of
China's constitution and its fundamental system, the NPC is
playing a very important role in public activities.

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Cao Yu, 86, China's top
playwright and the founding father of the country's modern drama,
passed away at a hospital here early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"He passed away while he was sleeping," said Li Yuru, the widow
of the world-famous playwright, who was currently the executive
president of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
(CFLAC).
</P>
<P>
"He woke up at 3:40 Friday morning and asked for a drink of
water and then went back to sleep," Mrs. Cao recounted. "He died
15 minutes later, leaving no will."
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Cao, who was also president of the China
Drama Association, president of the Central Theater Academy and
president of the Beijing People's Art Theater, sent shock waves
throughout the country's literary and arts community.
</P>
<P>
"He died at the moment when he and his colleagues were making
preparations for the opening of the national meeting of the China
Federation of Literary and Art Circles (CFLAC) next Monday,"
Mrs. Cao said.
</P>
<P>
"Gao Zhanxiang, a leading official from CFLAC, paid a visit to
my husband at the hospital early this month to brief him about the
preparations for the national conference and asking my husband if
he was able to attend the meeting," Mrs. Cao said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that I'm not able to go," Mrs Cao quoted her
husband as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Gao said that the whole literary and art community had
expressed a strong wish that he attend the meeting. "And my
husband told him that he would go to attend it," Mrs. Cao added.

"My husband had suffered from a cold recently, and his health
was very poor," Mrs. Cao said. "But he still devoted his utmost
attention to this conference."
</P>
<P>
She quoted her husband as saying, "The upcoming meeting is a
big event in the literary and art community. I have many friends
and they all want to come and visit me."
</P>
<P>
Only a few days ago, Cao asked his wife to draft a speech for
him for the meeting, and the topic was how to be an upright man.
</P>
<P>
"Young people must have noble integrity, be well-educated and
devoted to their careers," Mrs. Cao quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cao's health deteriorated last Thursday afternoon, when he was
found to have pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
"That afternoon, when I came back from a tailor's shop and went
to the hospital, taking a new suit which had been specially made
for my husband to wear at Monday's meeting, I saw him having some
difficulty breathing, and his face looked swollen and lustrous,"
Mrs. Cao recounted.
</P>
<P>
After about one hour of emergency medical care, Cao recovered
somewhat. He and his wife had dinner together that evening. "He
ate a bowl of his favorite onion soup," Mrs. Cao said.
</P>
<P>
"Then, my husband asked me to go back home after dinner. He
said that he felt tired. We then said good-bye to each other," she
remembered.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect that we had parted forever," she said
emotionally, her eyes filled with tears.

Senior Chinese government officials, included Ding Guan'gen, a

the CPC Central Committee, and Minister of Culture Liu Zhongde,
went to the hospital yesterday to pay their last respects to the
world-famous playwright.
</P>
<P>
Most of Cao's dramas have long been regarded as classics since
he published his first play, "Thunderstorm", in 1934, when he was
only 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
Many of Cao's plays, including "Thunderstorm", "Sunrise",
"Wasteland", "Beijingers" and "Wang Zhaojun", have been translated
into other languages and some have been made into movies.
</P>
<P>
"Cao Yu was a master playwright, and he left an enormously rich
legacy for the country's drama. His influence is international,"
said Zhang Qihong, director of the China Youth Art Theater, who was
the first director to bring Cao's play "Wasteland" onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
"I will join other people in the art circles to appeal to the
government to set up a museum in honor of Cao Yu," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Cao said that she was also preparing to write to the
government, urging the government to set up such a museum to
preserve Cao's legacy.
</P>
<P>
Cao, a member of the CPC and a member of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, spent
the last eight years of his life in hospital, according to his
family.
</P>
<P>
Cao is survived by his widow, who once was a noted Peking opera
actress, and four daughters.

CAIRO -- Oil ministers of the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OAPEC) met here today at their 57th session.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Council meeting under the chairmanship of
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah Ben Hamad al
Attiya will review reports on the activities of OAPEC's offshoot
companies and functions of the Secretariat General in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member OAPEC is also expected to set the budget of the
organization for 1997 and discuss joint Arab projects in the
petroleum industry, which are being implemented in member
states.
</P>
<P>
The grouping of Arab oil producers, set up in 1968 with a view
to developing oil industry through fostering cooperation among
its members, now sponsors five joint ventures and their
subsidiaries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Owls Good for Paddy Field Pest control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 14 (Xinhua) -- In Malaysia, owls are
being used for pest control in paddy fields, saving the country
some 100 million ringgit (about 40 million US dollars) worth of
paddy annually.
</P>
<P>
The owls with an average life span of about 10 years could be
obtained for free from oil palm plantations in the country and one
pair of owls are sufficient to cover 20 hectares of paddy fields,
according to Director of the Agriculture Department's Crop Pests
Division Zulkifli Ayob today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the use of the birds, the damage to paddy fields was
some 10 percent, but now only 0.5 per cent of the total 200,000
hectares of paddy is destroyed, he told reporters after receiving
the department's innovation award 1996 for his pest control
technique.
</P>
<P>
Zulkifli said the biological control which he introduced in
1988 not only saved paddy fields but also was environment friendly
since it helped to reduce the use of pesticide.
</P>
<P>
Previously, a 0.4-hectare of paddy field needed to be sprayed
with pesticide eight times per season, costing 30 ringgit (about
12 dollars) per spray but now only one spray is necessary as the
owls feed on rats, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zulkifli, the department has so far built 3,500
owl nests in paddy fields in the country and another 1,500 were
planned for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imported food worth 7.9 billion ringgit (about 3.15
billion dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Schenk Takes Third Straight Win in Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- German speed skater Franziska
Schenk posted her third straight victory of the season on the
first day of a two-day World Cup competition in Ikaho, Japan, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Schenk, a Lillehammer Olympic bronze medallist, said a
smoother style and lower crouch helped her to win easily over
Japan's Shiho Kusunose in the women's 1,000 meters by 1.41
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Schenk crossed the line in one minute 20.45 seconds, a rink
record at the outdoor Ikaho Highland Skate Centre north of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Defending World Cup champion Chris Witty of the United
States was third on 1:22.38.
</P>
<P>
Schenk took both 1,000-meter races by more than a full
second at last week's season's opener in Chonju, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Hiroyasu Shimizu stumbled with a false
start, yet managed to lead a Japanese one-two finish in the men's
500 meters with a time of 36.51 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu's effort was only 0.06 seconds better than compatriot
Manabu Horii. Russian world sprint champion Sergey Klevchenya was
third with a time of 36.63.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Grunde Njos, third in both 500 races at Chonju,
failed to finish his race after crashing into the wall around the
final bend. He did not compete in the 1,000.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 500, Japan's Kyoko Shimazaki gained her second
win of the season with a rink record of 39.94 seconds, 0.13
seconds ahead of China's Xue Ruihong. Schenk was third in 40.09.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yoon-man gave South Korea their first World Cup win of
the season with 1:14.39 in the men's 1,000, 0.07 seconds ahead of
Klevchenya and 0.19 seconds faster than world record holder
Horii.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Debt Soars to 314 Billion Dollars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Africa's debt soared to over 314
billion U.S.Dollars in 1995 from 289 billion dollars in 1991 with
sub-Saharan countries' increasing to 223.2 billion dollars from
194.7 billion dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Africa Recovery's special edition
on Mid-Term Review as indicating that faced with the growing debt
overhang mainly occurred in 1995, the emphasis has shifted from simply
rescheduling debt service on more concessional terms to including the
cancellation of more debt stock.
</P>
<P>
The continent's external debt is now widely acknowledged to be
unsustainable and search for durable solution intensified, according
to the local newspaer.
</P>
<P>
Despite the political and economic reforms in some 37 African
countries, the continent is being bypassed by the boom in investment
flows.
</P>
<P>
For all developing nations, net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
inflows remarkably rose from 22.6 billion Dollars in 1991 to 60
billion Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But for Africa the net FDI only increased to 2.9 billion Dollars
in 1994 from 1.8 billion Dollars in 1991 before falling back by 27
percent in 1995 to 2.1 billion Dollars, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Fund Helps China Protect Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China has obtained
international financial aid totalling more than 13 million US
dollars for the preservation of its cultural relics since 1992, an
official from the Ministry of Culture said.
</P>
<P>
At a national meeting on expanding cultural exchanges with
foreign countries here last week, the ministry released a
breakdown of the first relics preservation projects through
concerted efforts between Chinese and overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
The main projects are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Protecting the Jiaohe ruins in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region and the ruins of the Hanyuan Temple of the Daming Palace in
Xi'an, in Shaanxi Province, with the aid of a Japanese government
trust fund via the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO);
</P>
<P>
Protecting and renovating the terracotta warriors and horses at
the tomb of China's first emperor and the gigantic stone Buddha in
Binxian County, both in Shaanxi Province, with German partners;
</P>
<P>
Protecting and researching the Mogao Grottoes in Gansu Province
and the Yungang Grottoes in Shanxi Province with help from an
American research body specializing in relics preservation;
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Shaanxi Relics Preservation Center
with help from the Italian government;
</P>
<P>
Donation of advanced high-definition equipment by a Japanese
company to the Shanghai Museum; and
</P>
<P>
Aid for cultural projects given gratis by the Japanese
government to the China Relics Research Institute, the Shanghai
Museum and the Shaanxi Relics Preservation Center.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China has cooperated with many foreign countries
to unearth a series of ruins, including research on the ancient
Niya culture together with Germany and Japan, and some other
relics investigations with the cooperation of Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese historical relics belong not only to this country, but
to the whole of mankind," the official said, explaining the need
for Sino-foreign joint efforts to preserve China's relics.

<HEADLINE> Arab Oil Ministers Meets in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) met
here today at their 57th session.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial Council meeting under the chairmanship of Qatari
Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullah Ben Hamad al Attiya will
review reports on the activities of OAPEC's offshoot companies and
functions of the Secretariat General in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member OAPEC is also expected to set the budget of
the organization for 1997 and discuss joint Arab projects in the
petroleum industry, which are being implemented in member states.
</P>
<P>
The grouping of Arab oil producers, set up in 1968 with a view
to developing oil industry through fostering cooperation among its
members, now sponsors five joint ventures and their subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Nine Arab ministers from Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar, Libya, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain attend
the 57th session of the Kuwait-based body, while Iraq sent its
representatives to the Arab League to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's representative to the Arab League Nabil Nejm headed the
delegation from Iraq, which resumed its limited oil exports only
four days ago after six years of sufferings under the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reopened its pipeline in the north Tuesday to pump oil
through Turkey to the world market for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
The resumed outflow of Iraqi oil was based on an oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations, which allows Baghdad to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to pay for
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1991
following its invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
By 1982 the OAPEC membership has risen to 11 oil exporting
countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. In
1986, the organization suspended Tunisia's membership at its
request.
</P>
<P>
Its 10 member states make up more than 70 percent of the
entire Arab world population and take up two thirds of the world
oil reserves, according to the OAPEC Data Bank.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC turns out 17.2 million barrels of crude oil per day
(bpd), which is 26 percent of the global production. Its oil
exports accounted for 33 percent of the world total in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The organization discharges its duty through four main bodies,
the Ministerial Council, which holds meetings twice a year, the
Executive Bureau, the Secretariat General and the Judicial Panel.

the Consolidation of Peace will meet in Freetown early next week,
according to a State House release broadcast on the state radio.
</P>
<P>

TIANJIN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Toyota Corporation of Japan
donated 6.5 million yen (some 65,000 US dollars)-worth of research
funds to Tianjin University earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
It was the second donation from the corporation to the
university, located in this north China port city, this year.
</P>
<P>
Toyota is one of the multinationals which are keen to set up
connections with China's schools of higher learning, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of close relations with local schools has
become part of many corporations' management strategy, the sources
said, adding that the relations are in the forms of donations of
equipment and funds, the establishment of scholarships, joint
technical training and special aid.
</P>
<P>
In June this year a computer center jointly set up by IBM of
the US and Tianjin University was opened to the public. It is one
of several such centers IBM agreed with the Chinese government
last year to set up with a donation of 25 million US dollars at 23
universities in 16 cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of relations with universities or colleges
with advantages in human resources, information and technology is
common for multinationals with long-term goals, economists here
said.
</P>
<P>
The top 500 foreign-funded enterprises in China reported 700
million yuan-worth of assets each on average last year.
</P>
<P>
It does not cost much to cooperate with institutes of higher
learning in China, but the benefits are great, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Most schools welcome such cooperation. Education circles hold
that such cooperation will doubtlessly benefit financially
strapped schools, whatever the purpose of the companies in
donating.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation will also help promote the relations between
domestic enterprises and schools, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Xi'an, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi
Province is expected to receive more than half a million overseas
tourists this year, a rise of 13.1 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Kong Qingsen, director of the provincial tourism bureau, said
that during the January-October period this year the province
received more than 424,000 overseas tourists, earning 168 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rising tourism income to the province's
successful publicity activities, which included staging a
historical relics show in the US, holding an international seminar
on the ancient Silk Road and a conference on the world's historic
metropolises.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year the average tourist is more likely to
venture out of Xi'an to other parts of the province, prolonging
his Shaanxi stay from 2.23 days to 2.6 days.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the tourists used to visit Xi'an only, he
said. Xi'an was the capital of several Chinese dynasties.

The third set was a see-saw game until Li failed to return the

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Flays U.N.Resolution on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of
Nigeria has reacted to the U.N. resolution on the Nigeria's human
rights situation, describing the pronouncement as " unfortunate,
unhelpful and unnecessary".
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Nigerian Foreign Affairs Ministry
last night said the European Union-sponsored resolution is hasty,
politically motivated and based on the emotional feelings of some
influential members of the organization.
</P>
<P>
"In an open affront on a sovereign nation, the sponsors of
this resolution have conveniently ignored the fundamental
principles of objectivity and nonselectivity which should guide
the actions of the U.N. at all times," said the statement, quoted
by the official newspaper "New Nigerian" today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. general assembly expressed "deep concern" Thursday
about the human rights situation in Nigeria and urged the
government to take steps to rectify it.
</P>
<P>
The general assembly passed the resolution, criticizing
alleged human rights violations in Nigeria and calling on the
Nigerian government to release all detained political prisoners,
trade union leaders, human rights advocates and journalists.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is the second following the general assembly
adopted a similar one last year, but the language of the fresh
one, according to the official News Agency of Nigeria, was toned
down substantially following Nigeria's counter-proposal
reflecting the positive developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
"After one year," said the statement, "all those genuinely
interested in the affairs of Nigeria need to embark on an
objective analysis of the developments in our country in order to
form a balanced view."
</P>
<P>
It said that since the submission of the report of the U.N.
fact-finding mission to Nigeria earlier this year, the present
administration has spared no efforts in responding constructively
to the issues of interest to the international community on which
un members just voted.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated the commitment of the administration
to the pursuit of its programs of political and economic reforms
which call for the establishment of durable peace, stability and
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The programs, which have led to the recent release of some
well-known human rights activities, were embarked on by the
government not in responding to any external pressure or demands
but in the best interest of the Nigerian people, the statement
added.

<HEADLINE> Shelterbelt Takes Shape in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A shelterbelt has taken
shape in northeast China's Jilin Province to protect 3.16 million
ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has completed its afforestation plan two
years ahead of schedule. And its forest coverage rate has reached
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central and western parts of the province used to be
haunted by natural adversities because of harsh conditions. To
change this situation, the provincial academy of forestry sciences
undertook the task of solving the problems in afforestation and
cultivated several species of poplar trees that fit local
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, local research institutes
have made 193 achievements in the field of forestry, which have
yielded 330 million yuan-worth of economic returns after being put
into practice.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 460,000 ha of quality poplar trees in the
province, which yield 1.6 billion yuan-worth of economic returns a
year.
</P>
<P>
Since a high-density charcoal project was completed in Jilin,
Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces, the forest area in northeast
China has been exporting 4,000 tons of high-density charcoal to
Japan every year, earning 1.3 million US dollars-worth of foreign
currency.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Have Serious Differences on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Serious differences arose
between Jordan and Israel over a planned expansion of Jewish
settlement in the West Bank, Jordanian Information Minister
Marwan Muasher has said.
</P>
<P>
"I've clarified the Jordanian position regarding the
settlements and stressed that this constitutes a threat to the
peace process," said Muasher Friday when concluding a four-day
visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"There are big differences between the Jordanian and Israeli
perspectives on the issue of settlements," Muasher said after
his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Natanyahu in
West Jerusalem, according to Jordan radio.
</P>
<P>
Muasher's remarks coincided with an Israeli government decision
Friday to give tax breaks and generous grants to Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a move that could
entice more Israelis to settle in the occupied area.
</P>
<P>
The decision would likely boost construction and investment in
the 144 Jewish settlements. The Palestinians sharply opposed the
settlement expansion and warned that it would lead to the collapse
of the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Muasher told Israel TV Thursday that Jordan was committed to
working with Israel "to protect the achievements" of peace, but
warned that Netanyahu's policies were endangering them.
</P>
<P>
Muasher, who was Jordan's first ambassador to Israel
following the kingdom's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish
state, cited the settlement expansion plans and the delays in
implementing the Israeli-Palestinian accords in particular.
</P>
<P>
He said Friday that the construction of new settlements
in Ras Al Amud area in Jerusalem and the Israeli cabinet
decision to provide additional facilities to the settlement
activity posed a threat to the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said that during his meetings with Israeli officials,
he stressed Jordan's keen interest and desire to work with all
peace-loving forces to push the peace process forward, and to
block all attempts to abort the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said the prime
minister assured Muasher that Israel was still committed to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government remains committed in the peace
process with the Palestinians and respects the peace treaty
signed with Jordan," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is conscious of Jordan's needs for stability and
prosperity," Netanyahu told Muasher, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Called on to Confront Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of renewed
tension, Palestinian officials have called on all Palestinian
people to confront Israel's policy of settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Israeli cabinet's lately decision to give a new
push to expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian Council, warned that no
issue was more dangerous than the settlement expansion, according
to Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat condemned Friday
Israel's settlement policy as "another breach" of the signed
agreements that would escalate tension.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Council called on Palestinians everywhere to
confront with any means available the Jewish settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Wednesday's terrorist shooting attack near the West
Bank city of Ramallah which killed a Jewish settler and her son,
the Israeli right-wing Likud government reacted in a rare tough
manner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the funeral for the victims, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu vowed to strengthen the Jewish
presence in the territories in response to the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Netanyahu chaired the weekly cabinet meeting in
which the government decided to place expansion of settlements as
its policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
To encourage continued existence and prosperity of 144 Jewish
settlements throughout the occupied land, the cabinet pledged to
grant special tax breaks, preferential grants and child
allowances to the settlers.
</P>
<P>
At the security meeting convened Thursday by Netanyahu after
the Wednesday attack, Ami Ayalon, head of Israel's General
Security Service, warned that the government's decision to expand
Jewish settlements could spark new rounds of Palestinian
violence, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon also threatened to leave the meeting after his heated
exchanges with Netanyahu, the report said. But his warning was
apparently ignored at the Friday cabinet meeting.

<HEADLINE> Katyusha Attack Evokes Fear for Israeli Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Friday's Katyusha shelling of
northern Israel has evoked fears in Beirut for possible Israeli
military strikes at Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers published in the Lebanese capital this morning
noted that the Katyusha attack came before an upcoming conference
of donor countries in Washington on financial aids to Lebanon and
amid escalating Israeli warnings against Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Three Katyusha rockets fired from an area near the south
Lebanese port city of Sour (Tyre) landed in northern Israel
Friday night, an Israeli army spokesman announced in Jerusalem
without giving reports on casualties.
</P>
<P>
The salvo was the first since the United States brokered a
cease-fire understanding between Lebanon and the Jewish state in
April, which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz against Muslim
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire understanding bars the combating forces in
south Lebanon, namely guerrillas of Lebanon's Hezbollah and
Israeli forces, from attacking civilians on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah or Party of God was quick to deny any involvement in
the Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically deny any involvement," one Hezbollah official
in Beirut said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Resistance strongly denies that it launched any
Katyusha rocket Friday," another Hezbollah in south Lebanon, who
also declined to be named, said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance is the military wing of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials had no immediate comment on the development
six hours after Prime Minister Rafik Hariri took off for the
Friends of Lebanon conference to boost his fund-raising campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has placed great hopes on the
conference scheduled to be held in the U.S. capital on December
16. Some 30 countries and leading international lending
organizations will attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Three Katyusha rockets were fired from the outskirts of the
villages of Hinniyeh and Qlaileh, 10 kilometers from Sour and 15
kilometers from the Lebanese-Israeli border in the direction of
northern Israel," the Israeli army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon said
they heard "two bangs" in Qlaileh at 7:45 p.m. (17:45 GMT) and
were investigating the cause.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army statement said the rockets were fired towards
the western Galilee area but did not specify where they landed.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious violation of the Grapes of Wrath
understandings," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Grapes of Wrath was the code name for the April Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon, which claimed some 200 Lebanese lives,
mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the attack, Israeli forces in the occupied zone
began shelling the Qlaileh area in retaliation, the Israeli army
spokesman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the area said that some 10 percent of
Qlaileh residents, fearing further reprisals, had fled the area
and taken refuge in Sour.
</P>
<P>
Ad-Diyar daily said that these developments followed a series
of statements indicating that "the government of (Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin) Netanyahu is preparing an aggression against
Lebanon and probably Syria."
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian paper noted that Israeli defense Minister Yizhak
Mordechai visited the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in
south Lebanon only two days ago.
</P>
<P>
"Mordechai's visit to the border strip could not be understood
but in the framework of Israel's full-scale military political
activity," the paper said in its front-page story covering the
event.
</P>
<P>
The Christian daily Nida Al-Watan noted that these
developments were probably "a message of refusal and protest
against the (Friends of Lebanon) conference sponsored by the
united States."
</P>
<P>
It added that the conference was aimed at financing
reconstruction projects in Lebanon "at a time when the peace
process is still deadlocked on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
since Netanyahu came to power."
</P>
<P>
The leftist As-Safir daily said that the announcement of the
katyusha attack has "prompted speculation that Israel is ready to
launch a new aggression in order to frustrate the Washington
conference."
</P>
<P>
It said that the conference will lead not only to an influx of
foreign capital to Lebanon, but also to ease of a 10-year-old
American travel ban to this country in order to help an entry of
U.S. companies into Lebanon's markets.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that assistance for Lebanon will be
discussed in Washington for the first time and with a separation
from the peace process," the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Offers To Be Training Base of African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is willing to host the
training base for an African crisis reaction force recently
considered by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the
official newspaper "New Nigerian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A monitoring group has been sent by the OAU to Nigeria to

proposed continental training institution and fighting force, the
paper said, quoting Chief of Army Staff Ishaya Bamaiyi.
</P>

<P>
According to the newspaper, the OAU recently floated the idea
of the African crisis reaction force, which will complement the
effort of the United Nations organizations in curtailing the ugly
incident of crisis on the continent.

not," Bamaiyi said, "We shall continue to contribute our quota in
terms of manpower and resources to such a formidable force."

<P>
Nigeria will continue to contribute to efforts to bring peace
and stability to Africa and the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Denounces Japan for Its Meddling in Korean Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today denounced Japan for its attempt to
meddle in the issue of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Rodong Sinmun, organ of the Worker's Party of Korea,
denounced in a commentary the intentions of the leaders of Japan's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who proposed a "Northeast
Asian Forum for Security-Oriented Dialogue".
</P>
<P>
The proposal laid bare, the bylined commentary said, Japan's
attempt to "poke its nose into" the Korean Peninsula issue, in
which, Japan has no part whatsoever to play.
</P>
<P>
The article said the LDP declared in its foreign policy that it
would urge the DPRK to accept the dialogue to "replenish and
complete the Four-Way Talks".
</P>
<P>
In fact, by the "Northeast Asian Forum for Security-Oriented
Dialogue", the article said, Japan intends to internationalize the
Korean issue, poke its nose in it and lord it over in northeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that no one has ever requested Japan to do anything to
"replenish" or "complete" the Four-Way Talks, the commentary
concluded, the talks, even if held, but without removing the
inter-Korean confrontation and building mutual trust between the
DPRK and Japan and between the DPRK and the United States, will
turn out to be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese authorities are advised by the article to "throw
away its design to internationalize the Korean Peninsula issue"
and give up its "sinister purpose".
</P>
<P>
The Four-Way Talks were proposed earlier this year by
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his South Korean counterpart Kim
Young-sam. The DPRK and China were asked to join in.

Misundu are transit points for robbers into Zaire, hence the need for
improved telecommunication there. enditem

<HEADLINE> Go-Slow Talks of Civil Aviation Deadlocked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The talks between management
and staff of the Kenyan civil aviation sector has come to a deadlock,
resulting in the sacking of the striking air traffic controllers,
the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting on Friday with the striking controllers,
the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Communication, Stanley
Murage, said that since the controllers refused a return-to-work
order, the government had no option but to declare them
redundant.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Meteorological Department staff yesterday joined the
striking air traffic controllers in their go-slow action
beginning from last Saturday evening, saying that they would stop
supplying information to the airport or shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted airline managers as saying that they had been
instructed that no flight will be allowed to land or take off at
any of the Kenyan airports with effect from midnight yesterday.
</P>
<P>

ordering the striking staff to resume their work by 16:00
local time that day.

Kenya's Civil Service Code of Regulations provides that any
officer away from his workplace for 48 hours without permission
is considered a deserter.
</P>

Murage said yesterday that "you refused to follow my previous
instructions... Therefore we did not take an option but to
implement the sacking orders."
</P>
<P>
Industry sources confirmed that part of Kenya's airspace was
temporarily closed yesterday after the employees abandoned their
place of work.

<HEADLINE> China Enjoys Healthy foreign Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Customs statistics show that
in November China's import and export totalled 25.24 billion US
dollars, up 4.2 percent from a year ago, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The export volume grew 11.8 percent to reach 13.62 billion US
dollars last month, the fifth consecutive monthly growth since
exports revived in July and the first time this year that the
monthly growth rate has surpassed the rate for the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in November fell by 3.5 percent to 11.62 billion over
that in October, resulting in a trade surplus on the month of two
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trend towards growing exports and declining imports is
expected to continue until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade volume for the whole of 1996 is estimated
at 288 billion US dollars, or three percent more than last year,
said Huang Guohua, an official with the statistics department of
the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that throughout 1996, exports will rise to 151.5
billion US dollars while imports will likely hit 136.5 billion, an
increase of 3.5 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
During last 11 months, China registered 251.6 billion US
dollars in foreign trade. Exports gained 0.9 percent to 132.8
billion US dollars over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative trade surplus this year was 14 billion US
dollars at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
General trade totalled 89.1 billion US dollars in the
January-November period, down 9.7 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Processing trade -- importing materials to be processed and
re-exported with added value -- jumped 11 percent from a year ago
to 130.5 billion US dollars, one-and-a-half times the turnover in
general trade registered by November.
</P>
<P>
Capital goods imports by foreign-funded enterprises, bonded
trade and border trade also grew fast in the first 11 months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises remained China's mainstay exporters. In
the past 11 months, their exports were worth 75.3 billion US
dollars, or 57 percent of China's total, but 14 percent less than
they scored a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded companies accounted for 53 percent of China's
total imports in the period, with 28 percent of their imports
being capital goods for their own use. With a bullish 32 percent
export growth, such companies were the driving force behind
China's export revival.

<HEADLINE> PKK Also A Threat to Iraq: Iraqi Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq considers the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) is also a threat to itself, local
newspaper Daily News today quoted an Iraqi envoy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey Rafi Dahham Mijwel al Tikriti
said that the PKK is a threat to regional peace and stability,
adding that Baghdad understands the security concern of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to the U.S. influence in northern Iraq, the
Iraqi envoy stressed that Turkey and Iraq should work together
to solve their own security problems.
</P>
<P>
Tikriti accused the United States of trying to help the Iraqi
Kurds establish an independent Kurdish state loyal to Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq is ready to renew the "hot-pursuit"
accord with Ankara, which enabled Turkish forces to move into
northern Iraq to strike the PKK rebels in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed more than
21,000 lives since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S.-sponsored Operation Provide Comfort (OPC), the
ambassador said that the operation caused the situation in
northern Iraq even more unstable.
</P>
<P>
"This means the U.S. plans were unsuccessful. So it has
become obvious that they must review their policies toward us."
Tikriti said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has voiced
his opposition to the extension of the OPC mandate in view of
the recent developments in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Erbakan said that a new coalition air
reconnaissance force comprising of U.S., French, British and
Turkish forces will replace the OPC, which will expire on
December 31.
</P>
<P>
The OPC force, also made up of the four countries' forces,
was established in line with a Turkish parliamentary decision
made on January 17, 1991 and deployed at the Incirlik air base of
Adana, southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to provide air protection to the Kurds living
in northern Iraq against any possible action by the Iraqi
government troops in the wake of the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Botswana To Privatise State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is planning to
privatise major state corporations and utilities over the next
few years in an attempt to increase efficiency, said source
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Friday in Gaborone, Botswanan
Vice-President and Finance Minister Festus Mogae said the
government had appointed an independent task force to study the
issue and a privatisation policy paper is most likely to be ready
by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said although the government is under no budgetary
pressure to sell state assets to raise funds for development, it
is the correct approach for the benefit of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The consideration is to try and introduce efficiency into the
system," said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
Those state assets among the consideration for privatisation
include flag-carrier Air Botswana, Botswana Telecommunication
Corporation, Botswana Power Corporation and Water Utilities
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Mogae stressed that he believed the government should dispose
of 100 percent of such state corporatioins, reserving a fixed
amount, perhaps 20 percent, for domestic investors.

<HEADLINE> CCTV Marks Tenth Anniversary of English Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first television
service in the English language celebrated its 10th anniversary
here today.
</P>
<P>
China Central Television (CCTV), the national television
station, took the lead in starting English news and
general-interest program broadcasting in December 1986. It now
broadcasts some eight hours of English news and other programs
every day. All the English programs are about China and are
produced by CCTV itself.
</P>
<P>
Yang Weiguang, CCTV president, joined some 250 Chinese and
foreign viewers of the English service for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that he considered the English news service an
important part of CCTV's overseas service.
</P>
<P>
CCTV's English service is beamed to over 80 countries and
regions around the world. A CCTV survey showed that millions of
people at home and abroad have access to the program.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade at least 15 provincial TV stations and
TV stations in big cities across the country have been providing
local audiences with English-language services, such as news, and
foreign films and drama series. Among them are Beijing, Tianjin,
Shanghai and Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province,
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and east China's
Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan broadcasts the most hours of English-language programs
among all the country's TV stations. Most of the hours are
occupied by English foreign films and TV series.
</P>
<P>
Along with the deepening of China's reform and opening-up
drive, there will be more television stations starting
English-language services in various forms, said Sheng Yilai,
deputy director in charge of CCTV's overseas service.

<HEADLINE> Expressway Accidents Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A sharp rise in traffic
accidents on expressways left nearly 600 people dead and 1,550
injured in 4,780 accidents across the country during the first
nine months of this year, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the Ministry of Public Security.
Its Traffic Mangement Bureau has decided to take measures to curb
the occurrence of expressway accidents and minimize danger, said a
senior official with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Police patrols on expressways will be intensified and on some
sections officers will patrol 24 hours a day, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of traffic safety needs to be further popularized
among the public, especially among children and the rural and
transient population, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of expressway accidents has risen sharply in recent
years. incomplete statistics suggest 616 people were killed and
1,600 injured in 4,590 accidents on expressways in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of accidents rose 60 percent from 1994 and the death
toll and injury rate were 14.5 percent and 38 percent higher
respectively.
</P>
<P>
in 1994 and 1995 combined, the death rate on expressways was
30.8 people per 100 kilometers, five times that on ordinary
highways.
</P>
<P>
Effective prevention of road accidents on expressways needs the
close co-operation and joint efforts of all relevant departments,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Public security traffic management organs will strengthen
co-ordination between transport departments and other relevant
authorities to close or partially close express ways in bad
weather conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Violation of traffic regulations by drivers, including
exceeding speed limits, driving while overtired, random parking
and failure to keep a proper distance from vehicles ahead are the
main reasons for expressway accidents, he said.

<HEADLINE> ZANU (PF) Delegates Press for Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Factionalism, land
redistribution and black economic empowerment dominated the
debate at Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU (PF) national conference on
Friday with delegates accusing some leaders of causing divisions.
</P>
<P>
In a debate during which the government was also attacked for
allegedly moving slowly on land redistribution, the delegates
urged the government to enact laws that will nullify large claims
held by established mining house to enable indigenous
participation in that sector.
</P>
<P>
The delegates warned at the debate that if factionalism,
bedevilling the party continued unchecked, it had the potential
to cause civil strife.
</P>
<P>
''Factionalism is threatening the stability of the party and
eventually it can lead to the downfall of the ZANU (PF)
government,'' Christopher Mushowe, a provincial delegate from
Mutare said.
</P>
<P>
Joe Mapatya, a delegate from Masvingo noted that some central
committee and politburo members are solely responsible for
causing factionalism.
</P>
<P>
''The party is collapsing because of our leaders who are
hungry for power and greedy for money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mutoko North parliamentary member Mavis Chinomona-Guri said if
the government is serious about acquiring land for the people,
then it should do it.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is expected to respond to
questions posed by the delegates today.

Another resolution asked Tel Aviv to immediately end the
closure of the occupied territories and to ensure free movement
within the Palestinian territory.

<HEADLINE> Recommendations for Boeing 747 Fuel Tank Safety Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Five months after the TWA
Flight 800's crash, the U.S. federal safety agency today requested
the Federal Aviation Administration to protect U.S. airliners'
fuel tanks from heat sources to prevent explosion.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board made the urgent
recommendations after investigators said evidence from the crash
of the Trans World Airlines Flight 800 was "consistent" with a
fuel tank explosion.
</P>
<P>
The July 17 mid-air explosion occurred soon after the plane
took off at the New York J.F.K. International Airport, killing all
230 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB said, "The reconstruction thus far shows outward
deformation... of the internal components of the tank that are
consistent with an explosion originating within the tank."
</P>
<P>
The NTSB recommended the FAA to consider aircraft design
modifications, such as fire-extinguishing systems. It also
recommended the addition of insulation between heat-generating
equipment, such as air-conditioning ducts, and the fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
The safety board also asked the FAA to consider a rule
requiring an appropriate amount of fuel be kept in the center wing
tank of the B-747 to prevent volatile vapors from accumulating,
and keep the fuel cool. There should be proper monitoring and
maintenance of the tank's temperature.
</P>
<P>
The FAA and Boeing Co. said they would carefully review the
recommendations, which apply to all aircraft with similar fuel
tank configurations.

<HEADLINE> Canada Says Military Mission No Longer Needed in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada will withdraw its
command and elements of the Ottawa-led multinational military
force in eastern Zaire since the mission is no longer needed to
address the humanitarian crisis there, Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said today.
</P>
<P>
Canada has informed the United Nations of its stance, Chretien
said.
</P>
<P>
Canada will withdraw its command and elements of the military
force by December 31, the prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of Steering Group in New York, the force
commander, Canada's Lieutenant General Maurice Baril, presented
his first-hand assessment of the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The group agreed that the remaining problems in eastern Zaire
and Rwanda can best be addressed through a coordinated
international effort under civilian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The focus needs to be on providing support to the humanitarian
agencies and on addressing the political problems that caused the
crisis, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"Much remains to be done," Chretien said, adding that Canada is
willing to assist in the ongoing effort to cope with the influx of
refugees into Rwanda.
