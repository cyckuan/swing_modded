<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 104, Jazz 96  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 35 points and Vin Baker had a
season-high 33 to lead the Seattle SuperSonics to a 104-96 victory over the Utah
Jazz on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sonics led 90-79 with 5:21 to play, but Utah made things interesting by
cutting the margin to 95-94 on a 3-pointer by Jeff Hornacek with 2:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker hit two free throws and a jumper. Payton missed a 3-pointer, but the
Sonics got the rebound and Shammond Williams buried Utah on a 3-pointer with
35.6 seconds left, stretching the lead to 102-96. Williams finished with 16
points.
</P>
<P>
	   The best shot the Jazz could manage in the closing seconds was an airball
3-point attempt by John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone had 26 points and 11 rebounds, and Bryon Russell scored 19 and
gave the Jazz a chance by drawing an offensive foul by Payton with 2:26
remaining, setting up Hornacek's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton and Hornacek each scored 15, but Utah lost its fourth straight.
It's the first time that's happened since January 1997, but the Jazz went on to
reach the NBA Finals that season.
</P>
<P>
	   It also was the first time Utah lost consecutive home games since the
1995-96 season, when Minnesota and San Antonio won at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle seemed ready to wrap up the victory after Brent Barry hit a
3-pointer and Utah's Armen Gilliam was called for a flagrant foul on Payton, who
hit one of two free throws for a 90-79 lead with 5:21 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton emerged from a timeout with a bandage covering his forehead, a sight
that made Jazz fans chuckle. They weren't laughing a short time later when
Payton hit a 3-pointer for a 95-84 lead with 3:46 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's when the Jazz made a 10-0 run. Russell hit a 3-pointer and drove
for a three-point play, drawing a foul on Barry that hurt the Sonics even more
when Barry received a technical foul for arguing the call.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other end, Russell drew the foul on Payton on the perimeter and
Hornacek's 3-pointer pulled the Jazz within a basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry's 3-pointer with 10:04 remaining gave the Sonics an 80-73 lead.
Stockton hit a jumper to cut the margin to 80-75, but the Sonics came out of
timeout with a 6-2 run to regain control.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams had two layups and Payton drove for another basket as Seattle went
ahead 86-77 with 6:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz led by 10 points in the first quarter but Seattle rallied by
outscoring Utah 30-18 in the second. The Jazz shot 38.6 percent (17-of-44) in
the first half, helping the Sonics climb back.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 2, Canucks 1  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Joe Sakic had a goal and an assist, and Patrick Roy made 36
saves as the Colorado Avalanche outlasted the Vancouver Canucks 2-1 on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado, which extended its home-unbeaten streak to 11 games (9-0-2), lost
star forward Peter Forsberg early in the second period with a mild concussion
and a cut near his right eye that required seven stitches. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy's victory was the 431st of his career, leaving him just three wins shy
of Jacques Plante (434), who stands second on the NHL career list. Terry Sawchuk
leads with 447.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver's Garth Snow had 23 saves.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakic missed the two previous games with a strained groin, and Roy was
pulled from Saturday's loss to St. Louis with a similar injury, but neither
showed the effects of their injuries against the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
	   In a scoreless first period that saw Colorado outshoot Vancouver 13-4, the
Canucks withstood a 5-on-3 disadvantage for 1:43. Snow stopped Sandis Ozolinsh's
shot and a rebound by Sakic during Colorado's two-man advantage, and the Canucks
killed off both penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver rebounded in the second period, outshooting the Avalanche 14-6.
Snow stopped both Sakic and Adam Deadmarsh on short-handed breakaways in the
period. Vancouver again withstood a big penalty -- a five-minute major and game
misconduct on Todd Bertuzzi for boarding. Bertuzzi's hit sent Forsberg into the
glass.
</P>
<P>
	   But Colorado got off only one shot during the penalty, which actually lasted
just three minutes because of Dave Reid's goalie-interference penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   At 14:19, Chris Dingman poked the puck ahead of defenseman Mattias Ohlund to
Sakic, who beat Snow with a wrist shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado's Shjon Podein hit the left post in the waning seconds of the
period.
</P>
<P>
	   At 6:26 of the third, Sakic brought the puck across the blue line and fed
Deadmarsh in the slot for his 14th goal and a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than a minute later, the Canucks countered with a power-play goal by
Trent Klatt. Markus Naslund's shot from the point was deflected by Klatt past
Roy at 7:16, and the Canucks peppered Roy with shots in the closing minutes but
could not convert.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks outshot Colorado 33-12 over the last two periods.

<HEADLINE> Bruins 4, Senators 4, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Radek Bonk was a healthy performer for the
flu-stricken Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonk's 14th goal of the season with 33 seconds remaining in regulation gave
the Senators a 4-4 tie with the Boston Bruins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   He re-directed Igor Kravchuk's slap shot past Byron Dafoe with the Senators
on a power-play after Ray Bourque gave Boston the lead at 12:33 of the third
period.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a great shot by Kravy, right where my stick was, and I just tipped
it by (Dafoe)," said Bonk, who also added an assist.
</P>
<P>
	   Vaclav Prospal, Andreas Dackell and Andre Roy each had a goal and Daniel
Alfredsson had two assists for the Senators, missing defenseman Wade Redden,
goalie Patrick Lalime and forwards Marian Hossa and Shawn McEachern because of
the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   Defenseman Patrick Traverse was added to the flu list when he left midway
through the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could feel it at the end of the game, I was so tired," Bonk said of the
depleted lineup. "But it's things that we can't control and we have to power
through it."
</P>
<P>
	   Bourque, P.J. Axelsson and Rob DiMaio each had a goal and assist for the
Bruins, who blew a third-period lead for just the fourth time in 17 times when
leading after two. Anson Carter added his 22nd goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt made 38 saves, including stopping a 2-on-1
chance by Joe Thornton in overtime. Dafoe stopped 24 shots for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm a little disappointed," Axelsson said. "We relaxed too much at the
beginning of the third and they came at us. You can't do that."
</P>
<P>
	   After Prospal scored just 52 seconds in, Axelsson and Dackell exchanged
goals late in the first. For Dackell, it was just his third goal and first in 27
games.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody had to step up a little bit because we missed five guys with the
flu tonight," Dackell said. "I think a lot of guys stepped it up tonight and
showed they could play hockey."
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa twice came back in the third to tie it. Trailing 3-2, Bonk kept the
puck in at the Bruins' blue line before wristing a soft shot at Dafoe that Roy
deflected in with his glove. After a review, referee Greg Kimmerly allowed the
goal to stand.
</P>
<P>
	   In overtime, Axelsson and Bonk both shot high on back-to-back breakaways.
</P>
<P>
	   "We played (well) enough to get the two points," said Bourque, who was in
the penalty box for slashing when Bonk scored. "If we keep playing like that,
we'll get the two points."
</P>
<P>
	   Tugnutt returned to the lineup after missing two games with the flu. Lalime
had started the last four for Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Crash Clues Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- The pilots of Alaska Airlines Flight 261
struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before the
jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard, federal investigators
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The last minutes of the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by
pilots aboard four other aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board
was seeking to interview them.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane plunged from 17,000 feet and crashed nose-down in the Pacific
after the pilot reported problems with the horizontal stabilizer, a wing-like
structure on the tail that controls the pitch of the aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators at the crash site also said Tuesday they had detected an
electronic pinger intended to help locate the flight recorders, which could
reveal exactly what went wrong with the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   The search was concentrated on a debris field about 10 miles offshore and
about 40 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport. Coast Guard, Navy and
private vessels were joined by military airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a day after the accident, searchers had pulled four bodies -- one
man, two women and an infant-- from the sea, which is 300 to 750 feet deep in
the area. Hopes dimmed that anyone aboard Flight 261 survived in the 58-degree
water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is still a search for human life,'' Coast Guard Adm. Tom Collins
said. ``The challenge is time. As time ticks off, risks go up.''
</P>
<P>
	   At day's end, 11 relatives and friends of victims huddled on shore Port
Hueneme beach, staring out across the receding tide as the sinking sun painted
the Pacific horizon pink and brilliant orange. Candles left in the sand by
strangers flickered as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
	   A few members of the group scooped water and sand into plastic cups. A
police officer guarding their privacy took a group picture before they left.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, passers-by paused to bow their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just feels so good to stand out here and pray. It sort of cleanses you
out,'' said Diane Adame, 39. ``You don't realize when you put someone on a plane
and give them a hug that you might not see them again. I just feel for the
people who lost their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flight had left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for San Francisco and Seattle
with 83 passengers and five crew members. The passengers included three airline
employees, four employees of its sister airline Horizon and 25 relatives or
friends of the employees taking advantage of free standby flights.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt released preliminary transcripts of air
traffic control communications with the airliner. The last routine transmission
came at 3:55 p.m. PST, when the flight was cleared to continue to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4:10 p.m. the pilots said they had control difficulties and were
descending below 26,000 feet. A few seconds later they advised they were at
23,700 feet and there was ``some discussion about their ability to control the
aircraft,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next few minutes, the pilots said they ``were kind of stabilized
and going to do some troubleshooting,'' but then said they had a jammed
stabilizer. At 4:16 they were cleared for an emergency landing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The controllers cleared the plane to 17,000 feet. The crew acknowledged that
in what was the last known transmission from Flight 261, Hammerschmidt said. At
4:21 p.m. the aircraft dropped from radar.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew Gottshall, 45, a Channel Islands National Park worker, was putting up a
trail sign near the Anacapa Island lighthouse when he heard the jet, looked up
and watched it slam into the water 2 1/2 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The plane made a quick entry into the water upon impact, and
disappeared,'' Gottshall said in a statement released by the Park Service, which
noted that at the NTSB's request it did not include observations of the plane's
flight path and orientation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a point as I was watching the descent of the plane where I felt
hopeless,'' Gottshall said. ``It had a finality to it that came very quickly.
After the plane hit the water and disappeared, there was just me and the sea
gulls out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   The underwater pinging was pinpointed by a Navy team that joined in the
search effort. Investigators were uncertain whether the pings were from one or
both of the recorders.
</P>
<P>
	   One some planes, the horizontal stabilizer is monitored by the plane's data
recorder. The other ``black box'' records pilot conversations.
</P>
<P>
	   If the data recorder was programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it would
reveal the condition of the device's electrical and hydraulic controls. If not,
officials would have to deduce what happened to the device by studying how other
systems performed before the crash, said Barry Schiff, an aviation consultant
and former TWA pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer typically is controlled by the automatic pilot, but can also
be manipulated in the cockpit. Pilots are trained extensively in what to do
about stabilizer malfunctions. If the problem can't be fixed, the nose of the
aircraft can move up or down uncontrollably until gravity forces the plane into
a dive.
</P>
<P>
	   Both pilots were Alaska Airlines veterans. Capt. Ted Thompson, 53, was hired
in 1982 and had 10,400 flying hours with the company. First Officer William
Tansky, 57, was hired in 1985 and had 8,047 flying hours with the Seattle-based
airline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure everyone knows that it would make my dad happy to see
how many people saw him as a father, a brother and a friend,'' said Fred
Thompson, 24, the pilot's son. ``And our hearts and thoughts are with the
families of the Alaska employees and passengers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was being directed by a 10-member NTSB team that arrived
in Port Hueneme early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the NTSB would be interviewing as many as four pilots who
might have seen Flight 261's final minutes from their planes -- a Skywest
flight, a private aircraft, another Alaska Airlines jet and a fourth plane that
was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   As search boats moved in and out of Port Hueneme, an artist erected a 7-foot
wooden cross as a memorial to the victims. The cross was adorned with flowers,
and a white plastic angel sat at the base next to a candle in a jar.
</P>
<P>
	   Victoria Arjaev, 55, of Port Hueneme, and her sister JoAnne Frank, visiting
from Wisconsin, tossed a bouquet of red carnations into the water off the pier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to say a prayer that they're in God's hands. And maybe for a
miracle, that there's some survivor out there. You never know,'' Arjaev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has the image of an Eskimo painted on the tails of
its planes, serves more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five
Western states. Until Monday, the airline had gone 24 years without a fatal
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, Alaska Airlines has been the subject of federal grand jury
investigation in Oakland over maintenance and repair records for some MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report concluded that records were
falsified on two MD-80s that made 840 flights in late 1998 and early 1999.
Because of the altered records, the aircraft were considered ``unairworthy,''
FAA documents said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines, said the plane
that crashed was not one of those involved in the investigation. An airline
spokesman said the investigation focused on record keeping, not the safety of
the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors declined to comment, citing grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA had 44 reports of ``service difficulty'' for the plane that crashed
dating to 1992, when it was built, but most deal with problems involving
emergency lights and sliding windows not opening. In 1995, an engine failed and
the plane landed without incident. The engine was replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Evans, an airline spokesman, said the plane had no previous stabilizer
problems.

<HEADLINE> Jagr May Miss All-Star Game  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- NHL scoring leader Jaromir Jagr, who said last week he
might miss the All-Star game because of a rib injury, now says a banged-up thumb
may cause him to skip Sunday's game in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr, upset a penalty wasn't assessed after he absorbed a slash across his
left thumb Monday in Atlanta, said Tuesday he would prefer to sit out the
All-Star break to get healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr recently missed four games with a sore rib cage muscle, only to injure
his thumb three games after returning from the rib injury.
</P>
<P>
	   The thumb was heavily wrapped in tape during a 3-2 victory Tuesday over
Washington, but Jagr didn't bother getting an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's probably broken," he said. "But I don't want to know."
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr would prefer to skip the Toronto festivities, get some medical
attention and rest up for a stretch of four games in six nights next week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure if I'm going to play," Jagr said. "I'd rather see the doctors
and get ready for some very important games we've got coming up. We've got some
very important games coming up."
</P>
<P>
	   But if Jagr plays as expected Thursday against the New York Islanders, the
NHL probably would exert some pressure, subtle or otherwise, for him to appear
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr was by far the leading vote-getter, becoming the first player to draw
more than 1 million votes in the fan balloting.
</P>
<P>
	   "They put some pressure on me last (Monday) night by hitting me on the
finger," Jagr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his injuries, Jagr assisted on two of the Penguins' three goals
Tuesday, giving him 36 goals and 43 assists and a league-leading 79 points in 46
games.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's playing unbelievable right now," said teammate Martin Straka, who
scored twice. "He's giving us a chance to win right now."

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Lewis Accusations  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- NFL star Ray Lewis was at a post-Super Bowl brawl in which
two people were stabbed to death but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong
time, his lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Baltimore Ravens linebacker, his hands shackled in front of him,
appeared in court on two counts of murder in the slayings early Monday. No bail
was set and he will remain jailed until a Feb. 24 preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder charges carry life in prison or the death penalty, if prosecutors
pursue it.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis is the second NFL player in less than a month accused of murder.
Former Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth was charged with murdering his
girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time of the drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue had no comment, but Gene Washington, the
NFL's chief disciplinarian, called Lewis' arrest "devastating."
</P>
<P>
	   "We've had a tough year as it goes anyway with the Rae Carruth situation,"
he told One on One sports radio network in Chicago. "We certainly, for his own
good, hope that it's not true, and for the good of the NFL."
</P>
<P>
	   The Ravens said they have not taken any action against Lewis and have not
spoken with the 24-year-old player.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if the team was considering releasing Lewis, Ravens spokesman Kevin
Byrne said, "Until due process of the law is completed, that will not be
addressed."
</P>
<P>
	   Several of Lewis' teammates reacted with disbelief at his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's my man," Ravens cornerback Rod Woodson, whose locker is next to
Lewis', said from the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. "I hope it ain't true. That's all I
can say."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's always been a good guy," another Pro Bowler, linebacker Peter
Boulware, told One on One. "Everyone in the locker room likes him. I mean, he
rallies our team together. I can't say enough good things about Ray."
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were stabbed repeatedly during a fight about 200 yards from a
bar where a party had emptied into the street.
</P>
<P>
	   "You go out and you get around different people," Boulware said. "Some
people may not like you because of who you are. They put you in bad situations.
I can see that maybe that's the only reason this happened."
</P>
<P>
	   According to witnesses, six men fought and argued with the victims before
fleeing in a black limousine, firing at least five shots as they drove away.
Police found the limousine a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're taking the position that he was in the wrong place at the wrong
time," Lewis' lawyer, Max Richardson Jr., said outside court. "From what I've
gathered from law enforcement officers, they know Ray didn't kill these
unfortunate victims."
</P>
<P>
	   He said police were searching for other suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't know where the other two men who were involved are, so they
arrested Ray," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokeswoman Marion Lee would not comment on whether other suspects
were being sought or why murder charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Wednesday that police were holding
Lewis' limousine driver under guard in a hotel room while they hunted for others
in the pro football star's entourage.
</P>
<P>
	   Detectives said they were gathering information for murder warrants on at
least two more men who were with Lewis in his limousine Monday morning, but they
would not identify the men, the paper said. It said one officer believed that
they were not active NFL players.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was questioned Monday and postponed a flight to Hawaii, where he was
to have appeared Sunday in his third straight Pro Bowl after leading the NFL in
tackles this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I cooperated fully," Lewis told The (Baltimore) Sun before his arrest. He
wouldn't comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he had spent only a few minutes with Lewis before the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ray is doing fine," he said. "He believes the system will ultimately show
that he is innocent of these heinous crimes."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis also faces second-degree assault charges from a Nov. 30 confrontation
at a Baltimore-area bar in which he allegedly hit a woman. But authorities said
Tuesday the case will not go to trial if the charge cannot be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims from the Super Bowl fight were identified as Jacinth "Shorty"
Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, both of suburban Decatur.
</P>
<P>
	   Lollar's grandmother said several of Lollar's friends told her he had been
trying to break up a fight between Baker and an unidentified man when a group of
men ambushed them.
</P>
<P>
	   Joyce Lollar, speaking from Akron, Ohio, said her grandson and his
girlfriend were expecting a baby next month.

<HEADLINE> High-Interest Lender Regs Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan clashes over gun makers and anti-abortion
protesters is marking Senate debate on legislation that would make it tougher
for people to sweep away their debts through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   An amendment proposed by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., would prohibit gun makers and dealers from erasing debts in bankruptcy
that arose from successful lawsuits against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative GOP lawmakers have protested the amendment as anti-business.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal ``is designed to encourage lawsuits ... and put the firearms
industry in this country out of business,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that some two dozen U.S. cities and towns have sued gun makers and
distributors, Levin said the firearms industry ``should not be able to evade
judgments by going bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate was voting today on the proposed amendment and on a provision,
sponsored by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that would require bankrupt people
found to have violated laws protecting abortion clinics to pay their penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer has cited the case of Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who
filed for bankruptcy court protection in November 1998, blaming heavy debts owed
to women's groups and abortion clinics that have sued him.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., denounced the proposal as an attempt ``to silence
the free speech of abortion opponents.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Senate rebuffed an attempt by some Democrats to make it
harder for high-interest, storefront lenders to collect debts from people who
have filed for bankruptcy relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators voted, 53-44, to reject an amendment proposed by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., that would have prohibited lending businesses charging more
than 100 percent annual interest in recovering debts from consumers in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A partisan dispute over a minimum wage increase and tax breaks for small
businesses, meanwhile, threatened to delay final Senate passage of the
legislation to overhaul the bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said a $1 increase in the $5.15 hourly
minimum over three years was insufficient. In addition, the White House and
Democratic lawmakers oppose $18.4 billion in small-business tax breaks proposed
by the GOP that are tied to the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made, Daschle told reporters, ``I'm concerned that the
bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The current bill, which appeared headed toward Senate passage today, has
been pushed by banks, credit card companies and retail-business groups.
Proponents say the bankruptcy overhaul is needed to stem abuse by people who can
afford to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation favors
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt. They insist
that the credit card companies share the blame by flooding consumers with mailed
solicitations to entice them into easy credit.
</P>
<P>
	   The House approved bankruptcy overhaul legislation last May by a veto-proof
margin, 313-108.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration, which supports overhauling the bankruptcy laws
in principle, has criticized the House and Senate versions as being too hard on
debtors.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the minimum wage-tax breaks provision, the Senate bill
contains several other provisions unrelated to bankruptcy: tightened penalties
for selling illegal drugs to minors, a narrowing of the disparity in sentences
for sales of powder and crack cocaine, and stiffer penalties for makers of the
illegal drug methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone's defeated proposal opened a debate on so-called payday loans --
small, short-term cash advances against a borrower's paycheck that carry
triple-digit interest rates. Wellstone called the businesses making them
``unscrupulous loan sharks.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Hatch insisted that payday loans are ``a legitimate service that many
honest consumers use.''

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 92, Bulls 81  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Brian Grant scored 19 points as the Portland Trail
Blazers moved atop the NBA overall standings by beating the Chicago Bulls 92-81
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers moved a half-game ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers, who lost to
San Antonio 105-81.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace, who earlier in the day was selected to the All-Star team
for the first time in his five-year career, added 14 points and nine rebounds
for Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time the Blazers were all alone in first place in the Pacific
Division was Dec. 7, when they were 15-4 and the Lakers 14-4. Two days later,
Los Angeles pulled into a tie at 15-5 and held onto first until its recent
slide.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand led the Bulls with 22 points and eight rebounds. Toni Kukoc
added 12 points but shot just 2-of-10 after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers, who have won six in a row and 10 straight at home, never
trailed against the Bulls, but Portland coach Mike Dunleavy was constantly
yelling at his team for giving up easy baskets and trying too many
highlight-reel dunk attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team seemed interested in playing much interior defense in the first
half, as Portland gave up 15 offensive rebounds and 24 points in the paint. The
Blazers, meanwhile, scored 36 inside points -- 16 on dunks.
</P>
<P>
	   A put-back by Brand ended an 8-0 run and cut the lead to 43-40 with 4:44
left in the first half, but the Bulls didn't hit a field goal for the next nine
minutes, and Portland pushed the lead back to 12 three minutes into the third.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 105, Lakers 81  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- It has been almost three weeks since the Los Angeles
Lakers' 16-game winning streak ended, and never did they look further removed
from such success than Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The San Antonio Spurs made the Lakers look lazy and lousy in a dominating
105-81 victory that helped knock Los Angeles out of first place in the overall
NBA standings.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Duncan had 29 points and 18 rebounds, Avery Johnson tied his season-high
with 22 points, Terry Porter scored 15 and David Robinson had 14 points and 12
rebounds for the Spurs, who sent the once-mighty Lakers to their fourth loss in
five games.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's saying it's the difference in the Lakers, but we played a lot
better than we usually do," Duncan said. "We shot the ball well, we defended
solid, make fewer mistakes than we did (against Los Angeles) on Christmas Day
and didn't give up as many layups as we did.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the NBA, on any given night anything can happen, and this was a great
night for us."
</P>
<P>
	   This loss had to be particularly disturbing for the Lakers, who showed
little discipline or cohesion as they frequently abandoned the triangle offense
for ill-advised shots and matched their lowest point total of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio led by five after one quarter, by 10 at halftime, by 17 after
three quarters and by as many as 28 in the fourth in handing the Lakers what was
easily their most lopsided loss of the season. Previously, the Lakers' worst
loss was by 16 points against Houston in the seventh game of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to figure out what we're doing wrong and correct it," Kobe Bryant
said. "We're down because we've lost a couple games in a row here."
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers tumbled out of first place in the Pacific Division -- a spot they
held since Dec. 14 -- when the Portland Trail Blazers beat visiting Chicago
92-81 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   For San Antonio, the victory avenged a loss to the Lakers on Christmas Day.
The Spurs shot 52 percent to improve to 11-0 when making at least half their
shots and 14-1 when scoring at least 100 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal, who was in foul trouble much of the night, scored 31 to
lead the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles allowed an opponent to shoot 50 percent for only the second time
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to get back to the basics to get back on track. We will," O'Neal
said. "We're not playing well, not hitting shots, not playing good defense. We
just have to look in the mirror at our individual selves and pick it up.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever we don't play smart, this is the outcome."
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan had 18 points and 10 rebounds in the first half, which ended with the
Spurs ahead 55-45 after they closed the half with a 14-7 run. O'Neal finished
the half with three fouls but shot 7-for-8 from the field and scored 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Mario Elie hit a 3-pointer and Robinson followed with a jumper early in the
third quarter to put San Antonio ahead 62-48.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal picked up his fourth foul with 4:18 left in the third quarter,
prompting coach Phil Jackson to turn away from the ensuing play so he could
berate the officials, and Duncan followed with a bank shot to up the lead to
71-56.
</P>
<P>
	   A 3-pointer by Jaren Jackson, a jump hook by Duncan, a wide-open jumper by
Johnson and two foul shots by Elie constituted a 9-0 run that put the Spurs up
80-58 late in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   An 11-2 run got the Lakers back within 13, but Duncan had a tip-in and
another bank shot and Elie hit a 3-pointer to make it 88-71 with 7:44 left, and
the run reached 19-4 on a foul shot by Jackson that made it 103-75 with 3:36
left.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is we just have to play ball together," Jackson said. "Part of
the demise of the winning streak going down the tubes is that we're not playing
well together."

<P>
    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Pavol Demitra scored twice -- including the
overtime winner -- as the St. Louis Blues won their fourth straight Tuesday
night with a 5-4 victory over the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
	   A pass from Michal Handzus sent Demitra in on a breakaway and he beat Fred
Brathwaite on a shot through the pads at 2:02 to win it.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory moved St. Louis past the Detroit Red Wings into first place in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis had a 4-2 lead entering the final five minutes of the game but
goals 3:37 apart by Valeri Bure and Andrei Nazarov tied it.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra period featured the NHL's top two overtime teams. St. Louis
improved to 5-0-6 while Calgary dropped to 10-2-5.
</P>
<P>
	   The late-game excitement overshadowed a solid performance from St. Louis
center Marty Reasoner, who scored twice in his first game filling in for the
injured Pierre Turgeon.
</P>
<P>
	   Reasoner was recalled Monday from Worcester of the AHL. Scott Pellerin also
scored for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Demitra extended his point-scoring streak to seven games (4-5-9).
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Shantz and Clarke Wilm also scored for the Flames.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss, Calgary's fourth in a row, snapped a seven-game home winning
streak. It was just the Flames second loss at the Canadian Airlines Saddledome
since Nov. 13 (13-2-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 4-2, Calgary pulled within one when Bure scored his 27th goal from
a scramble at 15:12.
</P>
<P>
	   Nazarov then tied it at 18:49, firing Marc Savard's pass past Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure's 27 goals are a career-high, surpassing the 26 he scored last season.

<HEADLINE> No. 21 Temple 75, Massachusetts 48  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Neither Temple nor Massachusetts shot very well. It's
what happened to all those missed shots that made the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 21 Temple harassed the Minutemen into bad shots and then dominated the
boards, outrebounding UMass 48-20 Tuesday night en route to a 75-48 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're not rebounding the ball and getting second chances, it's
tough," said UMass coach Bruiser Flint, whose team shot just 38 percent. "When
you start getting down against those guys, it's tough because of the way they
play."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Karcher scored 17 points and Keaton Sanders had nine rebounds for
Temple (15-4, 8-1 Atlantic 10), which earned its sixth consecutive victory and
ninth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Monty Mack scored 14 points and had a team-leading four rebounds as UMass
(11-9, 5-3) had its lowest scoring output of the season and just their second
loss in eight games. It was their worst loss ever at the Mullins Center, which
opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bruiser right now doesn't have the talent that they once had," said Temple
coach John Chaney, who had only won in the building once before. "Those things
go around and around."
</P>
<P>
	   Temple shot just 46 percent, but its top-ranked defense, which has allowed
opponents 53.5 points per game, gave up more than 47 points for the first time
in five games -- and just barely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Owls' defense was so dominant that they finished with as many rebounds
-- 48 -- as UMass had points. Temple had a 20-16 rebounding edge under its own
basket and a 28-4 edge on the defensive boards.
</P>
<P>
	   That helped the Owls to 15 second-chance points -- UMass had none -- and a
20-8 advantage on points in the paint.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we establish the floor with our defense, our offense comes around,"
Karcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple led 23-19 before going on a 20-2 run that put the game away early.
The Owls held UMass scoreless for 7:32 before Micah Brand made a layup with four
seconds left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minutemen then went scoreless for the first 3:55 of the second half. By
that time, the Owls led 43-21, and it was never close again.
</P>
<P>
	   Mack and Temple's Quincy Wadley, the Atlantic 10's co-players of the week
last week, each had just one basket for most of the first half. But Wadley added
two in the final two minutes of the half and a 3-pointer for the first basket of
the second half to finish with nine points.
</P>
<P>
	   "We tried to get out (in front of) Mack," Karcher said. "He's their shooter
and we didn't want to let him get a good look at the basket."

<HEADLINE> Alaska Dominates Pacific NW Routes  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- It's said that the closest thing Alaska has to a mass
transit system is Alaska Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   For 19 Alaskan cities and towns, from metropolitan Anchorage to rural King
Salmon and remote Barrow, Alaska Airlines serves as a link to the rest of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In each of the last 27 years, the airline has carried more people from
Alaska to the lower 48 states than any other airline, according to Alaska Air
Group, the company which operates Alaska Airlines and the smaller Horizon
Airlines, a regional carrier in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline, which has the image of an Eskimo painted on the tails of its
planes, also ferries people throughout Alaska and is the leading carrier in
Washington and Oregon as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "In its market, Alaska Airlines is dominant," said Brian Harris, a financial
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   And until Monday, it could also boast it was among the safest air carriers
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had gone 24 years without a fatal accident before one of the
company's jets plummeted into the sea off the California coast Monday night,
taking 88 people down with it.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash comes amid a rough patch for Alaska Airlines, which serves more
than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had to severely reduce costs in the mid-1990s to stay
competitive with Southwest Airlines and Northwest Airlines as they pushed into
the Seattle market, where Alaska is based. Today, with both competitors dominant
in the mountain states and California, Alaska finds itself hemmed in -- strong
at home, but with little room to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not a growth airline," Harris said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, in the past year, Alaska Airlines has been the subject of federal
grand jury investigation in Oakland over maintenance and repair records for some
MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
	   A Federal Aviation Administration report concluded that records were
falsified on two MD-80s that made 840 flights in late 1998 and early 1999.
Because of the altered records, the aircraft were considered "unairworthy," FAA
documents said.
</P>
<P>
	   John Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Alaska Airlines, said the plane
that crashed was not one of those involved in the investigation. An airline
spokesman said the investigation focused on record keeping, not the safety of
the airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors declined to comment, citing grand jury secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Until this week, Alaska Airlines' most recent fatal crash was on April 5,
1976, when one passenger was killed when an airplane overran the runway in
Ketchikan, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline traces its roots to McGee Airways, which started flying between
Anchorage and Bristol Bay with a three-passenger plane in 1933. The Alaska
Airlines name was adopted in 1944; it acquired Horizon Air in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   The rough terrain and weather in Alaska prompted the company to become an
early adopter of new technologies. In 1989, an Alaska Airlines 727 jet was the
first commercial craft to land in dense fog using a heads-up guidance system,
which projects flight information on a transparent screen, allowing the pilot to
monitor instruments without having to look down at the control panel.

<HEADLINE> Accounting Industry Sets New Rules  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Following revelations of widespread rule-breaking at a
major accounting firm, an industry group is adopting new guidelines to make sure
accountants maintain their distance from the companies they scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals announced Tuesday by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants came less than a month after an independent review found that
nearly half the partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers reported having violated
rules prohibiting them from owning stock in companies they audit.
</P>
<P>
	   The widespread violations embarrassed the public accounting profession,
whose mission is to serve as independent arbiters of the way publicly traded
companies keep their books.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is continuing its
investigation of PricewaterhouseCoopers, gave the new guidelines a cautious
welcome.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a first step in ensuring that the firms comply with elementary
independence rules," said SEC spokesman Chris Ullman. "But while systems changes
are helpful, the culture needs to change as well."
</P>
<P>
	   The new rules call for the nation's top five accounting firms to set up more
rigorous internal control systems, include training programs for accountants and
strengthening inspection processes. The changes are expected to cost about $25
million.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals also call for formalizing disciplinary steps for rule
violators and modernizing language used in the rules about stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Conway, chairman of the group's SEC Practice Section Executive
Committee, said too many of the rules "have become disconnected from the
realities of how business is conducted."
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Melancon, president of the accountants' group, told reporters in a
conference call that he expected most of the new provisions to be in place by
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to PWC, the other five major accounting firms -- which dominate
the industry -- are Andersen Worldwide, KPMG Peat Marwick, Deloitte &AMP; Touche and

<HEADLINE> GM Won't Spin Off Hughes  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- In a bid to boost its stock and let its shareholders in on
Wall Street's technology craze, General Motors Corp. will offer to swap its
shares for those in its Hughes Electronics unit, a major player in satellite
television service.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said Tuesday it would issue $15 billion in new shares of the stock that
tracks Hughes' performance. Shareholders will be offered $8 billion in Hughes
tracking stock in exchange for their regular GM shares. GM will contribute the
remaining $7 billion of Hughes' stock to trust funds for retiree benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   "These actions enable GM to realize $15 billion of the value of Hughes, and
improve GM's financial flexibility to pursue business and growth initiatives in
our automotive and financial services businesses," GM's chairman, Jack Smith,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes' tracking stock reflects its financial performance, but does not
represent any ownership stake in the company, which will remain a wholly owned
subsidiary of GM.
</P>
<P>
	   The move will reduce the number of GM shares on the market, driving up GM's
earnings per share. The transaction also will reduce GM's hoard of Hughes stock
from 68 percent to 35 percent, or about $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts had been expecting some kind of move from GM on its
Hughes stock for months, as Hughes enjoyed a strong run in a market hungry for
technology businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The former defense electronics specialist has become a leader in the
satellite television business; its DirecTV service has 8 million subscribers.
Hughes is also building a $1.4 billion wireless data network called Spaceway
that it expects to unveil in 2003. The system will use satellites to connect
users to the Internet at high speeds and to swap data with each other.
</P>
<P>
	   While GM has not been shy about selling or spinning off businesses, company
leaders say they have no such plans for Hughes. GM has been looking at ways to
squeeze more profits out of each vehicle by selling services such as Internet
access, its OnStar security system or satellite radio -- all of which require
expertise in wireless and satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
	   One example: Smith said last month that Hughes scientists had figured out a
way to use satellite radio services to carry video signals, making a satellite
TV service for vehicles possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no current plans or intentions to separate Hughes from GM," said J.
Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer. "We continue to like the Hughes
growth opportunities and the telecommunications synergies."
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities said the deal would likely be a
good compromise between GM's need to stay in control of Hughes and Wall Street's
clamor for a full spinoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not as good a deal as if GM had spun off the whole Hughes business,"
Healy said. "But they balanced the need of the corporation with the needs of
shareholders."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Report Mixed Sales  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- While January storms hurt some U.S. sales of cars and
trucks, most automakers managed to keep the sales momentum from a record 1999
churning into 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Major American automakers were a mixed bag. General Motors Corp. reported
Tuesday a sizable increase, while Ford Motor Co. posted a more modest gain and
the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG said its sales were down slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Most foreign automakers said their sales remained strong.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said its sales of cars, pickups, minivans and sport utility vehicles were
up 12 percent overall, with an 18 percent increase in truck sales and a 6.5
percent increase in car sales over January 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those gains came from GM mainstays whose production had been slowed
while new versions were rolled out, like the Chevrolet Suburban SUV, the
Silverado pickup and the Cadillac DeVille sedan. GM's results do not include
sales from its Saab unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst David Healy with Burnham Securities said GM also benefited from
comparison to a weak January 1999. But GM said even taking that into account,
its performance was still good.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're off to a brisk beginning, and we think the industry is off to a brisk
beginning," said Paul Ballew, GM's director of industry analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at Ford were up 3 percent because of a 15 percent gain in cars that
outweighed a 3 percent decline in trucks. Ford's results do not include sales
from the Volvo or Jaguar lines that it owns.
</P>
<P>
	   The decline in truck sales was led by the Ranger pickup, but also hit most
of the company's SUVs -- the Ford Explorer and Excursion and the Lincoln
Navigator. Healy said some of the decline was likely because of new truck models
from GM, Dodge and other automakers luring customers from Ford's aging lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their bread-and-butter light truck lines have been out there a while and
are getting hurt by the competition," Healy said.
</P>
<P>
	   While some of Ford's gains in cars came from new models -- the restyled Ford
Taurus/Mercury Sable sedans, the Focus compact and the Lincoln LS -- the biggest
gains were posted by two models that Ford plans to discontinue, the Ford
Contour/Mercury Mystique sedans. Healy said Ford might be trying to clear out
its lots.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly you don't have customers lining up around the block to buy
semi-obsolete models unless there are rebate or fleet deals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles were down 6 percent overall, with
cars and trucks each down 6 percent. Much of the decline could be traced to the
Plymouth line, which Chrysler is phasing out. Other results were mixed; while
minivan sales ticked up, sales of some pickups and Dodge and Jeep SUVs fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing
operations, said the company's results suffered because of comparisons with
blockbuster results from a year ago. Jameson also said winter storms in the
Northeast hit Chrysler hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, "this January was a very good month," Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a group, foreign automakers continued to improve their sales. Toyota said
its U.S. sales were up 36 percent because of big gains from its Camry sedan and
Tundra full-size pickup.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't supposed to be this good," Jim Press, Toyota's executive vice
president for U.S. sales, said in a statement. "Industry sales have tracked the
steady rise in personal income and personal spending. It's been an enjoyable
ride, but we have plans in place for a slower pace, if necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Honda said its U.S. sales were up 3 percent because of strong demand for its
Odyssey minivan. Nissan boosted its U.S. sales 27 percent with its Xterra SUV
and Frontier Crew Cab pickup. Mazda sales were up 2 percent, Mitsubishi sales
were up 9 percent, and Subaru sales were up 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen said its sales were up 48 percent over last year, with its Passat
and Jetta models leading the way. Volvo said its sales were up 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a few automakers had not reported their results by Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Resell of Wireless License Nixed  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal court has rejected a bid by the Federal
Communications Commission to take back valuable airwave licenses from a bankrupt
wireless company and reauction them.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York ruled on
Monday that the FCC exceeded its authority Jan. 12 by declaring that NextWave
Telecom's licenses had been revoked because the company failed to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC, emboldened by a November appeals court ruling that confirmed the
agency's authority over the licenses, argued that NextWave violated FCC rules by
failing to pay the remaining $4.3 billion of the $4.7 billion the company bid
when it won a spectrum auction back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bankruptcy court rejected that argument with a stern tone, asserting
that FCC rules do not supercede the federal Bankruptcy Code.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also criticized the FCC's timing, calling it "shocking" that the
agency would take such an action after more than a year of "intense litigation"
involving three federal courts and at least five federal judges.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC declaration "conflicted with countless written and oral utterances
and acts of the FCC throughout the past year," the ruling said, adding that the
bankruptcy court had not yet been able to rule on a new proposal by NextWave to
pay its debts and begin building a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   "Astonishingly, the January 12 Declaration followed by one day a letter from
the President of NextWave to the Chairman of the FCC offering to satisfy
NextWave's entire 10-year installment obligation to the FCC by making a single
lump sum payment."
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC, anxious to put finally NextWave's portion of the airwaves to use
for consumers, had hoped to hold a new auction for the NextWave licenses in
July. With the current frenzy over wireless access to the Internet, those
licenses could fetch far more than NextWave's winning bid.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the agency declined to comment specifically on the ruling, but
said it expects to file an appeal shortly.
</P>
<P>
	   NextWave, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., is one of three winning bidders in the
1996 auction that have since filed for Chapter 11, tying up the licenses in
bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   The NextWave licenses include spectrum in major metropolitan markets such as
New York, Seattle, Philadelphia and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a group of investors including Global Crossing and Liberty
Media, an affiliate of AT&AMP;T, agreed to provide $1.6 billion in cash to help
NextWave emerge from bankruptcy court and build a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   That process, however, could take much longer than reauctioning the licenses
to an existing wireless operator.

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Beating back Bill Bradley's once-robust challenge,
Vice President Al Gore cast his New Hampshire victory as a "devastating blow" to
his Democratic rival. Both candidates raced toward battleground primary states

from coast to coast, all the way to victory in November," Gore declared before
leaving for a 2 a.m. airport rally in New York, which votes March 7. Bradley
credited Gore with running a strong race but declared his determination to fight

Chances of Alaska Air Survivors Slim
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Hopes are increasingly slim for finding any
survivors from the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. Searchers have pulled
four bodies -- one man, two women and an infant-- from the calm sea, which is
300 to 750 feet deep in the area. Investigators said Tuesday that the pilots of
the jet struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before
the jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard. The last minutes of
the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by pilots aboard four other
aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board was seeking to interview
them.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Antawn Jamison had 24 points and 12 rebounds and John
Starks returned from the injured list to score 20 points as the Golden State
Warriors humiliated the Los Angeles Clippers 107-76 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Donyell Marshall added 19 points and 13 rebounds for the Warriors, who
enjoyed their most lopsided victory of the season despite entering the game with
the worst record in the Western Conference. It was their fourth victory in six
games following an 11-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyrone Nesby scored 20 points for Los Angeles, which lost for the 15th time
in 17 games following a season-best three-game winning streak. The loss was
their 10th this season by 20 or more points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers, who won their previous three games against the Warriors by a
combined margin of eight points, made only four of 22 shots in the third quarter
as Golden State built a 73-51 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Starks, who missed the Warriors' previous nine games because of tendinitis
in his right knee, hit 3-pointers on both ends of an 11-2 run that increased
their six-point halftime lead to 59-44 with 9 1/2 minutes left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Starks' fourth and final 3-pointer of the game gave the Warriors their
biggest lead, 80-53, with 9:36 remaining. The Clippers got no closer than 19
points after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State's 48-42 halftime margin was the biggest for either team during
the first two quarters. Marshall had 12 points in the half, while Jamison
contributed 10 points and nine rebounds. Sam Jacobson's 21-foot jumper put the
Warriors ahead to stay with 8:22 left in the second period.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 101, Mavericks 100  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Allen Iverson scored 29 points, including two free throws
with 17.1 seconds left that capped a rally, as Philadelphia beat Dallas 101-100
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The 76ers, who had lost their last three, trailed by 10 just seconds into
the fourth quarter, but within minutes tied it at 89. A basket by George Lynch
put them ahead 99-98 for the first time in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   New All-Star Michael Finley answered with a jumper at 28.4 seconds and
appeared to be the hero again when he snagged a rebound of an Iverson miss.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials said Cedric Ceballos fouled Iverson on the play and the
league's leading scorer swished his first free throw and bounced the second in
off the front rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Finley had the ball on Dallas' last possession, but he gave it up to Dirk
Nowitzki. As the double-team ran to him, he dumped the ball to Steve Nash, who
didn't seem to be expecting it. An ugly lob that bounced off the rim at the
buzzer reflected that.
</P>
<P>
	   A smiling Iverson ran off the court and hugged coach Larry Brown, who moved
into sole possession of 10th place on the career victory list with 708.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other end of the floor, the Mavericks -- who ended a four-game
winning streak -- were still upset about the foul called on Ceballos. Finley
walked slowly to the scorer's table and gave it a loud whack with his fist.
</P>
<P>
	   Theo Ratliff was a huge inside presence for Philadelphia, scoring a
season-high 25 points and grabbing 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas, possibly playing its last game without Dennis Rodman, was
outrebounded 54-39. Rodman was in town deciding whether to sign with his
hometown team.
</P>
<P>
	   Ceballos led the Mavericks with 26 points and 12 rebounds. Finley had 21
points and Shawn Bradley added 17.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Avalanche Victims Rescued  </HEADLINE>
   By T.A. BADGER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Nine motorists were rescued by a police helicopter
Tuesday after spending the night trapped by a series of avalanches south of
Anchorage that killed a maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
	   The travelers, who had kept in touch with rescuers by cellular phone as they
waited along the Seward Highway, were flown out in three groups and taken to a
diner for breakfast. They were in good condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ate everything they had in the restaurant, and now we're starting all
over again,'' said Darwin Peterson. ``I told my wife when we get back home, I'm
not going as far as the post office for the rest of the winter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ten other motorists trapped by another avalanche elsewhere along the highway
were rescued late Monday by a construction crew that used a front-end loader to
clear away snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Avalanches have covered parts of the highway over a 50-mile stretch south of
the city. On Tuesday afternoon, an Alaska Railroad employee was killed when an
avalanche smashed into his bulldozer while he was clearing snow. Kerry Brookman,
53, of Palmer was pulled from the snow but died of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Alternating freezes and thaws in December created a base of crusty, unstable
snow, and a series of storms deposited deep snow over the past week. The
combination has created the worst avalanche danger in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the those rescued Tuesday had wrapped up for the night in sleeping
bags, while others were in a van that had a propane heater. They spent the time
playing cribbage, getting acquainted and talking to troopers by phone.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Alaskans carry warm clothing, sleeping bags and survival gear when they
travel long distances in the winter.
</P>
<P>
	   Blizzard conditions prevented rescuers from dropping supplies such as food
and blankets overnight, when temperatures dipped into the low teens. The
rescuers had to wait for the weather to clear to reach the motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson, 70, and his wife, Geneese, had braved blizzard conditions Monday
to make a 100-mile trip along the Seward Highway to Anchorage, where he was
scheduled for leg surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   He said they were part of a four-car caravan creeping along the highway at
the base of the Chugach Mountains when they found the road had been blocked by
an avalanche 40 miles south of Anchorage shortly before noon.
</P>
<P>
	   They turned around but managed to go only a few hundred yards before they
were struck by another avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It came down and pretty well covered the two vehicles ahead me and pushed
them off the road,'' Peterson said. ``I was the third one and it didn't cover me
so much.''
</P>
<P>
	   No one was injured and the travelers worked together to dig the vehicles out
of snow that buried them up to five feet deep.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was snowing so hard and wind was blowing so hard that you couldn't see
across the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Sterling Highway about 100 miles south of Anchorage, a woman and her
two daughters had to be dug out after an avalanche struck them Monday. The three
suffered only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hit their Suburban and swept it right off the road and buried it under
two feet of snow,'' said state police spokesman Greg Wilkinson.

<HEADLINE> Experts: No Common Crash Thread  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flying at or near cruising altitude is the safest part of
a plane trip, but a surprising number of jetliners have recently crashed during
that phase of flight -- the latest Alaska Airlines 261.
</P>
<P>
	   Those accidents have claimed nearly 900 lives over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
	   But aviation experts emphasized Tuesday that there is no common thread to
these accidents -- as many as a half dozen since 1996. And while the causes in
some cases have yet to be determined, the suspicions range from electrical
failure to mechanical control problems to sabotage by a pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   Early indications from the crash of the Alaska Airlines MD-83 were that a
mechanical problem with a control device -- the horizontal stabilizer -- may
have caused the jetliner to plunged 17,000 feet into the Pacific off southern
California. All 88 people aboard were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most accidents and fatalities happen during approach, landing or
takeoff,'' says Stuart Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, a
nonprofit air safety advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   A study by the Boeing Company, that examined fatal airliner crashes over a
10-year period, found that 9 percent of the accidents were at cruise altitude.
Nearly seven of every 10 crashes occurred in either takeoff and early climb or
in final approach or landing.
</P>
<P>
	   But since 1996 there have been five major air crashes where the problems
began when the aircraft were at or near cruise altitude, sometimes well into
their flight.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the case with Alaska Airlines Flight 261, which reported problems
Monday during a flight in clear weather from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San
Francisco. It fell from 17,000 feet into 300 to 750 feet of ocean after the
pilot suddenly reported a control problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft no doubt was cruising along minding its own business ... when
it got into some problems,'' says Matthews, although little is yet known for
certain of what triggered the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   On July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 was climbing gradually after taking off
from New York City and well along in its flight when it exploded at about 13,000
feet. All 230 people aboard were killed. While the investigation has yet to be
completed, an electrical spark is widely believed to have caused a fuel tank
explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Last October, Egypt Air Flight 990, a twin-engine Boeing 767, was cruising
at 31,000 feet off Nantucket, Mass., when it suddenly dove, and plummeted at
breakneck speed into the cold Atlantic, killing all 217 people aboard. The
reason for the dive is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
	   About two months earlier, on Sept. 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111, was also
cruising along a similar route on a flight from New York to Geneva when it
crashed off Nova Scotia, killing the 229 people aboard. While the investigation
continues, an electrical problem is suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators are still not certain what caused a Boeing 737, belonging to
SilkAir, to fall out of the sky from cruise altitude and crash into a muddy
river in Indonesia in December 1997. There is some suspicion the pilot may have
crashed the plane in a suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   And in May 1996, ValueJet Flight 592, with 110 people aboard, was climbing
well beyond its takeoff, though still climbing, when it crashed into the
Everglades. Investigators said hazardous cargo caught fire, causing the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   While still very rare events considering the thousands of airline flights
that are made daily, these half dozen accidents accounted for a total of 978
deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't see any common thread in these accidents,'' Capt. Dwayne Woerth,
president of the Air Line Pilots Association, emphasized in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``The higher you are usually the safer you are'' because pilots
have more time to react to trouble. But he said these accidents demonstrate that
``in every phase of flight there's nothing we can overlook. ... Things can
happen even at high altitude.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.4 jolted
Mataram, a town in central Indonesia, but there were no reports of damage or
casualties, seismologists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Musli, an officer of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency, said the tremor
that struck Mataram on Lombok Island, was centered beneath the Indian Ocean, 33
miles southwest of Mataram. It had a depth of 60 miles below the sea floor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The quake was felt in Mataram and surrounding areas as well as Denpasar,''
said Musli, who like many Indonesians uses one name.

<HEADLINE> Fed Ready for Interest Rate Boost  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is ready to bump up interest rates
for a fourth time since June in an effort to rein in the nation's economy, which
has been growing at a breakneck pace, private economists believe.
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since the Fed took a pass on raising rates in December to avoid stress
during the Y2K computer date change, most economists -- citing continuing strong
economic growth -- have been predicting that the central bank would boost rates
to help keep inflation under control. Most expect a quarter of a percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
	   When Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan raised new worries about inflation in a
speech last month, many economists took that as yet another signal that a rate
increase would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Open Market Committee, comprising members of the Fed board in
Washington and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional banks, began a two-day
meeting Tuesday to review interest rate policy. A midafternoon announcement of
their decision was expected today, with financial markets eagerly awaiting the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose Tuesday amid a growing sense that despite rising interest rates,
which can cut into corporate profits, most U.S. companies will post strong
earnings growth throughout the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up
100.52 points at 11,041.05.
</P>
<P>
	   "The story that the Fed has been telling over the last month is that we
think growth is too strong and could produce inflation. We don't see a
likelihood that it will slow on its own, so we need to raise rates," said Tim
O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank. "That message
is coming across loud and clear."
</P>
<P>
	   The economy grew at a sizzling 5.8 percent annual rate in the last three
months of the year and by 4 percent for all of 1999. That growth has pushed down
the nation's unemployment rate to 4.1 percent, the lowest level in 30 years.
Many analysts believe a further dip to 4 percent will be reflected in January's
employment report Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   With the economy growing so fast, employers are having trouble finding
scarce workers to fill job openings. Thus, they are wooing them with higher
wages and benefits, increasing the costs of doing business to the point that
economists and members of the Fed fear a sharp run-up in prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer prices have remained well-behaved so far, but wages and benefits,
as measured by the Labor Department's closely watched employment cost index,
surged in the fourth quarter, touching off fear about inflation and causing the
stock market to plunge when the report was released last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists believe there could be a total of four rate increases,
beginning at today's meeting, of a quarter-point apiece by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will be pretty clear that the Fed will view inflation as a
serious risk going forward," said William Cheney, chief economist for John
Hancock, referring to the Fed's new policy, starting today, of communicating its
outlook for the economy after every market committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised crucial interest rates three times last year by a
quarter-point each in June, August and November. A fourth quarter-point increase
would push the central bank's target for the federal funds rate -- the interest
banks charge on overnight loans -- to 5.75 percent from 5.50.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial banks would follow suit, boosting the prime lending rate, the
benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans, to 8.75 percent from
8.50, raising Americans' borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   A few economists see a chance that the Fed could increase the funds rate by
a more aggressive half a percentage point today, given the economy's robust
growth. Such a move would raise the funds rate to 6 percent and prompt banks to
raise their prime rate to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Fed decided not to raise rates, not wanting to create more
uncertainties given the Y2K changeover. In the end, the century date change went
smoothly and caused no disruptions to the nation's banking system or financial
markets.

<HEADLINE> Afghans Take Shelter in Embassy  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP)-- The tiny trembling hand of a 5-year-old girl
reached from beneath a tattered blue wool shawl to take a blackened piece of
carrot from a gnarled old man selling vegetables.
</P>
<P>
	   They are Afghan refugees in their own capital, driven by fighting to live in
squalor in the sprawling war-ruined embassy that was once home to Soviet
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
	   They are children, old men and women -- 15,000 souls, by U.N. count.
</P>
<P>
	   Plastic sheeting covers gaping holes in the rocket-shattered, four-story
buildings, wounds from the factional fighting that destroyed 70 percent of Kabul
in the mid 1990s when Islamic factions that drove the Soviets from Afghanistan
were in control. They in turn were ousted by the Taliban religious army in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fighting persists.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, tens of thousands of Afghans were driven from their homes on
the Shomali Plains north of Kabul by fierce fighting between the Taliban, who
rule about 90 percent of the country and the opposition, which rules the other
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Some found refuge in opposition-ruled areas on the Panjshir Valley. In
Kabul, refugees were shepherded into the former Soviet Embassy compound. There,
the buildings were ravaged by rocket fire, pockmarked by bullet holes and
streaked in black soot.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations and other humanitarian aid organizations moved to help
the refugees, trucking in bricks and patching some holes.
</P>
<P>
	   Balconies were put up to protect wandering children, said Qari Mohammed
Daoud, the Taliban leader in charge of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban, beset by fighting and with few resources, daily send truckloads
of bread into the compound each day.
</P>
<P>
	   Aid agencies, including the World Food Program, also help out with food. One
group sends wood, the only source of heat in subzero temperatures. Another group
donated an ambulance and another built latrines. Garbage is trucked away by
still another aid group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a small town,'' said Stephanie Bunker, the U.N. spokeswoman in
neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   In his fourth floor office-cum-residence, Daoud takes a seat on the floor:
His only furniture is a squeaky steel-frame bed with a thin cushion.
</P>
<P>
	   He sips sweet green tea from a chipped glass and says ``we have tried to
provide for them.''
</P>
<P>
	   In keeping with strict Taliban rules, two apartment buildings in the former
embassy compound have been set aside for women -- widows or women whose husbands
have gone north to escape. They must stay indoors, and the small children live
with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Only old men and young boys are allowed into the women's buildings, Daoud
said. Even a female reporter was barred.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. says the number of refugees in the former embassy total about
15,000, but no breakdown is available on the number of men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
	   From his balcony, Daoud points at the women's living quarters and says ``we
are their protection. We don't allow anyone to bother them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Life on the compound is hard.
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting on the cold ground, Abdul Hazim sells a grim collection of
vegetables, discards from city markets. He hunches over his vegetables,
occasionally glancing up at a passer-by.
</P>
<P>
	   A small child hidden beneath her shawl stood over his vegetables, just
looking. He picked up a small piece of a carrot, blackened from the cold, but
red within. The little hand reached out, trembling, and took it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a home in Qaribagh. Now I have nothing,'' said Hazim, remembering a
time before the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Compost Piles Reducing Landfills  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTHA MENDOZA AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Crab shells, plastic utensils, even livestock
carcasses are making their way back to the soil as communities are pushed to
reduce landfill waste with increased composting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything that came from something alive is compostable," said Mark Van Horn
who runs the student farm at the University of California, Davis. "The trick is
to make the conditions right so it can biodegrade."
</P>
<P>
	   Van Horn says those conditions are the right combination of air, water,
nitrogen and carbon, reacting together to reach a temperature of about 140
degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   While thousands of gardeners and farmers make their own compost today, there
are also more than 3,500 working commercial compost facilities in the U.S.,
according to the national Compost Technology Group. The facilities are paid to
accept garbage, which they turn into fertile soil and sell to commercial farmers
for about $20 a ton.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers can buy bagged compost for their gardens for about $1 a pound in
typical landscaping stores.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of composting centers is growing by a few hundred each year as
communities seek to control overflowing landfills.
</P>
<P>
	   The push toward more composting isn't just voluntary. Federal and state
regulations now require communities to reduce the amount of trash they throw
away. And certain industries -- poultry, cattle and sheep for example -- have
been banned in many cases from discarding their waste through dumping or
incineration because of the pollution created through those processes.
</P>
<P>
	   "In some places these days, the only thing they're allowed to do with a dead
chicken or cow is turn it into compost," said Utah State University professor
Bruce Miller, whose research has focused on composting cows.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller said their goal is to get rid of dead animals, not to create a
marketable soil for farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The issue is getting rid of carcasses," he said. "Nobody wants to buy
Bessie compost."
</P>
<P>
	   Miller said that cows left to compost in straw take about four months to
reduce to soil. The resulting dirt, he said, is best used to compost more
carcasses.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest problem faced by Miller and other composters are "the strong
odors," he said, best controlled with sawdust and straw piles.
</P>
<P>
	   At UC Davis, Van Horn said they run huge compost piles filled with waste
from campus cafes and festivals. For the past few years, he said, they've been
experimenting with cornstarch based plastic utensils, along with paper plates
and food waste, in an effort to reuse all their trash.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might look strange to see a plastic fork on a compost heap, but within
weeks they start to turn dark and twist and within months they're basically
gone," he said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS May Date Back to 1930  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The worldwide AIDS pandemic has been traced to a
single viral ancestor who emerged perhaps around 1930.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier research had suggested that the outbreak began in the first half of
the 20th century, but the latest analysis, done at the Los Alamos National Lab
in New Mexico, appears to be the most definitive so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Bette Korber, who keeps a database of HIV genetic information at the lab,
calculated HIV's family tree by looking at the rate the virus mutates over time.
She assumed these genetic changes happen at a constant rate and used a
supercomputer to clock the mutations back through time to a common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
	   Korber estimates that the current pandemic goes back to one or a small group
of infected humans around 1930, though this ancestor virus could have emerged as
early as 1910 or as late as 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   From this single source, she suggests, came the virus that now infects
roughly 40 million people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "This offers a small piece in a larger puzzle concerning the origins of
HIV," she said. Her findings were released at a scientific conference this week
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts believe that HIV's ancestor is a virus that ordinarily infects
chimpanzees. Somehow it spread to people -- perhaps through a bite or hunting
mishap -- in west equatorial Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Just when this happened, though, is still a mystery, Korber said. The leap
from chimp to man could have been around 1930. Or it may have occurred much
earlier and the virus stayed within a small group of humans.
</P>
<P>
	   The work challenges a theory that AIDS actually began in the 1950s, when HIV
was accidentally mixed with the polio vaccine. In last year's book "The River,"
Edward Hooper theorizes that HIV contaminated batches of the vaccine that were
grown in chimp tissue. This then spread when the vaccine was tested in the
Belgian Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Korber said this is highly unlikely, since it would require the introduction
of at least 10 genetically separate strains of the virus into the vaccine from
different chimps.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Steven Wolinsky of Northwestern University called Korber's project "a
computational tour de force."
</P>
<P>
	   Korber based her work on the genetic codes of 160 different copies of the
AIDS virus. She analyzed them on a Los Alamos supercomputer, called Nirvana,
that can perform 1 trillion computations per second.
</P>
<P>
	   The earliest existing sample of HIV was found in a blood specimen obtained
in Leopoldville -- now Kinshasa -- in 1959.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 1, Sharks 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Defenseman Keith Carney broke a scoreless tie with
his second goal of the season 1:32 into overtime and the Phoenix Coyotes beat
the San Jose Sharks 1-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes picked up their 14th road win, second most in the league,
despite being outshot 34-15. Bob Essensa had 34 saves in his first shutout this
season and 17th of his career.
</P>
<P>
	   Carney, after getting a pass from Greg Adams, swept around defender Patrick
Marleau and got off a shot that zoomed past goalie Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fifth straight loss for San Jose, the last two coming in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose went 0-4 on the power play and is 0-19 with the man-advantage in
four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Essensa again thwarted a Sharks' scoring chance with 14:39 remaining. Mike
Ricci dished off to Marco Sturm, who lifted a shot from just outside the crease,
but Essensa stuck his glove out and snared it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes were outshot 26-8 over the first two periods but fended off the
Sharks, killing two successive power plays midway through the second, including
a 5-on-3 that lasted for 1:06.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides missed solid opportunities to score.
</P>
<P>
	   With just seconds left in the second, Jeremy Roenick skated in on a
breakaway and unleashed a slap shot that Shields managed to stop with a glove
save 10 feet in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the period, shots by San Jose's Brad Stuart and the Coyotes'
Radoslav Suchy both hit the post and bounced away.

<HEADLINE> Twins Said Face Higher Cancer Risk  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Fraternal twin sisters face more than twice the risk of
developing breast cancer after menopause than women who aren't twins, according
to a study in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that women who were fraternal twins were 2.1 times more
likely to develop breast cancer than women who were not. The risk for identical
twins was no different from the risk for women born solo.
</P>
<P>
	   For women with a male twin, the risk was elevated but not statistically
significant, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 175,000
women are diagnosed with breast cancer yearly and more than 43,000 die from it.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraternal twins are produced when the mother releases more than one egg and
both are fertilized. Identical twins, which are less common, come formed when
one fertilized egg splits early in an embryo's development, giving both twins an
identical genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
	   Women who are twins should not become overly concerned, but should follow
the recommended guidelines for breast cancer screenings including regular
mammograms, said the lead author, Dr. James Cerhan, an epidemiologist with the
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
	   "The importance of this study is that it adds to a small but growing body of
research that suggests that intrauterine exposures may influence later breast
cancer risk," Cerhan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cerhan said the study was motivated by previous studies that found that a
mother's estrogen and other hormone levels are substantially higher when she is
pregnant with twins, and that intrauterine exposure to elevated levels of these
hormones may increase the risk of developing breast cancer as an adult.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers said that to their knowledge, their finding that the
relative risk is highest for female fraternal twins has not been reported
previously, though earlier studies have associated being a twin with an elevated
breast cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is very interesting," said Chung-cheng Hsieh, a professor of medicine
at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester and adjunct
associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsieh led a study published in 1992 that also found a higher risk of breast
cancer in women who were twins, but noted that he and his colleagues were unable
to determine then if their subjects were fraternal or identical twins.
</P>
<P>
	   For the new study, researchers with the Mayo Clinic, University of
Minnesota, Wake Forest University and the University of South Carolina evaluated
a group of 29,197 postmenopausal Iowa women with no history of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the size of that data set, Hsieh said, the researchers appeared to
have "very good information" to support their conclusions that fraternal twin
sisters face an elevated cancer risk.

<HEADLINE> Less Attention for Women Heart Pain  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Women who go to the hospital with serious chest pain are
less likely than men to be given diagnostic tests for heart trouble, researchers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the researchers also found that women are less likely to go on to
suffer heart attacks. As a result, they suggested the findings do not
necessarily mean that women aren't getting enough care; instead, they said men
might be getting too much.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mayo Clinic study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, follows previous studies that have documented differences in how
men and women are treated for heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   This study is believed to be one of the first to look at differences in how
the problems are diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 5 million people are evaluated for chest pain every year in emergency
rooms across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mayo study looked at 1,306 men and 965 women in Olmsted County, Minn.,
where two of the three hospitals are part of the Mayo Clinic and all health care
providers contribute to a large database that dates to the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   The subjects went to emergency rooms between 1985 and 1992 with unstable
angina, which occurs when the heart muscle doesn't get as much blood as it
needs. It may happen during exercise or strong emotions and can go away.
Unstable angina carries a risk of heart attacks, irregular heart rhythms and
congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Veronique Roger, looked at the diagnostic
procedures the subjects underwent within 90 days of their trip to the emergency
room, and what happened during an average follow-up period of six years.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty-five percent of the men and 72 percent of the women underwent common
diagnostic procedures. The researchers said men were 27 percent more likely than
women to undergo noninvasive cardiac tests like stress tests on treadmills or CT
scans. The men were also 72 percent more likely to have invasive procedures such
as angioplasty, which involves injecting a dye into the heart that can be seen
on X-rays.
</P>
<P>
	   After adjusting for age, cardiac risk factors and other factors, the men had
a 23 percent higher risk of death and a 21 percent higher risk of heart attack
or other serious heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   While the women "were subjected to fewer cardiac procedures than men, one
cannot infer from these data that more aggressive management of women with
unstable angina is warranted," the authors wrote. They said it's possible that
men are subjected to unnecessary diagnostic procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Vallerie McLaughlin, a cardiologist at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago and member of the American Heart Association's Board
for Women and Heart Disease, agreed it is possible that men are over-tested and
over-treated. But she stressed the need to educate doctors and patients about
the dangers of heart disease for women.
</P>
<P>
	   "One has to keep in mind that cardiac disease is the No. 1 killer among
women, and any woman who presents with any complaints that could be cardiac in
origin should be evaluated very thoroughly," McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   That is especially important for post-menopausal women because their risk
approaches that of men, she said.

<HEADLINE> Surgery May Aid Cancer Survivors  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Young women with breast cancer associated with two genetic
mutations may live years longer by having their healthy breast and ovaries
removed, researchers suggested today.
</P>
<P>
	   Their study was an analysis of women with gene mutations known as BRCA1 and
BRCA2, which are known to raise the risk of breast cancer so much that some
women with the flaws have had their breast and ovaries removed before any sign
of disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, led by Dr. Deborah Schrag and published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, is a follow-up to a statistical analysis she and
colleagues at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute did estimating the benefits of
such preemptive surgery for healthy women. Schrag, a cancer specialist, is now
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study, also based on a statistical analysis rather than on real
patients, looks at women in early stages of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   It does not advocate surgery. It notes that some women may be more concerned
with sexual and reproductive function and self-image than with gaining a few
years in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
	   "For others, taking maximum steps to reduce the risk of a terrifying outcome
such as ovarian cancer may result in a psychological benefit that outweighs even
a very small survival benefit," the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings are designed to ease the decisions faced by women who carry the
mutations.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 5 percent and 10 percent of the estimated 175,000 cases of breast
cancer diagnosed annually are linked to the mutations, according to the American
Cancer Society. Many women don't discover they carry the mutations until they
have been diagnosed with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a cancer specialist at the Mayo Clinic, said there is
very little hard data on the benefits of preventive surgery for such women.
</P>
<P>
	   "We definitely need some guidance in women who've already had a first cancer
and I think this begins to open that discussion," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because women who carry the mutations have a high risk of developing breast
and ovarian cancer, some healthy women have chosen to have their breasts or
ovaries removed just in case. Ovary removal may help guard against breast cancer
because it curbs production of estrogen, which encourages tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
	   A University of Pennsylvania study published last year found that healthy
BRCA1 women who had had their ovaries removed could reduce the breast cancer
risk by about 70 percent. But ovary removal induces menopause, which could put
young women at risk for early development of brittle bones and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Schrag estimates that women already diagnosed with BRCA-linked breast cancer
are two to eight times more likely to develop cancer in the opposite breast than
women with non-genetic breast cancer. They face similar or even higher risks for
developing ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors estimated that women first diagnosed with genetically-linked
breast cancer at age 30 who undergo removal of their ovaries and opposite breast
and take the cancer drug tamoxifen for five years would see the most gains in
life expectancy -- between 1.1 and 4.4 years. For women who choose removal of
the second breast only, the range in gains was estimated at 0.9 to 2.1 years.
The gain was put at 0.2 to 1.8 years for ovary removal alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Those whose first cancer had spread to adjacent lymph nodes and those first
diagnosed at age 50 or older could expect significantly lower gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Schrag stressed that the numbers are only estimates and that many women
could live much longer depending on numerous individual factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Women diagnosed with breast cancer, including those with the gene mutations,
generally have a good prognosis if their disease is caught early, Schrag said,
"and that makes it all the more important that you think ahead about how to
prevent problems down the road."

<HEADLINE> Diet May Influence Groundhog  </HEADLINE>
   By P. SOLOMON BANDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Punxsutawney Phil and his kin may be predicting the length of
winter instead of hibernating because of their diet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they are feeding naturally out in the wild, in general they wouldn't be
coming above ground,'' said Greg Florant, a biology professor at Colorado State
University.
</P>
<P>
	   Florant and researchers from Temple University identified two fatty acids in
marmots that, in abundance, keep the mammals active. The fatty acids, linoleic
and linolenic acid, are found in seeds, nuts and leafy plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Because marmots are close cousins to groundhogs, the findings apply to
groundhogs too, Florant said.
</P>
<P>
	   Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who helps predict the length of winter each
year, gets a steady diet of vegetables, fruits, grasses and protein-rich
vegetarian dog food, said William Deeley, a member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog
Club and Phil's handler.
</P>
<P>
	   Punxsutawney Phil's diet is not designed to keep him awake, Deeley said.
Instead, a climate- and light-controlled cage in the town's library prevents him
from going into hibernation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He does sleep an awful lot but he doesn't go into the true coma type of
sleep,'' Deeley said. ``He is probably 25 percent active of what he would be
during the spring and summer.''
</P>
<P>
	   As legend goes, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow Feb. 2 and sees its
shadow, winter will linger six more weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Punxsutawney Phil was the guest of honor at several celebrations Tuesday in
Punxsutawney, home of the 114-year tradition based on a German superstition.

<HEADLINE> Limitations Statute Eyed for Skakel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Attorneys are questioning whether it's too late to
prosecute a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy for the 1975 slaying of a teen-age
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Skakel, 39, was arrested Jan. 19 for the slaying of Martha Moxley,
who was found beaten to death with a golf club more than 24 years earlier on her
family's estate.
</P>
<P>
	   When the slaying was committed, there was a 5-year statute of limitations on
murder prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Jonathan Benedict said the Connecticut Supreme Court has since
ruled that murder is a crime that is always subject to prosecution, but other
legal experts say it's not that simple.
</P>
<P>
	   The question was reported in Monday's edition of The Connecticut Law
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
	   David Moraghan, president of the Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association, said he believes it is too late to prosecute Skakel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's an argument that could be made that the case should be
dismissed,'' Moraghan said.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Benedict both cite case law that they say proves their points, and
Moraghan said it could take years for the issue to be decided.
</P>
<P>
	   The state law was changed in 1976 to eliminate any time limits for
prosecuting serious felonies, including murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Skakel was 15 at the time of the crime, he will be arraigned in
juvenile court. The hearing is scheduled for Feb. 8. Skakel has denied any
involvement in Moxley's death.

<HEADLINE> Haider Fights for Political Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AP Photo NY107
By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The path to success for Joerg Haider has contained a
few pitfalls -- some of his own making. But they have not deterred Europe's most
popular rightist from his goal of political power.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently, Haider has had to deal with massive foreign pressure against
his party's participation in Austria's next government. Predictably, Haider is
unfazed as he and his negotiating partners reached agreement on a coalition
government made up of his Freedom Party and the conservative Austrian People's
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Typically, the 50-year-old lawyer attacks his attackers. It's not his party
that is undemocratic, he alleges, but the European Union, which is ignoring the
wishes of Austria's voters in threatening sanctions if his party shares
government power.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrians traditionally reject foreign criticism of their politicians --
including President Kurt Waldheim, who was widely supported in the 1980s despite
accusations that he hid a Nazi past.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes Haider's outspokenness has gotten him into trouble in a 30-year
political career that began as the head of the youth section of the Freedom
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, the trim, youthful-looking Haider moved up the ladder until he
ousted his predecessor as head of the national party in 1986. He steered the
party away from liberalism and toward the populist-nationalist mix many
Austrians have responded to.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, the child of well-to-do parents born in Upper Austria province, is
best known abroad for his past praise of Hitler and the Nazis -- statements he
has long since withdrawn -- and his party's public suspicion of foreigners,
manifested in last year's Vienna election posters warning in Nazi-era jargon of
``overforeignization.''
</P>
<P>
	   But deep-rooted Austrian suspicion of foreigners is only part of the formula
that made his party the second most popular in October elections and gave it the
chance to become part of the next government.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider and other party officials have also attacked the traditional parties:
the conservative People's Party and the Social Democrats who had governed
Austria for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges of corruption, cronyism and inertia hit home with an electorate that
-- while enjoying one of Europe's highest living standards -- was ready for
change.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations with the People's Party, which have ledto a proposed government
coalition, have been marked by professionalism and levelheadedness, according to
reports from those talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the Oct. 3 elections, the trim lawyer with a perpetual tan,
whose accomplishments include bungee-jumping and who changes from jeans to suits
with chameleon-like ease, appeared to have learned from the past.
</P>
<P>
	   The married father of two children has blunted his sharp rhetoric. He has
avoided bad company since his 1996 meeting with Waffen SS veterans. And he
attended Harvard for a few weeks a few years ago, as much to improve his image
as his knowledge of economics.
</P>
<P>
	   In November last year, Haider distanced himself from ``misleading comments''
and apologized to his country's Jewish community for his past praise of the Nazi
era.
</P>
<P>
	   Still concern from the European Union, the United States and other
democracies remains. Haider has spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would
threaten jobs in Austria, and he has predicted that the new government would
impose a nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Monday, the EU said it would curtail bilateral contacts with
Austria, oppose appointments of Austrian candidates to international
organizations and limit contacts with Vienna's ambassadors in EU capitals if
Haider's party shares power. State Department spokesman James Foley said the
United States is ``continuing to keep the situation under review.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen War Is Likely To Grind On  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The battle for Grozny may be in its final throes, but the war
in Chechnya is likely to grind on for as long as Russian forces remain in the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military is still far from its key objectives of destroying the
Chechen forces and ending the republic's separatist movement. In Grozny, one of
the world's largest armies failed to defeat a few thousand guerrillas, who had
no tanks, planes or heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of rebel fighters pulled out of Grozny on Monday after holding off
the Russian military for four months despite devastating artillery and air
attacks that destroyed much of the Chechen capital. Some Chechen forces remained
in the city to go on fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian high command, instead of being jubilant, tried to play down the
development. The Russians' main goal was to trap the Chechen forces and destroy
them -- a breakout was the last thing Moscow wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia thought it had crushed the Chechens after Grozny fell in 1995 during
the first Chechen war. But the Chechens retreated to the mountains and went on
fighting until they retook Grozny in 1996 and forced Russian forces to pull out
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel fighters who escaped Grozny can now join the rebel forces in the
south of the republic. Many of the fighters who came out of Grozny showed no
sign of giving up the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel commanders never intended to mount a suicidal defense of Grozny. Their
aim was to fight long enough to inflict heavy losses on the Russians, who did
lose hundreds of men in the battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Grozny was an ideal battlefield for the rebels. The Russian military has
lots of tanks and planes, but its ill-trained conscript soldiers were little
match for the rebels in street fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the rebels also paid a price for their defense of Grozny. The rebels
admit that they lost lots of fighters and their supplies ran very low during the
battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Several prominent Chechen field commanders, including some of the most
militant leaders, reportedly were killed or wounded in the breakout. Such men
played a major role in the Chechen struggle and their loss would be a serious
setback.
</P>
<P>
	   The deaths of some of the top Chechen radicals could clear the way for a
political deal between Moscow and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who is
regarded as a moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting President Vladimir Putin, who faces presidential elections March 26,
may try to use the fall of Grozny to say that his military has triumphed and
some kind of political settlement can now be considered. Or the Russian military
may have to go on fighting until it destroys the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Maskhadov, aware that Chechnya is in terrible condition after years of war
and endemic lawlessness, may want an accommodation. But he is unlikely to give
up Chechen demands for independence. If he does, other Chechens will repudiate
Maskhadov and continue to fight the Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   For more than a century, the Chechens have been fighting the Russians for
their independence. There is little sign that they will give up that struggle
now.

<HEADLINE> Karen Rebels Ready To Talk  </HEADLINE>
   By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) -- When Ba Thin joined up in 1949, the ethnic Karen
minority's war for freedom from the country then known as Burma looked like it
would be short.
</P>
<P>
	   Battle-hardened Karen fighters, who had helped colonial ruler Britain fight
Japanese troops in World War II, had pushed the post-independence Burmese army
to the capital, Rangoon, and looked set to carve out an independent state.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half-a-century later, only the dwindling numbers of Ba Thin's
generation can remember the scent of victory.
</P>
<P>
	   With Karen forces facing annihilation from the ever-more powerful government
army, the situation has become so desperate that perhaps 200 fighters have
turned for leadership to twin 12-year-old boys leading a faction called God's
Army.
</P>
<P>
	   The future of the Karens -- who account for 7 percent of Myanmar's 48
million people -- may rest in the hands of Ba Thin, 73, who was elected
president of the main rebel group, the Karen National Union, in a congress last
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Ba Thin's accession amounted to a tacit admission of the obvious -- the war
is all but lost. He replaced Bo Mya, also 73, a bearish general who had led the
KNU since 1976 and stubbornly presided over defeat after defeat in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters during Monday's celebration of Karen Revolution Day,
Ba Thin took pains to say that his elevation would not affect KNU policy, which
is to rally world pressure on the military to allow democratic rule and greater
autonomy for ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   But he stressed the need for negotiation and voiced less of the
fight-to-the-end rhetoric that became Bo Mya's hallmark.
</P>
<P>
	   Educated in missionary Baptist high schools in the 1940s, Ba Thin joined the
KNU at its inception in 1949 and rose through rebel ranks to colonel. He then
shifted to the political wing, becoming secretary-general in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I started serving my people, I had to carry a gun. There have been so
many killings in my life,'' Ba Thin told The Associated Press in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our problems can only be solved at the negotiating table, not in battle.
But surrender is also out of the question to pursue our goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   The KNU, however, has increasingly little bargaining leverage. A decade ago,
it was the strongest of a score of ethnic armies fighting the government and
controlled vast swaths of territory in eastern Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
	   Gems and teak traded through Thailand enabled it to hire foreign mercenaries
and line the pockets of corrupt Thai and Karen officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the government has made peace with nearly all the other factions
and practically only a rump of the KNU is left fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, the government orchestrated a split in the group,
bringing Buddhist Karens disaffected with the mostly Christian leaders under its
control.
</P>
<P>
	   The pro-government Democratic Karen Buddhist Army has been an instrument of
terror, raiding refugee camps in Thailand sheltering more than 100,000 refugees
from Myanmar, mostly Karen civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   Under annual government offensives since then, the KNU lost all but a few
toe-holds in Myanmar. Fighting strength is down to an estimated 4,000 troops --
from a one-time high of more than 20,000 -- and many new recruits are only in
their early teens.
</P>
<P>
	   The KNU depends on Thailand for a safe rear area, but the Thai government
increasingly views Myanmar's dissidents as more of a security threat than as a
buffer against Myanmar's army.
</P>
<P>
	   The feeling of defeat has been so pervasive as to send some KNU veterans
into God's Army, which siezed a hospital with hundreds of hostages last week in
an attempt to secure retreat into Thailand. The hostage-takers were killed, and
the operation deepened Thai distrust of the Karens.
</P>
<P>
	   Bo Mya has held cease-fire negotiations with the government on several
occasions in the past five years. Each time, they failed, once over the regime's
insistence that the KNU give up its arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Some other rebel groups that have reached cease-fires have kept their
weapons -- including the 20,000-strong United Wa State Army, considered by
Washington to be the world's biggest armed drug-trafficking group.

<HEADLINE> Report Says IRA Hasn't Disarmed  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's joint
Protestant-Catholic administration, launched in such high hopes two months ago,
is in danger of unraveling over the Irish Republican Army's continued
unwillingness to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, is hoping to
resurrect the American-mediated pact that spurred the Cabinet's formation --
and, crucially, expected that the IRA would scrap its stockpiled weapons in
response.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still have a small breathing space to see whether it's possible to find
a solution to the crisis we're now facing,'' said Mandelson, who planned
separate meetings starting today with all four parties in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's report by Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, chairman of a
disarmament commission, confirmed that his two months of discussions involving
IRA representatives produced no commitment from the outlawed group.
</P>
<P>
	   The major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, accused its Cabinet
colleagues in the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party of welching on their end of the
deal mediated by American diplomat George Mitchell in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble warned that the only way now to keep
the Cabinet intact at all was for the British government to suspend its powers,
resume ``direct rule'' from London, and hope fresh negotiations would deliver
either a start to disarmament or political penalties against Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble, who until now has outmaneuvered Protestants opposed to the 1998
peace accord, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Tony Blair in London today to
press his case for what he called ``putting the administration on ice.''
</P>
<P>
	   He insisted that November's negotiations produced ``an understanding''
between Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists that the Cabinet could only survive
for a matter of weeks if the IRA balked on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was made clear to Sinn Fein again and again and again that this
experiment, this risk that we were taking, would be time-limited and would not
run beyond the end of January,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams described as ``nonsense'' the idea that the
IRA would begin discussing disarmament ``in return for six or seven weeks of
government.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Good Friday accord's hope of achieving total IRA disarmament by
May 2000 also presumed that the Cabinet would have been formed by late 1998, so
any notion of disarmament deadlines looked increasingly unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unionists break deadlines whenever it suits them,'' Adams said. ``It's our
job as politicians to demonstrate to those in control of weapons that politics
works. Because of Ulster Unionist demands we are ... failing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement issued Tuesday, the IRA emphasized the value of its 1997
cease-fire, which followed a 27-year effort to destabilize Northern Ireland that
claimed 1,800 lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA said its representatives had stressed in its talks with the
disarmament commission ``that the IRA's guns are silent and that there is no
threat to the peace process from the IRA.''
</P>
<P>
	   De Chastelain's commission has also been discussing disarmament prospects
with representatives of two major outlawed pro-British groups, the Ulster
Defense Association and Ulster Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Those groups, responsible for slaying several hundred Catholic civilians,
called a cease-fire in 1994 but have vowed not to get rid of their own weapons
stocks unless the IRA moves first.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA has a network of hidden arms caches in the neighboring Irish
Republic. The bulk was supplied by Libya in the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Ponder U.S. Bombings  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HAWLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- For Puerto Rican and U.S. negotiators, the
Battle of Vieques has ended. But in the El Gato Bar, perched triumphantly on
land taken by squatters from the U.S. Navy 30 years ago, the fighting has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Americans should stay! They've brought us jobs!'' a red-faced Freddy
Garcia bellowed as he pounded the bar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What jobs? You're an ignoramus!'' shouted bartender Dolores Navarro. ``The
Americans have done nothing but destroy us!''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's promise Tuesday to hold a referendum in this U.S.
Caribbean territory about the Navy's future here has left people on this island
of 9,400 divided -- and a little bit dazed by the apparent success of a small
band of protesters who virtually shut down the Atlantic Fleet's most important
training ground.
</P>
<P>
	   For 60 years, the Navy bombed, shelled and strafed the eastern edge of
Vieques island with few restrictions. But after an errant bomb killed a civilian
security guard in the bombing range last April, a few dozen angry protesters and
pro-independence activists moved in to act as human shields against further
exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   The Puerto Rican government backed them. After one compromise was rejected,
Clinton relented in a televised speech Tuesday night, at least in part: The Navy
would no longer use live explosives, and if Vieques residents vote in a
referendum to boot the Navy, it must leave in three years.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare televised appeal, Clinton called on Puerto Ricans to support a
deal that paves the way for the Navy to resume, with dummy bombs, the exercises
it says are vital to national defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides gave up much in the deal announced Monday. The Navy -- at least
temporarily -- lost the live-fire training it says its sailors and aviators
need. The Puerto Rican government lost a rare political consensus its defiant
stand against the Navy had created by backing away from its ``no more bombs''
pledge. And opposition parties have lambasted Gov. Pedro Rossello for selling
out the people of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton urged Puerto Ricans to embrace the compromise, noting the
contribution of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. military and arguing that Vieques was
for now irreplaceable. ``You have never turned your back on your duty to share
in the defense of our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As Navarro served up another round of Budweisers, he said he didn't believe
the Navy would really leave in three years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the Navy is going to use those three years to figure out some way
to stay here,'' said Navarro, whose bar stands on Navy land settled by squatters
in the 1960s -- a symbol of residents' uneasy coexistence with the military.
``The next time there's an emergency and they have to go into Kosovo or
somewhere, the bombing's going start again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some protesters agreed, saying they would boycott the referendum -- whose
date has not yet been set -- to demand the Navy leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   At a protest camp outside the gates of the training ground, Maria Mulero,
cousin of the dead security guard, shook her head as she watched Clinton's
appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel like my cousin died for nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others residents, like 24-year-old college student Yaritza Barreras, were
more optimistic about the prospect of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is a fair solution,'' Barreras said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, she and other islanders said they were unimpressed by Clinton's offer
to spend $40 million on public works projects if the Navy stays. A similar pact
in 1983 did little to reverse the island's high unemployment, and attracted none
of the industry it promised.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy employs relatively few local people, mostly to maintain the
training ground and serve as security guards.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, 14-year-old twins Luis and Victor Boulgne sat within sight of
the Navy fence that bisects the island, and used scissors to trim the green,
orange and red feathers of a fighting rooster they planned to enter in a cock
fight -- trying to make money on an island where jobs are scarce.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People get frustrated when they don't have much, while the big Navy over
there has almost the whole island,'' said Boulgne.

McCain, Gore Win in New Hampshire

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain scored a landslide victory
over George W. Bush on Tuesday in New Hampshire's leadoff primary, puncturing
the aura of inevitability that had buoyed the Texan's drive for the Republican
presidential nomination. Vice President Al Gore staved off a toe-to-toe
challenge from Democratic challenger Bill Bradley. With more than half the
precincts counted, Gore had 52 percent of the vote, Bradley 47. McCain rolled up
49 percent of the GOP vote, Bush 31.

Slim Hope for Alaska Air Survivors
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Hopes are increasingly slim for finding any
survivors from the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. Searchers have pulled
four bodies -- one man, two women and an infant-- from the calm sea, which is
300 to 750 feet deep in the area. Investigators said Tuesday that the pilots of
the jet struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before
the jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard. The last minutes of
the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by pilots aboard four other
aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board was seeking to interview
them.

Haider Strikes Power Share Deal

that such a move could lead to Austria's diplomatic isolation. Haider, leader of
the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel reached the
agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government between Haider's party
and the conservative People's Party.

Limitations Statute Eyed for Skakel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Attorneys are questioning whether it's too late to
prosecute a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy for the 1975 slaying of a teen-age
neighbor. Michael Skakel, 39, was arrested Jan. 19 for the slaying of Martha
Moxley, who was found beaten to death with a golf club more than 24 years
earlier on her family's estate. When the slaying was committed, there was a
5-year statute of limitations on murder prosecutions. Prosecutor Jonathan
Benedict said the Connecticut Supreme Court has since ruled that murder is a
crime that is always subject to prosecution, but other legal experts say it's
not that simple.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Pro-Taiwan Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief sponsor of a bill to strengthen U.S. military
ties with Taiwan suggests its strong sendoff in the House should help generate
support among senators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They cannot ignore a huge vote like this,'' said House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The House approved DeLay's veto-threatened legislation 341-70 Tuesday. Its
fate was less certain in the Senate, generally more cautious on foreign affairs
than the House.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., cited his long support for
Taiwan but said he doesn't want to do anything that might further complicate
already tense relations between the mainland and the island. ``We should proceed
with due diligence,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy
Committee, suggested the legislation could develop considerable support in the
Senate. ``I don't think we're nervous about restating our commitment to
Taiwan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would lift a long-standing prohibition on direct
communication and cooperation among military officials of the United States and
Taiwan, open American military academies to more Taiwanese officers and require
annual Pentagon reports on threats to Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors portrayed the bill as a reaction to the reported buildup of China's
missile arsenal along the Taiwan Strait and continued Chinese human-rights
abuses. They called it an expansion of the landmark 1979 Taiwan Relations Act,
which allows the United States to provide military supplies to Taiwan for use in
defending itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration said the 1979 act should be left alone.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, national security spokesman David Leavy said the bill
``would decrease rather than enhance Taiwan security and risk the stability of
the entire East Asian region.''
</P>
<P>
	   If it passes in its present form, ``the president's senior advisers would
recommend that he veto it,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, the bill is less hard-edged than an earlier version, which would
have authorized the sale to Taiwan of specific weapons systems, including a
ballistic missile defense, sophisticated radar warning equipment and
conventional submarines.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the bill, even in its
watered-down form, ``would seriously diminish Taiwan's security and undermine
overall U.S. objectives of stability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
	   While a veto threat is on the table, ``We will, in the meantime, be working
hard to persuade the Congress not to enact it into law,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislative slap at China comes as the administration worked to try to
build support for a controversial measure that would give China permanent trade
benefits to accompany its expected entry into the World Trade Organization. A
vote on that measure is expected this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese officials have warned that the bill could bring ``serious damage''
to already fragile U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The bill is H.R. 1838.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nun Holed Up in Monastery  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERICHO, West Bank -- An American nun holed up in a monastery for 17 days to
keep out Palestinian police says she spends her days huddled around a small
heater, reading the Gospels and collecting food packages through a locked gate.
</P>
<P>
	   Maria Stephanopoulos, a sister of former White House spokesman George
Stephanopoulos, said that her faith and conviction keep her strong behind the
stone walls and iron gates of the Jericho Garden Monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   She and another American nun, Sister Xenia from San Francisco, both of the
``White'' church founded by Russian exiles, barricaded themselves in the
compound during a raid by Palestinian police on Jan. 15. They have since refused
to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The police evicted most of the ``White'' clerics and said they had documents
showing the monastery belonged to their rival Moscow-based ``Red'' Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Church property in east Jerusalem and the West Bank has been under ``White''
control since the 1917 Russian Revolution, when it split from the ``Red'' and
went into exile to avoid Communist control.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the Moscow-based Church is pressing the Palestinians, who are eager for
strong ties with Russia, to recognize their claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to an Associated Press reporter through the gate of the compound,
Sister Maria described her days in an abandoned room on the property with a
leaky roof, peeling paint and only an outdoor spigot for washing.
</P>
<P>
	   Clutching rosary beads, she said her struggle is in the tradition of martyrs
of her church persecuted under communism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were truly Orthodox and truly loved the Russian Orthodox faith.
That's what I'm inspired by, and they were in far worse conditions than we
are,'' said the 40-year old nun, originally from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials met Tuesday with members of the Moscow Patriarchy
including Metropolitan Kirill, a top ranking figure in the Russian Orthodox
Church, to discuss the monastery standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives from the ``White'' church were not invited.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitri Abu Aitta, the Palestinian tourism minister, said that at the meeting,
the Palestinian Authority proposed providing the ``Whites'' with a plot of land
near the compound while handing the monastery itself over to the ``Reds.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are simply returning the property to (its) rightful owners,'' Abu Aitta
said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Archbishop Mark, the highest ranking ``Red'' Church official in the
Holy Land, rejected the compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney wrote to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Monday blasting him for the eviction attempt and demanding that
the matter be turned over to a court.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has also asked Arafat to resolve
the issue, Palestinian officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria compared a suggestion that the two churches share the property
to the biblical story of Solomon suggesting to two women who claimed to be
mother to the same child that the infant be cut in two and shared.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The true mother could not bear such a thought,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Under Fire Codes, Capitol Closes  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Capitol likely would be shut down for fire code
violations it were an office building subject to safety laws, the official
responsible for congressional workspace says.
</P>
<P>
	   It would take an estimated four years of design and 10 more of construction
to bring the Capitol into compliance with fire safety standards, Architect of
the Capitol Alan M. Hantman told a House Appropriations subcommittee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional office buildings wouldn't take as long to comply but are years
away, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This needs to be raised to a very high level of concern,'' Rep. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md., told Hantman. ``You are the person responsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The architect was asked to respond to conclusions by Congress' Office of
Compliance last week that the buildings were in violation of fire safety laws.
The report by Congress' health and safety enforcement unit said the lives of
lawmakers, their staffs and visitors were being jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress until 1995 exempted itself from health, safety and environmental
laws that were applied virtually everywhere else. The Congressional
Accountability Act passed that year forced lawmakers to follow those laws, but
the enforcement agency can only issue citations without financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantman said his office was hampered by the need to preserve historic
features of the Capitol, where construction began in 1793, by the inability to
evacuate buildings to undertake major construction and by the lack of a staffed
trained in fire safety issues.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been enforcing
workplace safety for three decades, the 1995 statute applying to Congress only
became effective in 1997, he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Describing problems in bringing a national treasure up to modern fire codes,
Hantman said he couldn't approve major construction that would turn the Capitol
into a maze like a ``rabbit warren.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said fire sprinklers could not be tested because they had to be connected
to each other in a zone, and his workers have not always had access to certain
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoyer asked whether Congress would ``be able to continue to operate'' its
buildings if subject to District of Columbia fire codes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We probably would be closed down,'' Hantman said, adding, ``Your concern
is my concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., pointed out that instructions for opening emergency
doors in the Rayburn House Office Building were so imprecise that even Congress'
police officers didn't know how to open them.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Police Chief Gary Abrecht said he has tried to educate his officers
at roll calls, through a video and with written instructions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You issue these people guns?'' asked Rep. Charles H. Taylor, R-N.C., the
subcommittee chairman.

<HEADLINE> College Sports Betting Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional effort to outlaw betting on college
sports opened with an endorsement from an unlikely ally, Kevin Pendergast, who
served two months in prison for fixing Northwestern University basketball games.
</P>
<P>
	   Pendergast said the point-shaving scheme that landed him behind bars began
with illegal bribes to players, but ended with his cohort doing something legal
-- walking into a Las Vegas casino and placing bets on the fixed games.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without Nevada, without the option of betting money in Nevada, the
Northwestern basketball point-shaving scandal would not have occurred,''
Pendergast said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pendergast, 28, gave his support to a bill introduced Tuesday that would ban
betting on college sports.
</P>
<P>
	   He bolstered a fundamental argument of the measure's sponsors -- that legal
sports gambling in Nevada promotes and legitimizes widespread illegal sports
betting on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sports gambling has become a black eye on too many of our colleges and
universities,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who is sponsoring the
legislation with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada lawmakers and other gambling supporters wasted little time in
criticizing the proposed ban as misguided.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., called it ``a red herring, an exercise in
finger-pointing'' that blames Nevada for the nationwide problem of illegal
sports gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who lobbies for casinos as president of the American
Gaming Association, said the bill ``amounts to an ineffective Band-Aid on a
campus cancer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said they will
introduce competing legislation asking the Justice Department to study illegal
gambling on campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a frequent critic of the gambling industry said the bill misses the
point.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to help, but it's not going to solve the real problem,'' said
Arnie Wexler, former executive director of New Jersey's Council on Compulsive
Gambling. ``The real problem is what's going on the campus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada is the only state that allows widespread sports betting. The state's
gambling industry took in $2.3 billion in sports wagers in fiscal 1999, with 30
percent to 40 percent bet on college sports.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and the National Federation of State High School Associations joined
Brownback and Leahy at a news conference touting the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Wethington, president of the University of Kentucky and chairman of
the NCAA executive committee, said a ban would strengthen the NCAA's
long-running argument that newspapers should stop publishing point spreads for
college games. The NCAA believes the spreads encourage betting.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress banned sports betting in most states in 1992, but exempted Nevada.
Leahy called Nevada's exemption ``a loophole'' that should be closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which spent two years
studying all aspects of gambling, last year recommended banning wagering on
collegiate and amateur athletic events.
</P>
<P>
	   Brownback and Leahy's bill also would prohibit wagering on high school
sports and Olympic events. Representatives of Nevada's gambling industry say
there is little legal betting on the Olympics and none on high school sports.

<HEADLINE> Congressman: Reduce Runway Incidents  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Chicago, quick action by the pilot of a passenger jet
averts a collision with another aircraft on takeoff. In Los Angeles, two jets
nearly collide on a runway after a pilot misunderstands a controller's command.
In Rhode Island, a pilot refuses to take off until the location of a passenger
plane is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Incidents that occur at airports as planes taxi, take off and land have
increased from 204 in 1994 to 327 last year, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying the FAA needs to do more, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., on Tuesday called
on the agency to convene a summit to find ways to reverse the trend. To
underscore the problem, Wolf played a tape recording of a USAir pilot in
Providence, R.I., who ignored his clearance for takeoff on Dec. 6, 1999 until he
was sure there was no other plane in his path.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we figure out what's going on down there, we're just going to stay
clear of all runways,'' the USAir pilot told the air traffic controller.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's transportation
subcommittee, said he will ask the FAA to provide details of a more aggressive
effort to reduce runway incidents at his subcommittee's March 22 hearing on
aviation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Statistics show that the American public continues to be at unnecessary
risk of an aviation disaster, but as bad as the situation is, the problem will
only get worse if more is not done,'' Wolf said. ``The volume and complexity of
air traffic is expected to rise significantly over the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Called runway ``incursions'' by federal aviation officials, they range from
two planes nearly colliding to a vehicle or person getting too close to a plane
taxiing to a gate.
</P>
<P>
	   John Mayrhofer, FAA director of runway safety, said the problem is complex
because it involves thousands of controllers, pilots and people authorized to
operate vehicles and equipment at airports nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   He said FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has given the problem a higher level
of management focus in recent months, and that there have been fewer runway
incursions recorded in five of the past six months as compared to the same
periods a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA is working on a lower-cost alternative to costly ground radar
systems used at the nation's busiest airports, he said. For larger airports, a
new system designed to prevent runway collisions has been delayed until 2002. In
addition, Mayrhofer said the FAA has training, education and awareness programs
addressing the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Among runway incursions reported last year:
</P>
<P>
	   -- On April 1 in Chicago, a Korean Air jet taking off with more than 350
people on board averted a collision with a cargo plane that had taxied into its
path.
</P>
<P>
	   -- On Nov. 22 in Los Angeles, a United Airlines Boeing 757 carrying more
than 130 people was forced on takeoff to pull up and fly over an Aeromexico
MD-80 on the runway.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Deal Reached in Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Despite objections from the United States and the
European Union, populist Joerg Haider has negotiated a deal for his far-right
party to share power in Austria's government.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party, and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel reached the agreement late Tuesday on a proposed coalition government
between Haider's party and the conservative People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal can still be rejected by President Thomas Klestil, who could call
new elections or propose other alternatives. But he is unlikely to do so. Haider
and Schuessel planned to meet with Klestil today.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspicion of Haider's party stems in part from his past hostility to the EU,
his opposition to immigration and remarks sympathetic to aspects of Adolf
Hitler's regime. The EU's 14 other members have threatened to isolate Austria
politically if Haider's party gains power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider and Schuessel offered no details on the composition of their
government or details of their program. But in an attempt to defuse
international criticism, both politicians pledged that tolerance would be high
on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no evidence to indicate that anyone is going to have to leave
this country,'' Haider said, referring to charges that his party's stance on
immigration is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, while talks were still under way, the Clinton administration warned
that the United States would carefully examine its relations with Austria if
Haider's party moved into a leadership position.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate State Department response to the agreement, but
earlier Tuesday, spokesman James Foley said the United States is ``continuing to
keep the situation under review'' and added that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had called Schuessel on Tuesday. He offered no details.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider gained international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has since apologized for those comments
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has also spoken out against EU expansion, saying it would threaten
jobs in Austria. Haider has predicted that the new government would impose a
nearly complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In Brussels, Belgium, the European Commission, the European Union's
executive branch, said Tuesday it would continue a ``working relation'' with the
new government as long as it abides by the EU treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But individual EU countries, including Britain, Germany and France, have
warned that they would reduce ties to any government coalition with Freedom
Party participation.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU action was a shock to this small alpine country of 7.8 million
people, which is still recovering from the diplomatic isolation brought about
when former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was elected president in 1986
after trying to conceal his role as an intelligence officer in the Nazi army.
</P>
<P>
	   In Israel, 30 lawmakers signed a petition Tuesday asking Austria's president
to keep Haider out of the government. The petition, which was to be presented
today to the Austrian ambassador to Israel, said Haider's party ``recalls the
dark days of persecution against minorities'' and that ``the rule of the Nazi
regime also began with democratic elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Austria has been without a stable government since inconclusive
parliamentary elections Oct. 3 propelled Haider's party into second place ahead
of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations between caretaker Chancellor Viktor Klima's first-place Social
Democrats and the People's Party to renew their 13-year coalition collapsed last
month, paving the way for talks with Haider's group.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Fans Thank Titans  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL WEST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans will return to the Super Bowl
and win, players told fans who gave them a hero's welcome home despite a
last-second loss to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of fans filled downtown on Tuesday to thank the team for an
unlikely journey that ended when a pass play fell just short of the end zone on
the final play, giving the Rams a 23-16 victory over Tennessee in Sunday's Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, we came up short. But we're working hard, starting tomorrow,
to get back to this point because this is an exciting feeling to see you people
out here supporting us even though we came up short. But next year, we're going
to take it all the way, and we're going to come back with a victory in the Super
Bowl," quarterback Steve McNair told a crowd of about 20,000 fans in the
Adelphia Coliseum, where the Titans went undefeated en route to their first
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade wound through downtown, where players and coaches rode in
convertibles and were showered in confetti in near-freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been in a few St. Patrick's Day parades in New York, but this is
incredible," said backup quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who used to play for the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   Kicker Al Del Greco said: "This makes it all worthwhile. We know we're
loved, and we'll do it next year."
</P>
<P>
	   Receiver Chris Sanders jumped out of his convertible, ran over and
high-fived fans on both sides of the parade route, then jumped back in his car.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher carried the AFC championship trophy while riding in a
horse-drawn carriage.
</P>
<P>
	   One sign along the parade route said it all: "12th man gives thanks."
Another summed up the excitement from the team's trip to the Super Bowl: "Titans
put wings on our dreams."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans' parade snaked across a bridge over the Cumberland River into
Adelphia Coliseum, where even more fans waited, bundled in coats and blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Parents protested the timing of the midday parade after educators said
students would not be excused for taking a day off. That didn't stop hundreds of
children from lining the parade route and gathering at the coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Carney of Brentwood took her daughters Tara, 15, and Ashley, 13, out

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Soccer Team Plans League  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that they've got the cash, the players on the U.S.
women's soccer team await the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of their deal to end their boycott, the players will be part owners
of a league planned to start next year, the first such arrangement for any major
pro sport in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Cup champions, who missed two games in the wage dispute, agreed to
a five-year contract that raises the minimum monthly salary for star players
from $3,150 to $5,000, the U.S. Soccer Federation said Tuesday. For the first
time in soccer, the deal gives women on a national team the same salary as men.
</P>
<P>
	   John Langel, the players' lawyer, and a USSF official speaking on the
condition he not be identified said the players would get part ownership of a
league planned to start in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   No other major sports league in the United States allows players to be part
owners.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hendricks, the founder of Discovery Communications Inc., the parent of
the Discover Channel, has submitted a plan for a women's league. Major League
Soccer might also submit a plan to the USSF, which will decide in the next few
months on who will run the league.
</P>
<P>
	   But before then is the Sydney Olympics, and the U.S. team begins
preparations Sunday with an exhibition game against Norway in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mia Hamm, perhaps the best-known player on the World Cup champions, said the
boycott was worth it.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is something we all felt strongly in. This is something we all
believed in," she said at a news conference also attended by Carla Overbeck and
her 2-year-old son, Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   Players who had been getting $2,000 to $3,150 a month get at least $5,000 a
month through the Olympics in September, or $2,000 a game if they play in three
or more games in a month.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, each player gets bonuses of $1,000 to $2,000 per win and $500
to $1,000 per tie for exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
	   The entire team would split a $100,000 bonus for reaching the semifinals of
the Olympics, $150,000 more for winning the bronze medal, $300,000 more for
winning the silver and $700,000 more for winning the gold.
</P>
<P>
	   There also are provisions for guaranteed money for victory tours if the team
is successful in the Sydney Games, and the next World Cup, in 2002 or 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   The monthly guarantees would disappear with the start of a women's league,
much as it did for the men's national team players after the start of Major
League Soccer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, women cut from the team would get three months severance pay.
To put the tentative deal into effect, the women might form a union.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of us might be finished next year, the year after that, so this
contract will outlive us," Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
	   The game-appearance money and bonuses match the deal being negotiated with
the men's players, who finished last in the 32-nation field at the 1998 World
Cup. A clause in the contract guarantees the women the same percentage of money
as the men.
</P>
<P>
	   But the big difference is payments from FIFA, soccer's governing body. While
FIFA gave the USSF $800,000 for each of the three games the men played at the
1998 World Cup, it didn't give the federation any money for the women's
tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Up ahead is Sunday's game against Norway, the 1995 Women's World Cup
champion. It will be the first for the veterans under new coach April Heinrichs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think she's going to set the bar even higher," Hamm said.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Defends Handling of Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An internal report suggesting that current CIA officials
delayed disciplining former director John Deutch for violating security rules is
raising questions on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA Director George Tenet insisted he took ``decisive action'' when
confronted with the finding that Deutch violated security by working on secret
material at home, even stripping Deutch of his security clearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was to appear today before the Senate Intelligence Committee for a
previously scheduled hearing on world threats. Members of the panel suggested
they would grill Tenet on the new allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an extremely serious matter,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.,
the incoming vice chairman of the panel. He said he planned to question Tenet
closely about the CIA inspector general's report.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., cited ``grave concerns with the
findings and conclusions'' of the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said reports such as the
still-classified findings of the CIA inspector general raise ``fundamental
questions.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to be a pattern. I think it's very troublesome,'' Lott told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the previously disclosed revelations about Deutch's computer
use, the inspector general's report, first reported Tuesday by The New York
Times, suggested that Tenet and other CIA officials dragged their feet in taking
action against Deutch. Tenet disputes that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The bottom line is that a complete investigation was done, decisive action
was taken, and steps have been implemented to improve our security process,''
Tenet said in a statement issued Tuesday by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said the CIA established a special panel to look
into the handling of the case. The panel still is at work, Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, a former deputy defense secretary who spent 38 years in public
service, was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When he left his CIA
post, agency technicians went to Deutch's home for a routine inspection to
ensure that secrets were protected properly. They found 31 classified documents
on a CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA announced last Aug. 20 that Tenet had severed Deutch's access to
classified information.
</P>
<P>
	   According to congressional and administration officials familiar with the
report, Deutch deleted over a thousand files from his computer once he learned
about the investigation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, the inspector general said there is no evidence to show
whether any of the information fell into the hands of a foreign power, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, Deutch used the classified material for a variety of
writing projects, the officials said. At the time, he was serving as a
consultant to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter comes against a backdrop of the government's prosecution of Wen
Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist, on charges of
mishandling and improperly copying top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of breaching security by moving
classified material to unsecured computers and computer tapes. Lee was not
charged with espionage but is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlow said Tenet and a handful of other CIA officials are authorized to
work on classified material at home, but stringent safeguards are in place
involving their computers, including lockable hard drives, safes for depositing
laptops when not in use and prohibition against accessing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy praised
Tenet for taking ``strong, decisive and unprecedented action'' in the Deutch
matter. Leavy also said he sees no parallels to Lee's case, and no double
standard at work in the treatment of a top-ranking intelligence official.

<HEADLINE> Dick Vermeil Retires As Rams Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Dick Vermeil's retirement plans don't center around
sitting in a rocking chair all day surrounded by his grandkids.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to try to get a job in television again and finish out a couple
years in broadcasting," Vermeil said Tuesday after announcing he is leaving the
St. Louis Rams. "Carol's not real excited about that."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil and his wife celebrated their 44th anniversary two days before the
Rams beat the Tennessee Titans 23-16 in the Super Bowl, and during the buildup,
much was made of Carol Vermeil's statement that her husband has nothing to
prove. But Vermeil said he and his wife only had a couple of 20-minute
conversations on retirement -- one Monday and the other Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil got out because he realized it's impossible to top a Super Bowl
victory as an exit.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the time is right," Vermeil said in an emotional farewell. "Very
few people in this profession get this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Vermeil, who attended the news conference, did not contradict her
husband.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was his decision," she said. "There's a time for everything. But the
worst thing is overstaying your time, isn't it?"
</P>
<P>
	   The decision elevates offensive coordinator Mike Martz to coach. The Rams
signed Martz, who directed the NFL's top-rated offense (33 points a game), to a
two-year contract in January that assured he would inherit Vermeil's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz, scheduled to undergo surgery today for a neck problem, didn't attend
the news conference. A Rams spokesman said Martz would postpone surgery and hold
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's voice broke often and tears flowed freely at Tuesday's news
conference, attended by several players, assistant coaches and personnel
director Charley Armey. Team president John Shaw introduced Vermeil, referring
to him as "Champ."
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't have the ability to verbalize how I feel," he said. "I'm so
appreciative of what my coaching staff has done. And these players, these guys
are unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's quick decision had a lot to do with emotion. He didn't want to be
involved with the free agency period that starts Feb. 11, so he leaves with two
years to go on a five-year, $9 million contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to participate in that," Vermeil said. "I don't want to cut
the squad. These are my guys."
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Georgia Frontiere tried to talk Vermeil out of it, Shaw said he should
at least wait to make sure and special teams coach Frank Gansz made an
impassioned plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Rams players just wanted the best for the coach who made it a point to get
to know all of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Linebacker Mike Jones, who made the game-saving tackle in the Super Bowl,
recalled his first meeting with Vermeil, when the coach came around his desk and
locked him in a bear hug.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me I'm his guy and I'm like, 'What are you doing?' Everything he
did was genuine, and we're going to be Vermeil guys for the rest of our lives."
</P>
<P>
	   Offensive guard Adam Timmerman found out about the retirement when he got
off a plane in Honolulu, where he and seven teammates will play in the Pro Bowl
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess I thought he would finish it out," Timmerman said. "I'm happy he
could leave this way. There's probably no better ending to a coach's career."
</P>
<P>
	   Linebacker London Fletcher said he expected an announcement on the flight
back from Atlanta. He said he's never been around a more emotional coach,
recalling several private conversations with Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Vermeil will always be special in my heart," Fletcher said. "I love
him, and I'm going to miss the little guy."
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco general manager Bill Walsh agreed with his longtime friend
that the time was right.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this stage of his life, he's accomplished everything," Walsh said. "Now
it's time for him to thoroughly enjoy the rewards of what he's accomplished."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil said Martz would retain the staff, and that none of his fellow
60-something coaches would leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil coached two Super Bowl teams 19 years apart. He led the Philadelphia
Eagles to the Super Bowl in 1981, and that 27-10 loss fueled his return to the
profession in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil led the Rams to a 13-3 regular-season record after winning only nine
games his first two years. Following 1998's 4-12 mark, there was talk that he
could be fired. Vermeil, however, weathered the problems and led the team to an
incredible turnaround.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nun Holed Up in Monastery  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERICHO, West Bank (AP) -- An American nun holed up in a monastery for 17
days to keep out Palestinian police says she spends her days huddled around a
small heater, reading the Gospels and collecting food packages through a locked
gate.
</P>
<P>
	   Maria Stephanopoulos, a sister of former White House spokesman George
Stephanopoulos, said her faith and conviction keep her strong behind the stone
walls and iron gates of the Jericho Garden Monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   She and another American nun, Sister Xenia from San Francisco, both of the
``White'' church founded by Russian exiles, barricaded themselves in the
compound during a raid by Palestinian police on Jan. 15. They have since refused
to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The police evicted most of the ``White'' clerics and said they had documents
showing the monastery belonged to their rival Moscow-based ``Red'' Russian
Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Church property in east Jerusalem and the West Bank has been under ``White''
control since the 1917 Russian Revolution, when it split from the ``Red'' and
went into exile to avoid communist control.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the Moscow-based church is pressing the Palestinians, who are eager for
strong ties with Russia, to recognize their claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to an Associated Press reporter through the gate of the compound,
Sister Maria described her days in an abandoned room on the property with a
leaky roof, peeling paint and only an outdoor spigot for washing.
</P>
<P>
	   Clutching rosary beads, she said her struggle is in the tradition of martyrs
of her church who were persecuted under communism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were truly Orthodox and truly loved the Russian Orthodox faith.
That's what I'm inspired by, and they were in far worse conditions than we
are,'' said the 40-year old nun, originally from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials met Tuesday with members of the Moscow Patriarchy
including Metropolitan Kirill, a top ranking figure in the Russian Orthodox
Church, to discuss the monastery standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives from the ``White'' church were not invited.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitri Abu Aitta, the Palestinian tourism minister, said that at the meeting,
the Palestinian Authority proposed providing the ``Whites'' with a plot of land
near the compound while handing the monastery itself over to the ``Reds.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are simply returning the property to'' its rightful owners, Abu Aitta
said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Archbishop Mark, the highest ranking ``Red'' Church official in the
Holy Land, rejected the compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., wrote to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Monday blasting him for the eviction attempt and demanding that the matter be
turned over to a court.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Maria compared a suggestion that the two churches share the property
to the biblical story of Solomon suggesting to two women who claimed to be
mother to the same child that the infant be cut in two and shared.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The true mother could not bear such a thought,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes $2B Web Package  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking ahead to a day when all Americans are connected
to the Internet, President Clinton is proposing a $2 billion package to help
low-income families gain access to computers and the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan calls for $2 billion in tax incentives over 10 years, as well
as $380 million in expanded federal grants, to encourage the private sector to
donate computers, sponsor community technology centers and train workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was making the announcement today at a public high school in
suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, Clinton set a goal of connecting all Americans to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's
just a start,'' Clinton said in his State of the Union speech last month.
</P>
<P>
	   He also was announcing today that he will lead a group of high-tech CEOs on
a trip to impoverished areas this spring as part of his ``New Markets''
initiative to direct investment to areas that haven't shared in the nation's
good economic times.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft White House statement accompanying Clinton's announcement said the
trip would ``highlight communities that are using information technology to
enhance our children's education, expand access to lifelong learning and create
economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
	   The package also will include a request for $10 million to prepare American
Indians for careers in information technology and other technical fields.
Members of the Oglala Sioux nation beseeched Clinton to boost job prospects in
their community during a stop at South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation on his
first New Markets tour last year.
</P>
<P>
	   A Commerce Department report in July found that black and Hispanic
households are only 40 percent as likely to have Internet access as white
families.
</P>
<P>
	   And households with incomes of $75,000 and above in urban areas are more
than 20 times as likely to have Internet access as households at the lowest
income levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has been working with the computer industry,
private foundations, nonprofit organizations and civil rights groups to make the
Internet more accessible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thank the high-tech companies that are already doing so much in this
area -- and I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will encourage others
to join us,'' Clinton said. ``If we take these steps, we will go a long way
toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says more than 50 percent of America's schools and over
80 percent of its classrooms are wired for the Internet. The goal is to have all
schools connected by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the plan Clinton was unveiling today include:
</P>
<P>
	   --$150 million for training new teachers how to use new technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   --$100 million to create 1,000 Community Technology Centers in low-income
urban and rural neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   --$50 million for a pilot program to expand home access to computers and the
Internet for low-income families.

<HEADLINE> Documents Link Chiefs To Drug Probe  </HEADLINE>
    By CRAIG HORST AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tamarick Vanover and Bam Morris, members of the
1999 Kansas City Chiefs, are being investigated for a possible link to drug
trafficking from Missouri to California.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities emphasized that neither man has been charged. But
charges were filed against Greg Burns, who is described as the personal
assistant to Vanover, a return specialist whose 80-yard punt return sparked the
Chiefs to victory against Denver this season.
</P>
<P>
	   An affidavit naming Vanover and Morris was filed in federal court Jan. 25 in
connection with the case against Burns. The affidavit also linked Vanover to a
stolen car.
</P>
<P>
	   Burns was charged last week with conspiracy to distribute marijuana. He was
said to be "a significant cocaine and marijuana supplier in the Kansas City
metropolitan area."
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit, signed by FBI agent Larry G. Tongate, says Vanover's house
was under surveillance since April.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other men mentioned in the affidavit also were charged early last month
with drug trafficking. Chad Pollard and Logan Gearheart, both of Kansas City,
Kan., each pleaded not guilty at hearings. Gearheart soon was released on bond.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Kansas City Star reported that a federal magistrate judge denied
bond for Pollard after testimony from an FBI agent that "he has supplied members
of the Kansas University football team with drugs since 1996 as well as various
Kansas University fraternities."
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Vance, Kansas' assistant athletic director for media relations, said
the reference to the program came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one has any knowledge of this person or any contact with any
investigation related to this issue," Vance told the Star. "We have a
comprehensive drug-testing program here, so if any of that is going on, it's
going on in spite of that."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris, a sixth-year running back who unexpectedly retired from the NFL less
than two weeks ago, twice was suspended by the NFL for substance abuse while
with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He spent 89 days in jail in Texas for violating
terms of the probation he was given in 1996 after pleading guilty to marijuana
possession. He was arrested near Rockwall, Texas, with six pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Tongate said in the affidavit that he received information about "the drug
distribution activities" of Vanover and two people not associated with the
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit noted that on April 23, a car driven by a friend of Morris,
DeWayne Bryant, was seen leaving Vanover's house with Morris as a passenger. The
car was stopped in the Kansas City suburb of Leawood, Kan., and marijuana
residue was found in the car, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris was not charged.
</P>
<P>
	   The car had been stolen in Dallas, according to the affidavits.
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit also said Vanover sold a car stolen from a Kansas City
dealership to a man in Florida for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris' agent, Terry Lavenstein, did not return phone calls to The
Associated Press. He earlier told Kansas City radio station WHB, "Bam Morris, as
far as we know, is not involved in any activity in this ridiculous story."
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit said the investigation was centered on a "large scale,
organized, and structured organization" involved in the distribution of
marijuana and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   "This organization has been distributing marijuana and cocaine in numerous
states," the affidavit said. "Members of the organization obtain marijuana and
cocaine from sources in Mexico, California, and Texas for distribution in
Missouri and Kansas."
</P>
<P>
	   Chiefs fullback Tony Richardson said he was shocked to hear that Morris
might be involved in another drug investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a lot of time to talk and reflect on a lot of things," Richardson
said. "He never gave me any indication something like this was going on. He
probably wouldn't tell me anyway because I'd wring his neck."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Chiefs said club officials hadn't been contacted.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we know is that Bam Morris sent a letter to the NFL declaring that he
was retiring as of 4 p.m. on Jan. 18," team spokesman Bob Moore said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Denies Lewis Accusations  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ray Lewis' attorney proclaimed the innocence of the Pro Bowl
linebacker and expressed confidence he will be cleared of murder charges in the
stabbing deaths of two men following a post-Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ray is doing fine," defense lawyer Max Richardson Jr. said Tuesday after
Lewis was ordered held without bond pending another court date Feb. 24. "He
believes the system will ultimately show that he is innocent of these heinous
crimes."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis is charged with two counts of murder in the deaths of Richard Lollar,
24, and Jacinth "Shorty" Baker, 21, early Monday in Atlanta's Buckhead
entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
	   The Baltimore Ravens linebacker faces a possible sentence of life in prison
or the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're taking the position that he was in the wrong place at the wrong
time," Richardson said outside the courtroom where Lewis appeared briefly,
wearing handcuffs and a red jail uniform. "From what I've gathered from law
enforcement officers, they know Ray didn't kill these unfortunate victims.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't know where the other two men who were involved are, so they
arrested Ray," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported today that police were holding
Lewis' limousine driver under guard in a hotel room while they hunted for others
who were with Lewis' entourage early Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Detectives said they were gathering information for murder warrants on at
least two more men who were with Lewis in his limousine, but they would not
identify the men, the paper said. It said one officer believed that they were
not active NFL players.
</P>
<P>
	   In Baltimore, The Sun reported that the owner of the limousine, Tony Toscov,
said the driver, Duanne Fassett, told him that Lewis did not stab the men.
</P>
<P>
	   The pretrial hearing was continued at the request of prosecutors, who said
they needed more time to interview witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta Solicitor General Raines Carter, who handles the early phases of
cases for the city before they are transferred to Superior Court, said that
Atlanta police made the decision to file murder charges.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that police officials had yet to provide him any details of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta police spokeswoman Marion Lee would not comment on why murder
charges were filed or whether a search is on for other suspects, saying only
that the investigation was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker and Lollar were stabbed repeatedly, according to the Fulton County
medical examiner's office. According to Lollar's grandmother, both men moved to
the Atlanta area from Ohio about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "Richard was very good at cutting hair, and could make anyone look good,"
Joyce Lollar of Akron said, adding that he and his girlfriend were expecting a
baby next month. "He was really into being fashionable and always wanted to look
good himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would cut everyone's hair starting when he was 11 years old, and Shorty
was one of the guys who would come around," she said, adding that her grandson's
funeral would be held in Akron as soon as the body was released and flown north.
"He would have made a good daddy."
</P>
<P>
	   Lollar's cousin, Teresa Lollar, said Tuesday from their grandmother's home:
"To know that an NFL player is involved just goes to show you that regardless of
your status, you can just be an ordinary person when it comes to the law."
</P>
<P>
	   Police said officers responding to a call about a fight in Buckhead found
the two men lying in the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Joyce Lollar said several of Lollar's friends told her he was trying to
break up a fight between Baker and an unidentified man when a group of men
ambushed them.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was just what he was all about, trying to be the peacemaker," she
said. "Then these guys got away in some limo. To watch CNN and ESPN and see his
body being carted away, that really just hurts deeply."
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Byrne of the Ravens, who moved from Cleveland and changed their name
in 1996, said the team has taken no action against the 24-year-old Lewis.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have not had the opportunity to speak to Ray Lewis about this matter,
and we can only hope that the charges against Ray are false." Byrne said. "This
is a very serious matter to the Baltimore Ravens. Two young men died in Atlanta,
and we offer our sympathies to their families and friends."
</P>
<P>
	   Gene Washington, director of player development for the NFL, told the
One-on-One sports radio network in Chicago: "This kind of news is almost
devastating. We certainly, for his own good, hope that it's not true, and for
the good of the NFL."

<HEADLINE> Wider FBI Crime Fighting Role Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global dimensions of crime require that the attorney
general and the FBI extend their authority over other law enforcement agencies
such as the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, according to a congressional
report.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement recommended
Tuesday that the law enforcement functions of the Treasury Department's ATF be
shifted to the FBI and that the Drug Enforcement Administration become a
separate division of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress, which created the commission in 1996 in the wake of law
enforcement controversies such as the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff in Idaho and the
1993 Branch Davidian siege in Waco, Texas, has failed to act on similar
recommendations in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   The departments of Treasury and Justice, in a joint statement, said the
report was ``thoughtful and deliberative,'' but noted that the idea of merging
the ATF and DEA into the FBI was not new and had previously been rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe such a merger would be unnecessary and would be detrimental to
our law enforcement efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the chairman of the five-member group, former FBI Director William H.
Webster, said better coordination is crucial if the country is to meet the
growing threats of global crime, terrorism and cyber-crime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have serious concerns about the readiness of the federal government to
protect Americans and the national security'' without structural changes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the attorney general should be responsible for overseeing
all major federal law enforcement policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also criticized the recent tendency to ``federalize'' crimes.
It said 40 percent of federal crimes have been put on the books since 1970 and
now total more than 3,000. ``This situation threatens to overwhelm federal law
enforcement capacities, just as dramatic and serious new law enforcement
challenges grow in intensity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Webster acknowledged that others in the past, going back to President Lyndon
Johnson, have attempted to restructure the ATF or consolidate law enforcement
efforts, with limited success.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said his panel
``will study the report and review its recommendations.'' A hearing on the
findings was scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster said that while such events as Ruby Ridge and Waco had become
``metaphors'' for some of the recent problems in law enforcement, they were only
part of a larger picture that included some real successes such as law
enforcement coordination after the 1995 bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI was deeply involved in both the 1992 Ruby Ridge and 1993 Waco
incidents. At Ruby Ridge, the wife and son of white separatist Randy Weaver and
a deputy U.S. marshall died. At Waco, which began with a botched ATF raid on the
Branch Davidians religious sect's complex, the FBI was in charge for most of the
standoff that ended in the complex's destruction by fire, with more than 80
people dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also recommended that law enforcement and intelligence
communities better coordinate their activities, that global crime be made a
national law enforcement priority and that Congress require that law enforcement
agencies establish new standards for professionalism and integrity.

<HEADLINE> India Arms Smugglers Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- A British arms dealer and five Latvians were
sentenced to life in prison today for smuggling arms intended for a revolution
against India.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Bleach, the arms trader, and the Latvian crewmen who parachuted crates
of weapons into eastern India five years ago, said they would appeal their
conviction to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very disappointed, but not surprised,'' Bleach said outside the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were convicted of aiding insurgents who intended to wage war against
India.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was closely watched because it touched on the international arms
market and involved some of the most serious charges brought against Western
defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The six have spent four years in jail since they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution claimed the assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and
missiles were intended for an anti-communist religious group in West Bengal, a
state with a communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   Bleach argued that he had secretly kept the British intelligence services
informed of the plan to fly arms to India.

<HEADLINE> US Fire Departments Need Volunteers  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTEN HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Pa. (AP) -- Walter ``Frosty'' Forys may not be able to hoist
a 100-pound ladder anymore, but he can still throw on a fireman's hat and hook a
hose to a hydrant.
</P>
<P>
	   At 88, the retired coal miner is the oldest volunteer firefighter in Mount
Pleasant, a community that still needs his more than 50 years of experience
battling blazes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mount Pleasant isn't alone. The state has lost about half of its volunteer
firefighters in the past five years, part of a nationwide decline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It used to be we always had plenty of firefighters in the hopper,'' Forys
said. ``But now there are a lot of volunteer companies thinking of folding up.
Nobody wants to do this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the National Fire Protection Association, the nation's
volunteer force dropped 13 percent from 1983 to 1991, to 771,800 firefighters.
That increased to 838,000 in 1995, but dropped again to 804,200 by 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Smaller communities have been hard hit, forced to depend on a grayer
population for jobs that increasingly entail more fund raising than
firefighting. As of 1998, about 13 percent of firefighters in cities of 10,000
or more were 50 or older; the association said the figure in towns with fewer
than 2,500 people was even greater, at 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Many blame the booming economy for thinning out the ranks of volunteer
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a low point, because with the good economy and low unemployment
like we have now, people are just unable to be as active as we want them to
be,'' said Jerry Lucia, Mount Pleasant's mayor and chief of the volunteer fire
department.
</P>
<P>
	   About 90 percent of Pennsylvania's 2,464 fire departments are run by
volunteers, the highest percentage of any state, said Heather Schafer, executive
director of the National Volunteer Fire Council. By comparison, Texas has 1,600
volunteer departments, and New York has 1,400.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1985, Pennsylvania has lost thousands of volunteer firefighters while
emergency response calls increased 48 percent, said John Brenner, executive
director of the Pennsylvania Fire and Emergency Services Institute in
Harrisburg.
</P>
<P>
	   Diane Bailey's husband, Bernard, dropped out of Mount Pleasant's force three
years ago after 12 years of service. She worries whether enough firefighters
will be around when it counts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does become a concern for people in the area only because we know the
ranks are down,'' she said. ``Our fire department does good work, but you never
know when it might be your place that gets involved in a disaster and you always
hope the best possible people are there.''
</P>
<P>
	   A key hurdle for volunteers is that fire protection isn't cheap. State law
allows municipal fire taxes to be used only for equipment, maintenance and
buildings -- not for salaries, pensions or other perks.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucia said the $37,000 in local fire taxes pays a portion of the cost to
maintain Mount Pleasant's two-story red brick firehouse, a storage building and
seven trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Department volunteers run bingo games every Tuesday night and a week-long
street fair every June to raise the lion's share to operate. Firefighters go
door-to-door to raise money to buy or repair pumpers and ladder trucks, which
cost $350,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
	   It takes several years to raise that much cash, Lucia said, so the
door-knocking never stops in this southwestern Pennsylvania town of 4,800
people. Fund raising is mandatory in Mount Pleasant's department, and most of
its 46 members are either single or retired.
</P>
<P>
	   No one, it seems, is standing in line to sign up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people don't join the fire house to sell hoagies and run bingo. They
join to answer calls,'' said Brenner, himself a firefighter at the Lincolnway
Volunteer Fire Company in Manchester Township.
</P>
<P>
	   The constant need to find money played a big part in why Ms. Bailey's
husband called it quits, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did as much as he possibly could, but he couldn't meet the extra
demands of the bingos,'' said Mrs. Bailey. ``We even paid someone $20 to do it
each time my husband was due to handle a bingo night when he couldn't be there.
The time commitment was just too much.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. Victor Lescovitz of Washington said if something isn't done, some
volunteer departments will dry up -- and taxpayers eventually will feel the
bite. He plans to introduce legislation to allow for state or municipal tax
dollars to be used for incentives, such as pensions or tuition reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we don't resolve it, we're going to end up with a big problem here in
the next 10 to 15 years when we have no volunteers,'' he said. ``Volunteer fire
departments save hundreds of millions of dollars each year to taxpayers. If we
have paid departments, they will pay much more.''

<HEADLINE> Graf on board for AmericaOne Win  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Steffi Graf took a wild ride on AmericaOne. When
it was over and the U.S. boat was tied with Italy in the the America's Cup
challenger finals, skipper Paul Cayard and his famous guest were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-9 series is 3-3, but it appears to be advantage, Cayard.
</P>
<P>
	Once, AmericaOne trailed Prada of Italy 3-1. But after winning by 34 seconds
Tuesday and 9 seconds Wednesday in the closest race of the round, Cayard had the
momentum going into today's seventh race.
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the series advances to the best-of-9 America's Cup finals against
defending champion New Zealand starting Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen in sailboat races, and we got to a score that wasn't exactly
the score we were hoping for,'' Cayard said, ``but it didn't mean we're out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
	His 16-man crew might have had its best performance today. Graf, filling the
role of ''17th man,'' took it all in. Each boat is allowed to take a non-sailing
passenger on board as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
	Graf, in Auckland for a tennis exhibition, visited the AmericaOne compound
Tuesday and asked to tag along. It wasn't center court at Wimbledon, but she was
watching two boats seeking the top prize in sailing.
</P>
<P>
	``It's as thrilling as can be,'' Graf said. ``That race was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very competitive person and we gave her the best that this sport has
to offer to see from a front-row seat,'' Cayard said. ``She was just very
ecstatic. She was just as she would have been had she won the fifth set of a
very tight tennis match.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada's 17th man, as it has been for much of the trials, was 73-year-old Renzo
Guidi, a long-time friend of syndicate head Patrizio Bertelli and a hotel
operator near Prada's summer base in Punta Ala, Italy.
</P>
<P>
	Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis smiled as he deflected a question about
whether the Italians have a policy barring women from the role of ''17th man.''
</P>
<P>
	``We have a gentleman that stays with us. We are pleased with his company,'' de
Angelis said. ``We'd like to take girls when we go cruising, give them a better
time.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada trailed for almost all of the last four legs of the six-leg, 18 1/2-mile
race, with three legs going downwind and the other three upwind. Winds were a
relatively strong 16-20 knots.
</P>
<P>
	The boats crossed the starting line simultaneously, and Prada led by 20 and 17
seconds after each of the first two legs. Then it tripped on the kind of sail
that had been so sturdy for it throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	As it lowered its spinnaker after the first downwind run, the sail dragged
through the water. Some of the cloth got caught on the rudder and keel. A crew
member leaned over the port side, held by a teammate, and tried to free the
material with a long pole.
</P>
<P>
	``This stuff's bad when it gets on the rudder, isn't it, Francesco?'' Cayard
joked. ``Our stuff just goes away, like toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada has lost just two spinnakers in its 45 races so far, while AmericaOne has
ripped four in this series alone and a total of nine.
</P>
<P>
	``The boat was not giving the best performance and I think we survived until
the bottom mark,'' de Angelis said, ``but then we had to go upwind. It was
painful. The boat was going sideways.
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from that problem, we kept the race tight until the end.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada's spinnaker trouble helped AmericaOne gain 33 seconds on the third leg
and take a 17-second lead. That dwindled to seven seconds after the fourth leg
and remained the same after the fifth.
</P>
<P>
	On the final leg, with the wind blowing from behind, de Angelis tried several
maneuvers ``to force the boat ahead into making a mistake.'' But AmericaOne
never did.
</P>
<P>
	``So far I think the Italians have felt like they probably operate the boat a
little smoother than we do,'' Cayard said, ``but I think we might have turned
the cards on that today.''

<HEADLINE> McCain, Gore Win in N.H. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain opened the Southern front in his battle for the Republican
presidential nomination today, boosted by the momentum of a startling landslide
over George W. Bush in New Hampshire. He called it ``a powerful message'' of
change to come.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore edged Bill Bradley to win the Democratic primary, and
claimed to have dealt ``a devastating blow'' to his challenger. But Bradley
declared himself a smarter, tougher candidate for the national battle still
ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   That struggle began Tuesday night even before all of New Hampshire's votes
had been counted, as candidates deployed south and west for the primaries ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On to South Carolina,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I like my chances in Delaware,'' Bush said. ``And South Carolina is Bush
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats get a five-week pause in primary voting, but not in campaigning.
Gore heads for crucial California later today; Bradley is due Thursday.
California is the biggest of the 14 state prizes at stake in the Super Bowl of
the primary campaign March 7. Both also were campaigning in New York, which
votes the same day, on their way west.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Delaware is next on Feb. 8. Bush is campaigning
there, although briefly. McCain is not; his strategy hinges on South Carolina,
which he has said he must win. Steve Forbes, a fading third in New Hampshire, is
competing in Delaware, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Alan Keyes ran fourth in New Hampshire; Gary Bauer, who
finished last, went home to consider his next step, which may be withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, McCain got 114,047 votes or 49
percent; Bush had 71,492 votes or 31 percent; Forbes, 29,945 votes or 13
percent; Keyes, 15,078 votes or 6 percent; and Bauer, 1,653 votes or 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP analysis showed McCain was winning 10 out of the total 17 delegates at
stake Tuesday. Bush was winning five and Forbes two.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore had 75,449 votes or 53 percent, and Bradley had
68,800 votes or 47 percent. Gore was winning 13 of the 22 delegates at stake
Tuesday and Bradley was winning nine, the AP analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have made a remarkable turnaround but there is still a tough fight
ahead,'' the former senator told supporters in Manchester, N.H. ''... We're
smarter and better prepared and we're ready to continue the fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   At his Manchester victory rally, Gore said, ``This Tennessean is in the end
zone and it feels great, and let me tell you, we have just begun to fight.'' He
promised to ``crisscross this continent again and again'' for the nomination and
as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his before-dawn arrival at New York's LaGuardia Airport, approximately
200 cheering fans -- including actor Billy Baldwin -- braved cold winds to greet
Gore, who hopped up and down, looking like a boxer in the ring, as worked down a
ropeline shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've just begun to fight!'' he shouted into a bullhorn before a limousine
whisked him to a Manhattan hotel for an abbreviated night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush called the outcome a bump in the road in a state known for placing them
in the path of front-runners. But it was a jolting one for a campaign that had
expected no worse than a narrow defeat. McCain's wipeout -- only presidents
running for renomination had gained margins that wide in prior primaries --
struck at Bush's greatest advantage, the image of inevitability, given his
towering lead from the beginning in national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think electability is a big factor,'' said Gov. Paul Celluci of
neighboring Massachusetts, campaigning for Bush, the governor of Texas.
``Republicans think Bush can win in the fall.'' But to keep them thinking so,
he's got to win in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Bush suffered in New Hampshire, he still has advantages over
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Money is one, with more than $31 million in Bush's campaign treasury to
begin the election year, four times the amount that McCain, the Arizona senator,
had.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also leads in polls for South Carolina's primary, but New Hampshire
will have an impact there. ``The comparison shopping has just begun,'' said Rep.
Lindsay Graham, a McCain ally in South Carolina who came north to shiver with
his candidate on election eve.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's endorsements -- including from his famous parents -- didn't help in
New Hampshire, but could prove a bigger boost in later states. All but four
Republican governors favor his nomination, and their organizations will be at
his service.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona and Michigan hold GOP primaries Feb. 22, followed by Virginia on
Feb. 29, and Bush should have the advantage in the latter two contests.
</P>
<P>
	   But the March 7 primaries are pivotal to Republicans, too. McCain spokesman
Dan Schnur said California will be ``the single most important decision-maker in
the primary campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   That goes for the Democrats, too. Gore swamped Bradley nearly 2-to-1 in the
Iowa caucuses, but beat him only narrowly in New Hampshire. Bradley climbed to
the lead in the New Hampshire opinion polls, then slumped, then edged back up.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he has the money and determination to wage the national contest
that begins March 7, when six of the 10 biggest states vote in a single day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're no longer in a single state, we're in the national phase of the
campaign,'' he said. Gore agreed. ``It's a national primary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley claimed satisfaction in New Hampshire, it prompted him to one
change -- he challenged Gore to weekly debates through March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had started the debate challenges four months ago, when he pronounced
himself the underdog and remodeled his campaign. Bradley rebuffed him, but they
eventually met in eight forums. The vice president then demanded two debates a
week, to supplant campaign TV ads. Bradley called it a gimmick and said he'd
keep advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he's willing to debate, but renewed his demand that the ads be
dropped. He and Bradley are booked to debate March 1 in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Shakes Reputation  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA MENDOZA AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- High tech entrepreneurs are finally shaking their
stingy reputation, giving away their Silicon Valley millions at an unprecedented
rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent high profile donations -- including billions for education and health
care from Microsoft Corp.'s Bill and Melinda Gates, $150 million to Stanford
University from Netscape founder Jim Clark and another $100 million to the
University of Mississippi from former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale -- are setting
examples for young high tech entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many of these young people are very idealistic, but until recently they've
had few examples of how to give,'' said Peter Hero, who heads the nonprofit
Community Foundation Silicon Valley. ``Now we're seeing them applying the same
creativity they used to build their businesses to charitable giving.''
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation received more than $75 million in cash and stock gifts
between July 1 and Dec. 31 last year, an all-time high in the organization's
45-year history. It expects donations to double this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Silicon Valley nonprofits are enjoying new waves of generosity.
</P>
<P>
	   Donations were up 23 percent at the Second Harvest Food Bank last year,
which had the largest holiday food drive in the nation with 1.7 million pounds
of donated food and $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   And the YMCA of Santa Clara Valley recently surpassed its capital campaign
goal of $7 million by raising almost $10 million, the most money ever raised by
the 132-year-old local association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were really surprised and pleased,'' said Robb Hermanson, vice
president for development. For a long time, ``the amount of wealth being
accumulated in this region was completely out of balance with the philanthropic
giving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been wonderful to see that change. Donors are now coming to us at an
unprecedented rate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The result: new children's programs, health facilities and swimming pools
for local families.
</P>
<P>
	   It's no coincidence that technology stock prices are soaring at the same
time as charitable donations.
</P>
<P>
	   In many cases, the donations come in the form of tech stocks -- which rose
an average of 130 percent last year. As the stocks go up, so does the monetary
value of the gift.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, before online auction house eBay went public in 1998, founders
established a charitable fund with 107,250 shares of stock in June 1998. When
the company went public a few months later, shares were priced at $18, making
the donation worth $1.9 million. Since then, eBay's shares have soared as high
as $234. Last week, they were trading around $150 a share, bringing the value of
the original shares of the fund to $16 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The online auction site's model is being emulated by other Internet
companies, Hero said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen groups have been created in the last year to help techies
give. One is the New Schools Venture Fund, created by venture capitalists and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
	   It plans to give millions to up to 20 of ``the most promising, scalable
education ventures in the country,'' said cofounder John Doerr, a high-tech
investor whose venture capital helped start many major companies, including
Amazon.com, Netscape and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Muther, who spent 1989 through 1994 as a senior marketing officer
at Cisco Systems Inc., launched the Three Guineas Fund last year with $2 million
of her own money. She plans to help women start tech companies and then teach
them to contribute to philanthropic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
	   The philanthropic efforts mark a significant change for the booming high
tech industry, which was chided by President Clinton in October during a White
House conference on philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Silicon Valley -- a region stretching south from San Francisco --
has one of the highest per-capita incomes in the country, it falls well below
national averages when it comes to sharing the wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   About one-third of Silicon Valley households earning more than $100,000 per
year give $1,000 or less to charity, according to a 1998 Field Research Corp.
survey.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also showed that almost half of the region's wealthiest households
were very low givers in relation to their net-worth: 45 percent of the
wealthiest contributors give just $2,000 or less annually to charity; 48 percent
``planned to donate more to charity when they get older.''
</P>
<P>
	   Maury Kendall, spokesman for the Emergency Housing Consortium of Santa Clara
Valley, said his agency received a few generous donations around the holidays.
But there hasn't been a notable increase in individual donations in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the numbers of homeless people -- especially families -- has
increased, with about 1,500 homeless people per night in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their homelessness is directly attributable to the skyrocketing costs of
housing in the Silicon Valley,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1992, Silicon Valley has created 250,000 jobs, but fewer than 50,000
housing units. As a result, home prices and rents are rising much faster than
incomes, making it the most expensive region in the country, according to the
Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group.
</P>
<P>
	   Kendall said his biggest challenge is educating high tech workers how to be
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
	   Hero said he's optimistic that the next survey of high tech giving will
reflect the recent changes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is our hope,'' Hero said, ``that Silicon Valley will soon be known as
much for its generosity as it is for its technology.''

Slim Hope for Alaska Air Survivors
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Hopes are increasingly slim for finding any
survivors from the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. Searchers have pulled
four bodies -- one man, two women and an infant-- from the calm sea, which is
300 to 750 feet deep in the area. Investigators said Tuesday that the pilots of
the jet struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before
the jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard. The last minutes of
the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by pilots aboard four other
aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board was seeking to interview
them.

flown out in three groups and taken to a diner for breakfast. They were in good
condition. Ten other motorists trapped by another avalanche elsewhere along the

place in the overall NBA standings. Tim Duncan had 29 points and 18 rebounds,
Avery Johnson tied his season-high with 22 points, Terry Porter scored 15 and
David Robinson had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Spurs, who sent the
once-mighty Lakers to their fourth loss in five games.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $1.2B For Indian Country  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian reservations would get an infusion of
$1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement
under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the
largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded
programs in nearly all federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking
about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after
she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and
Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton announced the spending initiative in his State of the Union address
last week, but did not mention any specifics. Those will be included in his 2001
budget proposal, to be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new
reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about
$300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to
reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main
agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't
address all the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In all, I don't think it's anything to have a party over, because the
needs in Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton
picked to head the BIA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and
chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does
wonder why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a
look at Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the
estimated $4 billion backlog of needed repairs. And, according to an Interior
Department report issued last year, $1.2 billion is needed to repair or replace
170 Indian schools.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know half-a-dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's
a drop,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reservations are home to some of the gravest poverty and worst health care
in the country. The unemployment rate on reservations is about 10 times the
national average and only about two-thirds of Indian adults have a high school
diploma, compared to three-quarters of the general population. The Indian Health
Service reports the Indian death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the
population.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31 tribal
colleges, Cutler said. The colleges, which serve 26,000 students in 12 states,
are a vital part of efforts to improve education and economic opportunities on
reservations, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report to be released today says tribal colleges have created jobs and
helped increase education levels on the reservations where they operate. The
report from the Institute for Higher Education Policy and the American Indian
Higher Education Consortium said median incomes for women on reservations with
tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster between 1980 and 1990 than for women on
reservations without colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler said other details of Clinton's proposal include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of
Indian students.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   -- $5 million for a Treasury Department program aimed at attracting
companies to reservation areas.

Slim Hope for Alaska Air Survivors

	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Hopes are increasingly slim for finding any
survivors from the crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. Searchers have pulled
four bodies -- one man, two women and an infant-- from the calm sea, which is
300 to 750 feet deep in the area. Investigators said Tuesday that the pilots of
the jet struggled with a sudden control problem for at least six minutes before
the jetliner plummeted into the ocean with 88 people aboard. The last minutes of
the MD-83's flight Monday may have been witnessed by pilots aboard four other
aircraft, and the National Transportation Safety Board was seeking to interview

<HEADLINE> Elian Grandmas Anguish Over Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez deny that they are being
pressured by the Cuban government to demand the boy's return to Cuba and say his
personality has changed while in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not hostages. We are acting freely,'' paternal grandmother Mariela
Quintana said during a 90-minute broadcast Tuesday night on Cuban state
television.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne O'Laughlin, a nun of the Dominican order who hosted their meeting
with Elian last week, has said she now favors keeping the 6-year-old in the
United States, in part because she believes the Cuban government is manipulating
the family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She is the one who is not free,'' said maternal grandmother Raquel
Rodriguez, who wept while recalling the meeting with Elian. ``She is a lying
person. It's a lie ... so many lies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy has been at the center of an international custody battle pitting
his father and grandparents in Cuba against the boy's great-uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
His mother and 10 other people died when the boat carrying them from Cuba to the
United States sank.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers complained that the child -- who has lived most of his life
in their homes -- seemed quiet and withdrawn when he was brought to meet them on
Jan. 26 at the home of O'Laughlin, president of Barry University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He looked frightened ... His face was sad. He was not the boy we knew,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the boy's second-cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, apparently remained
with O'Laughlin and another nun in a room next door and could listen though an
open entryway, despite an agreement that members of the Miami family would not
be at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a column published Tuesday in the New York Times, O'Laughlin said she now
favors keeping Elian in the United States with Marisleysis Gonzalez partly
because the boy ``has transferred his maternal love to her'' following the loss
of his mother. She said the grandmothers seemed fearful -- apparently of their
own government.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez said Elian seemed nervous when the grandmothers questioned the
presence of his cousin. ``He said, 'Look grandmother, this is my cousin,' '' she
said. ``He said it as if the boy was depending on her, that he could not be
without her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said that Marisleysis Gonzalez had almost no relationship with
Elian before the November shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
	   The women said their meeting with the boy was repeatedly interrupted by nuns
offering food or bringing messages. Rodriguez said one nun entered three times
with the same message, asking them to meet members of the Miami family.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that the boy was starting to warm up when O'Laughlin halted the
meeting after 90 minutes, short of the two-hour minimum reportedly agreed to.
</P>
<P>
	   After the boy was taken away, ``We cried a lot. That was terrible,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said attempts to speak with the boy by telephone either from the
United States or Cuba had been unsuccessful because they were always told that
the child was either sleeping or out. She said the boy's father, however, had
managed to speak to the boy twice in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father, but the Miami relatives are trying to block that action
in federal court. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb.
22 on whether their lawsuit should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Children's Rights Council, a Washington-based child advocacy group, said
Tuesday it will file a brief within a week to support returning the child to his
father, arguing that only the father has legal standing in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We realize Cuba is a dictatorship, but the child would not be living with
Fidel Castro, he'd be living with his dad,'' said the group's president, David
L. Levy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This child has lost his mother and stepfather. I would be a tragedy for
him to lose his father and four grandparents.''

<HEADLINE> Feds, Wal-Mart Team To Promote Coin  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is easier to find at Wal-Mart or even in a box of
Cheerios than at your local bank.
</P>
<P>
	   At least, that is the initial plan for the new Sacagawea dollar coin, which
is being aggressively marketed by U.S. Mint officials mindful of the debacle
with the Susan B. Anthony dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last Thursday, cashiers at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club store checkouts
have been making change with the Sacagawea coin instead of dollar bills. And
thousands of Cheerios boxes will include coins or certificates for coins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through the end of February, we will be the exclusive holder,'' said Laura
Pope, spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer.
``We're giving it back automatically to customers unless you request dollar
bills.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Anthony coin, often mistaken for a quarter because of its similar size
and ridged edge, was a flop, and the government was stuck with nearly two-thirds
of the 857 million coins produced between 1979 and 1981. Supplies eventually ran
out and the Mint produced a final 1999 encore run.
</P>
<P>
	   The silver-colored coin bore the likeness of suffragette Susan B. Anthony.
The new dollar coin, with an image of the Shoshone Indian woman who helped the
Lewis and Clark expedition explore the West, has a gold-colored surface and a
smooth edge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right away, this gets the new golden dollar coin into cash registers
across the nation,'' said Philip Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint. ``We've
achieved a huge objective in the first week, something the Susan B. Anthony
dollar never had the chance to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint is shipping $100 million worth to Wal-Mart and the same amount to
Federal Reserve banks, which in turn will distribute them to private banks.
Diehl said the Mint plans to produce as many as 1 billion coins this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Transactions involving the Sacagawea coins at the 3,000 Wal-Mart and Sam's
Club stores are limited to $10, Pope said. Customers also can request the coin
as change without buying anything.
</P>
<P>
	   People also may order the coins via the Internet at www.usmint.gov.
</P>
<P>
	   The special deal with Wal-Mart is vexing to some Main Street retailers, who
cannot get the coins. Jim Seigfreid, owner of Jim's IGA in Marshall, Mo., said
customers started asking for the coins last Friday, but local bank officials
told him they didn't have coins to distribute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the government offers something like this to private industry over
others, especially an industry as big as Wal-Mart, they ought to offer it to
small businesses who are trying to compete,'' said Seigfreid, also a Missouri
state legislator.
</P>
<P>
	   Seigfreid and others complained to Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who wrote to the
Mint on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wal-Mart is a fine organization, but there are also many, many small
businesses that would like to participate in this,'' Skelton said in an
interview. ``The backbone of the American economy is the small business
community. Why not let small businesses across the nation distribute these?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint plans to spend $40 million promoting the gold-colored coin in a
television, radio and print advertising campaign in the spring.

<HEADLINE> Health Care Generous to Hastert  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Always House Speaker Dennis Hastert's strongest financial
backer, the health care industry gave the largest block of contributions to the
Illinois Republican's campaign committees in the last half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert, R-Ill., collected $113,000 in health care support for his
re-election committee and his Keep Our Majority political action committee from
July through December, according to reports filed this week with the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation also was a healthy contributor, with truck dealers, Federal
Express, the Big Three automakers and others combining for $32,000 of Hastert's
combined take of $817,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Hastert took the House's top job at the beginning of last year,
he had carved out a niche as his party's standard-bearer on health care.
</P>
<P>
	   The $113,000 tally included money from all types of insurers and many groups
representing providers, such as physical therapists and orthopedic surgeons.
Major contributions included $5,000 from the American Health Care Association, a
nursing home group; $3,000 from Prudential Insurance; and $2,000 from Aetna Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   A narrower analysis by a Washington-based watchdog organization, Center for
Responsive Politics, found Hastert's own campaign committee received $23,250
last year from PACs and employees of members of the Health Benefits Coalition.
The powerful collection of health, insurance and business groups lobbies against
changes in managed care.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's take was the second-highest in the House, according to the center.
He also had the second-largest donation total from pharmaceutical companies,
which are fighting a broader Democratic plan to provide prescription benefits
for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, efforts to give patients new rights in dealing with managed care
companies grabbed the spotlight as Hastert saw dozens of his Republican
colleagues defect and help Democrats pass a bill that would allow patients to
sue their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate version, more to the liking of health insurers, does not allow
patient lawsuits. But GOP leaders have indicated they may be ready to compromise
on an issue popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FEC filings, Hastert raised $633,565 for his campaign
committee and $183,441 for his leadership PAC during the last six months of
1999. He gave $118,000 to GOP congressional candidates, plus $75,000 to the
House Republican Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert raised $1.5 million for the two committees in the first six months
of his speakership. His spokesman, John McGovern, said Hastert gathered an
estimated $12 million more for Republicans in 1999 -- including an additional $7
million in the last six months -- by traveling the country and headlining
fund-raisers.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Study: Danger of Oral Sex High  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Many gay men consider oral sex a safer alternative to
intercourse, but a new study finds it carries a real risk of spreading AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Even without condoms, oral sex is widely regarded to be safe sex, even
though health agencies have never officially conceded that. A new study
conducted in San Francisco shows that frequent unprotected oral sex can also be
risky, though certainly not as much as anal sex.
</P>
<P>
	   "The message is not that everyone will get infected through oral sex," said
Dr. Frederick Hecht of San Francisco General Hospital, a coauthor of the study.
In fact, anal intercourse could be 100 times riskier.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of declines in unprotected anal intercourse, there has been a big
reduction in high-risk exposure, Hecht said. But there is still plenty of
low-risk exposure through oral sex without condoms, "and that low risk adds up."
</P>
<P>
	   His study found that oral sex was probably the cause of 8 percent of recent
HIV infections among a group of homosexual men examined in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, there have been occasional reports of people apparently
catching HIV orally. But health investigators have had difficulty being certain,
since gay men who have do oral sex also may engage in other, riskier sex
practices, such as anal intercourse.
</P>
<P>
	   Now diagnostic tests allow doctors to narrow down the timing of HIV
infections. They were used in the latest study, described as the most definitive
on the subject to date. The work, conducted with the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, was presented in San Francisco at the 7th Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
</P>
<P>
	   "While oral sex may still be safer than anal intercourse or vaginal
intercourse, it is not without risk and perhaps has higher risk than we would
have expected otherwise," said Dr. Helene Gayle, the CDC's AIDS chief.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers sought to learn the means of infection in 102 gay and
bisexual men who had recently caught HIV. When all other possible means of
infection were ruled out, oral sex turned out to be the only risk behavior in
eight of these men. Most said they thought oral sex had little or no risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the strict criteria used, the real number of cases resulting from
oral sex may actually have been higher. For instance, two men said they had oral
sex but not anal sex. But they also said they had blacked out once and could not
be sure what had happened, so they were excluded from the total.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the men apparently caught the virus by giving oral sex, rather than
receiving it, and none used condoms.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know that the only safe sex is total abstinence or sex with a mutually
monogamous, non-HIV-infected partner," Gayle said. "Everything else has some
degree of risk. The sense that oral sex is safe sex may have been an unfortunate
message."
</P>
<P>
	   Gayle said she assumes that the risk of oral sex when properly using a
condom is close to zero. She also said that if oral sex alone has played a large
role in the spread of AIDS, that would already have become obvious during the 20
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, noted that some gay men turned to frequent unprotected oral sex after
giving up anal intercourse.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of us in the public health field have been saying all along to be
careful of unprotected fellatio," he said. "People think the risk is low, but
what's low?"

<HEADLINE> Cohen OKs Training on Gays Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military services for the first time have
spelled out for field commanders a policy of ensuring that troops who complain
of anti-gay threats or harassment are not themselves investigated.
</P>
<P>
	   The intent is to allow such complaints to be aired without fear of being
kicked out of the service for being homosexual, and to reinforce the idea that
those who make anti-gay threats will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday the new guidelines on how to
investigate anti-gay threats are incorporated in updated training programs
designed to ensure that the Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy on gays is enforced fairly and uniformly throughout the services.
</P>
<P>
	   As a matter of policy, commanders are not to use complaints of anti-gay
harassment or threats as a reason to investigate the complaining person. Instead
the commanders are supposed to investigate the source of the threat or
harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These plans make it very clear ... that there is no room for harassment or
threats in the military,'' Cohen said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Service members need to understand that harassment for any reason will not
be tolerated, and commanders will take prompt, appropriate actions against
individuals involved in such behavior,'' Cohen added.

	   The Pentagon also announced Tuesday the number of discharges from the
military for being homosexual fell to 1,034 in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30
from 1,145 in the year-earlier period. Spokesman Kenneth Bacon said 83.5 percent
of discharges resulted from statements by service members that they were
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the administration's policy, gays may serve in the military as long as
they keep their sexual orientation to themselves. If they state that they are
homosexual, they are supposed to be removed from the service.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, the first full year of ``don't ask, don't tell,'' discharges
totaled 617. They rose every year since until 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Benecke, executive director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Fund, welcomed Cohen's approval of the training guidelines but said such
guidance should have been made available to field commanders years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're glad to see, finally, that the secretary is taking steps to train
people,'' Benecke said. She said her group has found that most service members
who declare their homosexuality, and thereby are removed from the service, do so
because they feel threatened by an anti-gay environment in their workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is needed now is for leaders to enforce the harassment guidelines
with commitment,'' Benecke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen instructed the services to develop new training guidelines in December
amid widening criticism that Clinton administration's policy on gays in the
military was not working. The criticism sharpened after a court-martial in which
an Army private was convicted of murdering a gay soldier harassed with the
knowledge of his superiors. President Clinton called the Pentagon's
implementation of the administration policy ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen also asked each of the service's top civilian and uniformed leaders to
issue statements to their troops reinforcing the policy against harassment of
gays.

<HEADLINE> Gore Beats Back Bradley Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Beating back Bill Bradley's once-robust challenge,
Vice President Al Gore cast his New Hampshire victory as a ``devastating blow''
to his Democratic rival. Both candidates raced toward battleground primary
states ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to march all the way down the field, from state to state, from
coast to coast, all the way to victory in November,'' Gore declared before
leaving for a 2 a.m. airport rally in New York, which votes March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley credited Gore with running a strong race but declared his
determination to fight on. ``We're smarter and better prepared and ready and
eager to continue to fight,'' he said in a speech to supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator surprised Gore with a proposal for weekly
debates starting Sunday and running through the March 7 primary. Gore said he'd
already been pushing for twice-weekly debates.
</P>
<P>
	   With 90 percent of precincts counted, Gore had 68,346 votes or 52 percent to
Bradley's 62,603 votes or 47 percent. Gore was winning 13 out of the 22
delegates at stake Tuesday. Bradley was winning nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls framed the race as a showdown between experience and candor.
Seven in 10 voters who said they wanted a candidate who ``stands up for what he
believes in,'' chose Bradley. More than 90 percent of voters who picked the
``right experience'' as a presidential prerequisite liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic presidential candidates were plunging immediately into the
five-week race for what Bradley called ``the first national primary'' -- the
March 7 contests in more than a dozen states, including California, New York and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who spent lavishly at the top of his race, faces the national fight
with a dwindling bankroll. And so, expensive national TV ads are out and Gore
will fight the ad wars state by state, campaign chairman Tony Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the latest Federal Election Commission reports, Bradley has a
$2 million edge over Gore heading into the next round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A national fight is good for Al Gore.'' Coelho said. ``It increases his
credentials with the American people and shows him as a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore was battered by Bradley's late offensive on abortion rights and
campaign finance. On Tuesday, he raced to air one last radio ad asserting his
``pro-choice leadership,'' and, with an hour left in the voting, abruptly
ordered his motorcade to make a final stop at a Bedford polling site. He called
Bradley's New Hampshire loss a ``devastating blow.''
</P>
<P>
	   For Bradley, the offer to debate, which he called an opportunity ``to reach
millions of voters across the country,'' doubled as a means of increasing his
name recognition outside New Jersey, which he represented in the Senate, and New
York, where he played for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane promised, ``It's pretty safe to assume we'll
have a lot of debates.'' But he said Gore still wants the debates to be coupled
with an end to 30-second TV ads, as he proposed earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore gave some of the credit for his second win of the nominating season to
the strong economy, and prosperity in the Cinton-Gore years clearly resonated
with some voters. In Manchester, Democrat Richard St. Hilaire, 70, said he knew
from the start he would vote for Gore, even though ``Clinton and his
administration have done a lot of bad things.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the economy to continue in the same direction it's been,'' St.
Hilaire explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But accountant Charles Baron, 51, a Democrat who described himself as
generally a Gore supporter, said he was so discouraged by the negative tone of
the Gore-Bradley race that he voted for a Republican, John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``lowered himself with the campaign he conducted here,'' said Baron,
who voted in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Education and health care were the most important issues to Democrats.
Bradley was favored by those who cared most about health care; Gore won those
who picked education.
</P>
<P>
	   About a third of voters said the most important quality in a candidate is
that he ``stands up for what he believes in,'' and about seven in 10 of those
voters favored Bradley. But having the ``right experience'' was in second place,
with about 20 percent saying it was most important, and more than 90 percent of
these voters liked Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore planned to defy fatigue and jet lag with a wee-hours-of-the-morning
rally at LaGuardia Airport in New York, then fly on to Ohio and finally finish
Wednesday with an evening question-and-answer forum with Los Angeles voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon arriving in New York, a couple hundred cheering fans -- including actor
Billy Baldwin -- waited in the cold to greet the vice president, who thrust
himself into the ropeline, looking much like a boxer in the ring as he shook
hands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've just begun to fight!'' he shouted into a bullhorn before a limousine
whisked him to a Manhattan hotel for an abbreviated night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who taped a new commercial before leaving New Hampshire, was
hitting Connecticut and New York. By the early hours of Thursday, he, too, was
due in California.

<HEADLINE> ABC Takes the Lead for the Season  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A super week put ABC ahead of its rivals for bragging
rights as the season's most-watched television network -- probably for good.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC crushed its competition last week behind Sunday's competitive Super Bowl
game between the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans and another record-setting
performance by "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Bowl telecast was up 7 percent in ratings over the 1999 game,
according to Nielsen Media Research. ABC had worried that a game featuring two
relatively small media markets would show ratings weakness.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Super Bowl, the three most-watched programs of the week were all
showings of "Millionaire." The game show's audience of 35.3 million last Tuesday
was its largest yet.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Academy Awards ahead on ABC and "Millionaire" showing no signs of
weakening, ABC is on target for its first ratings season championship since
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really think it will be pretty difficult ... for another network to make
up that deficit," said Larry Hyams, chief researcher for ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   For the season so far, ABC has averaged 13.7 million viewers in prime-time.
CBS has 12.9 million viewers and NBC has 12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC finished third behind CBS and NBC last year in household ratings. It has
won the season ratings race only four other times: three times in the late 1970s
and in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC had record-setting ratings for two of its other shows last week, thanks
to a little help. "Dharma &AMP; Greg," directly following Tuesday's "Millionaire,"
and "The Practice," on right after the Super Bowl, both had their most popular
episodes.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week, ABC averaged 27.6 million viewers in prime-time last week
(15.6 rating, 25 share), CBS had 11 million viewers (7.6 rating, 12 share), NBC
had 10.5 million viewers (7.4, 12), Fox had 7.9 million viewers (5.3, 8), the WB
had 4.1 million viewers (2.9, 4), UPN had 4.1 million viewers (2.8, 4) and Pax
TV had 1.1 million viewers (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's "World News Tonight" led the evening news competition with 12.6
million viewers (9.0 rating, 17 share). NBC's "Nightly News" had 12.4 million
viewers (9.2 rating, 17 share), and the "CBS Evening News" had 10.2 million
viewers (7.5 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 24-30, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were "Super Bowl XXXIV: Tennessee Titans vs. St. Louis Rams," ABC, 43.3; "Super
Bowl Post Game, Part 1," ABC, 35.9; "Super Bowl Post Game, Part 2," ABC, 25.6;
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 22.0; "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 18.7; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Saturday),
ABC, 15.4; "The Practice," ABC, 15.3; "Dharma &AMP; Greg," ABC, 13.0; "Law and
Order," NBC, 12.6; "NYPD Blue," ABC, 12.2.

<HEADLINE> Road Ahead Hard for Challengers  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The New Hampshire primary gave a big boost to the
presidential campaign of Republican Sen. John McCain and helped keep alive the
Democratic hopes of Bill Bradley. In both cases, the outcome suggested that the
front-runners, George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, will no longer appear
invincible.
</P>
<P>
	   But for fellow insurgents McCain and Bradley, the road ahead through the
contests of the next five weeks will be a mad and uphill scramble for votes.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's commanding 49 percent to 31 percent win over Bush in the
first-in-the-nation primary gave him the make-or-break victory he had gambled
for in campaigning nearly nonstop in New Hampshire since last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   His strategy now is to try to channel that momentum into essential victories
in GOP primaries in South Carolina on Feb. 19 and in his home state of Arizona
on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   While McCain hoped his record as a war hero would help him in
military-minded South Carolina, recent polls have shown Bush ahead. Furthermore,
McCain has generated considerable opposition in his own state and polls showed a
tight race there
</P>
<P>
	   And McCain has ignored Delaware's GOP primary on Feb. 8, leaving it
primarily to Bush and publisher Steve Forbes, who won there in 1996 but finished
a distant third in New Hampshire, with 13 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   As to Forbes' future, ``We don't know what's ahead,'' said spokesman Greg
Mueller.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was able to claim his second victory in a row in New Hampshire, after
last week's 2-to-1 win in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   But his relatively narrow margin -- 52 percent to Bradley's 47 percent --
gave Bradley justification to stay in the race, at least through the March 7
primaries involving some of the biggest states, including California and New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're eager to continue the fight,'' the former New Jersey senator and
former New York Knicks basketball star declared.
</P>
<P>
	   California and New York may be Bradley's best shots, but he now trails Gore
in California and the New York race appears to be a dead heat, based on voter
surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bush, there will be a succession of primaries in states with supportive
Republican governors where he appears comfortably ahead, including Michigan on
Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   He conceded defeat Tuesday night but suggested that New Hampshire had often,
notoriously, been ``a bump in the road for front-runners.''
</P>
<P>
	   Well, yes and no.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa Democratic caucus winner Walter Mondale lost to Gary Hart in 1984, but
went on to claim the nomination. And Republican Bob Dole lost in 1996 to Pat
Buchanan but won the nomination. However, both Mondale and Dole lost the general
election.
</P>
<P>
	   President Bush, father of George W., survived a stronger than expected
challenge in New Hampshire in 1992 from Pat Buchanan -- but George Bush's
relatively weak showing in New Hampshire rattled his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   He lost the general election to Bill Clinton, the self-styled ``comeback
kid'' after his own second-place finish in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's camp was jubilant after his strong finish and hoped for a boost
that would close the gaps in some of the polls in the upcoming contests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This propels the McCain candidacy forward,'' said former Sen. Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., a McCain adviser. ``We'll never raise enough money to equal
Bush. But we have enough to be competitive. And now, a lot more people are going
to be contributing to the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   That remains to be seen, of course.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls conducted in New Hampshire showed voters were roughly divided as
to whether issues or personal qualities were most important. McCain was No. 1
and Bush was No. 2 among both groups.
</P>
<P>
	   These polls also showed that independents, permitted to cast ballots in
either primary, accounted for nearly one-third of the vote in each race. The
surveys indicated they overwhelmingly favored anti-establishment candidates
McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Fred Greenstein, a political science professor at Princeton, said McCain's
victory should give him a national boost ``and it should help with fund
raising.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he said, ``It's hard for me to believe that either McCain or Bradley
can pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
	   James Thurber, an American University political scientist, suggested New
Hampshire may have been Bradley's high-water mark, and that if he couldn't win
there he probably can't win anywhere.

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lisa Marie Presley, whose marriage to pop superstar
Michael Jackson ended in divorce, will give married life another try.
</P>
<P>
	   The daughter of Elvis Presley is engaged to rock singer John Oszajea, her

	   Presley, 32, was married to Jackson for two years before they divorced in
1996.

    By TIM WHITMIRE AP Sports Writer No. 14 Kentucky 81, No. 6 Tennessee 68
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Once upon a time -- say, seven weeks ago -- Kentucky
was 4-4 and unranked for the first time in nine years.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Tubby Smith doesn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's too long ago for me," Smith said Tuesday night, after his
14th-ranked Wildcats once again took over first place in the Southeastern
Conference with an 81-68 victory over No. 6 Tennessee. "That's too long and too
far back. We're in conference play now, and we're much older."
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Bogans is one of the Wildcats (16-5, 6-1) who has grown up fast.
</P>
<P>
	   The freshman guard notched a career-high 25 points against the Volunteers
(18-3, 6-2), scoring 16 of Kentucky's first 23 points. Bogans made four
3-pointers and added two steals and two assists in the best game of his brief
college career.
</P>
<P>
	   "It felt good," Bogans said. "It felt like I couldn't miss, so I kept
shooting. That's what a guy dreams of, that every shot he shoots is falling."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games involving ranked teams Tuesday, No. 8 Michigan State beat
Michigan 82-62 and No. 21 Temple defeated Massachusetts 75-48.
</P>
<P>
	   In winning 11 of 12 going into the Tennessee game, the Wildcats had depended
largely on consistent scoring from center Jamaal Magloire, who had reached
double figures in 15 straight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Magloire's matchup with Tennessee center C.J. Black -- who labeled
him a "dirty player" in the preseason -- was the focus of pregame attention,
neither big man was much of a factor Tuesday. Each had to sit long stretches
because of foul trouble, and each finished with just two points.
</P>
<P>
	   With Bogans stepping up, Tayshaun Prince scoring 17 and grabbing six
rebounds and point guard Saul Smith contributing 12 points, six rebounds and
five assists, Kentucky didn't need Magloire.
</P>
<P>
	   "All our guys are growing, maturing, they're feeling more comfortable with
each other," Tubby Smith said. "(Bogans) was open because of the other players
doing other things for him to get his shots."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a real confidence-booster," Bogans said. "We know we can't just
depend on Jamaal. We all have to play our role."
</P>
<P>
	   Vincent Yarbrough scored 17 points and Tony Harris added 16 for Tennessee,
while Isiah Victor had 12 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel they had a little more emotion tonight," Yarbrough said. "We beat
this team twice last year. That is incentive, so they were ready."
</P>
<P>
	   "Our spirit is going to be fine," Tennessee coach Jerry Green said. "This is
a setback, but we understand Kentucky played a fine game tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   With the win, Kentucky took over first place in the SEC East and snapped
Tennessee's six-game conference road winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky has won 15 straight games at Rupp Arena, dating to last season's
47-46 loss to the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogans' big first half helped the Wildcats take a 36-31 halftime lead. In
the second half, Tennessee scrapped to stay in the game, getting within 58-54
with 9:46 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Five 3-pointers by Yarbrough and three by Harris helped keep Kentucky from
turning the game into a blowout.
</P>
<P>
	   Prince, however, scored 14 points in the second half, including two
3-pointers. One of those effectively locked the game away, 74-63, with 3:59
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tayshaun came through in the late game and led us through," Tubby Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The game ended with SEC statistics turned upside-down. The league's worst
3-point shooting team, Kentucky, went 10-of-21 from beyond the arc, while the
top long distance team, Tennessee, went just 10-of-27.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats, who were outrebounded in both losses to Tennessee last season,
held a clear advantage on the boards, 40-33.
</P>
<P>
	   And they got an assist from a raucous Rupp Arena crowd, which chanted
"over-rated" as the clock ran down on the Kentucky win.
</P>
<P>
	   Morris Peterson had 32 points and 10 rebounds to lead the visiting Spartans
(16-5, 7-1 Big Ten) to their fourth straight win. Freshman LaVell Blanchard had
16 points for the Wolverines (12-6, 3-4), who lost their third straight. They
found out just before warmups that freshman and leading scorer Jamal Crawford
that the NCAA was investigating his living arrangements before enrolling at
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Karcher scored 17 points for the Owls (15-4, 8-1 Atlantic 10), who came
into the game No. 1 in the nation in defense at 53.5 points per game. Monty Mack
had 14 points for the Minutemen (11-9, 5-3), who were held to their lowest
output of the season and suffered their worst loss in the Mullins Center, which
opened in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Supermodel Walks Away From Catwalks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- British supermodel Naomi Campbell is walking away
from the catwalks in New York and London.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find it really stressful," Campbell, 29, said today in Sydney, where she
launched her signature perfume.
</P>
<P>
	   "Doing 16 shows and then having to do fittings and dress rehearsals," she
said. "I'm not saying poor me, I just find it very stressful and I want to chill
out a bit more, so maybe it's about doing less."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she is undecided on whether to continue strutting the runways of
Milan. She said she held back from the couture shows in Paris recently and was
reassessing her workload.
</P>
<P>

world, I think I'll just pick one out of each country," she said. "I'm
definitely not doing New York and definitely not doing London (but) Milan --
I'll wait to see what happens."

<HEADLINE> McCain Takes Votes From Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Romping across New Hampshire, John McCain won among men
and women, young and old, rich, poor and middle-class. He even won among
registered Republicans, beating a front-runner, George W. Bush, who came into
the nation's first presidential primary with the backing of the GOP
establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Independents played a key role in both the Democratic and Republican
primaries, making up about 30 percent of voters in each contest Tuesday. And
both McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley won decisively with voters who were not
tied to either party.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain also won among registered Republicans, taking 43 percent of the
votes to 37 percent for Bush, according to exit polls of voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, by contrast, clearly lost registered Democrats to the party's
favorite, Vice President Al Gore, who eked out victory in the nation's leadoff
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   On virtually every issue -- from moral values to Social Security to world
affairs -- Republican voters preferred McCain. Sixty-three percent of them said
he says what he really believes and not just what people want to hear. Just 31
percent said the same of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain is more of a straight talker,'' said Lisa Schechtman, 38, a
registered Republican from Manchester who voted for the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's his moxie and no-nonsense attitude,'' agreed Mike Kania, 47, also a
Manchester Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what quality mattered most in a candidate, Republicans were most
likely to say standing up for beliefs, and those voters overwhelmingly picked
McCain. And while Bush is campaigning as a ``compassionate conservative,''
McCain took 56 percent of votes among those who said it was most important to
care ``about the average American.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also did well on his defining issues. Most Republican voters said
campaign finance reform was a good idea, and they backed McCain. More than six
in 10 Republicans said McCain's military experience was important, and he took
most of those votes too.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Bush found less support in his strongest points. Asked who was
more likely to beat a Democrat this fall, voters were divided between McCain and
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Bush has campaigned on his plan for a large tax cut, GOP voters
were split as to whether it was more important to cut taxes or strengthen Social
Security. McCain and Bush evenly shared those who favored tax cuts, but McCain
soared among those worried about the retirement program, beating Bush by some 40
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   There was more bad news for the Texas governor. One-third of Republican
voters said he does not have the knowledge needed to serve effectively as
president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My impression was that he was a lot of window dressing and not much
depth,'' said McCain voter Charles Baron, 51.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Gore enjoyed the benefits of an incumbent, taking a
solid majority of the many voters who are feeling good about the economy's
future and their personal finances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the economy to continue in the same direction it's been,'' said
Richard St. Hilaire, 70, of Manchester, who voted for Gore. ``Clinton and his
administration have done a lot of bad things, but Clinton's done a good job with
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also got a big push from the unions he assiduously courted. While
Bradley and Gore split votes of non-union households, the vice president took
twice as many of the union votes -- a good sign for the vice president as the
race moves to states where unions are more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
	   More good news for Gore: Two in three Democratic voters say he has a better
chance of winning in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was hurt by several factors. His campaign has been distracted with
news of his irregular heart beat, and one in five Democratic voters said they
were concerned that his health would interfere with his ability to serve as
president. Those voters preferred Gore overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley made health care reform the centerpiece of his campaign, but
Democrats marginally preferred the Gore health plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, those who thought health care was the single most important issue
preferred Bradley to Gore. But an equal number of Democratic voters cared most
about education, and they preferred Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did do well in the closing days of the New Hampshire campaign.
Fifty-five percent of those who made up their minds in the last week picked
Bradley, compared with 44 percent for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   To some extent, Bradley and McCain were going after the same pool of
independent voters, but there's no evidence that McCain's strong showing hurt
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The exit polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press and the television networks. VNS surveyed 2,240 voters in the
GOP primary and 1,711 voters in the Democratic primary as they came out of
precincts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the
overall Democratic sample and 2.5 percentage points for Republicans, larger for
subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Study: Lyme Disease Treatments OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Patients who receive conventional treatment for Lyme disease
have not reported more long-term health problems than those who never had the
disease, a study has found.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings should reassure patients and physicians that the prognosis for
most of those with the disease who receive conventional treatment is excellent,
said Dr. Elyse Seltzer, lead author of the study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The study by Yale University researchers and a team of Connecticut doctors
observed 678 patients for up to 11 years, the largest long-run study of the
effects of the disease. It focused on cases reported to Connecticut health
officials from 1984 through 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   While 69 percent of the patients reported an increased frequency of symptoms
such as joint pain, fatigue and headaches, most patients attributed the
increased symptoms to aging or other illness, such as a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   The frequency of symptoms was similar to a control group of people not
diagnosed with the disease, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyme disease is carried by tiny ticks that live in wooded and grassy areas,
most notably in the Northeast and upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Early symptoms include a rash, swollen glands, achiness, fatigue and fevers.
Later, severe arthritis and facial paralysis may develop. Left untreated, heart
and nervous system damage may occur.
</P>
<P>
	   It can be hard to diagnose, especially since the characteristic bull's-eye
rash around an infected tick bite is absent in about one-third of cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Optimal treatment is a four-week course of antibiotics prescribed within the
first month of the bite, said David Ward, executive director of the American
Lyme Disease Foundation, a nonprofit educational and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers finding's underscore the need for early diagnosis and
treatment, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration approved the world's first Lyme disease
vaccine in late 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 9.61; Nasdaq Up17.89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened narrowly mixed today as investors expected
the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates only modestly at its meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 9.61 at 11,031.44.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.32 at 1,412.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 17.89 at
4,069.87.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that interest rates are headed sharply higher have roiled the market
recently, sending most stocks tumbling last week. On Monday and Tuesday,
however, stocks rebounded as investors proved unwilling to get out of the market
that has rewarded them so richly in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, trading was fairly volatile, suggesting investors remain wary of the
Fed's decision, expected to be announced at 2:15 p.m. EST. Most analysts expect
the Fed to raise rates by a quarter-percentage point, although some believe an
increase of a half-percentage point would be no surprise as the Fed works to
slow the pace of U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid
to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, General Motors rose 1/4 to 85 1/2 after the company named president
and chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner as chief executive officer,
preparing GM for the retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Discount broker Charles Schwab fell 7/16 to 35 3/16 after the company said
it would reduce fees for its most active online trading customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 133.04 million shares, well ahead of
Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.21 to 505.96.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.8 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was up 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Presidential hopeful makes stops in Hartford  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A day after narrowly losing the New Hampshire
primary, Bill Bradley promised a full-court press against Al Gore in the race
for the Democratic nomination for president.
<P>
	   "The ball is bouncing on," Bradley said, bouncing a basketball on the podium
as he addressed a crowd of supporters today at Trinity College. "The warm-ups
are over. The national campaign has begun. We have five weeks to get our message
across the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut and the remaining New England states hold their primaries March
7, along with delegate-rich California, Ohio and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his loss Tuesday night, the former New Jersey senator said the close
result reinvigorated his campaign. Gore received just 6 percent more votes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Last night in New Hampshire, people sent a powerful message that they want
new politics," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his new politics include campaign finance reform, restoring the
public's trust in the government and fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   He touched on the latter issue in an appearance earlier in the day at a
Hartford nursing home. Addressing about 50 union members who walked a picket
line outside Avery Heights, Bradley spoke out in support of better wages,
benefits and training.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe your fight is just," he called out through a megaphone. "The
lowest-paid workers in America are the people who take care of our children and
the elderly."
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Chernoff, a spokeswoman for New England Health Care Employees Union,
District 1199, said Bradley's appearance will give the union's cause more
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   "On the issues of workers rights both Gore and Bradley feel strongly. We may
be hearing from Gore on the issue," said Chernoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaka Tafari, a striking worker, said Bradley's appearance made him walk the
picket line on his birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is welcome visit," he said. "We need to shake up the establishment."
</P>
<P>
	   Last month District 1199, the state's largest union of health care workers,
had agreed to end the strike at Avery Heights in response to an offer from
management the union had rejected two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal allowed workers to return, but only to positions that had not been
filled by permanent replacements, and at the same wages and benefits they had
when they went on strike Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Avery Heights had hired more than 100 permanent replacements for the 180
nurse's aides, food service workers and housekeepers on the picket line.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said they would continue to picket until every striker
returned to work.

<HEADLINE> Woman Wasn't Told of Bad Reaction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A woman who volunteered for a gene-therapy experiment
at the University of Pennsylvania says she found out she briefly had a bad
reaction to the test only after another participant died.
</P>
<P>
	   Dolores Aderman, 36, Patient No. 11 in the tests of a treatment for
ornithine transcarbamylase, a liver deficiency, told The Philadelphia Inquirer
she was never told that enzymes believed to indicate liver injury had shown up
in her body, and that the concentration of those enzymes was high enough that
the experimenters reported them to the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Three patients who followed Aderman in the experiment also experienced liver
toxicity, The Inquirer reported today, and the FDA criticized the university for
not reporting two of the "adverse events" promptly.
</P>
<P>
	   Jesse Gelsinger, Patient No. 19 in the experiment, died in September after
having a severe reaction. The FDA has stopped all trials at Penn's Institute for
Human Gene Therapy, saying there were not adequate systems to protect patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Aderman, who participated in the experiment in June 1998, said she knew
nothing about her liver reaction until she pieced it together from news accounts
of FDA reports in December. Her enzyme levels had returned to normal by time she
left the hospital following the tests, the Inquirer reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "The patient has the right to know everything going on," she said. "It's my
body. It's not your body. I lent them my body."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Penn did not return telephone calls for comment, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aderman, who volunteered for the project because her son, Michael, died from
ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, said she still believes in helping
medical research to find cures for this and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I ask for is a little respect, a little common courtesy, and the
truth," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, patients in clinical trials have the right to request
adverse-event reports emerging from the research, according to an FDA
spokesperson, and consent forms are supposed to spell out all possible risks and
complications.
</P>
<P>
	   Aderman did not suffer from the disease, but Michael and her other two sons
inherited it from her. In OTC deficiency, the liver is unable to process
ammonia, a natural byproduct of the body's metabolism.

<HEADLINE> Special election for state Assembly seat is too close to call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. (AP) - A special election to fill the vacant 129th
District state Assembly seat was too close to call, with Democrat Samuel Casella
leading Republican Brian Kolb by just 14 votes.
<P>
	   With all precincts reporting Tuesday, Casella had 8,163 votes or 49.3
percent and Kolb had 8,149 or 49.2 percent. Right-to-Life candidate Edward
Tracey had the remaining 1.5 percent with 252 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The race will be determined by absentee ballots, which could take up to a
week to count.
</P>
<P>
	   The seat was left vacant when Republican incumbent Craig Doran was elected
in November to a judgeship in Ontario County. The district, in which Republicans
hold a better than 3-2 enrollment advantage over Democrats, covers all of
Livingston and Yates counties and part of Ontario County.
</P>
<P>
	   Kolb, 47, is a business executive from Canandaigua. He has served as
president and chief operating officer of Refraction Technologies Corp. since
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Casella, 46, is a Canandaigua farmer who unsuccessfully ran against Doran
for the Assembly seat in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   In the two weeks before the election, the state Assembly's Democratic
majority began pumping money into the race, allowing Casella to launch
television advertising promoting himself. Kolb answered with ads warning voters
against "Casella and New York City liberals."
</P>
<P>
	   The winner of the race will face voters again in November, when the seat's
current term expires.

<HEADLINE> Opening statements in Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The prosecutor in the Amadou Diallo case opened the
trial this morning by telling jurors that the four cops accused of murdering the
unarmed African immigrant made "a conscious decision" to shoot without any
justification.
<P>
	   But defense attorneys painted a far different picture of police confronted
with a suspicious man who failed to stop on their command and appeared to be
holding a dark object. They thought it was a gun; it turned out to be his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the 1990s, in Bronx County, in Albany County or anywhere else, a human
being should have been able to stand in the vestibule of his own home and not be
shot to death," said Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner. "Especially when
those doing the shooting are police officers sworn to protect innocent people."
</P>
<P>
	   He added: "We do not believe that these four defendants came on duty that
night with the intent to kill Amadou Diallo or anybody else. But when they got
out of the car in front of Amadou Diallo's home in the early morning of Feb. 4,
1999, they made the conscious decision to shoot him."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner said the officers "acted recklessly and with depraved indifference to
Amadou Diallo's life. ... For that, they are guilty of murder."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and
Richard Murphy, 27, are on trial in Albany, 150 miles away from the shooting
scene, and almost exactly a year after it took place.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett Epstein, the lawyer for Carroll, told jurors that an hour before the
shooting, the officers stopped another man nearby. "They required him to
identify himself, which he did," Epstein said. "Turned out they had the wrong
person, they apologized to him, he walked away."
</P>
<P>
	   The same thing did not happen to Diallo because although "the officers
identified themselves with their shields out, as they are trained to, Mr. Diallo
doesn't listen to their orders to stop, which they are trained to give," Epstein
said. "More orders to stop and to show his hands - again Mr. Diallo does not
comply."
</P>
<P>
	   Epstein said Diallo - who had caught the officers' eye by repeatedly peering
out of his building, then going back inside - first turned away from them, then
turned back holding a dark object.
</P>
<P>
	   Epstein and the other defense attorneys said one officer shouted "Gun!" and
another fell back, leading all of them to believe Diallo was armed. The dark
object was later determined to be his wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   But the account differed sharply from the prosecutor's, who had insisted
that the officers did "not yell out any commands like stop, don't move."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Stephen Worth, who represents McMellon, told the jurors to
focus on the "total absence of any motive in this case other than self-defense.
... They felt themselves in immediate danger of being shot."
</P>
<P>
	   Worth also asserted that the officers - all white - were only on trial
"because there was a furor created by people who have their own agendas," an
allusion to activists who say the case exemplifies racism and police brutality.
Diallo was black.
</P>
<P>
	   Worth said the notion that the officers behaved in a racist fashion is
false. "Today as we begin this case, that lie begins to die," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he acknowledged: "Amadou Diallo did not deserve to die. ... There is no
doubt it is a tragedy."
</P>
<P>
	   Opening statements were completed in about an hour and the first witness, a
police investigator, was called before noon.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers - who plan to testify in their own defense before the jury of
six men and six women - have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder and
reckless endangerment charges in the slaying of Diallo. If convicted, they face
a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were part of a plainclothes unit trying to catch violent
criminals in the Bronx when, shortly after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999, they
approached Diallo in the vestibule of his apartment building. They claim they
fired a total of 41 bullets from their rapid-fire pistols only after the
22-year-old street vendor made a sudden move as though to reach for a gun; 19
shots hit him.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying of Diallo has been cited by critics of the New York Police
Department as a glaring example of police brutality toward minorities. It
triggered a wave of pretrial publicity and civil unrest, and prompted an appeals
court to rule the officers could not get a fair trial in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was moved to Albany, where State Supreme Court Justice Joseph
Teresi decided the trial could be televised. Testimony is expected to last about
a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury, which includes four black women, was picked in just two days. It
includes a middle school teacher, a Korean War veteran and the wife of a former
FBI agent. Three jurors said they have family or other ties to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Prospective jurors are not required to provide their ethnic backgrounds to
the court; their names weren't released.
</P>
<P>
	   According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was
about 39 percent, compared with an 89 percent white population in Albany County.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 22.65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved moderately higher today as investors expected
the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates only modestly at its meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
22.65 at 11,063.70.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 1.96 at 1,411.24, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 31.06 at 4,083.04.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that interest rates are headed sharply higher have roiled the market
recently, sending most stocks tumbling last week. On Monday and Tuesday,
however, stocks rebounded as investors proved unwilling to get out of the market
that has rewarded them so richly the past several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, trading was fairly volatile, suggesting investors remain wary of the
Fed's decision, expected to be announced at 2:15 p.m. EST. Most analysts expect
the Fed to raise rates by a quarter-percentage point, although some believe an
increase of a half-percentage point would be no surprise as the Fed works to
slow the pace of U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors will also be closely attuned to the statement the Fed releases
with its decision, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "For today, the important part of the announcement probably won't be the
amount of the rate hike, because the markets will be looking for hints about
future rate increases and the temperament of the Fed," said Paul Cherney, market
analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid
to keep inflation under control, and has suggested it will continue raising
rates until it sees tangible evidence of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, General Motors fell 1 7/8 to 83 3/8 after the company named president
and chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner as chief executive officer,
preparing GM for the retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Discount broker Charles Schwab fell 1 3/8 to 34 1/4 after the company said
it would reduce fees for its most active online trading customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 308.61 million shares, well ahead of
Tuesday's pace.

<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -A man used a shotgun to kill his wife's friend
while the family's three children slept upstairs, police said.
<P>
	   Police said the killing appeared to have stemmed from a complicated domestic
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   "The domestic situation involved these three people. Other than that I'm not
going to comment any further on how the relationship was set up," Sgt. Joseph F.
Sweeny said today.
</P>

	   When police arrived at the home and on the city's west side at 11:17 p.m.
Tuesday, they found Carol Lozott, 35, of Solvay dead from a fatal shotgun blast,
Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hours later, relatives of Ralph Kazmirski, 30, contacted police and
arranged for Kazmirski to surrender. He was charged with second-degree murder
and scheduled for arraignment today.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was witnessed by the estranged wife of Kazmirski, Jolan
Kazmirski. She told police her husband entered the home, got into an argument
and shot her friend Lozott at close range in the chest before fleeing in his
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Jolan Kazmirski's children - aged 6, 10 and 14 years - were upstairs at the
time of the shooting, but were not harmed. Ralph Kazmirski is the father of two

<HEADLINE> US Investigates Banned Beef Hormone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal officials said today they are conducting a
criminal investigation into the shipment of American beef to Switzerland last
year that contained the illegal hormone known as DES.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss government notified the United States last July that the banned
carcinogen, diethylstilbestrol, had been found in two samples of U.S. beef that
was supposed to be free of hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service have been conducting a joint investigation of the
matter, but have turned up no evidence that the shipment was anything but an
aberration, said Carol Blake, a spokeswoman for the USDA agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department stopped testing beef for DES in 1991 after
failing to find the compound for several years, but had already planned before
the Swiss discovery to resume testing for it, Blake said. The department will
start the testing as equipment is upgraded and employees are trained.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wall Street Journal reported today that the Swiss barred two U.S.
exporters after the discovery: Farmland National Beef Packing Co. and Bruss Co.,
a subsidiary of IBP Inc. IBP and Farmland are two of the nation's biggest beef
processors.
</P>
<P>
	   One tainted sample was traced back to Chicago-based Bruss and then to a
Farmland National Beef plant in Liberal, Kan., said Sherlyn Manson, a
spokeswoman for Farmland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We agree with USDA that it would be an aberration,'' she said. ``We would
find it highly unusual if anybody in the cattle business was using DES. It's
been off the market for 20 years.''

<HEADLINE> TV Celebrates Black History Month  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Clip after clip in "It's Black Entertainment" reminds us
of the joyful depth of black contributions to movies, music and dance, but the
celebration is bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the focus is on Billie Holliday or Bessie Smith or Nat King Cole or
many other of the artists featured in the Showtime documentary, the pernicious
effect of racism on lives and careers looms unmistakably.
</P>
<P>
	   Lena Horne was boxed into stand-alone movie musical numbers that could be
cut for Southern screenings. Dorothy Dandridge found an Academy Award nomination
meant nothing to a black actress' career and died young from a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the buoyant Little Richard can't resist railing against the white
musicians he says soared higher than he was allowed on the same melodies.
</P>
<P>
	   The film is one of a clutch of television movies and documentaries marking
Black History Month and reflecting a broad commitment to the theme -- even if
it's a hyperbolic one limited to one month.
</P>
<P>
	   The same mixed feelings evoked by "It's Black Entertainment" accrue to this
February bounty; so much to honor and enjoy, such scant serious attention
otherwise paid to blacks and, even more so, other minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   (Besides Ricky Martin and Elian Gonzalez, good luck finding Hispanics on TV
outside of Spanish-language stations.)
</P>
<P>
	   Here are some of the notable Black History Month shows (all times listed
EST), most of them on cable channels and with Showtime a leader. The broadcast
networks, meanwhile, are focused on the giddy February sweeps.
</P>
<P>
	   Just another history lesson.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak rejects builder's call for delay of high-speed train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A request by the builder of the 150-mile-an-hour
Acela Express trains on the Northeast Corridor to delay the trains' introduction
has been denied by Amtrak, which instead is proposing ways to speed up tests on
the new service.
<P>
	   The consortium building the trains - Canada's Bombardier Transportation and
France's Alstom Ltd. - had said service between Boston and Washington would
begin by Christmas, but pushed back the first run until spring after wheel-wear
problems were found in tests in August at the Colorado test site.
</P>
<P>
	   The consortium last week asked to delay the first train until mid-July, the
company has rejected that idea, Richard R. Sarles, Amtrak's vice president for
high-speed rail, said Tuesday. The Amtrak board "took great exception" to the
request and "told them to come back with a better schedule," Sarles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Amtrak is now proposing that more people be added to allow more
than one test at a time, as is now being done. The company has also agreed to
add a second window - between morning and evening rush hours - for test runs on
the busy Northeast Corridor, which Amtrak administers from Philadelphia. The
test train now runs only late at night, Sarles said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Launching the new service this spring ... and having all 20 trains in
service by year's end, is still very much our goal," Sarles said. He said the
consortium had promised a response to Amtrak's suggestions by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the consortium could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Three trains have been delivered for testing and a fourth is due this month,
with others in various stages of construction. The first train is undergoing a
20,000-mile endurance run in Colorado, the second is making nightly test runs
out of Philadelphia, and the third is undergoing systems testing at a shop near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Sarles said the wheel-wear problem has been fixed by reshaping the wheels to
conform to the shape of U.S. track. Initially, the trains used wheels designed
for French high-speed trains.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 days ago, technicians discovered a new problem - sideways movement,
or yaw, of the wheels at very high speeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Sarles said engineers often find such problems during tests and fix them
with minor design changes. So far, he said, the tests have uncovered no
fundamental design problems or safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   The new trains will replace Amtrak's aging premium-class Metroliners between
Boston and Washington, through New York and Philadelphia. On Monday, two new
daily trains called Acela Regionals began running between Boston and Washington
with features developed for the high-speed Acela Express trains.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Protesters Lose in Senate  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted today to prevent people found to have
violated laws protecting abortion clinics from escaping fines or civil judgments
against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans abandoned their vigorous opposition to the Democratic proposal
after Democrats summoned Vice President Al Gore from the presidential campaign
trail to break a possible tie vote. But the 80-17 roll call denied Gore a chance
to vote on the measure as president of the Senate, as well as a needed
opportunity to reaffirm is pro-choice credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, opposing Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has questioned Gore's commitment to protecting women's right to
choose abortion, citing Gore's votes on abortion measures as a House member
nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this amendment, nobody will be able to politically demagogue this
issue,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said shortly before the vote.
</P>

hourly minimum over three years was insufficient. In addition, the White House

proposed by the GOP that are tied to the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made, Daschle told reporters, ``I'm concerned that the
bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Status Urged for China  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today urged Congress to give
up its politically charged annual review of trade benefits for China and instead
grant Beijing normal, permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
	   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said that giving China permanent
trade relations would ``get us out of the cycle we are now in, where the future
of Chinese trade comes up every single year for a divisive and not very
effective vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle and a determined
campaign by organized labor and environmental groups, President Clinton faces a
tough sell in persuading Congress to grant permanent trade benefits to China.
The election year heightens political pressures, as well, prompting Clinton and
his allies to push for a vote as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Permanent trade benefits are part of the trade-opening agreement negotiated
by China and the United States as the price for China's entry into the
135-nation World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for global commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The annual China trade vote has not been an effective instrument,'' Berger
said. ``It simply has affirmed our trading relationship with China for 20 years
in a row now.'' Each year, the vote has been caught up in emotional arguments
about China's human rights abuses and its huge trade surpluses with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger was to present the administration's case in a speech to the Woodrow
Wilson Center, a foreign policy group. An advance text of his remarks was
released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the trade-opening agreement will dramatically reduce Chinese tariffs
on everything from agricultural and industrial products to computers and
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Denying China (permanent trade status) would deprive American companies
and workers of the full benefits of China's concessions -- the favorable market
access and dispute settlement that our European, Japanese and other competitors
will have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger said that bringing China into the WTO ``will obligate China to deepen
its market reforms and open its economy to the world. It will increase the pace
of change in China.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said China's leaders understand that economic change is ``both essential
and risky.'' It is risky because opening China's protected markets to global
competition could cause more short-term unemployment and social unrest, Berger
said. But he said the leaders also understand that China cannot advance without
world-class industries and products that can compete in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, Berger said the WTO agreement ``will help bring the information
revolution to cities and towns across China'' -- making people more aware of
alternative ways of life and prompting them to seek a stronger voice in shaping
their destiny.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, just last week, Beijing announced that it was cracking down on
the Internet,'' Berger said. ``It's outrageous. But it's also futile. In this
information age, cracking down on the Internet is like King Canute trying to
still the waters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Indeed, the fact that the Chinese government is pushing back against the
increasing flow of information to the Chinese people only proves that the
changes China is undergoing are real and threatening to the status quo,'' Berger
said. ``This kind of repression is not an argument for slowing down the effort
to bring China into the world. It's an argument for accelerating it.''

<HEADLINE> Le Cirque 2000 Is Tres Chic  </HEADLINE>
    By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Le Cirque 2000 is arguably Manhattan's favorite dining room
of the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were sold out from the first day with famous names," said Sirio
Maccioni, an Italian restaurateur who opened the celebrated French restaurant Le
Cirque in 1974 in the Mayfair Hotel on the Upper East Side. "We weren't really
prepared, but the rest is history. We were the first 'place to be seen' that
also had good food."
</P>
<P>
	   With an eye toward the 21st century, he shut the restaurant's doors in 1996
and moved to the New York Palace Hotel in midtown Manhattan. The restaurant
reopened as Le Cirque 2000 in the landmark Villard Houses in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is New York, we have to change with the times," Maccioni explained.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "I know what good food is, and I know how to personalize it."
</P>
<P>
	   To emphasize its lighthearted circus theme, Le Cirque 2000 features a monkey
statue in the main entrance. The interior is filled with brightly colored neon
light sculptures.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Kissinger, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Bill Cosby, Sophia Loren and
Barbara Walters are among the 100 celebrities who are depicted in a portrait
that hangs in the restaurant's entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Le Cirque used to be filled with 'the ladies who lunch.' But they don't
like to be called that anymore. So now we have 'the women who talk charity over
lunch,"' Maccioni said.
</P>
<P>
	   Catering to the ladies is a smart business decision, he said. "If a
beautiful lady wants to go to a restaurant and she likes it, she'll bring her
husband, her friends, her lovers."
</P>
<P>
	   The 68-year-old Maccioni has been described in "America's Elite 1000: The
Ultimate List" (Cadogan Publications, $90) as "a global status symbol on a par
with Belgian chocolate and Italian motorcars."
</P>
<P>
	   "I consider myself a working restaurateur, but I'm proud to be called
elite," Maccioni responded. "I encourage all my people to be elite; be an elite
dishwasher. Being elite means being the best."
</P>
<P>
	   Manhattan's most celebrated and powerful residents dine on lobster salad,
consomme with foie gras, ravioli and roasted rack of lamb. Lunch is served
Monday through Saturday; dinner is served seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
	   A prix fixe lunch is available for $42. On the dinner menu, prices range
from a lobster risotto appetizer for $25 to striped bass served with caviar and
lemon sauce for $36. Black Angus steak, spit-roasted pigeon and Dover sole are
among the items available from the grill, with prices ranging from $28 to $39.
</P>
<P>
	   The restaurant has received a four-star rating from The New York Times and
has been recognized by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as being one of the city's most
glamorous and hospitable restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a restaurant that must be seen and experienced to be believed,"
said Fodor's "City Guide New York," adding: "Order the creme brulee for dessert
and you'll leave happy."
</P>
<P>
	   Maccioni, born and raised in Italy, was forced to go to work after his
father was killed during World War II. He worked in hotels and restaurants in
France, Switzerland and Germany before moving to the United States in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't do this out of inspiration or desperation. I realized very early
that I couldn't afford to be young," he said. "I did completely give my life to
this business. Is it worth it? Maybe not. But I had no choice, and I've never
felt exploited."
</P>
<P>
	   He attended Hunter College during the day. At night, he worked at The
Colony, one of New York's trendiest restaurants, where Frank Sinatra, the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor, and Aristotle Onassis frequently dined. After a few
years, he moved to a club at the Pierre Hotel before opening Le Cirque.
</P>
<P>
	   His sons now run Osteria del Circo on 55th Street and Le Cirque and Circo in
the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   "My three sons were born in New York. I've worked hard to give them a good
life, but they're all selling soup for me," Maccioni said. "I wanted them to be
a lawyer, a doctor and an architect."

<HEADLINE> Abortion Protesters Lose in Senate  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted today to prevent people found to have
violated laws protecting abortion clinics from escaping fines or civil judgments
against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans abandoned their vigorous opposition to the Democratic proposal
after Democrats summoned Vice President Al Gore from the presidential campaign
trail to break a possible tie vote. But the 80-17 roll call denied Gore a chance
to vote on the measure as president of the Senate, as well as a needed
opportunity to reaffirm is pro-choice credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, opposing Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has questioned Gore's commitment to protecting women's right to
choose abortion, citing Gore's votes on abortion measures as a House member
nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this amendment, nobody will be able to politically demagogue this
issue,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said shortly before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, called Gore's rush back to Washington
``theater'' -- adding, ``the vice president's going to need it'' to win election
in November.

women. ... We cannot allow violent extremists to use the bankruptcy code to
carry out'' their agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This issue is so important, I'm not going to take a chance of seeing it
fail,'' Gore said just prior to the vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   The amendment's sponsor, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., cited the case of
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who filed for bankruptcy court
protection in November 1998, blaming heavy debts owed to women's groups and
abortion clinics that have sued him.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes $2B Web Package  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning that failure to bridge the ``digital divide''
between the rich and poor could exacerbate inequality in America, President
Clinton on Wednesday offered a $2 billion package to expand access to computers
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be tragic if this instrument that has done more to break down
barriers between people than anything in all human history built a new wall
because not everybody had access to it,'' Clinton told students, educators and
high-tech executives gathered in the gymnasium of Ballou High School.
</P>
<P>
	   After a tour of the school's computer lab with America Online CEO Steve
Case, the president outlined his plan for $2 billion in tax incentives over 10
years, as well as $380 million in expanded federal grants, to encourage the
private sector to donate computers, sponsor community technology centers and
train workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our big goal,'' he said, ``should be to make connection to the Internet as
common as connection to telephones is today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, Clinton set a goal of connecting all Americans to the
Internet, not just classrooms and libraries. ``We should start by making sure
that every community has a technology center that serves not just young people,
but adults as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would will lead a group of high-tech CEOs on a
trip to impoverished areas in April as part of his ``New Markets'' initiative to
direct investment to areas that haven't shared in the nation's good economic
times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now at a time when our country has the longest economic expansion in
history,'' Clinton said, ``we must close the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
	   The package included a request for $10 million to prepare American Indians
for careers in information technology and other technical fields. Members of the
Oglala Sioux nation beseeched Clinton to boost job prospects in their community
during a stop at South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation on his first New Markets
tour last year.
</P>
<P>
	   A Commerce Department report in July found that black and Hispanic
households are only 40 percent as likely to have Internet access as white
families.
</P>
<P>
	   And households with incomes of $75,000 and above in urban areas are more
than 20 times as likely to have Internet access as households at the lowest
income levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Case, whose company and private foundation already are working with schools,
private groups and government to widen access to computers, joined Clinton at
Ballou and warned that ``too many people are being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Case noted that there always have been a gap between the haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real question that we face today is whether the Internet is going to
widen that gap or close it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says more than 50 percent of America's schools and over
80 percent of its classrooms are wired for the Internet. The goal is to have all
schools connected by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the plan Clinton was unveiling Wednesday include:
</P>
<P>
	   --$150 million for training new teachers how to use new technologies.
</P>
<P>
	   --$100 million to create 1,000 Community Technology Centers in low-income
urban and rural neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   --$50 million for a pilot program to expand home access to computers and the
Internet for low-income families.

<HEADLINE> Siberia Supermodel's Unique Journey  </HEADLINE>
    By LISI de BOURBON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- She's strutted down countless runways wearing clothes
created by the world's most famous designers and has graced the pages of
Harper's Bazaar and Vogue magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Irina Pantaeva, who says she is still in her 20s, has achieved much, despite
a difficult upbringing in communist Siberia and subsequent career struggles.
</P>
<P>
	   She has modeled for Anna Sui, Betsey Johnson and Vivienne Westwood. She has
appeared on NBC's "Third Rock From the Sun." Her film roles include a major role
in the 1997 film "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" and a small part in Woody Allen's
"Celebrity."
</P>
<P>
	   She is also a wife, mother, author and -- most recently -- jewelry designer.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the 5-foot-10-inch, 120-pound beauty insists she is nothing special.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just a person who is wondering and curious and is discovering life,"
Pantaeva said during an interview in her Manhattan apartment. "These things are
the greatest motivations in my life."
</P>
<P>
	   Her lyrical 1998 memoir "Siberian Dream" recounts how those forces propelled
her journey from a gritty city near the Mongolian border to the fashion capitals
of the world.
</P>
<P>
	   In the book, Pantaeva introduces readers to her nomadic people, the Buryats,
Siberia's largest indigenous population. Ethnic Russians were a majority in her
hometown of Ulan Ude, and Pantaeva was the only Buryat in her class at school.
</P>
<P>
	   Buryats are Eskimos, giving Pantaeva the physical characteristics that would
make her a standout among models. But her exotic features initially did nothing
for her except attract insults when she was growing up. She writes in the book
that a boy once told her that she had "eyes like saucers."
</P>
<P>
	   Her father was a composer; her mother, a tailor. Money was scarce as they
both worked for a theater company and earned less than local factory workers or
clerks. The family lived in a tiny apartment with seven other relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Pantaeva said she learned to be tough and resourceful, qualities that
prepared her for a long string of rejections when she started modeling in the
West.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to break down the walls," she said, cradling a large mug of tea in
her hands. "I was told I was too weird looking, but I kept going because I
wanted to find an answer to 'Why not?"'
</P>
<P>
	   That curiosity and determination fueled her quest for employment as a model
in Paris, where she was constantly turned down for jobs when she first arrived
as a teen-ager. She eventually talked her way into an interview with Karl
Lagerfeld, who hired her on the spot for a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
	   She soon started getting more phone calls for modeling work, allowing her to
send money to her family and save some for herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Pantaeva eventually set her sights on New York City, moved here and
immediately received dozens of work offers.
</P>
<P>
	   While backstage at the tents at Bryant Park during New York Fashion Week,
Pantaeva bumped into photographer Roland Levin, the man she had fallen in love
with years earlier in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sound of his voice unlocked my spirit," she recalls in her memoir.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple married.
</P>
<P>
	   Pantaeva wrote "Siberian Dream" because of the strong link she feels between
the East and West.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to sit down and really analyze everything that had happened to me and
what I had been through," she said, adding that she wanted to share her message.
"I felt I was chosen to write this book."
</P>
<P>
	   She wrote some parts by hand, others on a typewriter and recorded several
chapters on a tape recorder in English and Russian.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt like a little angel was sitting on my shoulder and whispering and
guiding me through."
</P>
<P>
	   The memoir was published by Avon Books in 1998. A paperback edition was
released by William Morrow last year. "Siberian Dream" has been translated into
Japanese, Norwegian and German. Chinese and Finnish versions are currently in
the works.
</P>
<P>
	   Pantaeva has received scores of letters from people thanking her for giving
them the confidence they need to reach their goals.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people are writing me with the same response, saying they will try
to achieve 'our dreams the way you did,"' she said. "That's really the best gift
I could ever receive in my life."
</P>
<P>
	   She recently launched an upscale line of jewelry called Irina's Universe.
Made from 18-karat gold and precious stones, diamonds and pearls, the pieces
reflect Pantaeva's connection to the Siberian landscape.
</P>
<P>
	   The collection includes earrings, necklaces and rings made in the shape of
snowflakes, snowballs and icicles, as well as pieces depicting the elements of
earth, air, fire and water.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the catalog, a pair of diamond "icicle" earrings set in white
gold conveys the aura of elegance, while a snowflake pendant with diamond spokes
and a sapphire center bespeaks a "delicate balance of fragile beauty."
</P>
<P>
	   "I know by heart how difficult it is for women to stay in balance and in
harmony," she said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Chased and Caught Success  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Edwin McCain always wanted to be a rock 'n'
roll guy. No one is more surprised than the singer-songwriter to find himself a
balladeer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to replace Adam Sandler as the wedding singer," McCain joked.
"I've got a career after my 15 minutes (of fame) is over just going around
singing 'I'll Be' and 'Could Not Ask for More."'
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has already had two wedding gigs. He sang at the weddings of friends
Mark Bryan of Hootie and the Blowfish and Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20.
</P>
<P>
	   "What an honor to be invited to be a part of something like a wedding.
That's a once-in-a-lifetime, supposedly, thing that people do," he said. "It's a
moment of great fellowship with friends and family."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, 30, took the matrimonial plunge himself last year with a former
high-school classmate.
</P>
<P>
	   He tours constantly to support "Messenger," his follow-up album to
"Misguided Roses," which produced the Top 10 ballad "I'll Be." The song wasn't a
hit right away. "I'll Be" finally broke through a year after "Misguided Roses"
was released in 1997. For McCain, that followed years of being a regional hit in
the Deep South with his self-released album "Solitude."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and his band's stint as an opening act for Hootie and the Blowfish
brought them to the attention of Atlantic Records, which released "Honor Among
Thieves" in 1995. The album yielded a Top 40 hit. But it would be another three
years and more than 600 road dates before McCain scored with "I'll Be."
</P>
<P>
	   Before national success arrived, McCain changed his personality to suit
whatever situation he was in.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was so busy trying to present this homogeneous version of myself. I'm so
busy making sure that everybody's happy with me that I wasn't really sure who I
was anyway," he said. "So now, it's like here it is. Here's all of it, and if
you don't like it, kiss off."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain writes most of his own material, so he was surprised when hit-maker
Diane Warren called and offered him "I Could Not Ask for More."
</P>
<P>
	   Then he heard the demo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was really smarmy, very schmaltzy," he said, wrinkling his lightly
tanned nose. "Apologies all around because I can't say enough good things about
Diane, but for my gig, we had to do something different with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Out went a verse McCain didn't think he could sing honestly, the kind of
words "you've heard a million times in every love song everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then McCain and his band upped the tempo, making it into an acoustic track
that builds into the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra. Warren wasn't thrilled
about the changes to her song, which McCain originally did for the "Message in a
Bottle" movie soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then after it grew on her she was like, 'Yeah, that's good,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's "I Could Not Ask for More" (Lava) is currently in the top 10 of
Billboard's listing of contemporary adult singles.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his success with ballads, McCain plays plenty of rock 'n' roll. One
of the liveliest songs on "Messenger" is "Do Your Thing," inspired by a young
boy who asked McCain how he got to do what he does.
</P>
<P>
	   "They think you're going to hand them that instructional booklet on how to
be successful in the musical industry," he said. "I just say 'find the thing you
love to do and do it all the time and never take no for an answer. Eventually
you'll be happy or not, but at least you did it.'
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem is everybody is too busy with finish lines. It's all about the
journey, being allowed to chase after whatever it is that you love to do. Even
if it's not successful, there's absolute validation in the trying. You already
win when you do that."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's decade of chasing success started out on the bar circuit in his
hometown of Greenville, S.C. When he realized he could earn $150 for three hours
of performing, he dropped out of college and decided that he would take his
guitar and "go have adventures everywhere." His black guitar case is evidence of
those trips. It's plastered with stickers from radio stations and bars
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's travels prompt many of his songs. A morning drive to the airport
that took him past a strip bar and its packed parking lot led to "Beautiful
Life," a sassy commentary on rock stars and regular people.
</P>
<P>
	   "People want to go see naked girls and drink beer at nine o'clock in the
morning. I've wanted to," he said. "That's a part of our world. I love that
about us."
</P>
<P>
	   Such frankness is part of his determination to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
	   "People like to have their emotional pendulum kind of sit there, it swings
happy and it swings sad, but it's not too happy or too sad," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then there's people like me who like to watch it whip around the pole a few
times because it's obnoxious and because it's fun."

	   Jack Lemmon was named best actor in a TV movie or miniseries for Showtime's
"Inherit the Wind" at this year's Golden Globe Awards. Lemmon was nominated in
the same category for his role in "Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With
Morrie." A few years ago, Ving Rhames spontaneously gave his Golden Globe to
Lemmon, who had presented him with it. But Lemmon won't be giving his Golden
Globe to Rhames. "In his spirit, I gave it to me," said Lemmon, who was born on
Feb. 8, 1925. Lemmon has been nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award for his
performance in "Tuesdays With Morrie." The winners will be announced at an
awards show on March 12, broadcast on the TNT cable channel.

"Dogma," directed by Kevin Smith. "Everything should be satirized and skewered.
Nothing is above jokes," the comedian says. "I don't want to go to heaven if it
ain't funny." Rock, who was born on Feb. 7, 1966, says he was kicked out of
Bible school as a child. "I was always joking and laughing. They finally just
said, 'Get out of here.' I went home crying, 'They kicked me out for laughing."'

	   Christina Ricci, who was born on Feb. 12, 1980, has grown up in films. Her
career began with "Mermaids," "Casper," "That Darn Cat" and two "Addams Family"
movies. "It was really stressful," she recalls. "They want to make films where
you're gangly and really skinny and that whole romantic notion of gangly
teen-age girls -- the Nabokov thing -- and I was never that." Her independent
films include "Ice Storm," "Buffalo '66" and "The Opposite of Sex." Now she's
ready to tackle more mainstream fare. She co-stars with Johnny Depp in "Sleepy
Hollow," Tim Burton's retelling of Washington Irving's classic tale. In the
upcoming "The Man Who Cried," she portrays a young woman who flees Germany and
falls for a Gypsy. This World War II drama also stars Depp and Cate Blanchett.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Wynonna Judd  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM PATTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Wynonna Judd is reaching into the future with a new
solo album "New Day Dawning" at the same time she's reviving her past with a
reunion tour of The Judds.
</P>
<P>
	   Will reprising 1980s hits like "Why Not Me?" with her mother Naomi Judd take
away attention from her new music?
</P>
<P>
	   "I think two or three years ago, I would have worried about that," Judd
said. "Because I was working so diligently at being independent from my family.
We all feel the need to move out of the house and get our own apartment and
forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've already done that."
</P>
<P>
	   The Judds rose to stardom in 1984 with their first chart-topping hit "Mama
He's Crazy." They went on to score 14 more No. 1 hits, sell more than 20 million
albums and win six Grammys.
</P>
<P>
	   Naomi Judd retired in 1991 after contracting hepatitis C. Wynonna Judd went
on to solo success with a slick R&AMP;B-leaning sound that is worlds away from The
Judds' homespun country style.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now, I can just be my own bad self because I've pushed two babies through
my body. I've married and divorced. So I'm touring with my mother again. Go
figure. I feel like I can do anything," Judd said.
</P>
<P>
	   The reunion tour features solo and duo hits. Major cities on the three-month
tour, which is scheduled to end in April, include Denver, Chicago, Las Vegas,
Atlanta, Detroit, Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   The 35-year-old singer is confident enough to package "New Day Dawning" with
a separate CD that has four new recordings by The Judds. It's their first new
music since their 1990 "Love Can Build a Bridge" album.
</P>
<P>
	   1. Do you get along with your mom and sister (actress Ashley Judd) better
now than, say, 10 years ago?
</P>
<P>
	   Judd: Oh, God yes. God yes. There's been a lot of Christian counseling.
There are a lot of rules, like no interrupting and no hollering. We've worked 10
years at being a dysfunctional family. Mom says we put the fun in dysfunctional.
... We save our competitiveness for when we're playing a game. And then I will
do anything to smash both of them. We play Gestures and Taboo. Anything where we
can scream and holler is our game.
</P>
<P>
	   2. How do you feel about being on the road with your mom after a decade on
your own?
</P>
<P>
	   Judd: It feels so awesome. ... If this reunion were all about show biz and
fluff, it would really probably scare the crap out of me, quite frankly. But
spiritually, I feel really that it's right. It's a celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   3. Your mom has said she's clear of hepatitis. Are The Judds coming back for
good?
</P>
<P>
	   Judd: Unless the heavens part and I actually see my angel, my gut instinct
is 'Don't push it.' We have to be realistic. There's mom's health, and I have my
own plans, as my own person.
</P>
<P>
	   4. On "New Day Dawning," you do songs by Joni Mitchell, Macy Gray and The
Fabulous Thunderbirds. That's pretty diverse.
</P>
<P>
	   Judd: I continue to thrive on being a musical troublemaker. I want to stir
it up and try things that feel right to my gut. People don't really understand
that. They think that (country music) is all formula and it's all about coming
up with some regular deal every year. Not me. I go with my gut instinct. I
continue to go down that unbeaten path. It's a very lonely journey sometimes. I
feel like I'm alone in the world. But (she starts singing) 'I got to be me.' My
mother raised two strong, very high-spirited women with a lot of independent
thinking. It's her fault.
</P>
<P>
	   5. Sales for country music are down. Why?
</P>
<P>
	   Judd: I see an awful lot of gimmicks going on. I see an awful lot of showy,
bright and shiny tricks, and I think we're getting so far into the entertainment
part of things that we're forgetting about the heart. I want it to get back to
the poetry of the everyday man. That's why I got into music.

<HEADLINE> Report: Oneidas offered $500 million to settle land claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A reported $500 million settlement offer to the
Oneida Indians leaves out their Canadian cousins, says a member of the Canadian
tribe upset at being abandoned in the land claim talks.
<P>
	   "Legally, it doesn't seem right and morally, it doesn't seem right," said
Bob Antone, a member of the Thames Band of Oneidas from Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Incited by the turn of events, Antone decided to break a federal judge's
confidentiality order and provided a seven-page summary to The Post-Standard of
Syracuse detailing the three-day marathon negotiating session held last week in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The session was billed as a the last chance for a settlement before the case
would be turned back over to U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn to be decided in
court.
</P>
<P>
	   Antone said court-appointed mediator Ronald Riccio opened the talks with a
$500 million proposal that provided $225 million for the 1,000-member Oneida
Indian Nation of New York, no less than $250 million for the 14,000 members of
the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and $25 million for the Thames tribe, which has
5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas, with the support of the U.S. Justice Department, are seeking
compensation for the loss of 250,000 acres of ancestral land in Oneida and
Madison counties. The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was seized
in questionable transactions with the state and private individuals and ruled
the Oneidas are entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the settlement, Madison and Oneida counties asked the Oneidas to
put $25 million in a trust fund to offset the county property taxes sovereign
Indian nations do not pay, Antone said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneida Indian Nation of New York would stop its land purchases at 45,000
acres and would consider quitting at 35,000 acres if the state would allow slot
machines at the nation's Turning Stone casino. The New York Oneidas currently
own about 10,000 acres, he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wisconsin Oneidas would receive as much as 1,500 acres of state-owned
land somewhere in St. Lawrence County. But they agreed to not use the land for
business development.
</P>
<P>
	   Antone said the Thames Oneidas have asked for 10,000 acres in Madison
County. That request was ignored. Also, on the first day of the session the
Canadian Oneidas were shocked and outraged when the Wisconsin tribe said it was
prepared to settle without the them.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department negotiators agreed, saying the United States government
has no responsibility to the Oneidas who live in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been cut out," Antone said. "We've been told by the federal
government not to say anything. We don't have a voice."
</P>
<P>
	   The federal and state governments would each contribute half of the $500
million, Antone told the newspaper. Federal negotiators would ask Congress to
extinguish aboriginal title of all three Oneida groups, which would make the
settlement final and preclude the Oneidas from suing again, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York state officials said there would not be a settlement unless the New
York Oneidas agreed to collect and remit sales taxes on all sales to
non-Indians, Antone said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas declined comment on the reported offer, citing McCurn's
confidentiality order. Others involved in the negotiations also held their
silence.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no settlement package at this time," said Oneida County Executive
Ralph Eannace. "Once we have a settlement proposal we will take it to the
residents of Oneida and Madison counties before consideration and a vote by the
county legislative bodies."
</P>
<P>
	   Riccio is scheduled to hold a public meeting Monday.

<TEXT>
    	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - Two people were killed and at least two others
injured when a crane collapsed at a power plant construction site this morning.
<P>
	   The crane was used in building a natural gas-fired power plant on Bic Drive.
It collapsed around 10:30 a.m., Milford fire Capt. Robin Tummins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport Hospital spokesman John Cappiello said the hospital had received
one dead victim. Tummins said a second dead person was located amid the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty bad," Tummins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crane operator was trapped in the rubble of the collapsed crane and the
steel frame of the building. He was injured but was able to communicate with
rescue workers, Tummins said.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth worker was taken the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven where
he was in fair condition, spokeswoman Bonnie Lukacs said. The man's injuries did
not appear life-threatening, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Identities of the dead and injured were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear whether the crane or the building collapsed first, Tummins
said. The structure was about 45 feet high at the point of the collapse, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other cranes at the job site were being positioned to help remove the
wreckage. Some workers were ordered home for the day while others were kept at
the site to assist rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   State records show Houston-based El Paso Energy Co. and Power Development
Corp. of Boston started work on the plant last year. An El Paso official said
the company was unaware of the accident and had no immediate comment. No listing
could be located for Power Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Overland Park, Kan.-based Black &AMP; Veatch, a consulting engineering firm, was
overseeing the construction. A message was left seeking comment from company
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Milford is on the Connecticut shoreline, about 10 miles west of New Haven
and some 60 miles northeast of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Harrison Loses Property Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HONOLULU (AP) -- George Harrison's neighbors are now free to cut through his
Maui estate to get to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawaii Supreme Court upheld a 1993 lower-court ruling that said owners
of two neighboring properties could use the easement on Harrison's 60-acre
oceanfront parcel on the remote eastern end of the island.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison said in 1993 he would sell the property if the ruling went against
him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to protect my privacy, and there is my need to have security," he
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, a homeless woman was found inside the estate doing her laundry
and eating pizza. Her Dec. 23 arrest came a week before Harrison was stabbed in
the chest by an intruder in his mansion near London.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller says Thruway toll hike plan is 'misguided'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A plan to allow New York State Thruway tolls to go
up by as much as 3 percent each year without public comment or review is
"misguided" and should be abandoned, New York's comptroller said Wednesday.
<P>
	   H. Carl McCall asked the chairman of the Thruway Authority, Louis Tomson, to
justify any toll hike by detailing the transportation projects the increases are
designed to fund and whether the money is already available from other Authority
sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big problem," McCall said. "There's no justification for it. If
you're going to do this, you start off by coming forward and explaining why you
need it. What's the additional money for?"
</P>
<P>
	   McCall told Tomson in a letter dated Tuesday and released Wednesday that the
toll increase "may or may not be justified - it's impossible to determine"
without a close look at the agency's books.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from the Thruway Authority on McCall's
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   When approving the previously unannounced toll increase plan last week, the
Authority said it would be used to help fund about $1 billion in improvements on
the superhighway and the other transportation facilties the Authority is
responsible for over the next five years. The agency detailed only the $275
million in projects to be funded this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The first toll increase would take effect June 1 and total 1.8 percent,
according to Authority Executive Director John Platt. The agency plans to hold
four public hearings on the toll increase this spring before finalizing the
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Toll hikes would be tied to increases in a national construction cost index.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall is a Democrat. The governing board of the Thruway Authority is
appointed by Republican Gov. George Pataki and the board is chaired by Louis
Tomson, once a top figure in Pataki's executive chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said he can do nothing to stop the Authority from raising tolls. But
he said he can audit the agency's books and report to the public whether he
believes the toll hike is justified by the Authority's fiscal needs.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said the toll increase would hit upstate New York particularly hard
at a time when it is becoming clearer that the region has not participated fully
in the national recovery from the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most commerce upstate depends on highway transport, and New York state
already has some of the highest trucking fees and taxes in the nation," he wrote
to Tomson. "A toll increase now will serve only as a further detriment to the
upstate economy, and that economy can ill afford even more damage."
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders of both the state Assembly and Senate say they will seek to
block the toll increase legislative if the Thruway Authority does not pull it
back voluntarily or Pataki, as he did with a proposed increase in 1996, doesn't
compel the agency to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, a lawsuit was filed against the Thruway Authority and seven
other toll-collecting agencies in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland
seeking elimination of highway toll booths on the ground that they damage the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   By slowing and stopping traffic to collect tolls, the suit claims, the
agencies are increasing toxic tailpipe emissions and violating the federal Clean
Water and Clean Air acts.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit was filed in federal court in White Plains by Kevin McKeown of
Washington, executive director of No More Tolls, who is acting as his own
attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   "The technology exists to collect road-use fees without causing long traffic
delays and destroying the environment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Louis Armstrong's Birth Celebrated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Jazz at Lincoln Center is celebrating the 100th anniversary
of Louis Armstrong's birth, taking advantage of the doubts over just when that
is.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong celebrated his birthday on July 4 and said he was born in 1900.
But some scholars say he was really born Aug. 4, 1901.
</P>
<P>
	   So starting on the Fourth of July this year, Jazz at Lincoln Center will
honor three aspects of Satchmo's career for the following 13 months: his
virtuoso trumpet playing, his understanding of how to play the blues, and his
role as an international ambassador and humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trumpeters will be coming from all over the world to play his music, in
their own style. Trying to play like Louis Armstrong would be a waste of time.
We'll never be able to play in the style of Louis Armstrong. We just do the best
we can," said Wynton Marsalis, trumpeter and artistic director of Jazz at
Lincoln Center.

<HEADLINE> New Buddy Holly Tune Performed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A new tune created from lyrics Buddy Holly scribbled in a
notebook is being performed nearly 41 years after the rock and roll legend's
death in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee drummer Victor DeLorenzo, formerly with the Violent Femmes, said
he first saw the notebook page in 1996, while visiting in New York with record
executive Howard Thompson, who had bought the page at auction.
</P>
<P>
	   On a later visit, DeLorenzo said he took a closer look at the writing and
decided it was Holly's attempt at lyrics to a song that was never completed.
</P>
<P>
	   Applying his own song-writing logic, he deciphered the repeated last line of
the chorus as "You get me in dutch."
</P>
<P>
	   "My whole idea was not to add anything," DeLorenzo said. When he got home to
his studio, he soon had the music for the lyrics written. "It was like my mind
was in possession of Mr. Holly for 10 minutes."
</P>
<P>
	   DeLorenzo planned to perform it this weekend but said he has no plans to
release a recording of the song.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 26.76  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved moderately higher today as investors expected
the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates only modestly at its meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before the Fed's decision was expected to be announced at 2:15 p.m.
EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.76 at 11,067.81.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 4.86 at 1,414.14, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 34.78 at 4,086.76.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that interest rates are headed sharply higher have roiled the market
recently, sending most stocks tumbling last week. On Monday and Tuesday,
however, stocks rebounded as investors proved unwilling to get out of the market
that has rewarded them so richly the past several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, trading was fairly volatile, suggesting investors remained wary of
the Fed's decision. Most analysts expected the Fed to raise rates by a
quarter-percentage point, although some believed an increase of a
half-percentage point would be no surprise as the Fed works to slow the pace of
U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors would also be closely attuned to the statement the Fed releases
with its decision, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "For today, the important part of the announcement probably won't be the
amount of the rate hike, because the markets will be looking for hints about
future rate increases and the temperament of the Fed," said Paul Cherney, market
analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid
to keep inflation under control, and has suggested it will continue raising
rates until it sees tangible evidence of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, IBM led the Dow's advance, rising 4 3/16 to 114 3/16.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors fell 3 7/16 to 81 13/16 after the company named president and
chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner as chief executive officer, preparing
GM for the retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume was running well ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.32 to 509.07.

<HEADLINE> Senate Raises Minumum Wage  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today passed legislation to raise the
$5.15-an-hour minimum wage by a dollar while reducing people's ability to sweep
away credit card and other debts through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The 83-14 vote was on a broad bankruptcy overhaul bill that also would give
new tax breaks to small businesses and increase penalties for powder cocaine
crimes. The House has passed a similar but narrower bankruptcy bill; the Clinton
administration opposes both versions.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote culminated several hours of drama in which Democrats summoned Vice
President Al Gore to break a possible tie vote on an abortion rights measure.
Republicans dropped their opposition to the amendment upon Gore's arrival at the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour over three years, a
span that Democrats and President Clinton say is too long. They also object to
$76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years that Republicans maintain would help
small businesses deal with the impact of raising the wage floor. The House has
taken no action on a minimum wage increase, but Republican leaders have promised
a vote before November's election.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier today, the Senate voted 80-17 to prohibit people found to have
violated laws protecting abortion clinics from using bankruptcy proceedings to
escape fines and civil judgments. The lopsided voted denied Gore an opportunity
to reaffirm his abortion rights credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, opposing Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has questioned the vice president's commitment to protecting women's
right to choose abortion, citing Gore's votes on abortion measures as a House
member nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this amendment, nobody will be able to politically demagogue this
issue,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said shortly before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, called Gore's rush back to Washington
``theater'' -- adding, ``the vice president's going to need it'' to win election
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Grassley's comments prompted Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to say, ``This
issue is not about theater. It is about the very real issue of violence against
women. ... We cannot allow violent extremists to use the bankruptcy code to
carry out'' their agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This issue is so important, I'm not going to take a chance of seeing it
fail,'' Gore said just prior to the vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   The amendment's sponsor, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., cited the case of
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who filed for bankruptcy court
protection in November 1998, blaming heavy debts owed to women's groups and
abortion clinics that have sued him.
</P>
<P>
	   Partisan fighting over abortion and guns has marked Senate debate on the
legislation, which would make it tougher for people to sweep away their debts
through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., denounced Schumer's proposal Tuesday as an attempt
``to silence the free speech of abortion opponents.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defeated today was an amendment by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., to prohibit gun makers and dealers from erasing debts in
bankruptcy that arose from successful lawsuits against them.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal ``is designed to encourage lawsuits ... and put the firearms
industry in this country out of business,'' said Hatch.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that some two dozen U.S. cities and towns have sued gun makers and
distributors, Levin said the firearms industry ``should not be able to evade
judgments by going bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Senate rebuffed an attempt by some Democrats to make it
harder for high-interest, storefront lenders to collect debts from people who
have filed for bankruptcy relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators voted, 53-44, to reject an amendment proposed by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., that would have prohibited lending businesses charging more
than 100 percent annual interest in recovering debts from consumers in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A partisan dispute over a minimum wage increase and tax breaks for small
businesses, meanwhile, threatened to delay final Senate passage of the
legislation to overhaul the bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said a $1 increase in the $5.15
hourly minimum over three years was insufficient. In addition, the White House
and Democratic lawmakers oppose $18.4 billion in small-business tax breaks
proposed by the GOP that are tied to the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made, Daschle told reporters, ``I'm concerned that the
bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Voting against the abortion rights amendment were Republican Sens. Wayne
Allard of Colorado, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts of Kansas, Jim Bunning of
Kentucky, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Michael Enzi of Wyoming, Phil Gramm of Texas, Rod
Grams of Minnesota, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas,
Jon Kyl of Arizona, Richard Lugar of Indiana, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Jeff
Sessions of Alabama, Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and
George Voinovich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is campaigning for the Republican
presidential nomination, and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., did not vote. Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., whose family owns a bank, recused himself by voting
'present.'

<HEADLINE> IRS Struggles With Spouse Claims  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is struggling with a backlog
of some 46,000 claims under a new ``innocent spouse'' law intended to protect
divorced or separated partners from getting unfairly entangled in tax debts.
</P>
<P>
	   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told the Senate Finance Committee on
Wednesday that the agency was surprised by the sheer number of claims following
congressional passage of the law in 1998 and also wasn't fully prepared for the
complexity of determining which ones are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are really quite determined to get the claims right,'' Rossotti said.
``Sometimes, that has resulted in taking more time to get the result out to the
taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   In general, the innocent spouse law enables one partner to obtain relief
from tax liabilities stemming from a jointly filed tax return -- if the
requesting spouse can prove no knowledge of the offending items on that return.
The new law relaxed and broadened many requirements, among other updated
taxpayer rights.
</P>
<P>
	   In the four months before the 1998 IRS reform law took effect, Rossotti said
the agency had received about 3,000 innocent spouse claims. Since then, the
number of claims has ballooned to 63,906, with about 2,800 pouring in each month
-- and the backlog as of Dec. 31 was 46,665.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not satisfactory,'' said Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del. ``We do have to find some answers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti said the IRS intends for ``progress to pick up'' during 2000 and
projected the backlog to drop to about 30,000 claims by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Several senators were critical of reports that IRS enforcement actions --
liens, levies and property seizures -- have plummeted since the 1998 reform law
passed. Rossotti released new estimates predicting that the drop will end in
2000 as the agency improves how it administers the law and Congress provides
adequate money for staff and computer improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do think we have gotten past the first stage,'' Rossotti said. ``We want
to respect taxpayer rights. We also have to collect the taxes.''

<HEADLINE> Top Commerce Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commerce Under Secretary David Aaron, the top trade
official at the agency, announced Wednesday that he was leaving his post next
month to take a job with a Minnesota-based law firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron, who had been the administration's chief troubleshooter on a number of
contentious trade issues with the European Union, said he would be joining the
Washington office of Dorsey &AMP; Whitney, a law firm that has its main offices in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   Before he leaves office, Aaron said he hoped to have resolved a dispute with
the EU involving data privacy. But he indicated that a second dispute with the
EU involving the proper approach to limiting airplane noise would have to be
dealt with by his successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron said no decisions had been made yet on who would be nominated by
President Clinton to take over his job. The under secretary for international
affairs at Commerce oversees the 2,000-member International Trade
Administration, the government's primary agency for enforcing trade agreements
negotiated by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITA will also be in the lead in efforts to win congressional approval
for permanent normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron forecast an administration victory on the China vote and rejected
suggestions that because of strong opposition from labor unions, a key
Democratic constituency, that the administration may ultimately decide to put
off a vote if Republican leaders in Congress delay the matter until close to the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we have the opportunity to do it,'' Aaron said. ``I don't see anything
next year that will make it easier.''

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Keeps Flawed Stamp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, the U.S. Postal Service had to destroy 100 million
Grand Canyon stamps because the caption put the natural wonder in Colorado, not
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that the corrected version is on sale, postal officials have admitted
another glitch: The dramatic photograph on the stamp is flipped, giving a mirror
image of the real view.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, there are no plans to recall or destroy the 60-cent air mail
stamps, Postal Service spokesman Don Smeraldi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're sticking with it,'' Smeraldi said. ``No matter how you look at it,
the Grand Canyon makes a beautiful postage stamp.''
</P>
<P>
	   The stamps, part of a series highlighting American landmarks, went on sale
Jan. 20. It wasn't long before a ranger at Grand Canyon National Park called
postal officials to point out the mistake, Smeraldi said. The photo shows Lipan
Point on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon under orange-hued storm clouds.
</P>
<P>
	   The photographer who took the picture, Tom Till of Moab, Utah, could have
caught the error if he had received an advance copy of the stamp design, said
Ann Carter of Till's office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All we saw was a teeny, tiny picture that was faxed,'' Carter said. She
said Till was touring the Middle East nation of Oman and could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last May, the Postal Service said it had destroyed all 100 million Grand
Canyon stamps with the Colorado error. At the time, the trade paper Linn's Stamp
News estimated that reprinting the stamps cost about $500,000.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Testifies in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George Tenet says there is no evidence that
classified material improperly kept on former director John Deutch's home
computer fell into the wrong hands via the Internet. Still, ``We cannot exclude
that possibility,'' he told a Senate committee looking into the security lapse
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was sloppy in what he did,'' Tenet said of his former boss and
predecessor. ``He worked around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tenet denied he
deliberately delayed an investigation into Deutch's computer practices. But, he
conceded, ``The internal investigation took too long. The process was not
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet stripped Deutch of his security clearances in August, even though the
CIA investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified materials began in
December 1996, the month Tenet became acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal report by the CIA's inspector general faults Tenet and other
senior CIA officials for waiting too long before notifying the Justice
Department or congressional intelligence oversight committees of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet agreed the CIA was slow in notifying appropriate officials and
lawmakers. ``There was no excuse for that,'' he said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When he left his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home and found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet said most of the classified documents on Deutch's computers were not
ones he took home from secure CIA computers but ones he created in writing
reports. Even so, Tenet said, there were ``high levels of classified materials''
on Deutch's home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   According to those familiar with the still-classified inspector general's
report, Deutch deleted more than 1,000 secret documents on the computer when he
became aware of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized. Although the CIA eventually referred the case to the
Justice Department, Deutch has not been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was grilled on the security lapses during a hearing on world trouble
spots. In that testimony, Tenet said:
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a ``high potential'' for a military flare-up across the Taiwan
Strait this year because of increasing tensions between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   --Over the next 15 years, U.S. cities could be within range of ballistic
missiles from ``North Korea, probably Iraq and possibly Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The CIA, working with foreign governments, has helped to bring ``more than
two dozens terrorists to justice'' since July 1998. More than half were
associated with suspected fugitive terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia's economic difficulties are weakening the government's ability to
safeguard its nuclear arsenal. `While there is no evidence weapons are missing,
``We remain concerned by reports of lax discipline, labor strikes, poor morale
and criminal activities at nuclear storage facilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Deutch matter was one of ``grave concern,'' said the committee chairman,
Sen. Richard Shelby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people have a keen interest in the performance of senior
officials charged with upholding our laws and policies with respect to the
protection of classified information, '' said Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby asked Tenet if he could assure Congress that foreign powers or other
unauthorized parties had not gotten access to Deutch's materials via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   While there was no evidence of that, Tenet said: ''``We cannot exclude that
possibility. I can't give you a statement that it absolutely didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch clearly violated CIA security rules on the handling of classified
documents, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet balked at questions on whether the Deutch material posed as much
damage to U.S. security if it were to fall into the wrong hands as information
passed on by convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a case of espionage, Tenet said. ``I would not put the Deutch
case in the same category as Ames and Pollard. I don't think it's fair.''

<HEADLINE> Two Pratt workers win $880,000 in age discrimination suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Two former Pratt &AMP; Whitney workers who claimed
they were laid off because of their ages have been awarded $880,000 in damages.
<P>
	   An eight-member jury in U.S. District Court in New Haven deliberated less
than 2 1/2 hours Tuesday before finding that the March 1997 layoffs by the jet
engine maker were discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Schanzer of West Hartford and Robert R. Madison of Longmeadow, Mass.,
filed the lawsuit in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men were 53 years old and employees in Pratt's finance department when
they were notified that they were being laid off in an effort to reduce
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit claimed that most of those selected for layoff in the department
were older than 46. Although only 39 percent of department members were over 46,
all but one of the 33 workers laid off were over 46.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seemed a little more than coincidence that that many of the people they
laid off were above that age," juror Richard Barletta of Hamden said after the
six-day trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Gregg Adler, an attorney for Schanzer and Madison, told the jury that one of
the criteria Pratt used in evaluating employees before the layoff was "future
potential" - a criterion he said discriminated against older workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt's lawyer, Albert Zakarian, conceded in his final argument that
Schanzer and Madison weren't bad employees. But he said the evaluation process
that preceded the layoff was designed to keep the better employees in the face
of cost-cutting needs dictated by competition.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's about honest people making tough decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict included a total of $445,000 in damages for Schanzer and
$435,000 for Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   One other Pratt employee who was laid off in March 1997 has an
age-discrimination lawsuit pending in U.S. District Court in Hartford.

<HEADLINE> Small Babies May Earn Less Later  </HEADLINE>
    By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Babies born smaller than normal tend to have lower incomes
as adults but are just as likely as normal birth-weight people to be employed,
married and satisfied with their lives, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The study linked the lower incomes to lower achievement in school, which led
to lower-paying, blue-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous studies have linked low birth weight to problems with brain
development in children.
</P>
<P>
	   But those studies did not track low birth-weight babies past mid-childhood,
said Dr. Richard S. Strauss, the study's lead researcher and assistant professor
of pediatrics at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, which was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, tracked about 1,000 full-term babies who weighed less than
about 5.5 pounds at birth in Britain in 1970. They were examined at ages 10, 16
and 26 and compared with normal-size babies born the same year.
</P>
<P>
	   The adults born small earned about 10 percent less, and those who had normal
birth weights were twice as likely to become professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   At age 26, no differences were seen between the normal and low birth-weight
adults in years of education, hours worked, marital status, satisfaction with
life and perception of standard of living.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers are "really getting at the issues that parents want to
know," said Dr. Marie McCormick, head of maternal and child health at the
Harvard School of Public Health. "People think these problems give you a really
poor quality of life, but this shows that they don't feel that way."

<HEADLINE> Bills propose abolition of sheriffs system  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The eight county sheriffs would be stripped of
the bulk of their powers under four bills proposed Wednesday.
<P>
	   Each bill would take responsibility for courthouse security away from the
high sheriffs and give it to the state's Judicial Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Two bills would put the Department of Corrections in charge of prisoner
transportation, while the other two would give that job to the Judicial
Department. Currently, special deputy sheriffs transport prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   The sets of bills differ when it comes to determining the fate of their
deputies, who serve legal papers such as summonses and divorce writs.
</P>
<P>
	   One set would leave it to lawmakers to decide whether paper servers should
be under the control of the Judicial Department. The other set proposes a
constitutional amendment which would let voters decide whether the Judicial
Department should oversee the deputies.
</P>
<P>
	   The constitutional amendment would also abolish the office of high sheriff,
the last remnant of county government in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   A public hearing on the bills likely will be held next month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Raising these different options gives everyone a bite at the apple," said
Sen. John Fonfara, co-chairman of the Program Review and Investigations
Committee, which proposed the bills. "There's legitimate arguments for each of
the positions, and they should all be debated."
</P>
<P>
	   Since Gov. John G. Rowland proposed abolishing the sheriffs last year, the
system has been socked with scandal. Two high sheriffs were indicted - one
charged with illegally possessing an assault weapon in his courthouse office,
the other accused of embezzlement and election fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   A female prisoner says she was raped by male inmates while being transported
in a New Haven County sheriff's van, and a special deputy was arrested for
firing his gun at a couple of black motorists as he chased them into Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Michael Lawlor, co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said more bills
probably will be raised to abolish the sheriffs system.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to happen this year," said Lawlor, D-East Haven. "There's no
doubt in my mind."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawlor said he wants all duties now performed under the sheriffs system to
be transferred to the Judicial Department. Eventually, he said prisoner
transportation should be moved to the Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not something that can just happen overnight," he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Turn Mixed; Dow Down 31.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mixed today after the Federal Reserve raised
interest rates a modest quarter-percentage point and said that inflation poses a
threat to the booming U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the Fed's announcement, which was widely expected, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 31.95 at 11,009.10. The Dow was up about 60
points in the moments before the Fed released its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 2.83 at 1,406.45, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 42.27 at 4,094.25.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip industrials turned lower after the Fed said it was increasing its
target for the federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other
on overnight loan -- to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate, the interest that the Fed
charges to make direct loans to banks by a quarter point to 5.25 percent from 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing
money. That makes it more difficult for businesses to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were also selling stock on the fear that today's rate increase
might be the first of several this year. In a statement explaining its decision,
the Fed said it continued to be worried that the rapidly growing economy "could
foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record
economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid
to keep inflation under control, and has suggested it will continue raising
rates until it sees tangible evidence of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   While interest rate concerns dominated Wall Street, investors found little
corporate news to shape the market.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors fell 3 7/16 to 81 13/16 after the company named president and
chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner as chief executive officer, preparing
GM for the retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner rose 5 1/8 to 83 1/16 after reporting earnings that beat
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume was running well ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.70 to 508.45.

<HEADLINE> Clinton under fire for "murder" claim; launches own ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton was attacked Wednesday for
saying last month that unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, fatally shot by
New York City police last year, had been murdered.
<P>
	   Clinton Senate campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady had
misspoken and "knows that only a jury can decide the outcome of this case."
</P>
<P>
	   The criticism came as Clinton launched the first advertising - a radio ad
seeking volunteers - that is being paid for from her own campaign funds. She is
expected to face New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaints about the first lady's comment came as the murder trial of
four New York City police officers charged in the Diallo shooting began in
Albany. The trial was ordered moved to the state capital from the Bronx where
the shooting took place because of concerns over pre-trial publicity. The
officers have maintained that they thought Diallo was armed and felt their lives
were in danger. The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo, striking him 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit to the Rev. Al Sharpton's New York City headquarters on
Martin Luther King Day, Mrs. Clinton had noted that "Senator (Charles) Schumer
... gave a speech after the tragic murder of Mr. Diallo in which he said that
what every community, but particularly the African-American community, wants is
to be respected and protected."
</P>
<P>
	   A group of police officers and others, calling themselves "The Coalition for
a Fair Trial," held a news conference Wednesday in Albany at a hotel near the
courthouse where the Diallo trial was underway.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Clinton, the group said her statement had "prejudged the
officers" and "poisoned the jury pool."
</P>
<P>
	   Behind those at the news conference was a banner for the Law Enforcement
Alliance of America, a group that has been highly critical of the Clinton
administration and has in turn been criticized by it for taking money from the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not surprising that an NRA front group would attack Hillary in light
of her strong record on gun safety," Wolfson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Victoria D'Angelo, a representative of the LEAA, said at the news conference
that her group's concern was not politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not about Mayor Giuliani running for Senate. This is not about Mrs.
Clinton running for the Senate," she said. "This is about four police officers
on trial."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the New York Post reported Wednesday that Clinton's newly hired
ad agency, DeVito/Verdi, produced a full-page newspaper ad for the American
Civil Liberties Union last year criticizing the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Featuring 41 jagged bullet holes, the ad said: "On February 4, 1999, the
NYPD gave Amadou Diallo the right to remain silent. And they did it without
saying a word." The ad was denounced at the time by the police and their union.
</P>
<P>
	   "We certainly don't endorse its content," Wolfson said when asked about the
Diallo shooting ad.
</P>
<P>
	   The new Clinton 60-second radio ad, also produced by DeVito/Verdi, features
the first lady talking about the "many goals I'd like to accomplish as your
senator." In explaining the goals, such as college tuition tax credits, her
voice alternately gives way to that of a woman, then a child and finally a man.
</P>
<P>
	   "Join the New Yorkers for Hillary team," the first lady says at the end of
the ad.
</P>
<P>
	   While the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee financed a
series of televisions ads across upstate New York last year boosting Clinton,
the radio ad represented the first time she had dipped into her own campaign
coffers for advertising. Wolfson said the ads would run in all of the state's
major radio markets for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton plans to formally announce her Senate candidacy on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Liability Limit Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though President Clinton may veto the measure, the House
passed a bill Wednesday that creates an 18-year liability limit when
manufacturers are sued by employees who have been injured by aging equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics called it ``unfair'' to American workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have left workers out to dry,'' Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio,
said before the measure passed 222-194. ``It (the bill) provides more protection
for machines than people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said. ``This malicious bill threatens worker
safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   But supporters said in an age of ``frivolous lawsuits,'' the measure was
needed. Often, machines are resold or modified without a manufacturer's
knowledge, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, and the bill's sponsor, said endless lawsuits
cost businesses, employees and consumers. ``A very significant amount of the
money that's won or settled ends up in the lawyers' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, said Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, ``If a product is used safely for
a substantially long period of time, it is not likely it was defective when
originally purchased. It's more likely the product was either misused or not
well maintained.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans have led the push for liability reform, but the bill's
future in the Senate is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has already indicated President Clinton will veto the
measure, said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill covers workplace goods like machine tools, printing presses and
farm equipment. It bars suing manufacturers of those products for incidents that
occur 18 years after it was delivered to its first purchaser.
</P>
<P>
	   Exempted from the bill are workers who do not qualify for any form of
workers' compensation and products with warranties that guarantee the life or
safety of the product for more than 18 years. The bill would not affect products
such as automobiles and commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen states currently have similar laws on the books, although all are
for a period less than 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress passed a similar 18-year liability measure in 1994 to protect the
small aircraft industry from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill will not cause injured parties to go uncompensated,'' said Rep.
Mark Green, R-Wis. ``It separates out the least productive portion. . . the
litigation driven costs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unions have campaigned against the bill. John Irvine, spokesman for the
American Federation of Government Employees, called the measure ``a dangerous
bill that will eliminate workers' rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would also allow employers and innocent bystanders to sue for
damages, while eliminating workers, Michael E. Mathis, government affairs
director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters complained in a letter
to lawmakers. ``This makes no sense.''

<HEADLINE> Bigger models strut new lingerie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - For years supermodel Kate Dillon starved herself to be
thin. Then she got fed up. She started eating and stopped working as a "skinny
model."
<P>
	   Today the 5-foot-11-inch, 175-pound Dillon is showing off revealing
negligDee on the runway, as part of retailer Lane Bryant's effort to kick off
Cacique - its new line of plus-size lingerie and sleepwear.
</P>
<P>
	   Lane Bryant, which already carries plus-size clothing, hopes to make an
impression with its thongs, plunging lace bras, and sleepwear for women sized 14
to 28.
</P>
<P>
	   The national chain had advertised Wednesday night's Webcast of its "intimate
runway show" in the New York Post, The New York Times and Women's Wear Daily, a
fashion trade paper.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads feature generously proportioned women stripping down to their
underwear, with the words "big girls take back the night" and a Web address for
virtual viewing of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   The actual runway show, Tuesday night in New York, included the likes of
former Playboy Playmate of the Year Anna Nicole Smith, actress Kathy Najimy of
the NBC show "Veronica's Closet" and Mia Tyler, daughter of Aerosmith's Steven
Tyler.
</P>
<P>
	   Before and after the show, black and white movies of women posing
seductively blanketed the walls of the packed studio in the West Village.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most lingerie runway shows, this one had models - most close to 6 feet
tall - strutting to the beat of bassy music, sporting garter belts, bodyslips,
bustiers, strapless tops, camisoles and flowing, see-through nightgowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Applause - and cleavage - abounded.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike those typically seen on television and in magazines, some of
these models had cellulite and stretch marks, not to mention flabby thighs and
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are very sexy, even if they are bigger," said audience-member Corrado
Speziali. "A slim model gives you the wrong idea."
</P>
<P>
	   But slim models have been the norm until recently.
</P>
<P>
	   "You couldn't have done this five years ago," said Julie Lewit, founder of
Mode magazine, which is targeted at plus-size women. "There was no one
manufacturing the clothes and no retailers selling them. The circle had to be
completed."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewit says Mode's circulation has tripled since its launch three years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   And for Kate Dillon, weighing 175 pounds is not hurting her career at all.
"I'm in the new Gucci ads coming out this spring," Dillon said. "Being a
plus-size model is a celebration. It's great not to be an automaton."
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   The fashion show Webcast was scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
Wednesday at www.lanebryant.com.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Liability Limit Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though President Clinton may veto the measure, the House
passed a bill Wednesday that creates an 18-year liability limit when
manufacturers are sued by workers who have been injured by aging equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics called it ``unfair'' to American workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have left workers out to dry,'' Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio,
said before the measure passed 222-194. ``It (the bill) provides more protection
for machines than people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said. ``This malicious bill threatens worker
safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   But supporters said in an age of ``frivolous lawsuits,'' the measure was
needed. Often, machines are resold or modified without a manufacturer's
knowledge, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, and the bill's sponsor, said endless lawsuits
cost businesses, employees and consumers. ``A very significant amount of the
money that's won or settled ends up in the lawyers' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, said Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, ``If a product is used safely for
a substantially long period of time, it is not likely it was defective when
originally purchased. It's more likely the product was either misused or not
well maintained.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans have led the push for liability reform, but the bill's
future in the Senate is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has already indicated President Clinton will veto the
measure, said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill covers workplace goods like machine tools, printing presses and
farm equipment. It bars suing manufacturers of those products for incidents that
occur 18 years after it was delivered to its first purchaser.
</P>
<P>
	   Exempted from the bill are workers who do not qualify for any form of
workers' compensation and products with warranties that guarantee the life or
safety of the product for more than 18 years. The bill would not affect products
such as automobiles and commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen states currently have similar laws on the books, although all are
for a period less than 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress passed a similar 18-year liability measure in 1994 to protect the
small aircraft industry from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill will not cause injured parties to go uncompensated,'' said Rep.
Mark Green, R-Wis. ``It separates out the least productive portion. . . the
litigation driven costs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unions have campaigned against the bill. John Irvine, spokesman for the
American Federation of Government Employees, called the measure ``a dangerous
bill that will eliminate workers' rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would also allow employers and innocent bystanders to sue for
damages, while eliminating workers, Michael E. Mathis, government affairs
director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters complained in a letter
to lawmakers. ``This makes no sense.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: Diallo shot without warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Four police officers who killed the unarmed Amadou
Diallo on his Bronx doorstep unleashed a 41-shot barrage without any warning,
prosecutors charged Wednesday at the officers' murder trial.
<P>
	   "They never called out commands like 'Stop, police,' or 'Don't move"' before
gunning down the West African immigrant in an apartment house vestibule,
prosecutor Eric Warner told jurors during opening statements in a packed
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy
"acted recklessly and with depraved indifference to Amadou Diallo's life. ...
For that, they are guilty of murder," Warner said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first day of the racially charged trial of the four white officers,
defense attorneys painted a much different picture: that of a suspicious-seeming
man who failed to stop on their command, turned and pointed a dark object at
them. The officers thought it was a gun and fired in self-defense; it turned out
to be a wallet holding $169.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's attorney, Bennett Epstein, described Diallo, a black, 22-year-old
street vendor, as "a person who felt compelled to avoid police." The lawyer said
the victim caused a deadly chain reaction by ducking into the vestibule as the
plainclothes officers searched for violent suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   "The officers identified themselves with their shields (badges) out, as they
are trained to; Mr. Diallo doesn't listen to their orders to stop, which they
are trained to give," Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Diallo turned around, "he had taken them into the no-man's land
that is every police officer's nightmare," Epstein said. Carroll, after
realizing the mistake, tried to resuscitate Diallo, saying, "Don't die, please
don't die."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a case about five good men," Epstein said. "One of them was Mr.
Diallo."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, - who plan to testify
in their own defense - have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder and
reckless endangerment charges in the slaying of Diallo shortly after midnight on
Feb. 4, 1999. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting triggered a wave of pretrial publicity and protests alleging
widespread brutality against minorities, and prompted an appeals court to rule
the officers could not get a fair trial in New York City. The case was moved 150
miles to Albany, where State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi decided the
trial could be televised.
</P>
<P>
	   In his opening, Warner detailed how the 19 bullets tore through Diallo's
vital organs. He alleged many were fired while Diallo was falling down and on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let us be absolutely clear: Each shot required a separate pull of the
trigger," Warner told the six-man, six woman jury, which includes four blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claimed that the officers were forced to make a split-second
decision using rapid-fire weapons. They also portrayed Diallo's Soundview
neighborhood one of the most dangerous sections of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Stephen Worth, who represents McMellon, asserted that the
officers were only on trial "because there was a furor created by people who
have their own agendas" - an allusion to activists who say the case exemplifies
racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courtroom, the Rev. Al Sharpton accused Worth of trying to
manipulate white jurors. "When has anyone called (the defendants) racist?" said
the civil-rights activist.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton also complained that the defense was giving the impression that
Soundview - located in a police precinct where violent crime has dropped more
than 22 percent in the last two years - is "the wild, wild west."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's insulting," he said. "It shows why this should have been a Bronx
jury."

<HEADLINE> Education Dept Defends Math Program  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department defended its endorsement of 10
school math programs while enduring criticism Wednesday from parents and
educators who complained to lawmakers about low test scores and student
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If medical doctors experimented with our kids in the same fashion school
districts do, they would be in jail,'' Mark Schwartz, a parent of three from
Livonia, Mich., told the House Education and the Workforce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the Education Department designated 10 math programs as
``exemplary'' or ``promising'' for school districts seeking to improve lagging
math scores. More than 200 mathematicians took out a full-page newspaper ad
condemning the programs and asking Education Secretary Richard Riley to withdraw
the designations. The department declined.
</P>
<P>
	   James Milgram, a Stanford University mathematician who led the campaign
against the lessons, told lawmakers that in California, where many of the
lessons are used, more college freshmen in the California State University
system need remedial math courses. In 1989, 23 percent of entering freshmen need
the courses; this school year, 55 percent enrolled in such classes.
</P>
<P>
	   Rachel Tronstein, a University of Michigan freshman, blamed the math program
she took in high school for her B-minus in first-semester college calculus. She
said she earned A grades in her other courses.
</P>
<P>
	   Other critics said the new math programs, many of which rely on calculators
and building blocks, neglected important skills such as dividing fractions and
multiplying multidigit numbers. The basics, they said, are essential to students
hoping to master algebra, calculus, physics and other advanced concepts.
</P>
<P>
	   Kent McGuire, a Riley deputy who oversees research, said the department had
an obligation to offer schools guidance on the best lessons available. He
defended the expert panel that reviewed the programs
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should respect the members of the panel and applaud their good-faith
efforts,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many school districts are accepting Core-Plus Math, Mathland and Connected
Math and other lessons because they promote reasoning rather than rote
memorization, said Judith Sunley, who directs education programs for the
National Science Foundation, which studied and supported many of the recommended
math lessons.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuire said the department simply was following a 1994 law requiring
federal researchers to make the recommendations. By law, the department cannot
directly tell the nation's nearly 16,000 school districts what to teach.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans who favor a reduced federal role in education hinted Wednesday
they would repeal the law, which was enacted by a Democrat-controlled Congress
and is up for renewal this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I imagine there will be pressure to do that,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling,
R-Pa., the House Education Committee chairman. ``Our job is to present research
and let the states and local districts make the decision about what they will
teach.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee Democrats and administration officials emphasized that districts
and schools do not have to adopt the recommendations, which also cover programs
in science, gender equity, school safety and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But school-level officials tend to follow the federal government's lead,
Milgram said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are easily swayed by trendy and unproven programs, which typically
offer a superficial treatment of the subject leading to weak backgrounds in
their students,'' he said. ``The programs they develop and push simply set too
low a standard.''

<HEADLINE> Comptroller says Thruway toll hike plan is 'misguided'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A plan to allow New York State Thruway tolls to go
up by as much as 3 percent each year without public comment or review is
"misguided" and should be abandoned, New York's comptroller said Wednesday.
<P>
	   H. Carl McCall asked the chairman of the Thruway Authority, Louis Tomson, to
justify any toll hike by detailing the transportation projects the increases are
designed to fund and whether the money is already available from other Authority
sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big problem," McCall said. "There's no justification for it. If
you're going to do this, you start off by coming forward and explaining why you
need it. What's the additional money for?"
</P>
<P>
	   McCall told Tomson in a letter dated Tuesday and released Wednesday that the
toll increase "may or may not be justified - it's impossible to determine"
without a close look at the agency's books.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway Authority spokeswoman Anya Frost Wednesday called McCall's letter
"completely political" and "headline grabbing." She said officials last week
sent McCall much of the information he requested about the Thruway's finances.
</P>
<P>
	   When approving the previously unannounced toll increase plan last week, the
Authority said it would be used to help fund about $1 billion in improvements on
the superhighway and the other transportation facilities the Authority is
responsible for over the next five years. The agency detailed only the $275
million in projects to be funded this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The first toll increase would take effect June 1 and total 1.8 percent,
according to Authority Executive Director John Platt. The agency plans to hold
four public hearings on the toll increase this spring before finalizing the
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Toll hikes would be tied to increases in a national construction cost index.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall is a Democrat. The governing board of the Thruway Authority is
appointed by Republican Gov. George Pataki and the board is chaired by Tomson,
once a top figure in Pataki's executive chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   McCoy said he can do nothing to stop the Authority from raising tolls. But
he said he can audit the agency's books and report to the public whether he
believes the toll hike is justified by the Authority's fiscal needs.
</P>
<P>
	   McCoy said the toll increase would hit upstate New York particularly hard at
a time when it is becoming clearer that the region has not participated fully in
the national recovery from the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most commerce upstate depends on highway transport, and New York State
already has some of the highest trucking fees and taxes in the nation," he wrote
to Toms. "A toll increase now will serve only as a further detriment to the
upstate economy, and that economy can ill afford even more damage."
</P>
<P>
	   Frost, the Thruway Authority spokeswoman, countered that the toll increase
plan is a "balanced" one that will enhance economic development, not detract
from it.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Thruway has always been an economic engine for growth and this plan
builds on it," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders of both the state Assembly and Senate say they will seek to
block the toll increase legislative if the Thruway Authority does not pull it
back voluntarily or Partake, as he did with a proposed increase in 1996, doesn't
compel the agency to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, a lawsuit was filed against the Thruway Authority and seven
other toll-collecting agencies in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland
seeking elimination of highway toll booths on the ground that they damage the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   By slowing and stopping traffic to collect tolls, the suit claims, the
agencies are increasing toxic tailpipe emissions and violating the federal Clean
Water and Clean Air acts.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit was filed in federal court in White Plains by Kevin of Washington,
executive director of No More Tolls, who is acting as his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   "The technology exists to collect road-use fees without causing long traffic
delays and destroying the environment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Worry Over U.S. in Balkans  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators expressed growing impatience Wednesday with the
continuing U.S. military role in the Balkans, arguing that the failure of
European nations to do more is prolonging the American presence there.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said he doesn't mind helping the Europeans on their
territory when there is a bona fide threat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do mind being a patsy to European nations who don't carry their own
load,'' he said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, commander in chief of allied forces in Europe, told the
senators that U.S. forces often have to do police work in Kosovo because
European nations have been unable to meet that need due to shortage of police
available for such duty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We desperately, urgently need more nations to provide police,'' Clark
said. He said there are fewer than 2,000 international police officers in
Kosovo, of whom 20 percent are Americans. The goal is to have 4,718 officers
deployed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark acknowledged that U.S. forces in Kosovo face a dangerous and difficult
environment. During the first six months of the post-war U.S. deployment in
Kosovo, he said there were 615 incidents of hostile fire in the vicinity of
those troops, 15 mortar or recoilless rifle attacks, 20 altercations with unruly
crowds, 129 grenade attacks and 58 mine strikes.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the continued presence of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) ``is
necessary to provide a secure environment for civil implementation to take place
and is key to achieving a lasting peace in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. troops have served in Bosnia since late 1995 and now number about
5,600. Two deadlines set by President Clinton for the return of the troops have
come and gone, and there is no longer a target date for their departure. All
told there are about 24,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, mostly from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 50,000 peace implementation forces in Kosovo, about 6,000 are
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. James Imhofe, R-Okla., said the deployments are ``a terrible drain on
our state of readiness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee chairman John Warner, R-Va., said it may be unrealistic to think
that ethnic reconciliation is possible in either Bosnia or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he believes the United States has reached a point ``where it
is the responsibility of the Congress to reexamine the goals, their
achievability and what appears to be our open-ended involvement in Bosnia and
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said some European nations in recent months transferred police in the
Balkans to East Timor because that was considered a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner reacted sharply, saying in a raised voice, ``The highest priority is
the protection of our armed forces, who weren't trained to do this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Warner said the European Union promised $500 million to peacekeeping in the
Balkans, then reduced that to $200 million. ``Now the $200 million is in
doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the administration should let the Europeans
know that ``we are really disappointed that they have not come through with the
police force they had promised.''
</P>
<P>
	   There is widespread agreement among Europeans that they should be able to
deal with most security threats on the continent. Plans are being made for a
60,000 European-only defense force by the year 2003.

crowds, 129 grenade attacks and 58 mine strikes.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the continued presence of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) ``is
necessary to provide a secure environment for civil implementation to take place
and is key to achieving a lasting peace in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. troops have served in Bosnia since late 1995 and now number about
5,600. Two deadlines set by President Clinton for the return of the troops have
come and gone, and there is no longer a target date for their departure. All
told there are about 24,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, mostly from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 50,000 peace implementation forces in Kosovo, about 6,000 are
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. James Imhofe, R-Okla., said the deployments are ``a terrible drain on
our state of readiness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee chairman John Warner, R-Va., said it may be unrealistic to think
that ethnic reconciliation is possible in either Bosnia or Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he believes the United States has reached a point ``where it
is the responsibility of the Congress to reexamine the goals, their
achievability and what appears to be our open-ended involvement in Bosnia and
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said some European nations in recent months transferred police in the
Balkans to East Timor because that was considered a higher priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner reacted sharply, saying in a raised voice, ``The highest priority is
the protection of our armed forces, who weren't trained to do this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Warner said the European Union promised $500 million to peacekeeping in the
Balkans, then reduced that to $200 million. ``Now the $200 million is in
doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the administration should let the Europeans
know that ``we are really disappointed that they have not come through with the
police force they had promised.''
</P>
<P>
	   There is widespread agreement among Europeans that they should be able to
deal with most security threats on the continent. Plans are being made for a
60,000 European-only defense force by the year 2003.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 31.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today after the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates a modest quarter-percentage point, even as central bankers
warned that inflation remains a threat to the booming U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 31.95 at 11,009.10. The Dow was up about 60 points in
the moments before the Fed released its decision, then dipped as low as 53
points following the widely-expected announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
9.01 at 1,418.29, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 50.78 at 4,102.76.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose after the Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal
funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to
5.75 percent from 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate, the interest that the Fed
charges to make direct loans to banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing
money. That makes it more difficult for businesses to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, investors turned to the stocks that are advancing quickly
enough to outrun rising interest rates, said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are crowding into shares of the companies that they believe will
continue to grow earnings, despite the Fed's tightening of interest rates,"
Acuff said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, that meant technology stocks. Hewlett-Packard gained 5
1/4 to 111 1/16, and IBM rose 4 7/8 to 114 13/16, the strongest of the Dow
components.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! rose 14 5/8 to 332.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading remained highly volatile as investors worried that today's rate
increase might be the first of several this year. In a statement explaining its
decision, the Fed said it continued to be worried that the rapidly growing
economy "could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid
to keep inflation under control, and has suggested it will continue raising
rates until it sees tangible evidence of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   While interest rate concerns dominated Wall Street, investors found little
corporate news to shape the market.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors fell 3 1/4 to 82 after the company named president and chief
operating officer G. Richard Wagoner as chief executive officer, preparing GM
for the retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner rose 6 1/4 to 85 after reporting earnings that beat analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 814.18 million shares, well ahead of
Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.71 to 509.46.

<HEADLINE> Naomi Campbell Guilty of Assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Supermodel Naomi Campbell pleaded guilty Wednesday to an
assault charge for beating her assistant while making a film in Canada in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The 29-year-old Campbell did not attend the court hearing, and her plea was
entered by her lawyer, Brian Greenspan. Under an agreement worked out with the
prosecution, she expressed remorse for the attack and was released without
punishment or a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
	   An assault conviction can bring up to six months in prison or a $1,370 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a just disposition," prosecutor Calvin Barry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell admitted beating assistant Georgina Galanis while in Toronto
filming the movie, "Prisoner of Love."
</P>
<P>
	   Galanis, 39, briefly worked as Campbell's assistant during filming. She has
filed a $2 million lawsuit against Campbell in New York that mentions the
alleged assault in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Galanis, who is from the New York City borough of Queens, said in the
lawsuit that she worked for Campbell for nine days. She said Campbell hit her
twice in the head with a telephone, punched her shoulder twice, grabbed her neck
and violently shook her head.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell previously denied the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Army May Prosecute No Gun Ri Vets  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army has begun interviewing Korean War veterans and
has not ruled out criminal prosecutions as a result of its investigation of the
alleged mass killing of South Korean civilians at No Gun Ri, Army Secretary
Louis Caldera said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Likening the situation to war crimes trials following World War II, Caldera
told the Associated Press, ``We don't want to set a double standard.'' He added,
however, that it is too early to conclude that any actions by American troops at
No Gun Ri at the outset of the Korean War rose to the level of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said Army investigators so far have questioned a few dozen U.S.
veterans from units that were in the area at the time of the alleged killings,
but have not yet talked to those who told the AP last year that a large number
of South Korean refugees were gunned down at the hamlet of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the AP report, which was based on ex-soldiers' statements as well as
declassified U.S. government documents, both U.S. and South Korean officials had
insisted there was no evidence to support the claims. After the report, however,
both the Defense Department and South Korea launched investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said the Army needs to investigate further before deciding whether
criminal prosecutions are warranted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not ruled that out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera, the Army's top civilian official, made these other points in a
wide-ranging interview with the AP:
</P>
<P>
	   --In searching for more effective recruiting methods, the Army has begun
trying to reach more young people who otherwise would move directly from high
school into college. Recruiters also will seek out college students who, for
financial or other reasons, are willing to leave school to join the Army. With
these and other new approaches, the Army's recent slump in recruiting ``will
turn around for us.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The Army's budget for 2001, to be submitted to Congress on Monday, will
include $1 billion for an ambitious effort to transform the service into a
lighter, more mobile force. Caldera would not discuss specifics, but said some
big weapons programs such as the Crusader mobile artillery will be scaled back.
</P>
<P>
	   --Debate over whether gays ought to be allowed to serve openly in the
military is unlikely to be settled during the final year of the Clinton
administration. Caldera said he supports the current ``don't ask, don't tell''
approach of letting gays serve so long as they keep their sexual orientation to
themselves. Those who say that allowing acknowledged gays to serve would
undermine discipline in the military have ``valid concerns.''
</P>
<P>
	   In describing the Army's No Gun Ri investigation, Caldera said officials
have reviewed more than 1 million documents but have not yet approached the
ex-soldiers who have publicly asserted that they knew of -- or participated in
-- deliberate killings of South Korean refugees in the war's opening weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the Army investigators are talking to veterans who had an indirect
connection, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes sense from an investigative perspective to begin your
investigation with those who may have knowledge of the actions of others, that
can shed light on the actions of others, before moving up to those who may
themselves have participated'' in the killings, Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you go directly to the person involved, that person is going to be
represented by counsel, and the first thing they're going to do is ask for
immunity from any prosecution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At some point the Army will have to decide whether to grant some witnesses
limited immunity that would bar prosecutors from using their testimony against
them, he said. He distinguished this from offering complete immunity, which
protects a person from being prosecuted for crimes they testify about.
</P>
<P>
	   In saying the Army did not rule out seeking criminal prosecutions in No Gun
Ri, Caldera noted that the U.S. government supports various international
conventions that try war criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And we go after Nazis and others who perpetrated atrocities in World War
II, and we certainly don't want to set a double standard,'' Caldera said. ``But
we don't know at this point -- by any stretch -- whether this (No Gun Ri) is a
situation that is anywhere near related to those kinds of criminal activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said the Army hopes to finish its No Gun Ri investigation before
June, when both Seoul and Washington will be holding special ceremonies to mark
the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drugs May Reduce Doses  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Powerful new AIDS drugs in development should help
relieve one of the biggest problems of treatment -- the pill burden.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past four years, new treatment combinations have revolutionized
AIDS care, changing HIV infection from a death sentence to a disease that is
treatable, if not curable.
</P>
<P>
	   However, patients must adhere to a tedious and exacting schedule of downing
pills, often more than 20 a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, drugmakers are working on new drugs that require much smaller doses as
well as better versions of the old standbys that can be taken less frequently.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say that if all goes well, over the next two or so years it may be
possible to reduce the pill burden to just four tablets taken once a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most drugs are dosed twice or three times a day for a reason. Once a day is
not enough. The Holy Grail would be to take all your medicines once a day with
as few capsules as possible. We are not so far from that, maybe in the next
couple of years," said Dr. Eugene Sun, head of antiviral drug research at Abbott
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
	   The pill-taking schedule is more than just a nuisance. Those who miss even a
few doses risk losing control over their virus. Without enough medicine in the
bloodstream, HIV comes roaring back, often generating mutant versions that are
resistant to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of all patients who initially respond to treatment eventually
find their virus levels rebounding, and the most common reason for this is
failure to stick to a pill schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say that simpler doses should make treatment more effective as well
as free patients from a sometimes all-consuming obsession with taking their
pills on time.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an important step toward improving compliance and getting away from
the perception of an enormous pill burden," said Dr. Ian Sanne of the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. "We are giving patients back a freedom of
choice in how to live their lives, uninterrupted by taking tablets."
</P>
<P>
	   A key ingredient of most drug regimens is a class of medicines called
protease inhibitors. They are often combined with two or three older kinds of
drugs, such as ddI and AZT.
</P>
<P>
	   At this week's 7th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections
in San Francisco, doctors described results of testing with new varieties of
protease inhihibors. Some of these medicines are 10 times more powerful than the
ones that transformed AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Protease inhibitors are by far the biggest lump in the pill burden.
Typically patients must take three of them three times a day -- a total of nine
pills -- often on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   In the works are protease inhibitors that doctors hope will need to be taken
twice or even just once a day. One of these described Wednesday is Bristol-Myers
Squibb's drug code-named BMS-232632.
</P>
<P>
	   In preliminary testing directed by Sanne, it appears that one or two of
these pills once a day is as effective at suppressing HIV as the standard dose
of nelfinavir, an older protease inhibitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbott presented promising results with its experimental protease inhibitor
ABT-378, showing it seems to work against strains of virus that are already
resistant to other drugs. The drug will be combined with ritonavir, another
protease inhibitor, into pills that will be taken three at a time, twice a day.
The company is working on smaller doses as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Unexpected side effects can quickly derail development of these drugs. Merck
Research Laboratories was scheduled to present results of its new protease
inhibitor at the meeting Wednesday. But two weeks ago, it suspended human
testing of the drug after rat experiments turned up possible kidney damage. The
medicine, called MK-944A, is a combination of a new protease inhibitor and an
older one, called indinavir, into a single pill that would be taken once or
twice a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies are also working on new formulations of older AIDS drugs that
allow them to be taken less frequently. For instance, this week Bristol-Myers
Squibb asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to sell a
once-a-day version of its ddI, a drug that has been on the market since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Celebrates Year in Office  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Celebrating a tumultuous first year in office,
President Hugo Chavez answered his critics on Wednesday in a speech lauding the
accomplishments of his ``social revolution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds lined the streets of the capital, Caracas, as Chavez shook hands on
his way to delivering his address.
</P>
<P>
	   Since taking office, the coup-leader-turned president has become one of the
most talked about and controversial leaders in Latin America, raising the hopes
of Venezuela's poor and the fears of the wealthy who think he has brought the
country to the brink of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   But his reforms have largely failed to improve the lives of ordinary
Venezuelans and his anti-corruption drive has succeeded mainly in decimating the
nation's old political order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've pulled out by their roots the corrupt elites that ran this country
for nearly half a century,'' Chavez told Congress -- at least what's left of it.
</P>
<P>
	   The regular Congress saw its duties sharply curtailed last year by a
constitutional assembly packed with Chavez supporters, and then was shut down
completely in December after a new constitution the assembly drafted was
approved in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   It's been replaced by a 21-member ``mini-Congress'' also made up of Chavez
supporters and will handle the nation's legislative duties until elections for a
new, single house National Assembly are held in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's supporters are expected to dominate those elections, too, since the
two political parties that ruled Venezuela for the last 40 years, Democratic
Action and the social Christian COPEI, are practically dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez, who broke into Venezuela's political scene eight years ago by
staging a failed military coup, has all but destroyed the two parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The assembly that wrote the new constitution also fired hundreds of judges
accused of corruption or incompetence, and appointed a new Supreme Court,
attorney general, comptroller and national elections board. Critics charged the
assembly was overstepping its legal bounds.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Chavez also paid his respects at the grave of his idol, 19th
century independence leader Simon Bolivar, after whom Chavez insisted the
country be named. Over the objections of many, the Republic of Venezuela is now
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   It's all part of a plan by Chavez to concentrate power in his hands and
expand the role of the military, opponents of the president say.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's ``strongman rule and his exercise of power have nearly turned him
into a dictator,'' leading Venezuelan historian Guillermo Moron said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chavez told Congress that his government is merely breaking up a corrupt
oligarchy that has left most people impoverished in a nation with the world's
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The greatest thing is that we have achieved this without a single drop of
blood,'' Chavez declared Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez stood at the same podium where a year ago he stunned Venezuelans by
calling the constitution ``moribund'' during his swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Chavez's rhetoric, most Venezuelans remain impoverished. The
nation's economy shrank a painful 7 percent last year, 1,000 businesses went
bankrupt and 600,000 workers lost their jobs -- even though prices for oil,
Venezuela's main export, more than tripled to $24 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela suffered another devastating setback in December when hours after
the new constitution was approved landslides struck Caracas and the northern
Caribbean coast and left between 5,000 and 30,000 people dead. Economists
calculate the damages at up to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez remains immensely popular, with approval ratings around 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet transforming Venezuela won't be easy. Analysts say many problems such as
nepotism, big government and a dependency on oil revenues have been ingrained in
Venezuelan culture for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be asking too much to assume Chavez can change that in a couple
of years,'' said political analyst Erik Ekvall.

<HEADLINE> Wahid Attends Cabinet Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The standoff between Indonesia's president and
the military intensified Wednesday when the security minister attended a Cabinet
meeting despite the president's demand that he resign.
</P>
<P>
	   President Abdurrahman Wahid insisted during a European tour that his
authority remained intact and that he has ``no personal enemies'' at home. Life
went on as usual in the Indonesian capital, with commerce operating normally and
people in the streets. The military discounted coup rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the conflict between Wahid and Security and Political Affairs
Minister Gen. Wiranto highlights the power struggle between the new, reformist
president and army hard-liners linked to authoritarian ex-President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
	   That friction came to a head Monday when Wahid, who took office in October,
demanded that Wiranto resign. His call followed the release of a government
report that held the former army chief responsible for killing and destruction
in East Timor after its people voted for independence from Indonesia last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto denies any wrongdoing and says the report's authors are biased
against the military.
</P>
<P>
	   The general, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, smiled at
reporters Wednesday but did not comment as he strode into the Cabinet room. Some
ministers expressed sympathy for his stand, and one suggested Wiranto should be
given more time to step down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be fair and good for Wiranto,'' said Human Rights Minister
Hasballah Saad.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, Wahid spoke briefly with reporters. He took only two questions --
neither of which touched on specifically what he would do if Wiranto refuses to
quit. He had said the day before in London that if Wiranto won't leave, he will
``remove him from office'' when he returns to Indonesia on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can handle the country as a whole,'' Wahid said in Paris. ``I do not
have any personal enemies there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Military spokesman Air Vice Marshal Graito Usodo dismissed the possibility
Wednesday that the army might stage a coup in support of Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wiranto is a minister,'' he said. ``The president has the right to choose
or dismiss ministers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, United Nations officials in East Timor said Wednesday they dug 10
bodies from a grave believed to contain the remains of up to 60 people killed by
anti-independence militias backed by Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said the bodies were recovered near
the border town of Pasabe, in the isolated enclave of Oecussi.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups and East Timor's independence leaders want the U.N.
Security Council to set up a tribunal to try those responsible for the violence.
But U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United States, and other countries
have backed Wahid's position that Indonesia should be allowed to conduct any
trials.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto is a former close aide of Suharto, who used the might of the
military to rule for 32 years until he was forced to quit as president after
riots and protests shook the world's fourth-most populous nation in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Blair Seeks Major IRA Disarm Move  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The survival of Northern Ireland's
Protestant-Catholic administration will depend on ``substantial progress'' soon
toward disarming the Irish Republican Army, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair scheduled a meeting Thursday with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern,
as the two governments struggled to calm the crisis imperiling the Cabinet for
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-party coalition Cabinet -- the intended cornerstone of the
province's 1998 peace accord -- finally took shape nine weeks ago as part of a
U.S.-brokered deal. But that deal is now falling apart.
</P>
<P>
	   After behind-the-scenes diplomacy stretching from Belfast to Dublin, London
and Washington, Blair's government was expected to announce Thursday whether the
Cabinet's powers should be transferred back to London to enable fresh
negotiations in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a move was envisaged in November's deadlock-breaking deal produced by
American diplomat George Mitchell. It required the Ulster Unionists to drop
their demand for an IRA arms handover in advance of the Cabinet's formation --
but on condition that IRA disarmament would speedily commence in response.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal specified that Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, chairman of
Northern Ireland's independent disarmament commission, should assess in January
whether his secret negotiations with IRA leaders had borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the British and Irish governments have refused to release the
general's full report since its delivery two days ago, Blair emphasized that it
contained ``insufficient progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Blair said his officials were working ``day and night'' on potential moves
the IRA might offer, and whether these could be sufficient to keep the Ulster
Unionists governing Northern Ireland alongside Sinn Fein. But he didn't sound
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless there is substantial progress, then we have a serious crisis on our
hands,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said President
Clinton strongly urged all parties not to allow the Cabinet to unravel and ``to
understand how harshly history will judge the parties at this point if they turn
back from the progress they made.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he believed Blair was ``going to be
spooked by the unionists into suspending the institutions.'' He said the IRA
would not disarm in those circumstances, and called the Ulster Unionists'
handling of the situation ``disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble emphasized they would be obliged to
resign from the Cabinet within the next week if the IRA refused to disarm and
the British government didn't intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet can't operate without the Ulster Unionists, the biggest party in
Northern Ireland. But rising Protestant hostility to sharing power with Sinn
Fein also means that Ulster Unionists can't count on sufficient support to win
re-election to Cabinet posts in the future.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Planes Strike Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By SAM F. GHATTAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Islamic militants set off a roadside bomb in
southern Lebanon on Wednesday, killing a man and injuring two Israeli-allied
militiamen, despite a string of Israeli air raids intended to halt guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for the bombing, which targeted
a military vehicle belonging to the South Lebanon Army near the village of
Braachit, six miles north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
	   A Lebanese contractor doing construction work for the SLA was killed,
Lebanese security officials said, and another contractor and two militiamen in
the vehicle were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the bombing, SLA militiamen opened fire with mortars and
machine guns, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel carried out air raids throughout the day, apparently to keep the
guerrillas at bay after days of heavy fighting. On Monday, a Hezbollah rocket
attack killed three Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon. The day before, Hezbollah
guerrillas detonated a bomb that killed the No. 2 man in the SLA militia.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighting could aggravate efforts to get peace talks back on track
between Israel and Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon. The talks, which began
in December, were postponed indefinitely last month. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has appealed to Syria and Israel to show restraint.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first airstrike Wednesday, Israeli fighter jets fired two missiles
into a valley between the villages of Chaaitiyeh and Zibqine, apparently in
pursuit of guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the Israeli-occupied zone, the
Lebanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli fighters later struck an olive grove outside the village of Jouaya,
six miles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In a third raid, Lebanese officials said Israeli helicopter gunships strafed
guerrilla infiltration trails near the village of Yater, four miles east of the
first strike.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday evening, Israeli jets fired two rockets at suspected guerrilla
positions about 10 miles northeast of Yater, in the central sector of the
occupied zone, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the security officials and Hezbollah's office in Beirut reported
exchanges of rockets and machine-gun fire in the area that took place around the
time of the Israeli air raids.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed three of the raids, saying planes
struck ``terrorist targets'' and returned safely to base. It did not issue a
statement on the raid reported near Yater.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Bankruptcy Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today passed legislation to raise the
$5.15-an-hour minimum wage by a dollar while reducing people's ability to sweep
away credit card and other debts through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The 83-14 vote was on a broad bankruptcy overhaul bill that also would give
new tax breaks to small businesses and increase penalties for powder cocaine
crimes. The House has passed a similar but narrower bankruptcy bill; the Clinton
administration opposes both versions.
</P>
<P>
	   The vote culminated several hours of drama in which Democrats summoned Vice
President Al Gore to break a possible tie vote on an abortion rights measure.
Republicans dropped their opposition to the amendment upon Gore's arrival at the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour over three years, a
span that Democrats and President Clinton say is too long. They also object to
$76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years that Republicans maintain would help
small businesses deal with the impact of raising the wage floor. The House has
taken no action on a minimum wage increase, but Republican leaders have promised
a vote before November's election.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier today, the Senate voted 80-17 to prohibit people found to have
violated laws protecting abortion clinics from using bankruptcy proceedings to
escape fines and civil judgments. The lopsided voted denied Gore an opportunity
to reaffirm his abortion rights credentials.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, opposing Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has questioned the vice president's commitment to protecting women's
right to choose abortion, citing Gore's votes on abortion measures as a House
member nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this amendment, nobody will be able to politically demagogue this
issue,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
said shortly before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, called Gore's rush back to Washington
``theater'' -- adding, ``the vice president's going to need it'' to win election
in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Grassley's comments prompted Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to say, ``This
issue is not about theater. It is about the very real issue of violence against
women. ... We cannot allow violent extremists to use the bankruptcy code to
carry out'' their agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This issue is so important, I'm not going to take a chance of seeing it
fail,'' Gore said just prior to the vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   The amendment's sponsor, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., cited the case of
Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who filed for bankruptcy court
protection in November 1998, blaming heavy debts owed to women's groups and
abortion clinics that have sued him.
</P>
<P>
	   Partisan fighting over abortion and guns has marked Senate debate on the
legislation, which would make it tougher for people to sweep away their debts
through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., denounced Schumer's proposal Tuesday as an attempt
``to silence the free speech of abortion opponents.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defeated today was an amendment by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., to prohibit gun makers and dealers from erasing debts in
bankruptcy that arose from successful lawsuits against them.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal ``is designed to encourage lawsuits ... and put the firearms
industry in this country out of business,'' said Hatch.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that some two dozen U.S. cities and towns have sued gun makers and
distributors, Levin said the firearms industry ``should not be able to evade
judgments by going bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Senate rebuffed an attempt by some Democrats to make it
harder for high-interest, storefront lenders to collect debts from people who
have filed for bankruptcy relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators voted, 53-44, to reject an amendment proposed by Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., that would have prohibited lending businesses charging more
than 100 percent annual interest in recovering debts from consumers in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   A partisan dispute over a minimum wage increase and tax breaks for small
businesses, meanwhile, threatened to delay final Senate passage of the
legislation to overhaul the bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said a $1 increase in the $5.15
hourly minimum over three years was insufficient. In addition, the White House
and Democratic lawmakers oppose $18.4 billion in small-business tax breaks
proposed by the GOP that are tied to the minimum wage increase.
</P>
<P>
	   If changes are not made, Daschle told reporters, ``I'm concerned that the
bankruptcy bill could be in some jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Voting against the abortion rights amendment were Republican Sens. Wayne
Allard of Colorado, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts of Kansas, Jim Bunning of
Kentucky, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Michael Enzi of Wyoming, Phil Gramm of Texas, Rod
Grams of Minnesota, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas,
Jon Kyl of Arizona, Richard Lugar of Indiana, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Jeff
Sessions of Alabama, Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and
George Voinovich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is campaigning for the Republican
presidential nomination, and Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., did not vote. Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., whose family owns a bank, recused himself by voting
'present.'

<HEADLINE> Alleged Peru Rebels on Crime Spree  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Suspected Shining Path guerrillas have killed three park
rangers and a rancher and robbed passenger buses and cargo trucks in a four-day
crime spree in Peru's central highlands, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the most recent incident, three park rangers were shot Tuesday by masked
assailants in a reserve for vicuna, a small non-domesticated relative of the
llama, about 275 miles southeast of the capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, five masked intruders broke into the home of a rancher in a
nearby village and gunned him down in front of his family.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the Prefect of Ayacucho, the highland department where the
killings took place, said all the victims had their hands bound and each
received a bullet to the head, ``a typical trademark of Shining Path
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials said rebels had stopped several passenger buses and
trucks between Saturday and Tuesday, robbing the occupants of food and cash.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, passengers of a minibus overpowered two of their assailants and
delivered them to authorities, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 60 guerillas last week looted the village of Pucamarca, about 220
miles southeast of Lima, and warned the population not to participate in next
April's presidential elections, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shining Path in the late 1980s and early 1990s almost brought the
Peruvian government to its knees, assassinating mayors and informers in the
countryside and waging a vicious car-bombing campaign in Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's power was diminished with the capture of several high level
leaders. But remnants of the rebel force are still active in the country's
central highlands and jungle.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting has left 30,000 dead since 1980, including soldiers, rebels and
civilians.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Minimum Wage Boost  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teeing up for an election-year fight, the Senate approved
a Republican bill Wednesday that would boost the minimum wage by $1 an hour over
three years, a period of time President Clinton and Democrats say is too long to
wait.
</P>
<P>
	   With many Republicans -- especially in the House -- eager to avoid repeated
campaign-season attacks on the widely popular issue, some increase in the
current $5.15 hourly minimum seems likely to become law before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the White House and Democrats also objecting to the measure's $18
billion in tax cuts over five years -- mostly for small business owners -- it is
unclear what the final version will look like. The GOP's desire to avoid making
the proposal a campaign issue gives Democrats little incentive to quickly settle
for anything less than what they want: a two-year phase-in, with a much smaller
tax package.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not the kind of legislation the president can sign,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart, citing its three-year phase-in and ``a bevy of
unpaid-for tax cuts for the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
	   The minimum wage boost was included in a bill that would overhaul the
nation's bankruptcy laws that the Senate approved by 83-14. The House approved
its own version of the bankruptcy legislation last May, but it lacked any
minimum wage provisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Last November, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a separate GOP
bill that would increase the minimum wage by $1 over three years and includes a
$30 billion, five-year package of tax cuts. Some $16 billion of that price tag
is a reduction in the estate tax paid by upper-income people who inherit
substantial assets.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fate of the House legislation is unclear. With defections likely by
moderate Republicans from urban, northeastern districts, GOP leaders so far lack
the votes to move their version of the bill through the House. They hope to have
a vote on the issue by late March and are insistent on including tax reductions
that they say will offset businesses' costs of paying the higher wages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hate it,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Tuesday when
asked about the minimum wage increase. ``Obviously, we don't have the votes to
stop minimum wage, so we ought to do something that lessens the burden on people
that pay the wages.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 11 million Americans are paid the minimum wage. About half of them are
less than 24 years old, and many hold part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   But more important to the politics of the issue is the proposal's popular
appeal. In a poll taken last spring for the Wall Street Journal and NBC News,
three-fourths of those questioned favored the $1-an-hour increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The potency of the minimum wage as a campaign issue was last illustrated in
1996, which was another campaign year. After initial opposition by many
Republicans, Congress finally voted to raise the wage from $4.25 to its current
$5.15 in two steps.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's Senate bill would increase the wage by 35 cents an hour in March
2000, by 35 cents more in March 2001 and 30 cents in March 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The language was added to the bankruptcy bill last November, after Democrats
tried -- and failed -- to force their own version into the legislation. The
Democratic alternative would have raised the minimum wage by $1 with two 50-cent
increases over 13 months, while also providing $9.6 billion in tax relief and
raising other taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   In a dispute the two parties have fought for decades, Democrats argue that
with many Americans flush from the booming economy, the time is ripe to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   They note that as is, it pays $10,700 a year for 52 40-hour weeks -- $3,200
below the poverty line for a family of three. They also say the difference
between their version and the GOP language would cost each minimum wage earner
$1,200.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The watered-down wage proposal in this bill is an insult to hard-working
men and women,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor of the Democratic
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers argue that raising the minimum wage would help low-income
families by less than meets the eye because many recipients are teenagers, not
parents of low-income families. They also say businesses could eliminate up to
500,000 jobs, rather than increase minimum salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do we get passed a very defensible bill that would not increase the
number of unemployed as dramatically as Kennedy's amendment would do,'' is how
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., described the GOP's task. ``Tax
relief is an important component of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate GOP bill includes health insurance deduction for workers who lack
employer-provided coverage and an immediate 100 percent deduction for the
self-employed. It also would raise the business meal deduction from 50 percent
to 80 percent and make pension rules more generous for many business owners and
higher-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten states and the District of Columbia already require minimum wages above
$5.15 an hour, including a $6.50-an-hour wage paid in Oregon. The other states
are Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Vermont and Washington.

<HEADLINE> India Arms Smugglers Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
   By CHANDRA BANERJEE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- A judge gave life sentences Wednesday to a British
arms dealer and five Latvians who parachuted crates of weapons intended for
revolutionaries into eastern India.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Bleach, the arms trader, and the Latvian crewmen said they would
appeal their convictions to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very disappointed, but not surprised,'' Bleach said outside the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The six were convicted of aiding insurgents who intended to wage war against
India, and procuring and bringing arms into the country five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants also were fined $1,400. A seventh defendant, an Indian, was
acquitted for lack of evidence. All five Latvian men were members of Latvia's
large ethnic-Russian minority. Latvia and Russia said they would push for
leniency.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was closely watched because it touched on the international arms
market and involved some of the most serious charges brought against Western
defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   The six have spent four years in jail since they were arrested for dropping
the arms from a cargo plane onto a field in the eastern Indian state of West
Bengal.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution claimed the assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and
missiles were intended for the Ananda Marg, a fanatical anti-communist Hindu
religious group in West Bengal, a state with a communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge P.K. Biswas said: ``The convicts do not deserve any leniency. It was a
clear case that security and safety of the nation was at stake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bleach argued that he had secretly kept the British intelligence services
informed of the plan to fly arms to India.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they reportedly acknowledge receiving Bleach's tip-off, the British
services say they warned the arms dealer not to get involved. The Ananda Marg
have denied it was the intended recipient of the weapons.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Releases New 'American Pie'  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY McSHANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bye-bye, Miss American Pie. Hello, Madonna.
</P>
<P>
	   The Material Girl released her version of the 1971 classic "American Pie" to
radio stations on Tuesday, a truncated take on Don McLean's 8 1/2-minute rock
'n' roll homage to Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper.
</P>
<P>
	   The song's debut came one day before the anniversary of "the day the music
died": Feb. 3, 1959, when a plane carrying the three young rock stars went down
in an Iowa cornfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna's remake times out at under five minutes, a considerable cut from
the original. And don't worry if you don't remember all the words: The Material
Girl has trimmed some of the verses.
</P>
<P>
	   That's blasphemy to a generation that grew up singing along with McLean's
hodgepodge of images and scenes, lines such as:
</P>
<P>
	   "The jester sang for the King and Queen
</P>
<P>
	   "In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
</P>
<P>
	   "And a voice that came from you and me."
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna's version strays far afield from McLean's simple arrangement.
There's an electronic dance beat, and distant background vocals from actor
Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also "an explosion of interest" from adult contemporary and Top 40
radio stations, which have jumped to add the song to their playlists, said Heidi
Ellen Robinson, spokesman for Madonna's label, Maverick.
</P>
<P>
	   The song is from the soundtrack to Madonna's latest movie, "The Next Best
Thing," which co-stars Everett. The movie opens March 3, while the soundtrack
(in perfect marketing style) arrives in stores Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1971 McLean classic was recently ranked as the 19th best rock song ever
by VH1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Madonna version didn't receive such a ringing endorsement from Newsday
writer Isaac Guzman, who described it as "an almost syrupy, slick take" on
McLean's original.
</P>
<P>
	   The radio release was the first chance for the public to hear the new
version. Madonna was originally scheduled to perform the song at the Super Bowl
but pulled out.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kohl Adviser Quizzed on Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's Christian Democrats said they received new details
Wednesday from an adviser to former Chancellor Helmut Kohl about a web of secret
campaign accounts at the center of a spiraling scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats' tax adviser Horst Weyrauch, considered a key figure
in the scandal, was quizzed for more than six hours by party officials in Bonn,
said the party's general manager, Willi Hausmann.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Weyrauch was ``extraordinarily cooperative'' and provided
``substantial new knowledge'' in the discussion Wednesday. Details of the
meeting would be made public after the information was verified and party
leadership informed, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Kohl refusing to talk about where the money came from, party leaders
had threatened Weyrauch with legal action if he didn't help with unraveling the
millions in covert accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview to be published on Thursday in Die Welt, the ex-chancellor
admitted to knowledge of secret donations beyond the $1 million he had
previously discussed. In the interview, Kohl said he already knew several years
ago about a $50,000 donation that current party chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble
received in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Weyrauch has said the secret accounts stretch back to 1971, the year he
started working for the party and before Kohl took over as party leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Weyrauch told ARD television that ``something new'' was revealed to the
party Wednesday, without being more specific.
</P>
<P>
	   The party said late Wednesday that leaders were to hold a special meeting
Friday in Bonn to discuss Weyrauch's statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Some details about the secret funds have already been trickling out from
Weyrauch over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, he released a statement through his lawyer on the secret funds
that were held by the party branch in Hesse state, which he said amounted to
$10.4 million diverted to a Swiss account. State party leaders previously
admitted transferring $9.6 million abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Tuesday, Weyrauch told ZDF television that the federal branch of the
party also held accounts abroad in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Weyrauch told
ARD that he had often traveled to Switzerland and Liechtenstein for both the
Hesse and federal parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, there were also more disclosures about donations that were never
recorded by the Christian Democrats.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Federal Judges Scrap Bypass Rule  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal judges in the nation's capital have quietly
scrapped a rule that allowed their chief judge to bypass normal random
assignments and send cases involving prominent Democrats to appointees of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   After a lengthy review, the full-time and senior judges for the District of
Columbia rescinded the rule during their closed monthly meeting Tuesday,
according to several officials at the U.S. Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges are developing a new system in which protracted or complex cases
will be randomly assigned from a separate pool of all the judges at the
courthouse, the officials said, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the chief judge for the U.S District
Courthouse in Washington, has been under scrutiny since last summer when The
Associated Press reported she used the rule to bypass the normal computerized
random assignment system in two high-profile Democratic cases.
</P>
<P>
	   AP reported that Johnson had specially assigned the criminal cases of
presidential friends Webster Hubbell and Charlie Trie to judges appointed by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   It was later learned that Johnson directed a total of five Democratic
fund-raising prosecutions to Clinton-appointed judges, plus the Hubbell tax
evasion case.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics questioned whether the special assignments created the appearance of
political favoritism. At the time Johnson assigned the cases, four of the 12
full-time judges at the courthouse were Republican appointees and all eight
senior judges were appointed by presidents other than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson has declined repeated requests for interviews. But in a letter to a
newspaper after the controversy erupted, she said she made the special
assignments to ``move the docket as expeditiously as possible'' and that
politics was ``never a factor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her decisions, nonetheless, caused unrest among her colleagues about the
rarely used rule she invoked to make the special assignments. Congressional
investigators and a federal appeals judge also reviewed Johnson's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who received some of the campaign
fund-raising cases from Johnson, spearheaded the internal courthouse review of
the long-standing rule -- a review that began last April, before the issue
became public. He recommended the rule be abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   The rule stated that criminal indictments can be specially assigned ``if the
chief judge determines ... that the case will be protracted and that the
expeditious and efficient disposition of the court's business requires
assignment of the case on a nonrandom basis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pressure to scrap the rule increased last month when Rep. Howard Coble,
R-N.C., chairman of a House Judiciary Committee panel, disclosed that Johnson
assigned a Clinton judge a case that was not ``protracted'' -- the guilty plea
of prominent Miami businessman Howard Glicken, a former fund-raiser for Vice
President Al Gore. Glicken admitted to two misdemeanors in the fund-raising
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief judge has never said why she bypassed the random assignment system
in Glicken's case.
</P>
<P>
	   Court records show presidential friend Vernon Jordan intervened in the case,
asking the sentencing judge to be lenient. Glicken was given community service
work and probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Friedman-led review began after the Judicial Conference, the
policy-making body for the federal judiciary, last March revoked the 28-year-old
policy that allowed for special assignments of certain cases, saying they raise
concern about ``judge shopping.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a good development,'' New York University law professor Stephen
Gillers said of the judges in Washington killing the rule. ``Even though there
may be some unusual situations in which it makes sense to have a specific
assignment, in the long run, confidence in the justice system will be stronger
if the choice is random.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandals, several high-profile criminal
cases at the courthouse in Washington were specially assigned. In those cases,
juries convicted the defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Hubbell prosecution and the fund-raising cases such as the one
against former Gore fund-raiser Maria Hsia, the judges Johnson assigned the
cases originally tossed out the indictment or key charges in them.
</P>
<P>
	   The decisions were overturned on appeal, but prosecutors lost valuable time.
Testimony in the 2-year-old Hsia case begins Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Israeli Helicopter Deal Stalls  </HEADLINE>
   By BARAK BARFI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A $450 million Israeli purchase of U.S. Apache attack
helicopters has stalled because the United States refuses to give Israel the
helicopter system's sensitive software codes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis said Wednesday they are requesting the codes so they would be
able to modify the helicopters, if necessary, to meet future threats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's obvious we need this information,'' Air Force Chief Maj. Gen. Eitan
Ben-Eliahu said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the United States is concerned that giving Israel the codes would allow
it to modify and sell U.S. technology developed at great expense, a U.S.
official said. The official asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a deal announced last October, Israel was to buy 24 AH-64 Apache
Longbow helicopters, a new version of the Apache equipped with more
sophisticated targeting and radar systems. The first half of the deal is being
held up over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technology increases the helicopter's ability to hone in on targets
and lets it attack them without exposing itself. The current Apache has to leave
its protected position behind hills and in crevices when shooting at targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longbow is also more effective in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis have been eager to acquire the Longbows because of problems
with their current Apache stock. An Israeli air force official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the current model suffers from
structural and design problems and that its transmission and hydraulic systems
were poorly designed.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, an Israeli air force F-16 fighter plane crashed in the Negev
desert after its engine shut down in mid-flight, the army said. The pilot
parachuted to safety, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The safety of the U.S.-manufactured F-16 has been questioned following a
series of crashes last year. Many were blamed on engine failure.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Student Strikers Chide Govt.  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHANNA TUCKMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Radical students occupying Latin America's largest
university accused the government Wednesday of declaring ``war'' against them
after campus security guards and striking students fought a bloody skirmish with
sticks, pipes and rocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives and supporters of the strikers gathered inside the university's
main campus to demand the immediate release of 251 students arrested during the
fighting Tuesday between strikers, anti-strike students and university guards.
Thirty-seven guards were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A war has been declared, and it's against us,'' said a striking art school
student who identified himself only as Carlos. He was manning the barricade of
logs, wires and window frames that has blocked the campus gates for the last
nine months.
</P>
<P>
	   Public pressure has been mounting for an end to the strike, in which a small
group of increasingly radical students have prevented 260,000 of their
classmates from entering the campus. The strike also has shuttered a dozen high
schools operated by the university.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle Tuesday occurred at Justo Sierra High School, which is affiliated
with the university and has been held by the strikers since April 20. About 200
students opposed to the strike forced their way onto the campus and, tossing
rocks and waving sticks, forced the strikers out.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, more strikers arrived, retook the campus and battled
security guards called in to hold it.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested 251 of the strikers and took them to jail or juvenile
detention facilities, depending on their ages. Most were booked on disorderly
conduct or riot counts. Prosecutors have 72 hours to file formal charges against
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The scenes of bloody violence added to mounting pressure to end the strike.
In a poll published by the Mexico City daily Reforma, 63 percent of respondents
said either police or non-striking students should take control of the
university campuses. The poll of 420 city residents had a margin of error of
five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives of the arrested strikers gathered inside the university Wednesday
to demand their release, saying the government had sparked the skirmish.
</P>
<P>
	   Many strikers said they believed the government wouldn't risk an assault on
the main campus because of memories of a 1968 massacre that left hundreds dead.
But some said that if the strikers were evicted, they would resist police -- or
continue the struggle by taking over other campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would have to continue the movement and retake the university,'' said
humanities student Rogelio Aguilar, 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco on Wednesday denied a report that one
person, apparently a guard, had been killed in the previous day's skirmish.
</P>
<P>
	   Ambulance driver Antonio Ramirez told The Associated Press on Tuesday night
that a man died of stab wounds to the chest, and an AP photograph showed a man
with his head and torso covered in a blanket, being removed on a stretcher.
Ramirez could not be reached on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers remained in control of the university's huge main campus, and
refused to reopen it until officials meet their demands for guaranteed
admissions and a loosening of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began in April to protest plans to raise annual tuition from a
few cents to $140. Administrators withdrew the plans for the fee increase, but
strikers later demanded sweeping policy changes.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 37.85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks struggled to a mixed finish today after the Federal
Reserve's widely expected interest-rate increase did little to calm the
turbulent U.S. financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 to close at 11,003.20. The Dow
rose as much as 60 points in the moments before the Fed released its decision,
then bobbed between positive and negative territory for much of the rest of the
session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 0.16 to 1,409.12, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 21.95 to 4,073.93.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,681 up, 1,340 down and 519 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 974.38 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.14 to 509.89.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks gave up early gains after the Fed said it was increasing its target
for the federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other on
overnight loans -- to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   It also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate, the interest that the Fed
charges to make direct loans to banks, to 5.25 percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by raising the cost of borrowing
money. That makes it more difficult for businesses to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, investors turned to the companies that are advancing quickly
enough to outrun rising interest rates, said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are crowding into shares of the companies that they believe will
continue to grow earnings, despite the Fed's tightening of interest rates,"
Acuff said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, that meant technology stocks. Hewlett-Packard and IBM
posted the strongest gains among Dow components.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Yahoo! and Qualcomm rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those are the companies that are driving innovation and improving
productivity for the U.S. work force," said Philip S. Dow, director of equity
strategy at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "They're helping this economic
expansion continue."
</P>
<P>
	   Trading remained highly volatile as investors worried that today's rate
increase might be the first of several this year. In a statement explaining its
decision, the Fed said it continued to be worried that the rapidly growing
economy "could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's
record economic expansion."
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed imposed three quarter-percentage point increases in 1999 in its bid
to keep inflation under control, and has suggested it will continue raising
rates until it sees tangible evidence of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
	   That hampered financial services companies like American Express, which
accounted for much of the Dow's decline. Higher interest rates are especially
damaging to financial companies, which see lending volume slide.
</P>
<P>
	   While interest rate concerns dominated Wall Street, investors found little
corporate news to shape the market.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors fell after the company named president and chief operating
officer G. Richard Wagoner as chief executive officer, preparing GM for the
retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner rose after reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations.
The strong report also lifted shares of America Online, which has stumbled since
it made its bold bid to acquire Time Warner last month.

<HEADLINE> White House Urges China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration waged a two-sided lobbying
campaign on Wednesday, urging Congress to approve a World Trade Organization
deal with China but reject legislation to increase military ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ought not to upset that apple cart,'' Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, said a day after the House overwhelmingly passed the
Taiwan military bill, a measure condemned by China and under a veto threat from
the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger said the administration hoped to work with the Senate in an effort to
prevent the bill from becoming law, suggesting it was needlessly confrontational
with China. No date has been set for Senate consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, approved 341-70 on Tuesday in the House, would lift the
long-standing prohibition on formal U.S-Taiwan military cooperation, increase
Taiwanese attendance at U.S. military academies and require an annual Pentagon
report on the threats faced by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill was watered down from an earlier version to the point where its
impact would be largely symbolic. Berger suggested that by formalizing a
military relationship between the United States and Taiwan, the legislation
would jeopardize the ``one China'' policy that has governed U.S. relations with
both sides of the Taiwan Strait for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' he said in remarks to the Woodrow
Wilson Center, a foreign policy group.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Berger pledged a ``full court press'' by President Clinton
and his national security team on behalf of legislation to grant permanent trade
benefits to China.
</P>
<P>
	   That status now must be reviewed annually for China even though it is
routinely conferred on other U.S. trading partners. Permanent trade status for
China is part of a package to complete China's entry into the 135-member World
Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization that sets rules for world
trade.
</P>
<P>
	   After the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle and a determined
campaign by organized labor and environmental groups against the measure,
Clinton faces a tough sell in persuading Congress to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., predicted earlier this week
that the legislation would be approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger said that giving China permanent trade relations would ``get us out
of the cycle we are now in, where the future of Chinese trade comes up every
single year for a divisive and not very effective vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the renewal of trade benefits for China has come up in Congress
each year for the past 20 years, Congress never has voted to withdraw the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Threatening to withhold trade benefits ``is like a nuclear bomb. It's not
very good for what's happening in China,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a top Taiwanese presidential adviser said Wednesday that it would
be a ``terrible blunder'' for China to threaten Taiwan during next month's
election as it did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any act of intimidation or use of force against Taiwan would simply be
counterproductive,'' John H. Chang said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no indication China is preparing to launch missiles and conduct war
games near the island like it did in the run-up to Taiwan's 1996 presidential
elections. That intimidation campaign backfired as the Taiwanese overwhelmingly
electing Beijing's nemesis, Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, rhetoric has been heating up between mainland China and Taiwan as the
island prepares for its election March 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, CIA Director George Tenet told the Senate Intelligence Committee
that because of the increased tensions, ``we see high potential for another
military flare-up across the Taiwan Strait this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that China had been increasing the ``size and sophistication'' of
its forces arrayed along the Strait, including deploying short-range ballistic
missiles. China should receive the first of two modern Russian-built destroyers
later this month, and ``we expect the ship to join the East Sea Fleet, which
regularly conducts operations near Taiwan,'' Tenet said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Ask For 2-Year Budget  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers pressed Wednesday for
adoption of a two-year budget cycle, saying it would give Congress more time to
oversee the programs it funds and ensure that federal money is spent wisely.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said the ``long-overdue common-sense reform''
could be ``the most sweeping change in the budget process in the last quarter
century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress now spends much of its time on the annual process of drawing up a
budget and passing the 13 appropriations or spending bills. Lawmakers rarely
finish by the Oct. 1 beginning of the fiscal year; last year they completed
their work 50 days late.
</P>
<P>
	   The numerous biennial budgeting bills introduced in the House and Senate
would, as in some 20 state governments, have Congress devote the first year of a
two-year session to approving a budget. In the second year, lawmakers would
oversee programs to ensure they are being run well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to spend less time putting together a budget that spends the
taxpayers' money and more time making sure that taxpayer dollars are spent
wisely,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said the biennial budget would alleviate ``the gridlock so
often caused by our annual confrontations over budget and appropriations.''
</P>
<P>
	   One longtime supporter of the change is the chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, Republican Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example of the inefficiencies of the current system, he noted that the
Army Corps of Engineers produced eight volumes, 2,000 pages, as part of its $3.7
billion budget proposal for 2000. He said in many cases 90 percent of the budget
requests are unchanged from previous years.
</P>
<P>
	   Dreier got 245 House members, more than half the House, to sign onto a
non-binding resolution that the issue should be taken up this year. The idea has
some powerful backers, including President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce on Tuesday, said he was ``very much for biennial budgeting. ... This
year I think we're actually going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also endorsing the idea was House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who
said Tuesday he did not think it could get passed in the second year of a
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
	   Resistance to the biennial budget generally comes from members of the
appropriations committees and others unwilling to surrender their annual shot at
influencing federal spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics also argue the biennial budget lacks the flexibility to cope with
sudden economic changes, wars or disasters. Supporters counter that supplemental
budgets can be passed to handle emergencies.
</P>
<P>
	   That support ranges from conservatives to moderates to liberals and ``puts
pressure to bear on the leadership,'' said Rep. Karen McCarthy, D-Mo.

<HEADLINE> DNA Chips Used to Identify Cancer  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT KOHLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Scientists say they can more precisely diagnose cancers with a new
technology that uses computers to rapidly monitor the activity of thousands of
genes in cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
	   That kind of detailed information should one day let doctors classify tumors
with more precision, helping them tailor treatments to each patient, scientists
say.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, doctors diagnose cancer by looking at tissue under the microscope
for certain biological changes and by doing other tests. The new technique,
however, goes beyond those methods to look at the activity of many tumor genes.
</P>
<P>
	   "You could think of it as a new kind of microscope" that looks at gene
activity instead of the visible structure of cells and tissues, said Dr. Patrick
Brown, an associate biochemistry professor at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   In Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, Brown and colleagues from
Stanford, the National Cancer Institute and elsewhere describe one of the first
large-scale experiments with the technology. They used glass chips the size of a
penny to keep track of how active each of 18,000 tumor genes were.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers focused on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a type of caner
diagnosed in more than 25,000 Americans each year. They uncovered two distinct
forms of that disease, distinguishable by different patterns of gene activation.
By checking records of previously treated patients, they found that one form was
deadlier than the other.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings help explain why two-fifths of patients with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma can be cured with standard chemotherapy while the rest often
relapse or die, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technique works because active genes in a cell give off chemical
messages. These messages will bind to specific DNA segments, depending on what
gene they came from. The glass chips carried some 18,000 DNA segments,
representing each gene the scientists wanted to monitor.
</P>
<P>
	   So by tracking which DNA segments attracted the chemical messages, and how
many messages bound to each segment, the technology revealed how active each of
the studied genes was.
</P>
<P>
	   The results need confirmation in larger studies but establish an important
principle, said Dr. Todd Golub of the Whitehead Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   "It suggests that we are really at the tip of the iceberg and that our
expectation going forward is that there will be similar stories emerging for all
common human cancers," Golub said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an accompanying Nature commentary, Anton Berns of the Netherlands Cancer
Institute agreed patients should someday benefit by genetic analysis. But he
cautioned that such analysis may not able to predict how cancers will behave
after the initial treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   DNA chips also hold promise for cutting the price of treatment. Someday, a
DNA chip that costs less than $100 could take the place of a barrage of current
tests, said Pat Brown, an associate biochemistry professor at Stanford who also
was part of the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "The actual technology is cheap, very cheap," he said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Liability Limit Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though President Clinton may ultimately veto the measure,
the House passed a bill Wednesday that creates an 18-year liability limit when
manufacturers are sued by workers who have been injured by aging equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said that in an age of ``frivolous lawsuits,'' the measure was
needed, arguing that machines are often resold or modified without a
manufacturer's knowledge. But critics called the measure ``unfair'' to American
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have left workers out to dry,'' Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio,
said before the measure passed 222-194. ``It (the bill) provides more protection
for machines than people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said. ``This malicious bill threatens worker
safety.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, and the bill's sponsor, said endless lawsuits
cost businesses, employees and consumers. ``A very significant amount of the
money that's won or settled ends up in the lawyers' pockets.''
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, said Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, ``If a product is used safely for
a substantially long period of time, it is not likely it was defective when
originally purchased. It's more likely the product was either misused or not
well maintained.''
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans have led the push for liability reform, but the bill's
future in the Senate is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has already indicated President Clinton will veto the
measure, said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill covers workplace goods like machine tools, printing presses and
farm equipment. It bars suing manufacturers of those products for incidents that
occur 18 years after it was delivered to its first purchaser.
</P>
<P>
	   Exempted from the bill are workers who do not qualify for any form of
workers' compensation and products with warranties that guarantee the life or
safety of the product for more than 18 years. The bill would not affect products
such as automobiles and commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen states currently have similar laws on the books, although all are
for a period less than 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress passed a similar 18-year liability measure in 1994 to protect the
small aircraft industry from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill will not cause injured parties to go uncompensated,'' said Rep.
Mark Green, R-Wis. ``It separates out the least productive portion. . . the
litigation driven costs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unions have campaigned against the bill. John Irvine, spokesman for the
American Federation of Government Employees, called the measure ``a dangerous
bill that will eliminate workers' rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would also allow employers and innocent bystanders to sue for
damages, while eliminating workers, Michael E. Mathis, government affairs
director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters complained in a letter
to lawmakers. ``This makes no sense.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Bankruptcy Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation Wednesday
making it harder for people to sweep away credit card and other debts through
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The 83-14 vote was on a bill that also would raise the hourly minimum wage
to $6.15 over three years, give billions in new tax breaks to small businesses
and increase penalties for powder cocaine crimes. The House last year passed a
similar bill, also with a veto-proof margin, which is limited to bankruptcy
provisions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This bill will end the free ride for wealthy freeloaders and deadbeats who
walk away from their debts,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill applies a new standard for determining whether people filing for
bankruptcy should be forced to repay their debts under a court-approved
reorganization plan rather than having them abrogated. If a debtor is found to
have sufficient income to repay at least 25 percent of his or her debts over
five years, a reorganization plan generally would be required.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration, which supports rewriting the bankruptcy laws in
principle, has criticized both versions because it believes they are too hard on
debtors. The White House also opposes the business tax breaks and wants to see
the minimum wage increase over a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
	   House and Senate negotiators now must iron out differences between the two
bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate vote culminated several hours of drama in which Democrats
summoned Vice President Al Gore to break a possible tie vote on an abortion
rights measure attached to the bankruptcy bill. Republicans dropped their
opposition to the amendment upon Gore's arrival at the Capitol; it sailed
through by an 80-17 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The bankruptcy legislation has been pushed by banks, credit card companies
and retail-business groups. Proponents say the bankruptcy overhaul is needed to
stem abuse by people who can afford to repay their debts.
</P>
<P>
	   They point to the rise in personal bankruptcies of Americans in recent
years, which reached a record 1.4 million in 1998, despite the strong economy,
up more than 300 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   The rate declined last year, though, as an estimated 112,000 fewer people
received bankruptcy court protection than in 1998. Some consumer advocates have
attributed the decline largely to consumers speeding up repayment of their
credit card debts.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and other opponents maintain the legislation favors
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt. They insist
that the credit card companies share the blame by flooding consumers with mailed
solicitations to entice them into easy credit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Senate bankruptcy bill is a triumph for the credit card industry but a
disaster for consumers who responsibly use the bankruptcy system,'' said former
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the Consumer Federation of America.
``It will deny many families in financial crisis a fresh start while spurring
more reckless and irresponsible lending by credit card issuers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has taken no position on the
bankruptcy legislation, noted the aggressive marketing of credit cards in his
testimony at the Senate hearing on his renomination last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Children, dogs, cats and moose are getting credit cards,'' he told the
Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation includes a requirement that credit card companies explain to
customers in their monthly statements how long it would take to pay off balances
if they make only the minimum required payments.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drugs May Reduce Doses  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Powerful new AIDS drugs in development should help
relieve one of the biggest problems of treatment -- the pill burden.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past four years, new treatment combinations have revolutionized
AIDS care, changing HIV infection from a death sentence to a disease that is
treatable, if not curable.
</P>
<P>
	   However, patients must adhere to a tedious and exacting schedule of downing
pills, often more than 20 a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, drugmakers are working on new drugs that require much smaller doses as
well as better versions of the old standbys that can be taken less frequently.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say that if all goes well, over the next two or so years it may be
possible to reduce the pill burden to just four tablets taken once a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most drugs are dosed twice or three times a day for a reason. Once a day is
not enough. The Holy Grail would be to take all your medicines once a day with
as few capsules as possible. We are not so far from that, maybe in the next
couple of years," said Dr. Eugene Sun, head of antiviral drug research at Abbott
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
	   The pill-taking schedule is more than just a nuisance. Those who miss even a
few doses risk losing control over their virus. Without enough medicine in the
bloodstream, HIV comes roaring back, often generating mutant versions that are
resistant to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of all patients who initially respond to treatment eventually
find their virus levels rebounding, and the most common reason for this is
failure to stick to a pill schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say that simpler doses should make treatment more effective as well
as free patients from a sometimes all-consuming obsession with taking their
pills on time.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an important step toward improving compliance and getting away from
the perception of an enormous pill burden," said Dr. Ian Sanne of the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. "We are giving patients back a freedom of
choice in how to live their lives, uninterrupted by taking tablets."
</P>
<P>
	   A key ingredient of most drug regimens is a class of medicines called
protease inhibitors. They are often combined with two or three older kinds of
drugs, such as ddI and AZT.
</P>
<P>
	   At this week's 7th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections
in San Francisco, doctors described results of testing with new varieties of
protease inhihibors. Some of these medicines are 10 times more powerful than the
ones that transformed AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Protease inhibitors are by far the biggest lump in the pill burden.
Typically patients must take three of them three times a day -- a total of nine
pills -- often on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   In the works are protease inhibitors that doctors hope will need to be taken
twice or even just once a day. One of these described Wednesday is Bristol-Myers
Squibb's drug code-named BMS-232632.
</P>
<P>
	   In preliminary testing directed by Sanne, it appears that one or two of
these pills once a day is as effective at suppressing HIV as the standard dose
of nelfinavir, an older protease inhibitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbott presented promising results with its experimental protease inhibitor
ABT-378, showing it seems to work against strains of virus that are already
resistant to other drugs. The drug will be combined with ritonavir, another
protease inhibitor, into pills that will be taken three at a time, twice a day.
The company is working on smaller doses as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Unexpected side effects can quickly derail development of these drugs. Merck
Research Laboratories was scheduled to present results of its new protease
inhibitor at the meeting Wednesday. But two weeks ago, it suspended human
testing of the drug after rat experiments turned up possible kidney damage. The
medicine, called MK-944A, is a combination of a new protease inhibitor and an
older one, called indinavir, into a single pill that would be taken once or
twice a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies are also working on new formulations of older AIDS drugs that
allow them to be taken less frequently. For instance, this week Bristol-Myers
Squibb asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to sell a
once-a-day version of its ddI, a drug that has been on the market since 1991.

<HEADLINE> India Approves Controversial Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The government gave filmmaker Deepa Mehta fresh
approval Wednesday to shoot her movie about an Indian widow trying to rejoin
society, after a few "alterations" were made in the script, news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The filming of "Water," the third in a controversial trilogy by Mehta, was
disrupted last week when a mob of Hindu nationalists ransacked the movie set,
accusing the filmmaker of distorting traditions in her depiction of Indian
widows in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
	   After the attack, the state government withdrew permission to shoot the film
in Varanasi and urged the federal government to review the script. The city,
with its many temples, is considered one of India's oldest and holiest.
</P>
<P>
	   Mehta rushed to New Delhi to seek the help of Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's government while vociferous opposition to the film, from people
affiliated to his party, continued in Varanasi. The city, 420 miles east of New
Delhi, is located in Uttar Pradesh state, which is ruled by Vajpayee's Bharatiya
Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval came after a meeting with Information and Broadcasting Minister
Arun Jaitley, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mehta is free to resume shooting, Jaitley said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am given to understand that the ministry has communicated this to the
Uttar Pradesh government. I hope this puts and end to this controversy," Mehta
said, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of five sentences were removed from the script, the United News of
India said. The altered script was then personally approved by Vajpayee, the
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some words used in the dialogue of my film 'Water' are being misinterpreted
to give it a meaning which has never been intended. In order to avoid any
ambiguity, I have submitted a fresh proposal wherein I have changed some words
in the script to avoid any scope of misinterpretation," Mehta said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, radical Hindus protesting the film burnt Mehta in effigy
in Varanasi while demanding the government ban the movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaushal Upadhyaya, president of the Varanasi unit of the World Hindu
Council, said his organization wouldn't allow the shooting to resume until they
were satisfied with the changes made in the script, PTI said.

<HEADLINE> Dying Cancer Kids Suffer Needlessly  </HEADLINE>
    By JANET McCONNAUGHEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Children dying of cancer often suffer needlessly because their doctors and
families refuse to give up hope of curing them, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   It's entirely understandable: "The life of the child is so precious, it's
hard to give that up," said Dr. Joanne Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
	   But that approach can -- and should -- be changed, said Wolfe, an instructor
in pediatric oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital
and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe's study of suffering among children with cancer was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard fact is that one-quarter of all children diagnosed with cancer will
die of it. That is considerably better than it used to be -- 30 years ago, the
death rate was 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the researchers talked to parents of 103 children who had died of
cancer between 1990 and 1997, they were told that 92 had suffered "a great deal"
or "a lot" from at least one symptom. More than half had suffered significantly
from at least three symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatigue, pain, trouble breathing and poor appetite were the most common
complaints. Nausea and vomiting, constipation and diarrhea were next. More than
80 percent of the children hurt. Most of them were treated for the pain, but
only 27 percent of those felt better.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty of the children were still getting cancer treatments, such as
radiation, chemotherapy or a bone-marrow transplant, in their last month alive.
Seven died in the bone-marrow transplant unit.
</P>
<P>
	   "For most children with cancer, the primary goal of treatment is to achieve
a cure," Wolfe wrote. "Considerations of the toxicity of the therapy, the
quality of life, and growth and development are usually secondary to this goal."
</P>
<P>
	   The findings indicate that doctors and parents "were pushing for a cure even
to the end, not knowing exactly when to stop," said Marilyn Hockenberry-Eaton,
an associate professor of pediatric hematology and oncology at Baylor Medical
School and director of nurse practitioners at Texas Children's Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
	   She praised the article.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have created very successful treatments for childhood cancer, but on the
way, something's had to go," she said. One of those things, she said, is a focus
on relieving symptoms of terminally ill children.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like its overlooked, but it's not emphasized," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hockenberry-Eaton said parents often do not want their children to get
opiates for pain, either because they are afraid of addiction, or because it
seems to represent acknowledgment that the disease is terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   Early findings from the study prompted Dana-Farber and Children's to set up
a team in 1997 to help parents, doctors and nurses ease the hurt for dying
children.
</P>
<P>
	   The team created a worksheet to help parents, doctors and nurses recognize
symptoms and treat them. It is working on a diary to help parents keep track of
the symptoms and treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   It has helped parents figure out how to let a toddler visit her dying
brother, also a toddler, without scarring her emotionally. And with the same
parents, the team discussed the painful question of when to stop treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes people think that will extend life, but in this case it would
only have increased his suffering," said Janet Duncan, an oncology nurse at
Children's. "So the family was able to do that, and make handprints with him
that they could keep, and really be together to say their goodbyes."

<HEADLINE> Group Aims To Help Disaster Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new coalition of insurance companies, governments,
universities and non-governmental organizations has signed on to a World Bank
effort to try to reduce the cost of natural disasters to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``ProVention Consortium,'' officially launched at World Bank
headquarters on Wednesday, aims to help poor countries -- many of which cannot
afford to insure their public buildings -- rebuild their infrastructure after
earthquakes, floods and other kinds of catastrophes, and lessen the impact of
future disasters.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 1 billion people worldwide live in shanty towns, which have
substantially higher death tolls from natural catastrophes than the housing
found in industrialized nations, said Alcira Kreimer, a World Bank official who
leads the consortium.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, said Kreimer, ``Ninety-six percent of deaths from natural
disasters occur in the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the partnership say promoting tougher building codes, mandatory
insurance and more effective land management are some of their main objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the program, some of the world's largest insurance companies say
they will provide lower-cost insurance for participating nations. Industrialized
nations, such as the United States, Japan and members of the European Union,
have pledged to contribute expertise and funding.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, non-governmental organizations like the Red Cross/Red Crescent
and universities, like the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, will
work with governments of developing nations to create emergency management plans
in advance of disasters, and to increase public awareness of disaster-related
risks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airmen Patrol Iraq Safely  </HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS MEIXLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH OF THE TURKISH-IRAQI BORDER (AP) -- Air Force 1st Lt. Chris McCarthy
flashes a thumbs up and pulls his F-15 Eagle away from an aerial refueler and
toward northern Iraq, where he patrols a no-fly zone with heat-seeking missiles
tucked under the wings of his fighter.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby, other F-15s gulp down a few more gallons of fuel from the tanker and
prepare to prowl the skies of northern Iraq carrying 2,000-pound guided bombs.
Those aircraft will pound any Iraqi anti-aircraft unit that dares threaten
McCarthy or the other men in his Wild Boars squadron.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. airmen have been guarding the no-fly zone over northern Iraq for nearly
a decade. They have flown an average of 500 sorties a month for the past two
years, setting out whenever the weather permits.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a mission that has been largely successful; Iraq rarely flies its
aircraft over the zone and no U.S. aircraft have gone down. U.S. aircraft have
also carried out some 90 strikes against Iraqi anti-aircraft targets during the
past year.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is a strategy fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi gunners threaten U.S. aircraft an average of once or twice a week by
opening fire or turning on targeting radar. The latest incident was Monday, when
Iraqi gunners fired artillery at U.S. jets, which responded by striking a site
near Bashiqah, some 250 miles north of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq claims more than 100 civilians have been killed in attacks on Iraqi
anti-aircraft positions, a number the U.S. military says is greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Politically, the patrols seem to have humiliated President Saddam Hussein by
denying him the use of his own airspace, but the Iraqi leader appears to be
firmly in power.
</P>
<P>
	   The patrols have maintained ``a symbolic knife in the back of the dictator
... rather than effecting any great change on the ground,'' said William
Hopkinson of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
</P>
<P>
	   The no-fly zone was set up in 1991 to protect rebellious Iraqi Kurds from
Saddam's forces. A similar zone was set up over southern Iraq a year later and
is also patrolled by U.S. and British aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   The job of patrolling the zones became far more dangerous in December 1998,
when Iraqi gunners began routinely firing on the American and British jets.
</P>
<P>
	   But pilots say there recently has been a slight decrease in Iraqi attempts
to shoot down planes, a development they say is mostly due to the poor weather.
Iraqi gunners usually don't turn on their radar, which can be instantly detected
by U.S. planes, but fire heavy machine guns or artillery that they aim by sight.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a few British planes fly refueling and reconnaissance missions, the
vast majority of the sorties over the northern zone are flown by Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just kind of tune out the `It's been going on for 10 years,''' said Lt.
Col. Mark Larson, an F-15 pilot with the Bold Tigers squadron. ``We're focused
on our mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. pilots try to steer clear of anti-aircraft weapons in civilian areas
and say they only drop precision weapons that are guided to their targets by
lasers or television cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, pilots aiming at sites in populated areas tried to avoid
civilian casualties by dropping bombs filled with concrete -- meaning they
didn't explode but crushed their targets. Concrete bombs have not been used
since Brig. Gen. Bob DuLaney took command of the northern air patrols in
October, he said. He refused to say why.
</P>
<P>
	   Most pilots are rotated out after 90 days, a move that officers says keeps
morale high. Many are also volunteers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to be where the action is,'' said Larson of Mercer Island, Wash.
``We drop bombs back home on the training range, but this is where it happens.''
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly added, however, that ``it would be a different perspective ... if
we were losing jets every day.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy, of Midwest City, Okla., returned home to Incirlik air base in
southern Turkey on Sunday after an uneventful mission.

<HEADLINE> Putin Unmoved by Albright on Gronzy  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- In the highest-level U.S. contact with Russia's new leader,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to persuade Vladimir Putin during
three hours of debate Wednesday to pull back in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we are any closer to a political solution on Chechnya,''
Albright said after Kremlin meeting, originally scheduled for about 60 minutes.
``Neither of us minced words.''
</P>
<P>
	   She complimented Putin as a Russian patriot with a ``problem-solving
approach,'' while expressing frustration at her inability to convince the former
security service chief that the blitz in Chechnya was isolating Russia
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Putin said at a picture-taking session that ``the United
States is putting certain pressures on Russia,'' but that he remained committed
to his policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have been ups and downs in our relationship,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   They debated the military offensive and Russia's suspicions about a
space-based weapons program that President Clinton may approve in the summer.
Meantime, Russian forces backed by tanks and artillery were battling to prevent
Chechen militants from reaching rebel forces in the mountains south of Grozny,
the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said he was interested in greater self-rule for the Chechens and for
stability in the area, Albright said, ``but I didn't hear how he intended to get
from here to there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, she told reporters, Putin authorized Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to
pursue a U.S. proposal to send a mission to Chechnya to make what Albright
called a ``humanitarian needs assessment.'' Putin also ``took on board'' her
suggestion that more reporters be permitted to go to the embattled republic,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, she described the meeting as intense but pleasant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was obviously on top of all the issues that we talked about,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin tossed aside the cue cards customarily prepared for discussions of
complex and sensitive issues and was ``a very good interlocutor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed to draw a contrast with Boris Yeltsin, whose last years as
president were hampered by heart trouble and other problems. Yeltsin resigned
New Year's Eve and named Putin his successor until elections are held in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody is engaged in psychobabble about him,'' Albright said.
``Everybody ought to watch what he does.''
</P>
<P>
	   A senior U.S. official who attended the meeting described Putin as ``soft
spoken and steely.'' He said the acting president promised to try to reform
Russia's tax code, which has been the target of complaints by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, he pledged to push for ratification by the Russian parliament of the
1993 START II treaty to make deep cuts in U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear
warheads, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright appealed in the meeting and earlier in a speech for Russia to do
more to control its export of nuclear technology. She told future Russian
diplomats at their academy that Russia had made a solid start, at least on
paper, with a new export control program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far more needs to be done to address this serious problem -- a commitment
at all levels to better implementation, better enforcement, better control of
exports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, she said Russia and the United States shared an interest in
preventing the spread of nuclear and ballistic missile capability in the Middle
East and on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries, she said, should eliminate their stockpiles of deadly
chemical weapons,
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know we are going through a kind of strange period in U.S.-Russian
relations,'' Albright said in a response to a question after the speech. ``But I
hope very much we will get through it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also offered assurances that ``the United States is seeking
partnership, not dominance,'' in its relationship with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   From Moscow, Albright met with officials in Croatia to signal U.S. support
for some recent democratic trends in the Balkans country. She backed up the
praise with a promise to boost U.S. assistance to $20 million this year from $12
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now every government of the world can have confidence that the Croatian
leadership truly represents the will of the people,'' she told reporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Suspected Shining Path rebels killed three park rangers
and robbed passenger buses and cargo trucks during a rash of attacks in Peru's
central Andes, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The rangers were shot Tuesday by masked assailants in a reserve for vicuna,
a small non-domesticated relative of the llama, about 275 miles southeast of the
capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, five masked intruders broke into the home of a rancher in a
nearby village and gunned him down in front of his family.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the Prefect of Ayacucho, the highland department where the
killings took place, said all the victims had their hands bound and had been
killed by a single bullet to the head, a ``trademark of Shining Path'' rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels also stopped several passenger buses and trucks between Saturday
and Tuesday, robbing the occupants of food and cash, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, passengers of a minibus captured two of their assailants and
turned them in to authorities, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shining Path raged during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the
widespread attacks, assassinations of mayors and informers and a vicious
car-bombing campaign in Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, the group's power was diminished with the capture of
several high level leaders.

<HEADLINE> CDC Director Sorry for Misued Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The director of one of the government's largest health
agencies apologized Wednesday for misleading Congress about how scientists spent
some money earmarked to fight deadly hantavirus. But he insisted the diverted
funds were well spent to fight other killer viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   The apology by Jeffrey Koplan, director of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, is his second since the fall. In October, he acknowledged the
CDC misspent about half of the $22.7 million it had received from Congress to
study chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest case, some of the $7.5 million that Congress intended to help
fight hantavirus each year was spent by the CDC to investigate other outbreaks
of mysterious killers, Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the outbreaks Koplan cited included the CDC's investigation last
summer of the Nipah virus that killed more than 100 people in Malaysia, an
outbreak spread by pigs that experts feared could have quickly spread around the
globe if not stemmed.
</P>
<P>
	   That is not to say that continuing to investigate hantavirus is not
important, Koplan said. The disease first appeared as a frightening 1993
outbreak, when otherwise healthy adults suddenly began suffocating from a
disease that filled their lungs with fluid. CDC ``disease detectives'' quickly
discovered the culprit was a never-before-seen strain of hantavirus spread by a
type of mouse, and worked to stem the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantavirus still does strike; it sickened 24 people last year.
</P>
<P>
	   But the CDC lacks the emergency funds to cover outbreaks of the Ebola virus
and numerous other mysterious killers that it is called upon to investigate
around the world, and thus must sometimes juggle spending on continuing studies
of one disease to cover a crisis, Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money was spent on very important public health issues,'' he stressed,
noting that fighting mysterious outbreaks in other countries helps keep some
killers from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is that CDC employees then filed budget documents with Congress
that did not acknowledge a yet-to-be-determined amount of the $7.5 million in
hantavirus funding was spent elsewhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmaker who oversees CDC spending said Wednesday that misleading
Congress about how taxpayer money is spent is a serious charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress never told CDC it had to spend all $7.5 million each year on
hantavirus, said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee that funds CDC.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have no problem at all with their doing something they think is more
important with the money than we might think is important. That's scientific
judgment,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has ordered Koplan and the CDC employees responsible for the budget
reports to Congress to appear at a hearing next week to explain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have basically not communicated the truth to us,'' Porter said.
``This is the second time in a very short period of time we find the money has
been spent in ways other they represented it was being spent.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it is important to uncover ``if we don't have an agency that is
going to tell Congress the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Wednesday the Justice Department should launch
a criminal investigation of CDC's budget practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan said CDC employees did not intend to mislead Congress, but that as
the agency's budget grew, its accounting practices got sloppy. He began
investigating CDC accounting practices in wake of the chronic fatigue issue, and
said he recently sent budget documents to Congress to begin clarifying how the
hantavirus money was spent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not saying that's an excuse for not having done it sooner,'' he said.
But ``I apologize for our not having informed Congress quickly about the way we
were using those funds.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Director Details World Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George Tenet, in an annual appearance before
the Senate intelligence committee to outline world threats, said the world
remains a dangerous place more than a decade after the end of the Cold War and
that technology and the rising threat of terrorism has only increased that
danger. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --INDIA-PAKISTAN. Deep-seated rivalries persist among the world's two newest
declared nuclear powers. The October coup in Pakistan that brought a military
leader to power makes it even less likely that India will be willing to resume
peace talks. ``Pakistanis are equally suspicious of India's newly elected
coalition.'' Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues through the winter in disputed
Kashmir, with ``potential to fuel a wider and more dangerous conflict.''
</P>
<P>
	   --NORTH KOREA. North Korea may already have the theoretical capability of
delivering ``a small biological or chemical weapon to the United States,'' and
may soon be capable of delivering a nuclear payload. Given North Korea's
economic woes and a population losing confidence in its rulers, ``sudden,
radical, and possibly dangerous change remains a real possibility... and that
change could come at any time.''
</P>
<P>
	   --RUSSIA. Russia's economic difficulties ``continue to weaken the
reliability'' of its system for controlling its nuclear arsenal. ``We have no
evidence that weapons are missing in Russia, but we remain concerned by reports
of lax discipline, labor strikes, poor morale and criminal activities at nuclear
storage facilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   --THE CAUCASUS AND CENTRAL ASIA. With the conflict in Chechnya forcing a
stream of refugees into neighboring areas and with economies stagnating and
organized crime on the rise, ``the region could become a breeding ground for a
new generation of Islamic extremists, taking advantage of increasing
dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
	   --IRAN. Iran's government will remain hostile to U.S. interests, at least
for now; and the regime will ``probably'' have ballistic missile capable of
delivering a ``light payload to the United States'' within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
	   --IRAQ. Despite a worsening economy, increasing domestic unrest and U.S. and
British enforcement of no-fly zones, Saddam Hussein has ``shown himself to be
politically agile enough to weather these challenges.'' Major worries are
Saddam's reconstruction of suspected weapons sites destroyed in Operation Desert
Fox, missile development work, and the fact that Iraq continues to have a
conventional military that remains the largest in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   --THE BALKANS. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ``hold on power has
not been seriously shaken in the past few months.'' He still controls the
military, his inner circle remains ``loyal or at least cowed,'' and he controls
an ``effective media machine.'' This comes as Serbia has become the poorest
country in Europe in the aftermath of the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   --CHINA. There is ``high potential for another military flare-up across the
Taiwan Strait'' this year, with the catalyst being the March 18 elections in
Taiwan. China has been building up its forces arrayed along the Strait.
</P>
<P>
	   --INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. The United States' attraction as a terrorist
target continues to increase. Fugitive Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden,
continuing to operate out of Afghanistan, is ``still foremost'' among terrorists
feared by the U.S. intelligence community. ``Everything we have learned recently
confirms our conviction that he wants to strike further blows against America.''

<HEADLINE> Marriage Penalty Tax Relief Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid strong opposition from President Clinton, a House
panel pushed ahead Wednesday with a 10-year, $182 billion Republican bill that
could cut income taxes for millions of married couples.
</P>
<P>
	   The party-line vote by the House Ways and Means Committee cleared the bill
for a floor vote as early as next week, just in time for Valentine's Day on Feb.
14. But the action came after Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told House
leaders that Clinton would not support the measure, even though the president is
also proposing relief from the so-called ``marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the president's budget will make clear, the administration supports
targeted marriage penalty relief,'' Summers said in a letter to congressional
leaders. ``But we believe marriage penalty relief needs to be done in the right
way, at the right time, with the right framework.''
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said this framework should balance the tax cuts with other budget
priorities including paying down the national debt, ensuring the solvency of
Social Security and Medicare and properly funding ``critical initiatives'' in
government spending. The president's fiscal 2001 budget will be released next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   About 25 million couples, most of them with dual incomes, pay more income
taxes than they would if single. Millions more couples in which one spouse is
the main breadwinner get a marriage bonus through current tax law -- the GOP
bill would cut taxes for all of them.
</P>
<P>
	   At an estimated cost of $182.3 billion over 10 years, the Republican bill
would consume about 10 percent of the projected budget surplus not dedicated to
Social Security, according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the cost comes from gradual enlargement, from 2003 to 2008, of the
bottom 15 percent tax bracket so that it applies to more income for married
couples. If that were in effect today, married couples would pay the 15 percent
rate on their first $52,500 of taxable income, instead of $43,850.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the GOP bill would increase the standard deduction for joint
tax filers to double that of single filers beginning in 2001 and expand the
earned-income tax credit for lower-income married people.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal, estimated at $45 billion over 10 years, includes similar
provisions to boost the standard deduction and on the earned-income credit --
both geared more toward people with modest incomes -- but does not adjust the 15
percent bracket, which generally would help higher-income couples.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the president's immediate
opposition to the GOP bill represents ``partisan, political games'' and
questioned whether the White House ``remains committed to correcting this tax
injustice'' as outlined by Clinton in last week's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, however, said the president would not go
along with the House GOP strategy of dividing last year's vetoed $792 billion
tax cut into pieces in an effort to put Democrats in a difficult political spot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can change the tactics, you can change the packaging, but if the
overall goal is to do a trillion-dollar tax cut to squeeze Social Security and
Medicare, we're going to oppose it,'' Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   But Republicans argued that the surplus has grown too large to ignore tax
law inequities such as the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans are divided about pushing individual tax relief bills, in
part because Senate rules make it more difficult. Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., told reporters he supports the thrust of the House approach but may try
to combine the tax bills into a big single measure later in the year. ----------

<HEADLINE> Report on Kosovo Atrocities Issued  </HEADLINE>
   By KATARINA KRATOVAC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the first public Serbian report on
atrocities in Kosovo, a Belgrade human rights group has documented alleged
crimes committed by Serb forces in the province and subsequent reprisals by
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   The Humanitarian Law Center released its eight-page report following a
seven-month investigation by director Natasa Kandic and a network of Serb and
ethnic Albanian volunteers. The report focuses on atrocities committed around
the Kosovo town of Orahovac.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Lesson of Orahovac'' recounts -- often with grisly detail -- alleged
crimes by Serb troops and paramilitaries against ethnic Albanians during the
NATO air campaign last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   In June 1999, NATO-led peacekeepers arrived in the province and many Serb
residents fled. The report goes on to document the subsequent reprisals by
Albanians against the dwindling Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
	   Kandic's report identifies which Yugoslav army troops, volunteers and police
forces -- along with Russian mercenaries and Bosnian Serb volunteers -- were
active in the Orahovac area during NATO's 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Orahovac became a profile for a setting where each and every crime against
the ordinary person was allowed,'' Kandic told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say many ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists
in Kosovo. After the NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last
spring, ethnic Albanians began attacking Serbs as revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Although allegations of brutality in Kosovo are hardly new, the fact that
such a study was produced at all in Milosevic's Serbia is remarkable. Most Serbs
dismiss claims of brutality by their forces either as Western propaganda or as
an unpleasant but inevitable result of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the nearly 17,000 Albanians who remained in Orahovac during the NATO
air campaign stayed hidden from Serbian forces. But the report details witness
allegations of specific murders, abductions and expulsions of Orahovac Albanians
from the start of the NATO campaign March 24 until the end in June.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, between 220 and 250 Albanian families were ordered
out of Orahovac by Serb authorities during the bombing. About 60 ethnic
Albanians were conscripted to work for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Atrocities in Orahovac did not halt once Milosevic accepted the
international peace deal and pulled his troops out, Kandic said. Nor was NATO's
arrival in the city a guarantee of protection for the Serb population there, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report recounts crimes by the rebel ethnic-Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, which entered the city before NATO troops and allegedly began searching
Serb houses and taking people away.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 40 Orahovac Serbs had disappeared by July 10, and all of the Serbs
from the houses and the 142 apartments in the center of the town were evicted,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last abduction took place on January 3, 2000,'' Kandic said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Orahovac is an example of how the international administration in
effect applies a double standard, treating ``every Serb'' as ``a war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I strived to make one thing crystal clear: if one has international law
and order, international principles must also apply,'' Kandic said. ``A crime is
a crime and must as such be punished in a court of law, nowhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Said Supporting Elian Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle suggested Wednesday
that sentiment is growing in both parties in the Senate for allowing 6-year-old
Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez to return to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How that is done and when it is done, are still open questions. But I
think that there is a great deal of support for it. And I think ultimately that
probably represents the sentiment of the majority of the Senate today,''
Daschle, D-S.D., said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., once pledged to bring a
bill conferring U.S. citizenship on the boy to a quick Senate vote, he backed
away from the plans in the face of mounting opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in the House, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
has put off consideration of the bill at least until a federal court in Miami
rules on the boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the citizenship bill say it would block the Immigration and
Naturalization Service from carrying out its ruling that the boy be sent back to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's Florida relatives are fighting his repatriation.
</P>
<P>
	   But, with the case before the courts, sentiment for granting Elian
citizenship has appeared to decline in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez's two grandmothers made personal appeals in visits to members of
Congress last week to allow Elian to be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   They had hoped to bring him back with them, but returned to Havana over the
weekend empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating in an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25
after a boat wreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. He has been

<HEADLINE> Earnings Rise for Time Warner  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc., the leading media conglomerate that has
agreed to be acquired by America Online Inc., reported higher fourth-quarter
earnings Wednesday as stronger results from cable and publishing offset
downturns in music and movies.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, whose properties include CNN, Time magazine and the Warner
Brothers film and music studios, earned 20 cents per share, easily beating
analysts estimates of 16 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings before taxes and amortization, a measure of cash flow used by
analysts, jumped 79 percent to $2.45 billion from $1.37 billion. After adjusting
for several one-time gains including a $1 billion profit from the sale of cable
systems, cash flow rose 12 percent, still a healthy advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Net profits were $848 million for the fourth quarter compared to $90 million
a year ago. Per-share figures were 62 cents versus a loss of 17 cents, when
dividend payments of $304 million brought down per-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenues rose 10 percent to $7.99 billion from $7.27 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Most segments of Time Warner's sprawling media empire reported higher
earnings, including Time Inc., which publishes Sports Illustrated, Money,
Fortune and other magazines. Cable networks, which include TNT and TBS, also had
a strong run and HBO made a splash with the hit series "The Sopranos."
</P>
<P>
	   Music continued to be a sore spot for Time Warner. Poor sales at home and
abroad, combined with a downturn at the Columbia House direct marketer, which is
half-owned by Sony, led to a 16 percent drop-off in earnings for the struggling
division.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to address its music problem, Time Warner last month announced a deal
to combine its music operations with Britain's EMI, the last remaining
independent music company, to form the industry's largest player. The
combination should lead to cost savings, increased clout with distributors, and
a stronger position in the race to bring music to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner expects its music business to be the first to take full
advantage of the new opportunities in distribution and promotion offered by the
Internet. Unsuccessful in previous efforts to bring its media properties online,
Time Warner is betting that its combination with AOL will help it leapfrog ahead
of competitors like Disney and CBSViacom on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have been struggling to make sense of the AOL-Time Warner merger,
which brings together a high-flying Internet company with a media conglomerate
firmly rooted in traditional businesses like publishing and broadcasting. AOL
stock, which is being used to acquire Time Warner, has slumped badly since the
deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Both stocks rebounded, however, after the strong earnings report from Time
Warner Wednesday. Time Warner shares rose $7.06 1/4 to $85 in trading at 5:15
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, while AOL's rose $5.50 to $60.75, also on
the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin, speaking to reporters after the earnings
announcement, reaffirmed his commitment to the merger, saying he did not have
"emotional highs and lows" because of the daily stock fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
	   Levin also said there was no chance of a renegotiation of the deal, which
calls for Time Warner shareholders to receive a fixed amount of AOL stock,
making the deal's value subject to AOL share prices. "I'm absolutely convinced
that the deal is structured appropriately," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time the merger was announced Jan. 10, AOL's lofty stock price placed
a value of $166 billion on Time Warner, a huge premium of 71 percent. But the
subsequent decline in AOL's shares make the deal worth $135 billion at current
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   In other parts of Time Warner's media holdings, the only division besides
music to show a decline was the film studio, where earnings edged down 3.5
percent. The company's WB television network, which aims for younger audiences
with shows like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," edged into the black for the first
time since it was launched in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, cash flow rose 64 percent to $7.33 billion from $4.46
billion a year ago. After adjusting for the cable profit and other one-time
effects, cash flow rose 15 percent for the year. Revenues for 1999 rose 4
percent to $27.33 billion from $26.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   On a per-share basis, excluding one-time items, Time Warner earned 39 cents
per share, beating analyst estimates of 36 cents per share. That compared to a
loss of 6 cents per share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The media conglomerate had net earnings of $1.95 billion compared to $168
million in 1998. The equivalent per-share amounts were $1.42 versus a loss of 31
cents.

<HEADLINE> IRS Struggles With Spouse Claims  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is struggling with a backlog
of some 46,000 claims under a new ``innocent spouse'' law intended to protect
divorced or separated partners from getting unfairly entangled in tax debts.
</P>
<P>
	   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told the Senate Finance Committee on
Wednesday that the agency was surprised by the sheer number of claims following
congressional passage of the law in 1998 and also wasn't fully prepared for the
complexity of determining which ones are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are really quite determined to get the claims right,'' Rossotti said.
``Sometimes, that has resulted in taking more time to get the result out to the
taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   In general, the innocent spouse law enables one partner to obtain relief
from tax liabilities stemming from a jointly filed tax return -- unless the IRS
can prove the requesting spouse had knowledge of the offending items on that
return. The new law relaxed and broadened many requirements, among other updated
taxpayer rights.
</P>
<P>
	   In the four months before the 1998 IRS reform law took effect, Rossotti said
the agency had received about 3,000 innocent spouse claims. Since then, the
number of claims has ballooned to 63,906, with about 2,800 pouring in each month
-- and the backlog as of Dec. 31 was 46,665.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not satisfactory,'' said Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del. ``We do have to find some answers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti said the IRS intends for ``progress to pick up'' during 2000 and
projected the backlog to drop to about 30,000 claims by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Several senators were critical of reports that IRS enforcement actions --
liens, levies and property seizures -- have plummeted since the 1998 reform law
passed. Rossotti released new estimates predicting that the drop will end in
2000 as the agency improves how it administers the law and Congress provides
adequate money for staff and computer improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do think we have gotten past the first stage,'' Rossotti said. ``We want
to respect taxpayer rights. We also have to collect the taxes.''

<HEADLINE> Schering-Plough Profits Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Schering-Plough said its fourth-quarter profits surged 21
percent, driven by strong sales of the allergy pill Claritin.
</P>
<P>
	   Schering-Plough said Wednesday it earned $506 million, or 34 cents per
share, up from $419 million, or 28 cents per share, in the same period a year
ago. Results beat Wall Street forecasts by a penny, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 12 percent to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The allergy drug Claritin had a sales increase of 14 percent to $573 million
from $505 million. Claritin, the most heavily advertised prescription drug to
consumers, has been the leading allergy drug for several years.
</P>
<P>
	   Combined sales of Intron A and Rebetron Combination Therapy for hepatitis
rose 37 percent to $297 million from $217 million.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the Madison, N.J.-based company said it earned $2.1 billion
or $1.42 per share, up from $1.8 billion or $1.18 per share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 14 percent in 1999 to $9.2 billion from $8.1 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Claritin's 1999 sales rose 18 percent to $2.7 billion from $2.3 billion in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Schering-Plough rose 93 3/4 cents to $60.75 in trading at 5:15

<HEADLINE> Wahid in Netherlands Amid Protests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid arrived
in the Netherlands Wednesday on the first official Dutch visit by an Indonesian
head of state in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   His two-day trip began as several dozen Indonesian exiles demonstrated
peacefully at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, demanding that the president take
action to stop continuing ethnic violence back home.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, an Islamic moderate in his fifth month of office, is on a European
tour to bolster foreign political support for his reform policies and attract
investors to his impoverished country. Arriving at Queen Beatrix's royal palace
in The Hague Wednesday evening for a ceremonial welcome, Wahid declined to
comment on his decision Monday to fire Security and Political Affairs Minister
Gen. Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has refused to step down despite a harsh government report that
linked him to atrocities in East Timor. A state-appointed commission
investigating the conflict found Wiranto and 32 other military leaders
responsible for the slaughter of thousands after the region voted for
independence from Indonesia in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid ordered Wiranto's resignation while in Switzerland Monday, but the
former army chief was seen at regular government meetings the next day.
Wiranto's resistance has created a standoff between Wahid's new reformist
government and the old-style military regime of former president Suharto, under
which Wiranto had significant power.
</P>
<P>
	   While in the Netherlands, Wahid will meet with Prime Minister Wim Kok. He
also hopes to convince former Premier Ruud Lubbers to mediate in the conflict in
Indonesia's eastern Maluku Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Netherlands has a large population of people from the islands. They have
held repeated demonstrations against the violence between Christians and Muslims
there, which has cost about 2,000 lives since last year.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wrestles With a Sumo Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By GINNY PARKER Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- In Japan, the sumo wrestling ring is sacred ground, blessed by
priests and purified with salt before each bout.
</P>
<P>
	   But a headline-grabbing scandal over a former wrestler's claim that Japan's
national sport is rife with fixed contests has renewed suspicions that sumo is
not as clean as its image might suggest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I regret what I did in the past,'' Keisuke Itai said Wednesday,
acknowledging that he intentionally lost many bouts. ``Sumo wrestlers are true
athletes, so there should be no fixed matches.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since Itai first made his allegations last month, saying he wants to revive
flagging interest in the sport with a thorough cleansing, sumo officials have
issued ardent protests denying any problem.
</P>
<P>
	   As for fans, they aren't necessarily ruffled by the accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This kind of thing probably happens in any sport, and I imagine it happens
in sumo,'' said Mitsukuni Kida, a 56-year-old ramen-noodle street vendor and
sumo devotee. ``What can you really do about it? As long as it's not every
wrestler, I don't mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,000 years old and with roots in Japan's indigenous Shinto religion,
sumo is, along with baseball, the country's most popular sport. Fans see it as
more of a cultural treasure than a mere competition.
</P>
<P>
	   During bouts, behemoths in colorful silk loincloths and traditional high,
bound ponytails stomp around the elevated clay ring and squat, glaring, before
trying to wrestle each other down or out of bounds. Bouts usually last no more
than seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Solemn referees in spectacular kimonos and headdresses oversee the ritual,
with its 70 winning techniques, including slapping down, lifting out and pushing
out with alternating hand thrusts.
</P>
<P>
	   Star wrestlers are as famous as the best-known actors or pop musicians.
</P>
<P>
	   The 15-day tournaments are held six times a year in different cities and
televised live.
</P>
<P>
	   It's easier to get tickets than it once was. Since the recession hit, the
biggest companies aren't buying up the priciest seats, and tickets range from
$28 to $143.
</P>
<P>
	   But the sport's image has taken a beating in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, in a series of tabloid articles, Itai's stablemaster, the
former wrestler Onaruto, talked about wrestlers who smoked marijuana, cheated on
their taxes, hung out with gangsters, joined in orgies and frequently lost
matches for money.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials denied it all. But shortly afterward, three members of Japan's top
sumo family were hit with back taxes for failing to report more than $3.7
million in income.
</P>
<P>
	   Modernity, meanwhile, is chipping away at sumo's traditional power base --
the training ``stable,'' where junior wrestlers do the household chores and wait
on senior fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   The stables, which subject wrestlers to rigorous practice sessions and
strict etiquette, are finding it harder to recruit talent as more wrestlers come
up through college sumo clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreigners are trickling in, too. While they once had trouble winning
acceptance from the tight-knit sumo establishment, they now occupy even the
sport's top rank. The last tournament included wrestlers from the United States,
Mongolia, China, Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans are criticizing a loss of athleticism. Amid a rash of weight-related
injuries last year, the sumo association forced wrestlers to take a test
measuring their body fat -- and told them to go on diets.
</P>
<P>
	   The sumo wrestler's staple fare is chanko-nabe, a calorie-rich stew of
seaweed stock, chicken, pork, fish, tofu, bean sprouts, cabbage, carrots, onions
and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
	   Itai, now owner of a chanko-nabe restaurant, like many other former
wrestlers, rose to the fourth-highest rank of komusubi but was not particularly
famous or popular. At 5-foot-10, with a fighting weight of 306 pounds, he
retired in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Itai accused several current stars of taking part in rigged bouts,
sumo experts were not impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   Andy Adams, publisher of Sumo World, a Tokyo magazine, said that
bout-rigging -- usually arranged among the wrestlers themselves to help someone
score the extra win he needs for promotion to a higher rank -- goes back
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's an old tradition that if you rub my back this time, next time ...
I'll rub your back,'' Adams said. ``It's unspoken. Nobody says anything to
anybody. It's just sort of understood.''

<HEADLINE> Kenya Air Black Box Said Located  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Ivorian authorities on Wednesday defended their
response to the Atlantic Ocean crash of a Kenya Airways jet carrying 179 people,
while acknowledging that the seaside airport had no rescue boats on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the 10 survivors clung to bits of wreckage for hours before being
rescued, and at least one swam to shore. Many were saved by volunteers trawling
the waters in their own boats.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, state television reported that the ``black box'' had been
located, but search officials could not immediately be reached for confirmation.
It wasn't clear whether the report referred to the flight data recorder or voice
recorder, both of which could provide insight into the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The director of the Ivorian civil aviation authority said the country had
responded properly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can assure you that all navy and military forces were mobilized within
one-half hour'' of the crash, said Jean Kouassi Abonouan.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash occurred Sunday night about 2 miles off the coast of Abidjan, just
after the Airbus 310 took off, destined for Lagos, Nigeria. One survivor said
more people would have lived if the rescue had come quicker.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The accident happened at night, making the search very difficult, but I
was informed and (rescuers) went to the site as soon as possible,'' Abonouan
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   He also conceded that while the plane went down within sight of the airport,
``unfortunately, we had no boats at the airport that could be ready to go to sea
in case of such an accident.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also added at one point: ``You also have to take into account that this
happened on a Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abonouan said that the country did not have the equipment needed to located
the airplane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, but that a team
of French specialists were looking for them and the remains of the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, three fire department divers jumped into 80 feet of clear
water about 2 miles off the coast, also trying to locate the plane's wreckage. A
military vessel also took part in the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya also sent 21 divers to assist in the search for bodies, while a barge,
diving gear and hoisting equipment are on the way from Senegal.
</P>
<P>
	   A Kenya Airways flight Wednesday brought scores of relatives from Lagos and
Nairobi to identify the victims. But only 86 bodies had been recovered,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline released a list of 26 victims from the United States, Canada,
United Arab Emirates, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Mali,
Nigeria, Congo, Rwanda, India and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Ford, UPS Join Forces  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday it will work with a
subsidiary of United Parcel Service to nearly cut in half the time it takes
vehicles to move from the assembly line to the dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, the partnership with UPS Logistics Group will let car buyers use
a Web site to track a new vehicle through the delivery process the way they now
can track packages.
</P>
<P>
	   When it is implemented in March, the system should reduce the time the
average new vehicle is in transit from 14 or 15 days to about eight or nine,
said Frank Taylor, Ford's vice president of material, planning and logistics.
</P>
<P>
	   "Speed is a competitive advantage," Taylor said. "If you look at what
happens in the total network today, it's lacking speed, and it's lacking
precision, and the customer needs both. Speed and precision will drive cost
down."
</P>
<P>
	   UPS Logistics will revamp Ford's network of road and rail carriers and add a
high-tech information system that makes it easy to track individual vehicles,
said Dan DiMaggio, chief executive officer of UPS Logistics Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the optimized network is complete, Ford customers can expect the same
on-time delivery reliability they get from UPS," DiMaggio said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Greiner, chairman of the National Auto Dealer Association's Ford
committee, said the ability to tell customers exactly when their vehicle will be
available will become a selling point.
</P>
<P>
	   "It provides an unprecedented connection between Ford, its dealers and its
customers," said Greiner, who owns a Casper, Wyo., dealership. "The ability to
have our customers instantly informed is definitely a competitive advantage, and
any reduction in delivery time is a plus."
</P>
<P>
	   Automakers have reported problems with rail delivery in recent months, due
to congestion on some routes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system may not completely solve all transportation problems, but,
"even with logistical problems of delivering, whether that's by rail or truck,
to provide consumers information about where their car is in transit is an
absolute home run," Greiner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry analyst Alan Baum said the initiative by Ford, the world's No. 2
automaker, is a combination of streamlining internal operations and providing
better customer service.
</P>
<P>
	   "UPS has made a business of this kind of work," said Baum, of IRN Inc. "It's
significant because they (Ford) are looking -- like lots of companies are
looking -- at the service aspect to try to improve revenues."
</P>
<P>
	   The partnership continues the trend of making more of the car-buying process
accessible through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford in January partnered with Yahoo! to create a Web site where vehicle
owners can get access to owner guides, recall notifications, Ford Credit account
information and personalized maintenance logs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said it will begin the program with Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars in
the western and southwestern United States. The system will cover all of North
America when it is fully functional in late 2001, according to Taylor. Ford then
plans to expand the system to its Volvo, Mazda and Jaguar lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 100-150 UPS employees and 30-50 Ford employees will manage the
system together, and UPS will be compensated based on how it helps Ford meet its
speed and efficiency goals, Taylor said. Detailed terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, Ford fell $1.18 3/4 to $48.62 1/2 a share in
trading at 5:15 p.m. Wednesday, while UPS fell $2.75 to $58.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 37.85  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks struggled to a mixed finish Wednesday after the
Federal Reserve's widely expected interest rate increase did little to calm
turbulent U.S. financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 to close at 11,003.20. The
blue-chip index rose as much as 60 points in the moments before the Fed released
its decision, then bobbed between positive and negative territory for much of
the rest of the session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 slipped 0.16 to 1,409.12, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 21.98 to 4,073.96.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks gave up early gains after the Fed said it was raising its target for
the federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge one another on overnight
loans -- to 5.75 percent from 5.50 percent. Several commercial banks quickly
announced that they, too, would boost borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by making it more difficult for
companies to borrow money to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, investors Wednesday turned to the companies that are advancing
quickly enough to outrun rising rates, said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. For the most part, that meant technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are crowding into shares of the companies that they believe will
continue to grow earnings, despite the Fed's tightening of interest rates,"
Acuff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hewlett-Packard rose 4 3/4 to 110 9/16 and IBM rose 3 1/2, the strongest of
the Dow components.

<HEADLINE> Putin Unmoved by Albright on Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- In the highest-level U.S. contact with Russia's new leader,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to persuade Vladimir Putin during
three hours of debate Wednesday to pull back in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we are any closer to a political solution on Chechnya,''
Albright said after Kremlin meeting, originally scheduled for about 60 minutes.
``Neither of us minced words.''
</P>
<P>
	   She complimented Putin as a Russian patriot with a ``problem-solving
approach,'' while expressing frustration at her inability to convince the former
security service chief that the blitz in Chechnya was isolating Russia
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Putin said at a picture-taking session that ``the United
States is putting certain pressures on Russia,'' but that he remained committed
to his policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have been ups and downs in our relationship,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   They debated the military offensive and Russia's suspicions about a
space-based weapons program that President Clinton may approve in the summer.
Meantime, Russian forces backed by tanks and artillery were battling to prevent
Chechen militants from reaching rebel forces in the mountains south of Grozny,
the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said he was interested in greater self-rule for the Chechens and for
stability in the area, Albright said, ``but I didn't hear how he intended to get
from here to there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, she told reporters, Putin authorized Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to
pursue a U.S. proposal to send a mission to Chechnya to make what Albright
called a ``humanitarian needs assessment.'' Putin also ``took on board'' her
suggestion that more reporters be permitted to go to the embattled republic,
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, she described the meeting as intense but pleasant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was obviously on top of all the issues that we talked about,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin tossed aside the cue cards customarily prepared for discussions of
complex and sensitive issues and was ``a very good interlocutor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed to draw a contrast with Boris Yeltsin, whose last years as
president were hampered by heart trouble and other problems. Yeltsin resigned
New Year's Eve and named Putin his successor until elections are held in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody is engaged in psychobabble about him,'' Albright said.
``Everybody ought to watch what he does.''
</P>
<P>
	   A senior U.S. official who attended the meeting described Putin as ``soft
spoken and steely.'' He said the acting president promised to try to reform
Russia's tax code, which has been the target of complaints by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, he pledged to push for ratification by the Russian parliament of the
1993 START II treaty to make deep cuts in U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear
warheads, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright appealed in the meeting and earlier in a speech for Russia to do
more to control its export of nuclear technology. She told future Russian
diplomats at their academy that Russia had made a solid start, at least on
paper, with a new export control program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Far more needs to be done to address this serious problem -- a commitment
at all levels to better implementation, better enforcement, better control of
exports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, she said Russia and the United States shared an interest in
preventing the spread of nuclear and ballistic missile capability in the Middle
East and on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   Both countries, she said, should eliminate their stockpiles of deadly
chemical weapons,
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know we are going through a kind of strange period in U.S.-Russian
relations,'' Albright said in a response to a question after the speech. ``But I
hope very much we will get through it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also offered assurances that ``the United States is seeking
partnership, not dominance,'' in its relationship with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   From Moscow, Albright met with officials in Croatia to signal U.S. support
for some recent democratic trends in the Balkans country. She backed up the
praise with a promise to boost U.S. assistance to $20 million this year from $12
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now every government of the world can have confidence that the Croatian
leadership truly represents the will of the people,'' she told reporters.

<HEADLINE> GM Names Wagoner CEO, Smith Remains  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- After seven years behind the wheel of the world's largest
business, General Motors Corp. chairman Jack Smith is handing over control and
the title of chief executive officer to his trusted lieutenant, G. Richard
Wagoner.
</P>
<P>
	   The move announced Wednesday, which takes effect June 1, portends no major
shifts in GM strategies; Wagoner, Smith and vice chairman Harry Pearce will
remain the ruling powers of the company. But it does mark the end of Smith's
tenure, which saw GM return to healthy profits but struggle to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who turns 62 in April, said he will become a liaison between the
company's management and its dealers and international partners. Harry Pearce
will stay on as vice chairman of the world's No. 1 automaker.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rick will have responsibility for the strategic and operational leadership
for General Motors. He is in charge," Smith said at a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Wagoner's promotion was expected, the timing was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   GM's stock fell nearly 5 percent in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange, declining $3.87 1/2 to $81.37 1/2 a share. Analysts said the
selling represented profit-taking from gains before Tuesday's announcement of an
offer by GM to swap its shares for those in its Hughes Electronics unit, a major
player in satellite television service.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagoner -- at 46 one of the youngest top leaders ever at GM -- becomes a
strong candidate to succeed Smith as chairman. Wagoner will keep the titles of
president and chief operating officer, overseeing GM's automotive business.
</P>
<P>
	   He said there would be "no huge change in strategies, but that doesn't mean
there won't be changes in the company."
</P>
<P>
	   Wagoner has followed in Smith's footsteps for much of his 22-year career
with GM and has wide experience in finance and overseas operations. He was named
president and chief operating officer of GM in October 1998. Before that,
Wagoner headed GM's automotive operations, the company's largest and most
profitable unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagoner was credited with streamlining management while cutting the number
of GM models and reducing design and manufacturing time.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rick Wagoner is well-respected among auto industry analysts. He's viewed as
someone who gets the job done, someone who has a great degree of experience
throughout GM," said Richard Hilgert with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagoner said Wednesday he prefers to stay close to the details of the
business rather than manage from a distance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I like to get in the game," he said. "I don't like to sit on the sidelines
and coach."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith was named CEO in November 1992 and has been GM chairman since November
1996. He succeeded John G. Smale, a longtime Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. executive who
led a 1992 coup that forced out then-chairman and chief executive Robert Stempel
after billions of dollars in losses from GM's North American operations.
</P>
<P>
	   During Smith's term, GM has brought itself back from near bankruptcy,
increasing profits and going to great lengths to please shareholders, spinning
off its Delphi parts operations and cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
	   While relations with the United Auto Workers union have been mixed,
especially after strikes in 1998 that cost the company $1.5 billion, Smith has
tried to make peace. Earlier this week, he was hailed for his efforts by UAW
President Stephen Yokich.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Smith has made strides in improving GM's balance sheet, Wall
Street has not always been satisfied with the results, complaining that GM has
not moved fast enough to reduce its staff and close unprofitable plants.
</P>
<P>
	   And Smith has not been able to stem the slow erosion of GM's U.S. market
share, which dropped from 33 percent in 1993 to 29.3 percent in 1999. GM's sales
were up 9 percent in 1999, but the automaker's share of the U.S. market for
cars, minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles was unchanged from 1998, when
production was crippled by lengthy strikes at two Flint parts plants. It was the
first time since the 1920s that GM held less than 30 percent of the market in a
year without a strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the results from 1999 were blamed on sour relations with dealers
unhappy with GM's plans to buy up to 10 percent of its franchises, mostly in
large urban areas where the automaker's market share collapsed. Smith killed the
plan in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Wednesday he would spend much of his time from now on meeting
with dealers and GM's international partners, allowing Wagoner to focus on the
automotive business.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a logical split," Smith said. "There's a lot of other things that go
with the CEO job that mentally get in the way of running the automotive
operations."
</P>
<P>
	   Pearce, who oversees the Hughes electronics unit and GM's research work, had
been seen as a successor to Smith until he was diagnosed with leukemia in 1998.
Pearce returned to work in 1999, and said his health was not a consideration in
the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the three executives work well together, and praised Wagoner as a
gifted executive with the experience necessary to run GM.
</P>
<P>
	   "Had I been an outside director, I would have selected Rick Wagoner as CEO
of this company," Pearce said.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Testifies in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George Tenet says there is no evidence that
classified material improperly kept on former director John Deutch's home
computer fell into the wrong hands via the Internet. Still, ``We cannot exclude
that possibility,'' he told a Senate committee looking into the security lapse
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was sloppy in what he did,'' Tenet said of his former boss and
predecessor. ``He worked around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tenet denied he
deliberately delayed an investigation into Deutch's computer practices. But, he
conceded, ``The internal investigation took too long. The process was not
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet stripped Deutch of his security clearances in August, even though the
CIA investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified materials began in
December 1996, the month Tenet became acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal report by the CIA's inspector general faults Tenet and other
senior CIA officials for waiting too long before notifying the Justice
Department or congressional intelligence oversight committees of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet agreed the CIA was slow in notifying appropriate officials and
lawmakers. ``There was no excuse for that,'' he said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When he left his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home and found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet said most of the classified documents on Deutch's computers were not
ones he took home from secure CIA computers but ones he created in writing
reports. Even so, Tenet said, there were ``high levels of classified materials''
on Deutch's home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   According to those familiar with the still-classified inspector general's
report, Deutch deleted more than 1,000 secret documents on the computer when he
became aware of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized. Although the CIA eventually referred the case to the
Justice Department, Deutch has not been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was grilled on the security lapses during a hearing on world trouble
spots. In that testimony, Tenet said:
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a ``high potential'' for a military flare-up across the Taiwan
Strait this year because of increasing tensions between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   --Over the next 15 years, U.S. cities could be within range of ballistic
missiles from ``North Korea, probably Iran and possibly Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The CIA, working with foreign governments, has helped to bring ``more than
two dozens terrorists to justice'' since July 1998. More than half were
associated with suspected fugitive terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia's economic difficulties are weakening the government's ability to
safeguard its nuclear arsenal. `While there is no evidence weapons are missing,
``We remain concerned by reports of lax discipline, labor strikes, poor morale
and criminal activities at nuclear storage facilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Deutch matter was one of ``grave concern,'' said the committee chairman,
Sen. Richard Shelby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people have a keen interest in the performance of senior
officials charged with upholding our laws and policies with respect to the
protection of classified information, '' said Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby asked Tenet if he could assure Congress that foreign powers or other
unauthorized parties had not gotten access to Deutch's materials via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   While there was no evidence of that, Tenet said: ''``We cannot exclude that
possibility. I can't give you a statement that it absolutely didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch clearly violated CIA security rules on the handling of classified
documents, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet balked at questions on whether the Deutch material posed as much
damage to U.S. security if it were to fall into the wrong hands as information
passed on by convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a case of espionage, Tenet said. ``I would not put the Deutch
case in the same category as Ames and Pollard. I don't think it's fair.''

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror Profits Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times and
The Baltimore Sun, reported lower fourth-quarter operating profits Wednesday,
despite an increase in revenues, due to higher debt service costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Times Mirror earned $67.5 million from continuing operations, or $1.03 per
share, matching the forecasts of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   That compared to $75.5 million, or 87 cents per share, in the same period a
year ago. The per-share amounts rose because of a decline in the amount of
shares outstanding and lower preferred dividend payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The results did not include a gain in the year-ago quarter of $232.6 million
on the sale of the company's medical publishing operations or other one-time
items. Including the items, net profits were $67.9 million in the fourth quarter
compared to $246.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 12 percent to $836.6 million in the quarter compared to $750.1
million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspaper publishing, which makes up the bulk of the company's business, had
a 15 percent gain in operating profit during the quarter thanks to strong gains
in advertising and lower costs for newsprint.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest expenses rose during the quarter because of a higher debt load
incurred because of a recapitalization transaction with the company's largest
shareholders, the Chandler Trusts.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, income from continuing operations rose to $248.4 million,
or $3.23 per share, matching analyst expectations. In 1998 the company earned
$246.5 million or $2.59 per share. Including gains from the sale of legal and
medical publishing operations in 1998 and other one-time effects, net income was
$259.1 million in 1999 and $1.42 billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-year revenues rose 9 percent to $3.03 billion from $2.78 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Times Mirror's newspapers include Newsday, The Hartford Courant and The
Advocate of Stamford, Conn. It also publishes several magazines including Field
&AMP; Stream and Popular Science. Times Mirror has agreed to sell The Sporting
News.

<HEADLINE> Bertelsmann Wants To Top Music Cos.  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The drive to make Bertelsmann AG the world's No.
1 player in the music industry is still alive, the company said Wednesday amid
increased speculation that it is weighing a partnership with Sony Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas Middelhoff said last month he wanted to
make the German media conglomerate the world leader in music by the end of the
year. But that was before the music industry was surprised last month by the
acquisition by Time Warner of British music company EMI Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   That merger would produce the world's No. 1 music group, just ahead of
Seagram's Universal Music, and create a music megahouse representing 2,500
performers, including names like the Rolling Stones, Spice Girls, Eric Clapton
and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
	   With Bertelsmann now in fourth place, Middelhoff has stepped up the campaign
to build his company -- even opening the door for a possible linkup with the
Japanese electronics and entertainment company Sony.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the company could be interested in a partnership with Sony and was
also considering various ventures for Internet music distribution, according to
reports in The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman Oliver Herrgesell denied Wednesday that Bertelsmann was in
negotiations with any other record label but reiterated that "it is still our
goal to be the world leader by year's end."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement late Wednesday, Sony also denied that its entertainment
businesses were in play.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has been much unfounded speculation in the press in recent weeks
about Sony's plans for its entertainment assets," said Sony president and chief
executive Nobuyuki Idei. "We want to be very clear in stating that our
entertainment businesses, Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Pictures
Entertainment, are not for sale."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say a full merger with Sony would be unlikely because it would give
the combined company nearly 30 percent of the world's music market. Universal
and Timer Warner-EMI have each just around 25 percent, and regulators usually
balk at approving mergers that push market shares above that level.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, the world's top four music houses -- including Time Warner-EMI as
one entity -- control about 80 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, there are plenty of ways for companies to cooperate and cut costs,
such as sharing CD manufacturing and splitting distribution.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only place the music industry competes is in signing and promoting
acts," said Paul Richards, a music industry analyst with WestLB Panmure in
London. "Everything else is open."
</P>
<P>
	   And open is a good way to describe the music entertainment industry right
now, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "After the Time Warner-EMI merger, the obvious question facing Bertelsmann
and everybody else is how to respond to the competitive threat," he said, adding
closer cooperation between Bertelsmann and Sony would be one means of defense.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Ad Restrictions Blocked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- The tobacco industry, battling state regulations on tobacco
advertising near schools, won a minor victory Wednesday when a federal appeals
court blocked implementation of the new rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the regulations pending a
ruling on the tobacco industry's appeal, said Henry Dinger, the Boston attorney
representing Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, U.S. District Judge William G. Young upheld the regulations that
prohibit outward-facing ads inside stores for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and
cigars within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   But the tobacco industry has appealed, claiming that the ban, which was to
go into effect on Tuesday, violates their free speech rights.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Try To Overturn FEC Ruling  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee has sued the Federal
Election Commission over the agency's decision to drop an investigation of
foreign donations to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a $2.1 million donation in 1994 to the Republican National
Committee's National Policy Forum from a Hong Kong businessman, Ambrous Young.
The contribution was solicited by then-party chairman Haley Barbour.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
	   The forum used $1.6 million of the funds to pay off a loan from the RNC,
which, in turn, spent the funds to help the GOP in the 1994 elections. The
National Policy Forum eventually defaulted on the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a complaint by the Democratic Party, the FEC's general counsel,
Lawrence Noble, concluded in September: ``Both Mr. Barbour and the RNC knew the
foreign source of the security for the loan, and that the known purpose of
seeking repayment in 1994 was to make funds available to the RNC for the
upcoming elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noble's office recommended the commission proceed with the investigation.
But the six-member commission deadlocked along party lines, 3-3, and dropped the
case, according to records in the case made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic officials, in their suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in
Washington, want a judge to force the FEC to act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the Republican Party and the leading Republican presidential
candidates start throwing stones about campaign finance reform and foreign
contributions, they had better make sure their own house is in order,'' DNC
National Chairman Joe Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Election Commission spokeswoman Kelly Huff said the agency could not
comment because the matter is in litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins said the lawsuit was an
attempt to divert attention from Democratic fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democrats have no shortage lawyers willing to file frivolous
lawsuits,'' Collins said. ``This is basically a subterfuge to cover up what Sen.
Bob Kerrey of Nebraska said was an embarrassing effort to violate the law in
1996 by the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic National Committee was forced to return millions of dollars
in campaign contributions after the 1996 elections amid allegations that they
came from foreign sources, which is illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Democrats on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
investigated campaign fund raising during the 1996 elections, said Barbour
``intentionally solicited'' foreign money. Barbour told the committee that he
did not know the money came from overseas, but Democrats called his testimony
``not credible.''

<HEADLINE> McCain N.H. Win Revives TV Concerns  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- John McCain's easy New Hampshire primary victory has
revived a concern for television networks about whether to report how an
election is going while people still have the chance to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours before voting was done Tuesday, exit polls had revealed McCain was
headed for a surprisingly big victory over GOP frontrunner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The three cable news networks declared McCain the winner at 7 p.m. EST, when
most -- although not all -- of New Hampshire's polls closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox News Channel's Brit Hume had reported at 6 p.m. that "all signs point to
a very good night for John McCain." Much of the next hour included discussion on
the implications of a big McCain victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "To do otherwise would have taken us completely off what we knew to be the
news," Hume said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Early victory projections were a big issue in the 1980s, when West Coast
politicians worried that network calls on a presidential race would keep voters
at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Research on whether this was true has been inconclusive, said Tom
Rosensteil, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. But networks
have generally waited in recent elections to avoid alienating voters, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With two new cable news networks this presidential election and more refined
exit polling, there's a greater temptation to break ranks, said Kathleen
Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Public Communication at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of a competition among news networks on who could call the race
first, "we got into a race of who could insinuate first," Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the "CBS Evening News" at 6:30 p.m., Dan Rather said there were "early
indications of possible surprises" in both parties. Correspondent Bob Schieffer
said exit polls concluded New Hampshire Republicans gave McCain an "astonishing"
70 percent favorability rating.
</P>
<P>
	   David Bloom said on NBC's "Nightly News" that "the McCain camp is brimming
with confidence tonight, and Bush aides appear resigned to defeat."
</P>
<P>
	   ABC waited until 8 p.m., when all New Hampshire polls had closed, to declare
McCain the victor. But Peter Jennings reported 90 minutes earlier that it
appeared to be a good day for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosensteil said that television commentators "pushed the semantic envelope
more last night than I have seen in a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   "We would argue that it's not semantic," ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said.
"You're not projecting a winner."
</P>
<P>
	   CNN's 7 p.m. declaration made for one awkward moment: a half-hour later,
Judy Woodruff noted on the air that polls hadn't closed everywhere in New
Hampshire and that voters should exercise their rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Before 7 p.m., CNN political director Tom Hannon said he emphasized to
correspondents not to let what they knew from exit polls seep into their
reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The risk of influencing, potentially, the outcome of an election is a
weighty responsibility, so we kind of play it straight," Hannon said. "I
recognize that it's a difficult issue. I'm not trying to imply any criticism of
the other networks."
</P>
<P>
	   Hume said Fox tries to strike a balance.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't want it to be a situation where the media and all the players
know what the score is and the spectators don't," he said. "There's nothing more
journalistically suspect to me than a bunch of journalists working with a head
full of knowledge and not telling the audience."

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury prices soared Wednesday after the
government said it would sell fewer bonds as part of the Clinton
administration's long-term plan to pay off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury shot up 1 27/32 points, or $18.43 3/4 per
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to
6.28 percent from late Tuesday's 6.42 percent. As recently as Jan. 18, the yield
on the long-term bond was at a 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's rally, one of the biggest in the past year, was sparked by news
that the U.S. Treasury would sell $10 billion in new 30-year bonds, $12 billion
of five-year notes and $10 billion of 10-year notes at next week's refunding
auction. That's $5 billion less than the market had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, the Treasury also said it would auction off fewer 30-year bonds at
its next auction in August.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing bond sales is part of the federal government's strategy to make use
of the huge budget surplus to pay down the national debt. Treasury officials
said they plan to buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices were little affected by the Federal Reserve's widely anticipated
decision Wednesday to raise interest rates by a quarter-point, its fourth hike
since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were down 1/32 to up 1/32 point,
while intermediate maturities rose 3/32 to 5/16 point, according to Bridge
Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.63
percent, with a discount rate falling 0.06 percentage point from late Tuesday to
5.47 percent. Six-month yields were 5.89 percent with a discount falling 0.05
percentage point to 5.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   One-year yields finished at 6.19 percent, with the discount dropping 0.10
percentage point from Tuesday's auction to 5.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.50 percent from 5.87 1/2 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose  1/8 point to 91 7/16. The
yield was 6.30 percent, down from Tuesday's 6.31 percent.

</P>
<P>
	   The automaker named president and chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner
as chief executive officer. Wagoner's appointment lays the ground for the
upcoming retirement of chairman and CEO John F. Smith Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   The media company earned 20 cents per share in the fourth quarter, easily
beating analysts' estimates of 16 cents per share. Time Warner said stronger

sales of the company's Claritin allergy medication grew 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said fourth-quarter revenues will miss expectations due to
problems with its sales force. Inso, a maker of multilingual data-access and
electronic publishing software, has retained an adviser to explore options
including a possible sale of the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Coulter Pharmaceutical won a patent for a drug expected to challenge Idec's

<P>
	   The company widened its losses in 1999, losing $3.08 per share compared with
$2.72 per share in 1998. For the fourth quarter, SonoSite lost 38 cents per
share compared with 99 cents per share a year earlier. SonoSite makes ultrasound
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The company received a U.S. patent for its drug delivery system for a class

<HEADLINE> Dominica Leader To Form Coalition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) -- Dominica's new leader said Wednesday he will form a
ruling coalition with conservatives after winning elections on the Caribbean
island.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement by Rosie Douglas comes after a final recount Tuesday night
confirmed that his Labor Party had won 10 of the 21 parliamentary seats in
Monday's polls. The United Workers' Party of outgoing Prime Minister Edison
James garnered just nine seats.
</P>
<P>
	   With the conservative Dominica Freedom Party's two seats, Douglas' coalition
will have a majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two parties will work together in offering the country a new
direction,'' Douglas said at a joint news conference with Freedom Party leader
Charles Savarin.
</P>
<P>
	   He has said one of his first acts will be to suspend an ``economic
citizenship'' program selling passports to foreigners, some of whom the Labor
Party has said are criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas said he would give the Freedom Party two Cabinet posts and two seats
in the 10-member senate. The outgoing government had 11 ministers holding 27
posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Savarin said he and the Labor Party had fought the election to remove the
Union Workers' Party from office and that the next objective was to
``restructure the economy, restructure the society and create a better life for
the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas also has promised to set up an inquiry into alleged corruption in
the UWP government.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas will be sworn in as prime minister on Thursday, and is expected to
announce his Cabinet afterward.

<HEADLINE> Mauritania Denies Militants' Arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) -- A government spokesman denied Wednesday that
Mauritanian authorities have arrested four Islamic militants suspected of having
links to millionaire fugitive Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first official comment since Tuesday's report of the arrests,
Communications Minister Rachid Ould Saleh blamed Western media for stirring up a
sensational story.
</P>
<P>
	   ``According to official information, there have been no arrests,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Security officials said Tuesday the arrests were part of a probe into
allegations that a Mauritanian, Mohamedou Ould Slahi, plotted bomb attacks
against the United States. They did not say who was arrested or when.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi was arrested in Mauritania last week. He had been living in Canada but
left there in part because of an investigation into an alleged bomb plot against
targets in the United States, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has
said. U.S. authorities say that plot was linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   No specific evidence has been released linking bin Laden to the newly
alleged bombing plot. U.S. officials also accuse bin Laden, a Saudi believed to
be living in Afghanistan, of planning the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. Those attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> CDC Director Sorry for Misued Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The director of one of the government's largest health
agencies apologized Wednesday for misleading Congress about how scientists spent
some money earmarked to fight deadly hantavirus. But he insisted the diverted
funds were well spent to fight other killer viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   The apology by Jeffrey Koplan, director of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, is his second since the fall. In October, he acknowledged the
CDC misspent about half of the $22.7 million it had received from Congress to
study chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest case, some of the $7.5 million that Congress intended to help
fight hantavirus each year was spent by the CDC to investigate other outbreaks
of mysterious killers, Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the outbreaks Koplan cited included the CDC's investigation last
summer of the Nipah virus that killed more than 100 people in Malaysia, an
outbreak spread by pigs that experts feared could have quickly spread around the
globe if not stemmed.
</P>
<P>
	   That is not to say that continuing to investigate hantavirus is not
important, Koplan said. The disease first appeared as a frightening 1993
outbreak, when otherwise healthy adults suddenly began suffocating from a
disease that filled their lungs with fluid. CDC ``disease detectives'' quickly
discovered the culprit was a never-before-seen strain of hantavirus spread by a
type of mouse, and worked to stem the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
	   Hantavirus still does strike; it sickened 24 people last year.
</P>
<P>
	   But the CDC lacks the emergency funds to cover outbreaks of the Ebola virus
and numerous other mysterious killers that it is called upon to investigate
around the world, and thus must sometimes juggle spending on continuing studies
of one disease to cover a crisis, Koplan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money was spent on very important public health issues,'' he stressed,
noting that fighting mysterious outbreaks in other countries helps keep some
killers from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is that CDC employees then filed budget documents with Congress
that did not acknowledge a yet-to-be-determined amount of the $7.5 million in
hantavirus funding was spent elsewhere, he said Wednesday after The Washington
Post disclosed the funding discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmaker who oversees CDC spending said Wednesday that misleading
Congress about how taxpayer money is spent is a serious charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress never told CDC it had to spend all $7.5 million each year on
hantavirus, said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee that funds CDC.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have no problem at all with their doing something they think is more
important with the money than we might think is important. That's scientific
judgment,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has ordered Koplan and the CDC employees responsible for the budget
reports to Congress to appear at a hearing next week to explain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have basically not communicated the truth to us,'' Porter said.
``This is the second time in a very short period of time we find the money has
been spent in ways other they represented it was being spent.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it is important to uncover ``if we don't have an agency that is
going to tell Congress the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Wednesday the Justice Department should launch
a criminal investigation of CDC's budget practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplan said CDC employees did not intend to mislead Congress, but that as
the agency's budget grew, its accounting practices got sloppy. He began
investigating CDC accounting practices in wake of the chronic fatigue issue, and
said he recently sent budget documents to Congress to begin clarifying how the
hantavirus money was spent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not saying that's an excuse for not having done it sooner,'' he said.
But ``I apologize for our not having informed Congress quickly about the way we
were using those funds.''

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Hike Shrugged Off  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite four interest rate increases in the past seven
months, Americans seem to be shrugging off efforts to slow the booming U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   As expected, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates a quarter point
Wednesday to 5.75 percent to rein in economic growth and fend off inflation. It
was the fourth increase since last June.
</P>
<P>
	   And yet, consumer confidence and spending are at their highest levels on
record. Low unemployment, rising personal income and a booming stock market have
put more money in Americans' pockets, offsetting worries over rising rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just psychology. People think things are going well so they aren't
reacting as quickly to these interest rate hikes as they would if they thought
things were bad," said David Orr, an economist at First Union Corp. in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The optimism is directly tied to the availability of jobs, Orr said. It's no
coincidence, he added, that consumer confidence is at a 30-year high at the same
time unemployment is at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent economic indicators point up that optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   The housing and automobile sectors -- both extremely sensitive to interest
rate fluctuations -- have dismissed the recent spate of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing construction rose 7.1 percent in December, ending the most
successful year since 1986. New homes sales rose 4.5 percent in December,
pushing the total for 1999 to an all-time record.
</P>
<P>
	   These increases came despite mortgage rates that now average 8.25 percent,
the highest since the summer of 1996. Last June, before the Fed started raising
rates, the average mortgage was at 7.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, car sales in the United States accelerated in January following
up on last year's record sales of 16.9 million vehicles. The Michigan research
firm Morgan &AMP; Co. said sales of cars and light trucks rose 10 percent during the
month, for a projected annual rate of 17.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending has been the major driver behind the economic boom as it
represents two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Macias, 48, a retired Army officer from El Paso, Texas, is
representative of the national mood. On Wednesday he was looking at a $10,000
Harley-Davidson motorcycle that he ordered two days ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to buy the bike no matter what," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Macias said he expects the latest interest rate hike to make Americans "more
conscious of how much you're going to spend on an item and if you really need it
or not."
</P>
<P>
	   But it won't stop him from buying the motorcycle, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Macias said he believes the economy still has room to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody's enjoying the prosperity and not thinking about the future,"
added Herman Scott, 66, a retired FBI agent from Jonesboro, Ga. "Everybody says,
'Hey, if I can get it, I'm going to get it."'
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists believe the Fed's strategy of incremental rate hikes isn't
intended to end the party, but merely lower the volume a bit.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're tapping on the brakes of the economy, not trying to slam on the
brakes," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, a St. Louis
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   After a record-breaking 107 months of expansion, accompanied by few signs of
rising inflation, the economy doesn't need a major overhaul, said Ken Goldstein,
an economist with the Conference Board, a New York research group that measures
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got so much momentum it's like a runner at the beginning of a race.
It's not wheezing across the finish line," Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   That momentum makes it likely that the Fed will raise rates again in the
coming months, Goldstein added.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's rate increase, the fourth since last June, marked the first time
interest rates have risen above the levels of mid-1998, when the Fed lowered
rates three times in an effort to free up capital to help bail out flagging
Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
	   Barring some similar catastrophe, consumer optimism is expected to remain
high.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumer confidence is a reflection of what your own life is like. Most
people are saying to themselves, 'My job is doing well, my company is doing
well, and it looks like it's going to continue for the foreseeable future,"'
said Godfrey Wood, president of the Greater Portland, Me., Chambers of
Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer, Warner-Lambert in Buy Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. tentatively agreed Wednesday to raise its
takeover bid for Warner-Lambert Co. to $85 billion, and the two are working out
the details of a deal that would form the second-largest pharmaceutical maker in
the world, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies must now placate American Home Products, the losing suitor in
a 3- month fight for control of Warner-Lambert. American Home had signed a $59
million deal in November to acquire Warner-Lambert before Pfizer trumped the
bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which is best known for its Viagra drug, will offer 2.75 shares,
worth about $99, for each share of Warner-Lambert, maker of the blockbuster
cholesterol drug Lipitor, said the sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   While Warner-Lambert shareholders would get 10 percent more of Pfizer's
stock than its original offer, those shares are worth about 8 percent less today
than they were when Pfizer first made its bid. Pfizer's original offer would
have been worth $77 billion based on Wednesday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer will have to pay a $1.8 billion breakup fee to American Home
Products. And Pfizer may also have to make other concessions to American Home,
which could still prevent Pfizer from using a favorable accounting treatment in
its acquisition of Warner-Lambert. That could hurt Pfizer's profits.
</P>
<P>
	   All three companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company would have a wide range of medicines including the
blood pressure-control drug Norvasc and the antidepressant Zoloft, as well as
consumer products like Bubblicious Gum, Certs mints, Schick razors and Listerine
mouth wash.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be a formidable, global company that investors will be very happy
with," said Tony Butler, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, who expects the
company's profits will grow at 24 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will have tremendous potential to be a force in any therapeutic area
where they have entries, not just today, but in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pfizer-Warner-Lambert combination is part of an industrywide
consolidation, and follows last month's announcement of deal that would combine
Britain's Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham to create the biggest drug
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the advantages of combining the research budgets and sales staffs of
Warner-Lambert and Pfizer, the companies have waged a very public battle in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have filed lawsuits against each other, and Warner-Lambert
had unsuccessfully sought a white-knight bidder to fend off Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   With such acrimony between the two chairmen, Wall Street does not expect
Warner-Lambert's chairman and chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, to
have a role in the new company. Details, however, were not available Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 5:30 p.m., Warner-Lambert's stock was off 62 1/2 cents at $95 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where Pfizer's stock was off $1 at 36. Shares of
American Home Products were up $1.12 1/2 at $46.12 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Mattel's Stock Rises Nearly 14 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s shares surged nearly 14 percent Wednesday
amid rumors that the toymaker's board of directors was holding an emergency
meeting, possibly to discuss the departure of chief executive Jill Barad.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad has been under fire in recent months for big losses at the company's
newly acquired The Learning Company division, which has put pressure on sales
and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   That has angered investors, who have pushed down Mattel's stock by more than
60 percent from its high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The El Segundo, Calif.-based company did not return phone calls seeking
comment whether a meeting was under way -- if it existed at all. But speculation
circulated on Wall Street and Internet chat rooms, pushing Mattel's stock up.
</P>
<P>
	   Its shares rose $1.43 3/4 to $11.81 1/4 as of 5:15 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of an emergency gathering of the board comes as Mattel prepares to
release its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday. It is also right
before the American International Toy Fair in New York, where toymakers showcase
their products for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have been looking for any signs that the company might be taking
steps to get its business back on track. For months, many have pushed for Barad
to be ousted from her helm of the company.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the biggest problems in the last year has come from Mattel's $3.6
billion purchase of The Learning Company, which it acquired in May as part of an
effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, there are worries that the troubles with The Learning Company may not
be over. Toy industry analysts, who declined to be named, said Wednesday that
there may be more losses to report because of the troubles with the software
division.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not the only thing that has gone wrong at Mattel. The company has lot
a number of top executives over the past year. In addition, Mattel hasn't
produced a must-have toy that's been the talk of the nation in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad is one of four women CEOs at a Fortune 500 company. Andrea Jung is CEO
of Avon; Carleton S. Fiorina holds the top spot at Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler leads Golden West Financial.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key Interest Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, still seeking to slow the
supercharged U.S. economy to a more moderate pace of growth, raised borrowing
costs for millions of Americans for a fourth time since June by pushing a key
interest rate up a quarter point to 5.75 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed action to boost its federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, was quickly followed by announcements from major banks around
the country that they were raising their prime lending rate a similar quarter
point to 8.75 percent, the highest level for this benchmark consumer and
business rate since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which had been worried that the central bank might feel the
need to raise rates by a half-point, turned in a mixed performance Wednesday
with the Dow Jones industrial average down 38.85 points at 11,003.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said while the Fed stopped with just a quarter-point increase,
investors were clearly worried by the tone of the Fed announcement, which
indicated further increases were in store.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a much more hawkish statement from the Fed today than any of the
statements that accompanied its three rate hikes last year," said David Jones,
chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists predicted the Fed would raise rates again at the next
meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on March 21 and again at the May 16
meeting. Some analysts said the unrelenting strength of the economy could prompt
a seventh quarter-point move at the June 28 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed wants to bring this high-flying economy down to a soft landing,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research Corp. "The rate increases
so far haven't really taken a toll on the economy, especially the consumer
sector."
</P>
<P>
	   While private economists saw the economic logic behind the Fed's actions, a
small band Fed critics complained that the central bank was fighting a phantom
menace, given that outside of rising energy costs, inflation has remained
exceptionally low despite a strong economy that has pushed unemployment to a
30-year low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding pretty
badly," Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said of the four rate increases in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., complained that the Fed's rate increases "impose
a tax on every single American citizen through higher interest rates," all to
fight what Dorgan said was a nonexistent inflation threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin and Dorgan spoke on the Senate floor as the Senate debated whether to
confirm Greenspan, 73, for a fourth four-year term as chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was expected to win the confirmation vote easily, with Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying his 12-year record as Fed
chairman could be used to build "a strong case that Alan Greenspan is the
greatest central banker in the history of the world."
</P>
<P>
	   In the statement announcing the Fed decision, the policy-makers said they
remained concerned that the strong economy and tight labor markets will produce
rising wage demands that will not be offset by gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's record economic expansion," the Fed said in explaining its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   While productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has shown big
gains in recent years, Greenspan has expressed growing worries that the
dwindling supply of available workers will eventually overwhelm these
productivity increases, forcing employers to raise product prices to cover their
higher wage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he
expected upcoming unemployment reports to be the biggest factor guiding Fed
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed does not want to see further declines in the unemployment rate,"
Steinberg said, forecasting that Friday's report will show the jobless rate
dipping in January to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first use of its new disclosure policy, the Fed said it viewed future
risks "weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures."
</P>
<P>
	   A string of recent indicators have shown the economy, which set a record
this month for the longest expansion in U.S. history, was growing at a rate of
5.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the government reported that sales of new single family homes
set a record for the second straight year with 904,000 homes sold in 1999, up 2
percent from 1998, indicating that rising mortgage rates have had little effect
so far in slowing sales demand.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second report, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
predict future economic activity, rose a strong 0.4 percent in December, its
biggest gain in nearly a year, indicating the current expansion is in no danger
of faltering.

<HEADLINE> Anger Over Minority-Ownership Rule  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading black and Hispanic entrepreneurs were outraged
Wednesday that a key corporate advisory group recast a rule that firms be 51
percent minority-owned to qualify for certain corporate contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   These leaders contend that this will lead to the end of affirmative action,
while creating fronts for white-owned firms to scoop up billions of dollars in
equity capital.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you don't think that our community is not receiving venture and equity
capital now, what makes you think this will change?" said George Herrera,
president and chief executive of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   But the president of the National Minority Supplier Development Council
countered that her group had created a solution to a pressing problem: Many of
the companies that currently quality are too small to attract large investments
and instead have to rely on loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The NMSDC says that under the new rules, companies would be more attractive
to venture capitalists and other investors because they could potentially be
larger.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 15,000 firms the NMSDC certifies, at least three-fourths have instead
had to rely on debt financing.
</P>
<P>
	   The 51 percent rule still applies, but the NMSDC created a new class of firm
that can be 30 percent minority-owned as long as 51 percent of the voting stock
is held by minorities and that they control the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, NMSDC-certified firms won more than $40 billion in contracts from
NMSDC members, a group of 3,500 companies that includes more than half of the
Fortune 500.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed rule change, which has been under consideration for more than a
year, led to the creation of a coalition last fall of civil rights leaders from
the NAACP, the National Urban League and the National Action Network along with
Earl G. Graves, the publisher of Black Enterprise, elected officials and
Hispanic business leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the objections, the NMSDC had its 78-member advisory board vote
in private, with a majority deciding by Tuesday to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition fears that Congress will take its cue from the vote and end
affirmative action, which has ushered innumerable small companies into the
business world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rules are being changed because of the proliferation of minority-owned
businesses," Herrera said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a thing called racism that necessitated that affirmative action
come into being. When did that go away?" Graves said. "There's not a (major)
minority contractor in construction in the New York area."
</P>
<P>
	   But Harriet Michel, the head of the NMSDC, said it's not likely there will
be majority-owned fronts because "this is going to be the most highly-controlled
investigation into certification in the country."
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no absolute," she said. "There are corporations today that accept
companies without any certification."
</P>
<P>
	   The new rules are expected to go into effect in about 90 days,

<HEADLINE> 7 Charged in Milosevic Murder Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A military court in Belgrade indicted seven
people Wednesday for allegedly planning to assassinate President Slobodan
Milosevic and two others.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven -- one army lieutenant and six civilians -- are charged with
plotting to kill Milosevic, Yugoslav Army Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic and opposition
leader Vuk Draskovic, the independent Beta news agency reported. The defendants
also allegedly conspired to form a terrorist organization called the Serbian
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the seven denied all the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The lieutenant was identified as Boban Gajic, 26, of Belgrade. The other
defendants are from the central town of Krusevac. All seven were arrested two
months ago and remain in custody pending trial in military court in the southern
city of Nis.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say the group collected arms, equipment and propaganda material
for an all-out Serb uprising against Milosevic. Also, a statement attributed to
the group claimed responsibility for a November traffic accident in which
Draskovic was injured and four associates were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Draskovic, though, has blamed the government for that incident.

<HEADLINE> AmeriServe Clients Report Shortages  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- A federal bankruptcy court Wednesday approved a $150 million
line of credit from Burger King Corp. and Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. to keep
a financially troubled Texas food distributor in business.
</P>
<P>
	   The distributor, AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc., had missed payments to
suppliers, resulting in spot shortages of food and paper products at some
restaurants and causing some Burger King franchisees to ask about switching to
other distributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Addison, Texas-based AmeriServe, one of the nation's largest food
distributors, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The $150 million line of credit is good for six months, giving AmeriServe
time to negotiate with debtor-in-possession lenders for more conventional
financing, said Matthew Kleiman, an attorney representing the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "The court's decision puts the company in great position because we'll be
able to continue normal operations and make a seamless transition to
reorganization," Kleiman said after the bankruptcy court proceeding before
Bankruptcy Court Judge Peter Walsh in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately held AmeriServe has not disclosed its current assets and
liabilities but reported in November assets of less than $2 billion and
liabilities and long-term debt of slightly more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say AmeriServe grew too quickly, particularly with two large
acquisitions in 1997 and 1998, and could not service its debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The line of credit was offered Tuesday by two of the distributor's biggest
customers. Burger King and Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., the parent of Pizza
Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, comprise about two-thirds of AmeriServe's accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe's problems paying its bills have led to breaks in the chain that
supplies goods to restaurants. Food and paper-goods suppliers send their
products to distribution centers, which fulfill orders from restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some suppliers have been reluctant to ship anything to us because they are
owed money by AmeriServe," said Robert Doughty, a spokesman for Miami-based
Burger King Corp. Wednesday's temporary financing should give suppliers
confidence that they will be paid for current shipments, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Doughty said AmeriServe supplies 75 percent of the 8,100 U.S. Burger Kings,
and there have been "some minor, spot outages around the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Some franchisees have asked about switching distributors, Doughty said. He
said the company advises the franchises, who typically sign long-term contracts
with distributors, to consult a lawyer before attempting to get out of a
contract involving a company that is going through bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at AmeriServe did not respond to several calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> FTC Rejects BP-Amoco-Arco Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission moved Wednesday to block BP
Amoco's takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., setting the stage for the biggest
oil antitrust court fight since the breakup of Standard Oil nearly a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission voted 3-2 to direct its staff to seek an injunction that
would scuttle the $30 billion merger, concluding the new company would dominate
Alaska oil production and West Coast markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This particular merger is anticompetitive," Richard Parker, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition, said at a news conference after the vote. "We're
going after this merger and we're going to try to stop it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the proposed company was "a colossus" that could dictate prices to
West Coast refiners who rely on Alaska crude oil. Other critics of the merger
have argued that such dominance could translate into higher retail gasoline
prices in California and other West Coast states that rely heavily on Alaska
crude.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would create the second largest nongovernment oil company behind
Exxon Mobil, whose merger was completed in November hours after receiving FTC's
approval. BP Amoco itself was created only a little more than a year ago with
the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco pledged to "argue the case vigorously" in court. "We
believe we have a compelling case," the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield, or Arco as it is commonly
known, together account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil production.
They dominate oil activities in the state, from drilling to transporting crude
to market.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said the government would go to court in San Francisco, as early as
Friday, seeking an injunction that would prevent from completion of the merger
as planned by the two companies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco had said it would sell off 13 percent of the production as well as
part ownership in two Alaska oil fields. But Parker said the new company still
"would control overwhelming proportions of the (Alaska) production."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the proposed divestitures, the combined company would account for
55 percent of the oil flowing from Alaska's North Slope, the FTC estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco said claims the new company dramatically could affect West Coast
prices, which are pegged to world oil markets, were "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
	   While the company said it remained receptive to negotiations and "any
reasonable options," it acknowledged "the only course now open to use is to
resolve the issue through litigation."
</P>
<P>
	   If the request for an injunction is successful, the case likely would go
before an FTC administrative law judge, whose decision can be appealed in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The litigation could take months and eventually may end up before the
Supreme Court if BP Amoco persists in fighting the biggest antitrust challenge
to the oil industry since the Standard Oil breakup nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been other industry challenges and price fixing cases, said
Victor Goldberg, an antitrust scholar and law professor at Columbia University.
But, he said, "this would be the first one attacking the basic market structure
of the oil industry" since the Standard Oil case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court in 1911 ordered the breakup of the Standard Oil holding
company because of its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg and other antitrust scholars said the government may have a tough
time proving its case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil flows. They're going to have to find some sort of argument to show why
the international (market) is not going to solve the problem," said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco contends the merger would produce efficiencies that would lead to
$1 billion in savings worldwide, about a fifth of that in Alaska, and "drive
down Alaskan production costs" so its crude would be more competitive in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any suggestion that there is a special West Coast market for Alaskan crude
oil that functions independently of world crude prices is without foundation,"
the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wednesday's vote, FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky and commissioners Mozelle
Thompson and Sheila Anthony voted to block the merger. Commissioners Orson
Swindle and Thomas Leary voted against seeking an injunction.

<HEADLINE> Glickman Wants Farm Subsidies Spread  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By proposing $11.5 billion more in farm spending, the
Clinton administration is trying to improve on the government's
Republican-written agricultural policy rather than overturn it, Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not rewriting the farm bill. We are enhancing it," Glickman said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the administration's program, which already has come
under criticism from congressional Republicans, is a new system of "supplemental
income" payments targeted to small and medium-size farms and estimated to cost
$5.6 billion through 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   An additional $2.7 billion is earmarked for conservation programs, including
$1.2 billion in direct payments to farmers who take steps to curb runoff of
pesticides and fertilizers from their land. And $1.3 billion more would go
toward expanding the federally subsidized crop insurance program and providing
discounts to farmers on the premiums.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman said the proposals will spread subsidies to farmers and areas of
the country that have traditionally received relatively little federal
assistance, while at the same time putting more of an emphasis on conservation
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The "supplemental income" program would correct what the Clinton
administration and some producer groups see as a major flaw in the GOP-authored
1996 farm law, which scaled back on crop subsidies, ended controls on planting
and gave farmers a series of fixed annual payments. Critics say the fixed
payments were insufficient when commodity prices fell sharply in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has passed $15 billion in emergency assistance over the past year
to compensate farmers for the low prices as well as weather-related crop losses
and is expected to consider another big aid package this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two years of plunging commodity prices, natural disasters and nearly $15
billion in ... emergency relief was a tacit admission that the 1996 farm bill
was not satisfactory," Glickman said. "We cannot ask farmers to wait any
longer."
</P>
<P>
	   The supplemental income plan is coming under criticism from farm groups and
in Congress, largely because of the administration's proposed $30,000 cap on
payments. The fixed "market transition" payments that farmers get under the 1996
farm bill would count toward the $30,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The administration's paltry plan for farmers is out of touch with the
economic crisis in rural America," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Indiana Republican Richard
Lugar, predicted earlier this week that farmers would reject the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The new program also runs the danger of driving commodity prices down
further by encouraging small farms to grow more crops that are already in
surplus, said Bruce Gardner, an agricultural economist at the University of
Maryland. The 1996 farm bill was designed to designed to do just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting into the 21st century. To say you're going to use commodity
policy to prop up these marginal farms ... is not a sustainable, long-term path
for agriculture," Gardner said. "I can't believe we're going to try to keep
these small operations in business.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA officials say they do not believe the supplemental income payments
would have any significant impact on production. They say that too much of the
emergency assistance Congress provided in 1998 and 1999 went to large farms that
did not need it.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the spending in the administration's proposals would be in the
government's 2001 and 2002 budgets. The ideas include:
</P>
<P>
	   --$500 million in low-interest loans to finance construction of grain bins
on farms so producers can hold commodities off the market.
</P>
<P>
	   --$300 million in dairy subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   --A freeze in rates for government crop subsidies, which would otherwise
fall this year because they are tied to recent averages in commodity prices. The
freeze would cost taxpayers an estimated $530 million through 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   --$400 million to develop a bioenergy program for turning crops into fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   --$130 million to assist livestock producers in forming cooperatives for
processing meat.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Releases New 'American Pie'  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY McSHANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bye-bye, Miss American Pie. Hello, Madonna.
</P>
<P>
	   The Material Girl released her version of the 1971 classic "American Pie" to
radio stations on Tuesday, a truncated take on Don McLean's 8 1/2-minute rock
'n' roll homage to Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper.
</P>
<P>
	   The song's debut came before the anniversary of "the day the music died":
Feb. 3, 1959, when a plane carrying the three young rock stars went down in an
Iowa cornfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna's remake times out at under five minutes, a considerable cut from
the original. And don't worry if you don't remember all the words: The Material
Girl has trimmed some of the verses.
</P>
<P>
	   That's blasphemy to a generation that grew up singing along with McLean's
hodgepodge of images and scenes, lines such as:
</P>
<P>
	   "The jester sang for the King and Queen
</P>
<P>
	   "In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
</P>
<P>
	   "And a voice that came from you and me."
</P>
<P>
	   Madonna's version strays far afield from McLean's simple arrangement.
There's an electronic dance beat, and distant background vocals from actor
Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also "an explosion of interest" from adult contemporary and Top 40
radio stations, which have jumped to add the song to their playlists, said Heidi
Ellen Robinson, spokesman for Madonna's label, Maverick.
</P>
<P>
	   The song is from the soundtrack to Madonna's latest movie, "The Next Best
Thing," which co-stars Everett. The movie opens March 3, while the soundtrack
(in perfect marketing style) arrives in stores Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1971 McLean classic was recently ranked as the 19th best rock song ever
by VH1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Madonna version didn't receive such a ringing endorsement from Newsday
writer Isaac Guzman, who described it as "an almost syrupy, slick take" on
McLean's original.
</P>
<P>
	   The radio release was the first chance for the public to hear the new
version. Madonna was originally scheduled to perform the song at the Super Bowl
but pulled out.

<HEADLINE> Austria Govt. Decision Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Facing European sanctions and worldwide scorn,
Austria's president on Wednesday delayed approving a new government that
includes Joerg Haider's rightists until leaders of the coalition pledge to
respect democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage over the coalition between Haider's Freedom Party and the
center-right Austrian People's Party spilled into the streets of this stately,
baroque capital. More than 10,000 people rallied Wednesday night in front of the
People's Party headquarters to protest the coalition deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prove yourself to be a patriot,'' theater producer Andre Heller told the
crowd in remarks directed to People's Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel. ``No
alliance with meanness. No alliance with right-wing radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil's office said Haider and Schuessel would meet with
the chief of state Thursday to sign a ``declaration of values of European
democracy.'' The new government was expected to be approved shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil's demand was designed to spare the country political and diplomatic
isolation within a European Union whose other members doubt Haider's commitment
to liberal democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview to be published Thursday, Klestil told the magazine News
that he fears Austria will suffer ``international damage'' if a government
including Haider's Freedom Party takes power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising Adolf
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has also spoken out against the EU's expansion
and has predicted the new government will impose a nearly complete ban on
immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has sought repeatedly to distance himself from previous statements.
He told reporters this week that the Freedom Party has no sympathy for the
Nazis, adding they were responsible for the ``greatest crimes of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Haider condemned the foreign pressure against his party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attempt from the outside to oppose the (Austrian) wish to change the
political system is not acceptable,'' he said. ``We will put to shame all those
who chastised us too early.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assurances by Haider and Schuessel that their new government would respect
democratic values did little to quiet the furor that swept through Israel and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel recalled its ambassador from Vienna on Wednesday ``for an unlimited
period,'' said Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who called Haider ``dangerous'' to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said any coalition with Haider
would bring diplomatic isolation for Austria. Norway issued a similar warning
Wednesday. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel urged his countrymen to cancel
ski holidays in Austria in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   And in Poland, Haider opponents rallied in front of the Austrian Embassy in
Warsaw. Earlier in the day, the Austrian Consulate in the southern Polish city
of Krakow was pelted with eggs.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked how the Clinton administration viewed the situation, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said, ``We share their (Europeans') concerns. We'll be
watching, and we'll take appropriate steps.'' Albright spoke in Zagreb, Croatia,
where she had stopped on her way home from talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   With an agreement between Haider and Schuessel in place, attention has
shifted to President Klestil. Although his post is largely ceremonial, the
president must swear in a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither party leader has confirmed the makeup of the new Cabinet. The
Austria Press Agency, however, said the Cabinet would be split evenly between
the two parties, with Schuessel as chancellor and a Freedom Party member as vice
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Ministry would go to a member of the People's Party, the agency
said. The Interior Ministry is responsible for immigration policies and
overseeing the police -- high priorities for the Freedom Party, which wants to
restrict immigration and has a tough law and order image.

<HEADLINE> US Investigates Banned Beef Hormone  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A criminal investigation is under way into the shipment
of American beef last year that contained an illegal growth hormone, but there
is no evidence that there has been any other use of the banned substance,
federal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss government notified the United States last July that the banned
carcinogen, diethylstilbestrol, or DES, had been found in two samples of U.S.
beef that was supposed to be free of hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service have been conducting a joint investigation of the
matter, said Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for the USDA agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The hormone was banned in 1979, and the Agriculture Department stopped
testing most beef for it in 1991 after failing to find the compound for several
years. However, meat being shipped to the European Union, which bans the
importation of hormone-treated beef, is tested for the chemical and it has not
shown up, said Gaston. Switzerland is not a member of the EU.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not believe it's being used,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA, however, had already planned before the Swiss discovery to resume
testing for DES this year as part of a plan to make sure it isn't being used,
she said. The testing is expected to begin this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Swiss barred two U.S.
exporters after the discovery: Farmland National Beef Packing Co. and Bruss Co.,
a subsidiary of IBP Inc. IBP and Farmland are two of the nation's biggest beef
processors.
</P>
<P>
	   One tainted sample was traced back to Chicago-based Bruss and then to a
Farmland National Beef plant in Liberal, Kan., said Sherlyn Manson, a
spokeswoman for Farmland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We agree with USDA that it would be an aberration,'' she said. ``We would
find it highly unusual if anybody in the cattle business was using DES. It's
been off the market for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Critics said the Swiss discovery raised questions about the adequacy of the
USDA testing program. ``Obviously they don't have any evidence (of DES) because
they're not looking for it,'' said Ben Cohen, senior staff attorney for the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer, Warner-Lambert Work on Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. tentatively agreed Wednesday to raise its
takeover bid for Warner-Lambert Co. to $85 billion, and the two are working out
the details of a deal that would form the second-largest pharmaceutical maker in
the world, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies must now placate American Home Products, the losing suitor in
a 3- month fight for control of Warner-Lambert. American Home had signed a $59
million deal in November to acquire Warner-Lambert before Pfizer trumped the
bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer, which is best known for its Viagra drug, will offer 2.75 shares,
worth about $99, for each share of Warner-Lambert, maker of the blockbuster
cholesterol drug Lipitor, said the sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   While Warner-Lambert shareholders would get 10 percent more of Pfizer's
stock than its original offer, those shares are worth about 8 percent less today
than they were when Pfizer first made its bid. Pfizer's original offer would
have been worth $77 billion based on Wednesday's stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfizer will have to pay a $1.8 billion breakup fee to American Home
Products. And Pfizer may also have to make other concessions to American Home,
which could still prevent Pfizer from using a favorable accounting treatment in
its acquisition of Warner-Lambert. That could hurt Pfizer's profits.
</P>
<P>
	   All three companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company would have a wide range of medicines including the
blood pressure-control drug Norvasc and the antidepressant Zoloft, as well as
consumer products like Bubblicious Gum, Certs mints, Schick razors and Listerine
mouth wash.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be a formidable, global company that investors will be very happy
with," said Tony Butler, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, who expects the
company's profits will grow at 24 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "They will have tremendous potential to be a force in any therapeutic area
where they have entries, not just today, but in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pfizer-Warner-Lambert combination is part of an industrywide
consolidation, and follows last month's announcement of deal that would combine
Britain's Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham to create the biggest drug
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the advantages of combining the research budgets and sales staffs of
Warner-Lambert and Pfizer, the companies have waged a very public battle in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have filed lawsuits against each other, and Warner-Lambert
had unsuccessfully sought a white-knight bidder to fend off Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
	   With such acrimony between the two chairmen, Wall Street does not expect
Warner-Lambert's chairman and chief executive officer, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, to
have a role in the new company. Details, however, were not available Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   As of 5:30 p.m., Warner-Lambert's stock was off 62 1/2 cents at $95 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where Pfizer's stock was off $1 at 36. Shares of
American Home Products were up $1.12 1/2 at $46.12 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key Interest Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, still seeking to slow the
supercharged U.S. economy, raised borrowing costs for millions of Americans for
a fourth time since June by pushing a key interest rate up a quarter point to
5.75 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed action to boost its federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, was quickly followed by announcements from major banks around
the country that they were raising their prime lending rate a similar quarter
point to 8.75 percent, the highest level for this benchmark consumer and
business rate since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which had been worried that the central bank might feel the
need to raise rates by a half-point, turned in a mixed performance Wednesday
with the Dow Jones industrial average down 38.85 points at 11,003.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said while the Fed stopped with just a quarter-point increase,
investors were clearly worried by the tone of the Fed announcement, which
indicated further increases were in store.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a much more hawkish statement from the Fed today than any of the
statements that accompanied its three rate hikes last year," said David Jones,
chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists predicted the Fed would raise rates again at the next
meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on March 21 and again at the May 16
meeting. Some analysts said the unrelenting strength of the economy could prompt
a seventh quarter-point move at the June 28 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed wants to bring this high-flying economy down to a soft landing,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research Corp. "The rate increases
so far haven't really taken a toll on the economy, especially the consumer
sector."
</P>
<P>
	   While private economists saw the economic logic behind the Fed's actions, a
small band Fed critics complained that the central bank was fighting a phantom
menace, given that outside of rising energy costs, inflation has remained
exceptionally low despite a strong economy that has pushed unemployment to a
30-year low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding pretty
badly," Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said of the four rate increases in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., complained that the Fed's rate increases "impose
a tax on every single American citizen through higher interest rates," all to
fight what Dorgan said was a nonexistent inflation threat.

<P>
	   Harkin and Dorgan spoke on the Senate floor as the Senate debated whether to
confirm Alan Greenspan, 73, for a fourth four-year term as Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was expected to win the confirmation vote easily, with Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying his 12-year record as Fed
chairman could be used to build "a strong case that Alan Greenspan is the
greatest central banker in the history of the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate was scheduled to vote on Greenspan's nomination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to boosting the federal funds rate, the Fed increased its
largely symbolic discount rate, the rate the Fed charges to make direct loans to
banks, by a quarter point to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the statement announcing the Fed decisions, the policy-makers said they
remained concerned that the strong economy and tight labor markets will produce
rising wage demands that will not be offset by gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's record economic expansion," the Fed said in explaining its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   While productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has shown big
gains in recent years, Greenspan has expressed growing worries that the
dwindling supply of available workers will eventually overwhelm these
productivity increases, forcing employers to raise product prices to cover their
higher wage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he
expected upcoming unemployment reports to be the biggest factor guiding Fed
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed does not want to see further declines in the unemployment rate,"
Steinberg said, forecasting that Friday's report will show the jobless rate
dipping in January to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first use of its new disclosure policy, the Fed said it viewed future
risks "weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures."
</P>
<P>
	   A string of recent indicators have shown the economy, which set a record
this month for the longest expansion in U.S. history, was growing at a rate of
5.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the government reported that sales of new single family homes
set a record for the second straight year with 904,000 homes sold in 1999, up 2
percent from 1998, indicating that rising mortgage rates have had little effect
so far in slowing sales demand.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second report, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
predict future economic activity, rose a strong 0.4 percent in December, its
biggest gain in nearly a year, indicating the current expansion is in no danger
of faltering.

<HEADLINE> Mattel's Stock Rises Nearly 14 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s shares surged nearly 14 percent Wednesday
amid rumors that the toymaker's board of directors was holding an emergency
meeting, possibly to discuss the departure of chief executive Jill Barad.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad has been under fire in recent months for big losses at the company's
newly acquired The Learning Company division, which has put pressure on sales
and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   That has angered investors, who have pushed down Mattel's stock by more than
60 percent from its high of $30.31 1/4 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The El Segundo, Calif.-based company did not return phone calls seeking
comment whether a meeting was under way -- if it existed at all. But speculation
circulated on Wall Street and Internet chat rooms, pushing Mattel's stock up.
</P>
<P>
	   Its shares rose $1.43 3/4 to $11.81 1/4 as of 5:15 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of an emergency gathering of the board comes as Mattel prepares to
release its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday. It is also right
before the American International Toy Fair in New York, where toymakers showcase
their products for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors have been looking for any signs that the company might be taking
steps to get its business back on track. For months, many have pushed for Barad
to be ousted from her helm of the company.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the biggest problems in the last year has come from Mattel's $3.6
billion purchase of The Learning Company, which it acquired in May as part of an
effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, there are worries that the troubles with The Learning Company may not
be over. Toy industry analysts, who declined to be named, said Wednesday that
there may be more losses to report because of the troubles with the software
division.
</P>
<P>
	   That's not the only thing that has gone wrong at Mattel. The company has
lost a number of top executives over the past year. In addition, Mattel hasn't
produced a must-have toy that's been the talk of the nation in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad is one of four women CEOs at a Fortune 500 company. Andrea Jung is CEO
of Avon; Carleton S. Fiorina holds the top spot at Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler leads Golden West Financial.

<HEADLINE> Study: Dying Kids Suffer Needlessly  </HEADLINE>
    By JANET McCONNAUGHEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Children dying of cancer sometimes suffer more than necessary because
doctors try so hard to cure them that they do not pay enough attention to easing
symptoms, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   It's entirely understandable: "The life of the child is so precious, it's
hard to give that up," said Dr. Joanne Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
	   But that approach can -- and should -- be changed, said Wolfe, an instructor
in pediatric oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital
and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe's study of suffering among children with cancer was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard fact is that one-quarter of all children diagnosed with cancer will
die of it. That is considerably better than it used to be -- 30 years ago, the
death rate was 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the researchers talked to parents of 103 children who had died of
cancer between 1990 and 1997, they were told that 92 had suffered "a great deal"
or "a lot" from at least one symptom. More than half had suffered significantly
from at least three symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatigue, pain, trouble breathing and poor appetite were the most common
complaints. Nausea and vomiting, constipation and diarrhea were next. More than
80 percent of the children hurt. Most of them were treated for the pain, but
only 27 percent of those felt better.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifty of the children were still getting cancer treatments, such as
radiation, chemotherapy or a bone-marrow transplant, in their last month alive.
Seven died in the bone-marrow transplant unit.
</P>
<P>
	   "For most children with cancer, the primary goal of treatment is to achieve
a cure," Wolfe wrote. "Considerations of the toxicity of the therapy, the
quality of life, and growth and development are usually secondary to this goal."
</P>
<P>
	   Parents of children who died from cancer said the article made an important
point. But they also felt that doctors did everything they could to relieve
suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is very difficult, especially in the late stages of a difficult
struggle, to focus on relieving the pain and balancing that with whatever
treatments may still exist," said Chris Hoefflin, whose son, Michael, died from
brain cancer in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings indicate that doctors "were pushing for a cure even to the end,
not knowing exactly when to stop," said Marilyn Hockenberry-Eaton, an associate
professor of pediatric hematology and oncology at Baylor College of Medicine and
director of nurse practitioners at Texas Children's Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
	   She praised the article.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have created very successful treatments for childhood cancer, but on the
way, something's had to go," she said. One of those things, she said, is a focus
on relieving symptoms of terminally ill children.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like its overlooked, but it's not emphasized," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hockenberry-Eaton said parents often do not want their children to get
opiates for pain, either because they are afraid of addiction, or because it
seems to represent acknowledgment that the disease is terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a number of studies have found "suboptimal" quality of care for
dying adults, high-quality care to relieve symptoms is now an expected standard,
Wolfe wrote. The researchers looked at whether the care of children with cancer
met that standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Early findings from the study prompted Dana-Farber and Children's to set up
a team in 1997 to help parents, doctors and nurses ease the hurt for dying
children.
</P>
<P>
	   The team created a worksheet to help parents, doctors and nurses recognize
symptoms and treat them. It is working on a diary to help parents keep track of
the symptoms and treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   It has helped parents figure out how to let a toddler visit her dying
brother, also a toddler, without scarring her emotionally. And with the same
parents, the team discussed the painful question of when to stop treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes people think that will extend life, but in this case it would
only have increased his suffering," said Janet Duncan, an oncology nurse at
Children's. "So the family was able to do that, and make handprints with him
that they could keep, and really be together to say their goodbyes."

Students Rally for Tuition Freezes
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Rachelle Sauve draped a thick, metal chain around her neck as
she joined a national day of student protests against tuition increases and
crippling debt.
</P>
<P>
	   It symbolized how getting an education will tie her down, the second-year
Carleton University student said.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than two years into a bachelor's degree in human rights and women's
studies, 21-year-old Sauve says she's $27,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
	   That figure will mushroom to at least $50,000 by graduation, she expects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The loan system is not working,'' she said on Parliament Hill as about
1,500 students and other supporters waved placards and called for lower tuition,
more grants and a $3.7-billion federal reinvestment in higher education.
</P>
<P>
	   The full day of protest was to push for renewed education and social
spending in the federal budget expected this month.

Health Care Tops Premiers' Agenda at Quebec City Meeting
</P>
<P>
	   QUEBEC (AP) -- The healthcare system is expected to get top treatment as
premiers gather to set their priorities for the coming federal budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The premiers, who meet in Quebec City today, are expected to ask Prime
Minister Jean Chretien's government to put several billion dollars back into the
healthcare system.
</P>
<P>
	   The four Atlantic premiers -- Prince Edward Island's Pat Binns, Nova
Scotia's John Hamm, New Brunswick's Bernard Lord and Newfoundland's Brian Tobin
-- say Ottawa has no other choice if it wants to preserve the system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The federal government has already made clear its intention to introduce
tax cuts in the upcoming budget,'' they said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time has come for it to complete the balance through a recommitment of
funding for health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tobin said the system needs an immediate injection of $3.5 billion to $4.5
billion -- part of it in cash and part to be used in consultation with the
provinces and healthcare professionals.

Commons Finance Committee Report Holds Clues to Federal Budget
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Personal income tax cuts, a major infrastructure program and
changes to RRSPs are all recommendations from the Commons finance committee that
will likely be part of this month's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
	   While budget details are leaking out, more clues can be found in recent
recommendations of the powerful, all-party committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's record for seeing its advice translated into budget measures
is good, observers say.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics complain that's because Finance Minister Paul Martin has too much
influence over the Liberal-dominated committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the finance committee in its recent incarnation is more frequently
than not a branch plant of Paul Martin's office,'' said Scott Brison,
Conservative finance critic and a committee member.
</P>
<P>
	   Brison would like even deeper tax cuts than the $46 billion over five years
recommended by the committee.

	    Parliament To Pass Bill Outlawing Police Chases
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Criminals who spark high-speed police chases could soon face
severe jail sentences if Parliament manages to achieve consensus Monday in its
first debate of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed law, which has been delayed since December, could be on its way
to the Senate for final approval if all five parties agree to pass it when
Parliament reopens Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dan McTeague, an Ontario Liberal MP who introduced the bill in October,
says he can't be sure everyone is on side.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the government's introduction of a bill spelling out terms for Quebec
separation in December, the Bloc Quebecois promised to do what it could in the
Commons to delay the clarity bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
	   McTeague tried to get consensus on the high-speed chase bill before
Parliament broke for the holidays but failed because of the Bloc's tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their tactic was to simply delay, stall, obfuscate at any cost,'' he said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the Bloc said while the party does plan to slow things
down in the House, it will be picking its battles.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bloc has no official position on the police chase bill, she said, and
will allow its members a free vote Monday.

	    Study: Many Canadians Have Trouble Coping With Stress
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Workplaces are a major source of stress, but most Canadians
feel supported on the job, the Heart and Stroke Foundation said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors with the foundation released a report card evaluating how 1,751
Canadians over age 30 felt about stress and their coping abilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Of those surveyed, 43 per cent said they felt overwhelmed by work, family or
financial responsibilities, while only one-quarter felt they coped well with
stress.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty per cent, however, realized prolonged stress can harm the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Stress can be healthy, spurring us to do more than we think we can. But too
much -- as a result of major transitions such as a job change, illness or new
baby, or a combination of many factors -- can leave one feeling overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
	   But are Canadians more stressed out than, say, 30 years ago, before
technology, shifting family structures and workplace uncertainty were issues?
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Paul Dorian, a cardiologist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, says
it's hard to tell because there's little previous research for comparison
purposes.

	    Ontario Seeks To Fix Violent Offender Rule Glitch
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Ottawa must move quickly to fix a ``defect'' in the Criminal
Code that allows violent offenders to serve their jail terms in the community,
says Ontario's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Flaherty wrote a letter Wednesday urging federal Justice Minister Anne
McLellan to curb the use of so-called conditional sentences as soon as
Parliament resumes next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter follows a Supreme Court ruling Monday that upheld the use of
conditional sentences, despite the efforts of Ottawa and the provinces to have
certain violent crimes declared ineligible.
</P>
<P>
	   Conditional sentences allow offenders facing jail terms of less than two
years to serve their time in the community rather than behind bars, under
certain limitations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We consider that's a discretion that ought not to be extended to the
courts, quite frankly,'' Flaherty said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Society demands, and the people of Ontario demand, that serious and
violent crime not be dealt with by way of conditional sentences. That's the
position I've taken.''
</P>
<P>
	   The high court noted in its ruling that the Criminal Code itself could
easily stipulate that violent crimes like sexual assault and manslaughter be
excluded from conditional sentence eligibility, but does not.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa introduced conditional sentences in 1996 to give judges an
alternative to jail for offenders not considered a threat to society. Judges can
also impose any conditions they see fit.

	   Expert: Black Babies Not Getting Proper AIDS Treatment
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Many babies of African and Caribbean descent in Canada are
not getting the treatment which could prevent them from developing AIDS, says an
expert who works with immigrants and refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   AIDS rates among the black immigrant population are far above the national
average, said Esther Tharao of Women's Health in Women's Hands, a Toronto health
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   She said black people in Ontario account for 12 per cent of the province's
HIV cases, a highly disproportionate share, and the situation is similar in
Montreal and Vancouver. ``For African and Caribbean women it is a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 study found that 70 per cent of HIV-infected children at the Toronto
Hospital for Sick Children were born to mothers of African descent, Tharao told
a briefing Wednesday on children affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   A child born to an HIV-infected mother has an approximately 30 per cent
chance of being infected. This can be reduced to eight per cent with AZT
treatment shortly after birth.

<HEADLINE> FTC Rejects BP-Amoco-Arco Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission moved Wednesday to block BP
Amoco's takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., setting the stage for the biggest
oil antitrust court fight since the breakup of Standard Oil nearly a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission voted 3-2 to direct its staff to seek an injunction that
would scuttle the $30 billion merger, concluding the new company would dominate
Alaska oil production and West Coast markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This particular merger is anticompetitive," Richard Parker, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition, said at a news conference after the vote. "We're
going after this merger and we're going to try to stop it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the proposed company was "a colossus" that could dictate prices to
West Coast refiners who rely on Alaska crude oil. Other critics of the merger
have argued that such dominance could translate into higher retail gasoline
prices in California and other West Coast states that rely heavily on Alaska
crude.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would create the second largest nongovernment oil company behind
Exxon Mobil, whose merger was completed in November hours after receiving FTC's
approval. BP Amoco itself was created only a little more than a year ago with
the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco pledged to "argue the case vigorously" in court. "We
believe we have a compelling case," the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield, or Arco as it is commonly
known, together account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil production.
They dominate oil activities in the state, from drilling to transporting crude
to market.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said the government would go to court in San Francisco, as early as
Friday, seeking an injunction that would prevent from completion of the merger
as planned by the two companies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco had said it would sell off 13 percent of the production as well as
part ownership in two Alaska oil fields. But Parker said the new company still
"would control overwhelming proportions of the (Alaska) production."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the proposed divestitures, the combined company would account for
55 percent of the oil flowing from Alaska's North Slope, the FTC estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco said claims the new company dramatically could affect West Coast
prices, which are pegged to world oil markets, were "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
	   While the company said it remained receptive to negotiations and "any
reasonable options," it acknowledged "the only course now open to us is to
resolve the issue through litigation."
</P>
<P>
	   If the request for an injunction is successful, the case likely would go
before an FTC administrative law judge, whose decision can be appealed in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The litigation could take months and eventually may end up before the
Supreme Court if BP Amoco persists in fighting the biggest antitrust challenge
to the oil industry since the Standard Oil breakup nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been other industry challenges and price fixing cases, said
Victor Goldberg, an antitrust scholar and law professor at Columbia University.
But, he said, "this would be the first one attacking the basic market structure
of the oil industry" since the Standard Oil case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court in 1911 ordered the breakup of the Standard Oil holding
company because of its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg and other antitrust scholars said the government may have a tough
time proving its case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil flows. They're going to have to find some sort of argument to show why
the international (market) is not going to solve the problem," said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco contends the merger would produce efficiencies that would lead to
$1 billion in savings worldwide, about a fifth of that in Alaska, and "drive
down Alaskan production costs" so its crude would be more competitive in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any suggestion that there is a special West Coast market for Alaskan crude
oil that functions independently of world crude prices is without foundation,"
the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wednesday's vote, FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky and commissioners Mozelle
Thompson and Sheila Anthony voted to block the merger. Commissioners Orson
Swindle and Thomas Leary voted against seeking an injunction.

<HEADLINE> Amway Corp. To Reorganize  </HEADLINE>
    By LISA SINGHANIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Citing a changing world economy and slow sales,
direct-selling giant Amway Corp. announced Wednesday it will restructure its
global business and cut jobs to become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
	   No details were immediately released about how many of the Ada-based
company's 12,000 employees worldwide might be affected by the restructuring,
which is expected to play out over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Bain, a spokesman for the privately-held company, said the changes are
designed to make Amway more competitive in a world where the Internet is
increasingly significant.
</P>
<P>
	   Amway, which sells soaps, cosmetics, vitamins and a range of other products
had estimated retail sales of $5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bain said cost savings are not a primary factor, although sales have slowed
in North America, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. Amway recently
completed buybacks of shares of Amway Asia Pacific Ltd. and Amway Japan, Ltd.,
its only publicly held subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our cash position is solid, our debt is manageable, we're financially very
strong," Bain said. "Our sales are a bit behind what we hoped they would be, but
that's not the driving force here."
</P>
<P>
	   Bain said tentative plans call for Amway to reorganize into three divisions:
</P>
<P>
	   -- A direct-selling unit that concentrates on Amway's traditional business,
while overseeing Quixtar, Amway's Internet-retailing sister company launched
last fall;
</P>
<P>
	   -- A manufacturing and business unit;
</P>
<P>
	   -- An entrepreneurial division to come up with new ways to direct-market to
the public, possibly incorporating some of the Internet technologies used by
Quixtar.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Koop, who heads Amway's operations, will take over the distribution and
manufacturing unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Van Andel and Dick DeVos will retain their jobs as chairman and
president respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Amway's free-lance work force, also known as independent business owners,
should not be affected, Bain said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Eyes Scandinavia As Example  </HEADLINE>
   By JAVIER BAENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Seeking a blueprint for Colombia's future,
government and rebel negotiators flew to Sweden and Norway this week for a look
at how Scandinavian societies balance economic competition with social justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Victor G. Ricardo, the Colombian government's peace commissioner, and a
high-level Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia delegation led by chief
negotiator Raul Reyes departed Colombia on Tuesday, said Foreign Minister
Guillermo Fernandez de Soto.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend, government and FARC negotiators launched talks on a new model
for economic and social development. Rebels say Colombia's deeply rooted
inequalities are the basis for their nearly 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This group of Nordic nations, friends of the peace process, can offer good
ideas for the negotiations regarding economic issues,'' Fernandez de Soto said
in a radio interview Wednesday. He spent the weekend in Stockholm and Oslo
working out details of the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Council of Swedish Industry invited the Colombians to
Stockholm to study aspects of that country's society.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we can provide is probably ideas and perspectives but indeed not any
solutions or any firm advice,'' said the council's executive director, Aake
Magnusson.
</P>
<P>
	   In rebel-controlled southern Colombia, government and FARC negotiators
agreed last weekend to work on an economic agreement as the first step toward
ending the conflict. Every third person in this Andean nation lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides have said they believe neither socialism nor unfettered
capitalism are acceptable, and that foreign investment should be encouraged
without Colombians ceding control of their natural resources.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have set an 18-month timetable for peace. However, analysts
expect the process to take years.
</P>
<P>
	   The FARC has refused a cease-fire and business leaders have shown little
willingness to offer concessions. Nevertheless, rebel leaders whose hermetic
life had given them little exposure to the modern world have been opening up
recently. In June, they received the New York Stock Exchange's chairman, Richard
Grasso.

<HEADLINE> Some Bush Petitions Said Fraudulent  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawyers for the state GOP admitted in court Wednesday that
Republicans in Brooklyn and the Bronx used fraudulent signatures to try to get
Texas Gov. George W. Bush on the March 7 presidential primary ballot in their
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The admission means no Bush delegates will appear on primary ballots in the
16th Congressional District, which covers parts of the south and west Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers appearing in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn conceded that
candidates seeking to become Bush delegates from the 16th district and alternate
delegates from the 10th Congressional District, which covers parts of Brooklyn,
compiled petitions that included forged signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today I had an 86-year-old blind woman come to court,'' said Bob Muir, a
lawyer for Bush opponent Steve Forbes, who challenged the Texas governor's
petitions in court. ``She didn't sign any petitions and she didn't know anything
about any petitions, and somebody forged her name.''
</P>
<P>
	   Party rules require presidential candidates seeking to get on the ballot to
gather supporters' signatures in each of the state's 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   A Bush spokesman said the governor will be upset if the allegations are
true.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't have anything to do with what they are alleged to have done,''
said campaign spokesman Scott McClellan. ``We'll be disappointed if people who
want to carry our banner were not following the rules.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state party -- which is supporting Bush and working with the tacit
approval of his campaign -- has challenged the validity of signatures gathered
by Forbes and Arizona Sen. John McCain, claiming they should be kicked off
ballots in some districts because of technical problems with their petitions. No
fraud was alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   Muir said the flaws in the Bush petitions were more serious.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Buley, general counsel to the Republican state committee, said that
since GOP lawyers have challenged the validity of signatures gathered by the
McCain and Forbes campaigns, it was only fair that Bush delegates be held to the
same standards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had one steady mantra through this whole process, and that is,
'You've got to play by the rules to get on the ballot,''' Buley said. ``In this
case we had Bush delegates not playing by the rules. ... We felt it just wasn't
proper to pursue (an effort) to retain ballot positions for these people who did
not act according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 16th district forgeries were committed by people seeking to become Bush
delegates, lawyers for Forbes and the GOP agreed. Since they are barred from
running and it is too late to put new delegates in place, there will be no Bush
slate in that district on March 7. The 10th district frauds were committed only
by people seeking to become alternates, the lawyers said, so the regular Bush
delegates can remain on the ballot.

<HEADLINE> Boy Falls Nine Stories, Breaks Leg  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy who fell nine stories from the
roof of a building survived with only a broken leg, national television reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, Lasha Gogichaishvili, was playing with friends on the roof of the
building when he tripped and fell over the edge, the report said. On his way
down, he plunged through three clotheslines stretched between apartment
buildings, which partially broke his fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors in the Black Sea city of Batumi, where the boy lives, said he
suffered no damage to internal organs and that he could return home Thursday.

	   Delaware GOP primary
</P>
<P>
	   Republican delegates: 12
</P>
<P>
	   Analysis: Texas Gov. George W. Bush and conservative Steve Forbes both need

<P>
	   Analysis: Democrat Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, led Gore in
pre-New Hampshire polls in this state, part of his strategy to sweep Northeast

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> After N.H., the 'National Campaign'  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The snowy expanses and quirky electorates of Iowa and New
Hampshire behind them, the presidential candidates recast their campaigns
Wednesday for a broader horizon of big-state primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The warmups are over, the national campaign has begun,'' said Democrat
Bill Bradley, reviewing his 0-for-2 record against Vice President Al Gore,
including a stinging defeat in New Hampshire's leadoff primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Licking his wounds from a landslide loss in the GOP contest, front-runner
George W. Bush said New Hampshire victor John McCain ``had the luxury of picking
and choosing'' the states in which he would compete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a national candidate,'' Bush said, knowing the GOP race will soon
become a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Working off wildly different primary schedules, the Democratic and
Republican candidates set separate courses out of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley threw themselves into coast-to-coast travel to prepare for
their next Election Day: March 7, when Democrats in 15 states award nearly 40
percent of the convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and the rest of the GOP field, meanwhile, will compete in a
handful of February primaries that could reshape the race before their own March
7 showdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Strategists in both parties worked Wednesday to determine where to focus
their resources.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have more time to prepare, but less money to spend. Advisers in
both contenders' camps, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Gore expects Bradley to spend $5 million on TV in the March 7 states, and
the vice president will be prepared to match it. Bradley aides say their budget
is several million dollars higher than Gore expects.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Both campaigns realize they don't have enough money to impact voters with
widespread major-market TV ads. Gore plans to target his ads to reach Democratic
constituencies. To a lesser extent, Bradley hopes to do the same. Shows that
attract black viewers, for example, would draw the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Both campaigns will rely heavily on ``free media,'' news reports about
the campaign, mostly on local TV. Gore has the advantage as the front-runner and
sitting vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Gore plans to beam his way by satellite into states where Bradley is
visiting, hoping to piggyback on his rival's coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   For trips and TV ads, Gore plans to focus much of his attention on Ohio,
California, Georgia and New York, four delegate-rich states loaded with
traditional Democratic constituencies -- such as minorities and labor members.
Exit polls showed Gore doing well among those groups in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore strategists say they hope to force Bradley to spend his money on his
political base, the Northeast. Polls show Gore doing well in New York,
Massachusetts and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before any bounce he'll get from the New Hampshire victory, the vice
president led Bradley 2-1 in California, a state with 367 of the 2,170 delegates
needed to clinch the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   A top Bradley strategist said the March 7 campaign is not a state-by-state
fight but rather a national effort with the media playing a central role. That's
why Bradley abruptly switched position and called for weekly debates against
Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley already had an uphill struggle against the party establishment, and
his defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire make it even less likely that he can
overcome Gore's huge advantages. Democratic strategists said it's time for
Bradley to roll the dice, perhaps accepting Gore's offer for a joint agreement
to not air TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Delaware's primary next Tuesday offers Bush and
publisher Steve Forbes a chance to recover from McCain's beating. Forbes, who
has gotten little for his personal investment in the race, badly needs a win.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush can't afford another loss, thus he's splitting his time between
Delaware and South Carolina, which is next up on the primary calendar. McCain is
bypassing Delaware to focus on South Carolina's Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists plan to use surrogates, and perhaps their own TV ads, to
question McCain's conservative credentials and criticize his support of tobacco
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Learning from their mistakes in New Hampshire, aides say Bush will be less
scripted and more open to question-and-answer sessions that served McCain so
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush himself promised to be tougher on McCain. ``One of the things that he
did a fine job of is making himself look like the outsider. He's the Washington,
D.C., person,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor also plans to tailor his message for a more conservative
electorate, as evidenced by his visit Wednesday to the Bob Jones University.
Some aides privately objected to the visit, saying the school's segregationist
past sends the wrong message from a candidate espousing ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exultant in victory, McCain's advisers promised no major changes in their
message. They do hope to stuff his depleted bank account with donations
generated by the New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
	   He raised $500,000 from the Internet alone just hours after winning.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain needs to defeat Bush again to keep his campaign alive, but South
Carolina will be harder than New Hampshire. The Arizonan led Granite State polls
for eight weeks and benefited from the state's independent spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain advisers suspect that Bush still holds a double-digit lead in South
Carolina. And the state tends to back establishment candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   As McCain rode a wave of good feeling, a reporter asked Wednesday if he
would consider Bush as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course,'' the senator replied. ``But I think that doing that after
winning one primary is a little presumptuous.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Testifies in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George Tenet says there is no evidence that
classified material improperly kept on former director John Deutch's home
computer fell into the wrong hands via the Internet. Still, ``We cannot exclude
that possibility,'' he told a Senate committee looking into the security lapse
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was sloppy in what he did,'' Tenet said of his former boss and
predecessor. ``He worked around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tenet denied he
deliberately delayed an investigation into Deutch's computer practices. But, he
conceded, ``The internal investigation took too long. The process was not
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet stripped Deutch of his security clearances in August, even though the
CIA investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified materials began in
December 1996, the month Tenet became acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal report by the CIA's inspector general faults Tenet and other
senior CIA officials for waiting too long before notifying the Justice
Department or congressional intelligence oversight committees of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet agreed the CIA was slow in notifying appropriate officials and
lawmakers. ``There was no excuse for that,'' he said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When he left his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home and found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet said most of the classified documents on Deutch's computers were not
ones he took home from secure CIA computers but ones he created in writing
reports. Even so, Tenet said, there were ``high levels of classified materials''
on Deutch's home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence-community officials, speaking later on the condition of
anonymity, said a chief concern was that the computer used by Tenet for CIA work
at home also had an America Online account used by Deutch and other family
members to access the Internet and send and receive e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators concluded that, in at least one instance, an e-mail message
was sent to Tenet's AOL account from an individual who identified himself as a
former Russian scientist, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators determined that the e-mail came from a European country,
said the officials. The e-mail was incoming, and not solicited or answered by
Deutch, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS News, meanwhile, quoting unidentified current and former intelligence
officers, said that pornography sites were among ``high risk'' sites visited by
someone in the Deutch household.
</P>
<P>
	   Several sources familiar with the investigation suggested that a review of
data on the hard drive of the computer did, in fact, show that such sites were
among those logged onto by someone using the computer. But the times of the
visit did not match up with times when Deutch was home, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to those familiar with the still-classified inspector general's
report, Deutch deleted more than 1,000 secret documents on the computer when he
became aware of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized. Although the CIA eventually referred the case to the
Justice Department, Deutch has not been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was grilled on the security lapses during a hearing on world trouble
spots. In that testimony, Tenet said:
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a ``high potential'' for a military flare-up across the Taiwan
Strait this year because of increasing tensions between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   --Over the next 15 years, U.S. cities could be within range of ballistic
missiles from ``North Korea, probably Iran and possibly Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The CIA, working with foreign governments, has helped to bring ``more than
two dozens terrorists to justice'' since July 1998. More than half were
associated with suspected fugitive terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia's economic difficulties are weakening the government's ability to
safeguard its nuclear arsenal. `While there is no evidence weapons are missing,
``We remain concerned by reports of lax discipline, labor strikes, poor morale
and criminal activities at nuclear storage facilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Deutch matter was one of ``grave concern,'' said the committee chairman,
Sen. Richard Shelby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people have a keen interest in the performance of senior
officials charged with upholding our laws and policies with respect to the
protection of classified information, '' said Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby asked Tenet if he could assure Congress that foreign powers or other
unauthorized parties had not gotten access to Deutch's materials via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   While there was no evidence of that, Tenet said: ''``We cannot exclude that
possibility. I can't give you a statement that it absolutely didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch clearly violated CIA security rules on the handling of classified
documents, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet balked at questions on whether the Deutch material posed as much
damage to U.S. security if it were to fall into the wrong hands as information
passed on by convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a case of espionage, Tenet said. ``I would not put the Deutch
case in the same category as Ames and Pollard. I don't think it's fair.''

<HEADLINE> Sharif Said To Want Plane Diverted  </HEADLINE>
   By ZAHID HUSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Hours before he was ousted in a coup, Nawaz Sharif
ordered the state-run airline to refuse landing rights to a plane carrying the
army chief, a witness at the former premier's trial testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors charge that Sharif ordered the airliner turned away as part of a
plot to kill Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who led the military coup when the plane
eventually landed.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharif was arrested and charged with hijacking, attempted murder, kidnapping
and terrorism. Three of the charges carry either the death penalty or life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharif has denied the allegations and has demanded the restoration of his
civilian government, which was elected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Shahnawaz Dara, director of flight operations for Pakistan International
Airlines, testified Wednesday that Sharif gave the order Oct. 12 as the jet was
approached Karachi's airport en route from Sri Lanka. The plane was carrying 188
passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dara said he received a call from the airline's chairman, telling him that
the flight should be diverted to Muscat, Oman. But the plane didn't have enough
fuel to make the trip, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly afterward, military officers seized the airport's control tower and
allowed the plane to land. Military officials said the plane had been circling
the airport and had only minutes of fuel remaining when it touched down.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial began a week ago. The prosecution plans to call dozens of
witnesses in the case, and the trial is expected to last several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Seeks To Pare Waco Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department wants a federal judge to throw out
a key part of the wrongful-death lawsuit against the government over the 1993
raid on the Branch Davidian complex near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Davidian lawyers are seeking to reinstate as defendants two of the
FBI's on-scene commanders. And FBI sharpshooter Lon Horiuchi, who is the only
named defendant remaining in the civil lawsuit filed by Davidian survivors and
relatives, sought Wednesday to be removed from the case, which heads to trial in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
	   In their filing in federal court in Waco, lawyers for Horiuchi, who was in
charge of a sniper post outside the Davidians' compound, said there is not a
``shred of evidence'' that he fired his weapon during the siege's final hours on
April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of whether federal personnel fired into the Davidians' compound
as it burned is a central issue in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Davidians contend FBI infrared surveillance footage taken April 19 shows
federal personnel fired into the building as it burned, cutting off the
Davidians' only route of escape. Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80
followers died that day, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds that
federal authorities say were inflicted by the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials insist no government personnel, civilian or military,
fired any shots in the waning hours of the 51-day siege. They say the bursts of
light captured on the infrared tapes represent ``glint.'' They also deny any
responsibility for the inferno that consumed the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   In a pivotal ruling last July, U.S. District Judge Walter Smith limited the
plaintiffs' case to three main areas: whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms acted with excessive force during the botched Feb. 28, 1993, raid that
triggered the siege; and whether the FBI fired into the compound 51 days later
or was negligent with regard to the fire that destroyed the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   On-scene commander Jeff Jamar has said he kept local firetrucks away as the
fire raged out of concern that the Davidians would shoot at the firefighters.
</P>
<P>
	   If Smith rules in the government's favor, the plaintiffs would find their
case limited to the question of excessive force during the initial raid and
whether federal agents fired into the compound on April 19.
</P>
<P>
	   In their motion Wednesday, the Davidians sought to reinstate as defendants
two FBI supervisors at Waco -- Jamar and Richard Rogers -- saying their orders
to use military tanks to crash into the compound weren't in the operations plan
approved by Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These two cowboys went out on their own because they were frustrated and
angry at David Koresh and they decided they were going to punish him,''
Davidians lawyer Michael Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department did not return calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Comic Book Artist Kane Dies at 73  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Gil Kane, the comic book artist who spent more than half a
century sketching such memorable characters as the Atom, Green Lantern, the
Hulk, Captain Marvel and Spider-Man, has died. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane died Monday in Miami of cancer, said his Los Angeles representative,
Harris Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   A self-taught artist, Kane worked steadily from the age of 16 until he
recently became ill. He was known for his dynamic figures and innovative fight
scenes between superheroes.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans and collectors revered the work Kane did from 1956 to 1969. During that
period, he redesigned the costumes of Green Lantern and Captain Marvel and
helped make the old superheroes familiar to new generations of readers.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Eli Katz in Latvia on April 6, 1926, Kane came to New York with his
family when he was 3. He grew up reading comics and pulp novels, and later
served in the Army toward the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane worked extensively for DC Comics and Marvel but also freelanced for
other producers of the genre. He illustrated a variety of DC's lines from
mysteries and westerns to Rex the Wonder Dog and science fiction.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't became famous until the late 1950s when DC revived Green Lantern
and Kane took over its illustration. He soon added a revival of the Atom as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Moving to Marvel, Kane drew the Hulk, Conan the Barbarian, Captain Marvel,
Spider-Man, Captain America, the Avengers and others and became a model for new
comic artists who studied his style. He liked to ink his own work, instead of
leaving the details to assistants.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, Kane spent about five years in Los Angeles, working on
animation concepts for Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears. But he soon returned to
comics, illustrating the ``Ring'' for writer Roy Thomas in 1990 and drawing new
versions of Superman.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane is survived by his wife, Elaine; son, Scott; and two stepchildren, Eric
and Beverly.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tanker Searched for Iraq Oil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Navy ship patrolling the Persian Gulf detained a
Russian tanker Wednesday and was taking oil samples to determine whether it was
carrying Iraqi oil in violation of the U.N. trade embargo, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The USS Monterey stopped the Russian vessel off the coast of the United Arab
Emirates and the captain was cooperating, Defense Department spokesman P.J.
Crowley said. The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through the Straits of
Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowley did not say if the Pentagon knew where the Russian ship had picked
up the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   A second Pentagon spokesman, Jim Kout, said stopping a Russian ship was
``not new but it is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the oil is found to have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would
request permission from an Emirates port to haul the ship to a nearby port and
dispose of the contraband, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since sanctions were
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the U.N. Security Council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military said in October that American sailors had diverted at
least five ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems
searching for contraband over the past month. The United States and Britain are
the main enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''

<HEADLINE> Families Mourn Crash Victims  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Miguel Morales clutched a well-worn Bible and
prayed. School children tossed flowers off the pier.
</P>
<P>
	   Disaster visited this Southern California beach town this week, tying it to
the friends and relatives of the 88 people killed when Alaska Airlines Flight
261 plunged several miles offshore into the Pacific on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beaches became a mecca for mourners unsure how to express grief for the
victims. Many walked quietly to the sand, looking to the sea and kneeling for a
moment of prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very sad,'' Morales said as he gathered with fellow Victory Outreach
parishioners Wednesday alongside Hueneme Pier, where a floral tribute featured
the sign ``Remembering those lost ... pray for their families.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``God's with them,'' Morales said. ``We're going to lift them up with our
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teachers Cynthia Mehle and Terri Foulks and 45 of their seventh- and
eighth-grade students from Hueneme Christian School, all in uniform, walked two
blocks from their school to the ocean and dropped flowers from the pier.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash brought back old feelings for one 13-year-old who lost his mother
when he was 4. ``He said he knew how it felt to have a parent yanked away from
you suddenly. He knew the grief the families were feeling,'' Mehle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each student was given two names from the victim list. As they dropped their
flowers into the sea, they prayed for those two people and their families.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruth Hirsh, 75, sat on a beach bench with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that pilot was a hero. He could have taken us out. I think the
pilot deliberately put it in the ocean so he wouldn't hit us,'' Hirsh said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Union Said To Delay Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Engineers and technical workers at The Boeing Co. agreed
Wednesday to return to contract talks next week -- postponing a threatened
strike -- after the federal government's top negotiator offered to sit at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
had threatened to strike Thursday. Union officials on Wednesday were counting
mail ballots on a pair of new, three-year contract offers but both were expected
to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said workers were being asked not to stage a wildcat
walkout, but that their members were so angry over the contract talks, some
might walk out anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA Executive Director Charles Bofferding said talks with the company
would resume Monday and Tuesday with Richard Barnes, head of the federal
Mediation and Conciliation Services agency, sitting at the table.
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said Barnes's offer to join the talks was highly unusual and that
he should be given a chance to help resolve the contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very hard decision to make," Bofferding said of calling off
immediate strike plans and opting for more talks. "We think it would be a shame
to not give the strength and power they (workers) have exerted already a chance
to succeed and give them the contract they deserve."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company agreed to resume talks to
"honor the request" of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we hope the meeting on Monday is constructive ... our participation
in the meeting should not imply to anyone that Boeing intends to make additional
proposals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike preparations have been under way for more than two weeks, and SPEEA
headquarters has at least 500 "On Strike" signs ready for picketers, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not stopping this strike forever," SPEEA President Craig Buckham
said. "We're simply giving this new turn of events a chance to succeed. We hope
it will, but we're not throwing away the signs."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's previous offers for the engineering segment and the technical
workers were rejected by 99 percent and 98 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting on the latest offers began by mail two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The union represents 22,352 Boeing engineers and technicians, though only
about 13,780 of those workers actually are union members.
</P>
<P>
	   In its latest offers, Boeing backed off proposals for mandatory weekend
shifts for some workers. However, the company's offer reduced life insurance
benefits and altered health benefits -- a sticking point with many SPEEA
members.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Boeing offers, professional workers would make a minimum of
$35,000 per year, with a maximum of more than $105,000. Technical workers would
have a minimum off $20,500 with a maximum of $88,200.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing made its first contract offers Nov. 11. The SPEEA negotiating team
recommended they be voted down and they were rejected Dec. 1, the day the old
contract expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks resumed Dec. 8 and Boeing made its latest offer Jan. 13. The SPEEA
team has recommended approval, but union officials acknowledged it is unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Ad Restrictions Blocked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- The tobacco industry, battling state regulations on tobacco
advertising near schools, won a minor victory Wednesday when a federal appeals
court blocked implementation of the new rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the regulations pending a
ruling on the tobacco industry's appeal, said Henry Dinger, the Boston attorney
representing Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, U.S. District Judge William G. Young upheld the regulations that
prohibit outward-facing ads inside stores for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and
cigars within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   But the tobacco industry has appealed, claiming that the ban, which was to
go into effect on Tuesday, violates their free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Dinger said the appeals court decision suggests "the appeal has sufficient
merit to maintain the status quo while the court resolves the issues."
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Shea, chief of the Massachusetts attorney general's public
protection bureau, said he was optimistic that the appeals court eventually
would rule in the state's favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a ruling on the merits at all," he said. "We're confident the
1st Circuit will agree with the district court and agree with these
regulations."

<HEADLINE> 2 Die As Bus Carrying Serbs Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVKSA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.N. bus carrying 49 Serb civilians
was hit by a rocket Wednesday in Kosovo, U.N. officials said. Two people died
and three were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The white bus bore markings of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. It
was struck on a hilly road near the village of Cubreljas, about 10 miles from
the city of Kosovska Mitrovica, said Olivier Saint Leger, a press officer for
Kosovo's multinational peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, snow near the bus was stained with blood. Shattered glass lay on
the side of the road, while the vehicle, with twisted metal protruding from its
right side, was parked a few yards further on.
</P>
<P>
	   The dead were an elderly man and an elderly woman, Saint Leger said. The
injured were taken to a military hospital in Kosovska Mitrovica, where one was
reported in very serious condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot overemphasize how shocked and deeply disturbed I am by the
terrorist incident that happened today,'' said peacekeeper commander Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt. ``The deplorable attack ... was a deliberate attempt to kill and maim
defenseless Serbian men, women and children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reinhardt said the peacekeeping force ``will conduct a full and thorough
investigation with the aim of bringing the terrorists to justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bus was taking Serbs from Kosovska Mitrovica to the nearby village of
Banja. Two French armored vehicles from the Kosovo multinational force were
acting as escorts, but the bus was driving through dense fog at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The rocket or rockets were apparently fired from a gully by the side of the
road.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack comes as ethnic tensions remain high in Kosovo. Authorities say
many ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists here. After NATO
bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last spring, ethnic Albanians began
attacking Serbs as revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   No information was released about possible suspects. But a senior State
Department official traveling with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her
flight home from Croatia said the attack appeared to be ``an ethnically
motivated crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright issued a statement saying: ``This reprehensible act only serves to
prolong the cycle of violence that has plagued Kosovo. We call on the leadership
of the Kosovar Albanian community to join us in condemning this attack.''

<HEADLINE> Earlier Alaska Air Problems Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators said Wednesday they are looking
into a report that the Alaska Airlines jetliner that plunged into the Pacific
Ocean had problems with the aircraft's tail controls in a flight hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline reiterated its statement that it knew of no previous problems
with the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also began analyzing recordings of the pilots' conversations
with a Seattle maintenance crew made while the pilots tried to control the plane
in the terrifying moments before it nose dived into the sea Monday, killing all
88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed after a pilot reported problems with the horizontal
stabilizer, a wing-like structure on the tail that keeps the plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   The first of three remote-operated underwater vehicles was set to dive
Wednesday night to 700 feet beneath the Pacific in search of Flight 261's
``black box'' voice and flight data recorders.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier dozens of ships were ordered to abandon the search for survivors and
shift their focus to recovering flight recorders and wreckage that could explain
why the plane went down about 10 miles off the Southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The search was officially called off over the protest of some family members
who held out hope that some of the plane's passengers and crew might still be
alive in the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   On shore, investigators interviewed airline employees about the report that
a different crew of pilots complained of problems with the aircraft's horizontal
stabilizer as they headed toward Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The jetliner crashed hours later on the return trip to San Francisco and
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that the crew had reported problems
with the stabilizer on the southbound leg of the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know if it's true, we are investigating that,'' John
Hammerschmidt, a member of the NTSB, said of the report.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about the report, airline spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle again
said there had been no previous problem with the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand by what we said earlier this week which is that we're not aware
of any maintenance anomalies with this aircraft,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots who reported the problem will be interviewed, an anonymous source
familiar with the investigation told the Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to land in Phoenix 20 minutes after takeoff Wednesday, said Phil Frame, a
spokesman for the NTSB in Washington. The plane, which had been headed toward
Dallas, is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines incident and the crash
investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators interviewed pilots who were flying in the area of the crash
and may have seen Flight 261 go down.
</P>
<P>
	   The audio tapes of the pilots and the Seattle maintenance crew apparently
capture an exchange that took place as the pilots tried to troubleshoot what was
going wrong, Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said on morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time. It's going to be very important to
this investigation,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape was handed over Tuesday to federal investigators by Alaska Airlines
in Washington, D.C., Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 family members had arrived at an assistance center in the
Renaissance Hotel in Los Angeles by Tuesday night and another 50 were expected
to show up Wednesday, said Chris Thomas, an American Red Cross volunteer.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those who had arrived at the hotel remained in a state of shock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will be able to deal with the emotional responses; they'll be able to
see the search-and-rescue recovery process,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, several ships used for salvage arrived
at Port Hueneme, including Navy vessels equipped with advanced side-scan sonar
that can be used to map debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The gear will be used to locate the wreckage of the airplane and the flight
recorders. Searchers on Tuesday said they had detected pinging from one or both
of the devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down. Divers cannot operate below about 300
feet, so the search will be carried out by three unmanned vehicles. One, the
Scorpio, was at the crash site aboard the ship Kellie Chouest, and was scheduled
to dive Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   If one of the plane's two recorders -- the flight data recorder -- was
programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it might reveal the condition of the
stabilizer when the jet went down. If not, officials would have to deduce what
happened by studying how other systems performed before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Man Tied to Terrorist Case Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Moroccan man who was being held as a material witness --
reportedly in an alleged terrorist conspiracy case -- was released Wednesday,
the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Youssef Karroum, 35, of Surrey, British Columbia, was detained last week
after attempting to cross from Canada into the United States at Blaine, a border
crossing about 100 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Magistrate Judge David E. Wilson had ordered Karroum held without bail
as a material witness. All records connected to his arrest, detention and
release are under seal, and no further details will be released, said Harold
Malkin, spokesman for U.S. Attorney Kate Pflaumer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times, citing an unidentified Justice Department source,
reported that Karroum's arrest was related to the case of Ahmed Ressam, the
Algerian arrested Dec. 14 in Port Angeles and charged with trying to smuggle a
trunkful of explosives into Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum's attorney, Gene Grantham, said his client was not a suspect in the
explosives case.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 20, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment charging
Ressam with conspiring ``to destroy or damage structures, conveyances or other
real or personal property within the United States.'' Ressam has pleaded
innocent.

<HEADLINE> Primaries Lure Record Numbers  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID TIRRELL-WYSOCKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Good weather and hard-fought races produced a record
number of votes for New Hampshire's presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers shocked Secretary of State William Gardner, even though he had
predicted a record turnout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Holy mackerel,'' he said as the total printed out on his adding machine.
He punched in the numbers again to make sure, and they were the same.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Republican primary, 238,606 votes were cast for president; Gardner
had predicted 191,000. In the Democratic primary, 154,639 votes were cast;
Gardner had anticipated 60,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said it would be a record, but this is a record record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner predicted 351,000 of the state's 738,000 registered voters would
cast ballots. His tally Wednesday was 393,245, surpassing by 10 percent the
previous record of 348,303 set in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., defeated Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, 49 percent to 30 percent. They were followed by Steve Forbes at
13 percent, Alan Keyes with 6 percent and Gary Bauer at 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Dole, who dropped out of the race before any ballots were cast,
attracted 231 write-in votes on the GOP ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Vice President Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley, 50
percent to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Interestingly, 3,320 Democrats wrote in McCain and 998 wrote in Forbes.
Another 827 picked Bush on the Democratic ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republicans, 1,025 wrote in Bradley and 1,155 wrote in Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner could not estimate a percentage of turnout because some people vote
only for vice president and others take a ballot and don't vote at all, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire lets undeclared voters cast ballots in either party primary.
Gardner expected 81,000 independents to vote Tuesday, but there was no
indication of how many voted, or in which primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before the primary, the state had 198,000 registered Democrats,
266,000 Republicans and 275,000 independents.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Vote for Fringe Candidates  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID TIRRELL-WYSOCKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Hundreds of New Hampshire voters turned away from
McCain, Bush, Bradley and Gore to vote for Buckley, Peters, Harder and Capalbo
in Tuesday's presidential primaries -- some of the 22 lesser-known candidates on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   The winner among the fringe candidates was Democrat Charles Buckley of
Whitefield, N.H., who finished third, behind Al Gore and Bill Bradley, with 322
votes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the risk of sounding obnoxious and self-righteous, I am more qualified
than Gore and Bradley,'' Buckley, 58, said before the vote. ``I'm a former clerk
of court, former probation officer, former teacher, former bank examiner, a
trial lawyer for 30 years, a Navy veteran.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among Buckley's ideas was easing the shortage of affordable housing in the
East by irrigating vast tracts of land in the West and building more houses
there.
</P>
<P>
	   Heather Anne Harder, a lecturer, university professor and businesswoman from
Crown Point, Ind., was second among the lesser-known Democrats with 192 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   She is continuing her campaign to give power back to states and individuals
by simplifying laws and holding national referendums to let Americans speak
directly on key issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a life commitment for me -- not a whim, a quick fix or 15 minutes
of fame,'' she said Wednesday, as she prepared to move her operation from snowy
New Hampshire to sunny Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Harder attracted 369 votes in 1996 and suggested fewer people voted for the
lesser-known candidates this time ``because of the tight race between the big
boys.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the last primary, with an uncontested Democratic race, the lesser-known
candidates attracted nearly 4,000 votes. The total this year was just less than
1,100.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Peters, of Jackson, N.H., won 156 Democratic votes as part of his
plan to attract enough attention to become a coalition candidate for We the
People, representing nonvoters, independents and disillusioned Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   On the GOP ballot, Dorian Yeager of Rye, N.H., picked up 98 Republican votes
to make her first among the lesser-known GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The ballot also included:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Democrat Mark Greenstein of Culver City, Calif., who got 75 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Democrat Jim Taylor of St. Paul, Minn., who got 87 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Republican Kenneth Capalbo, of Wakefield, R.I., with 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Republican Thomas Oyler of Wichita, Kan., with 14 votes.

<HEADLINE> Earlier Alaska Air Problems Reported  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Investigators said Wednesday they are looking
into a report that the Alaska Airlines jetliner that plunged into the Pacific
Ocean had problems with the aircraft's tail controls in a flight hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline reiterated its statement that it knew of no previous problems
with the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also began analyzing recordings of the pilots' conversations
with a Seattle maintenance crew made while the pilots tried to control the plane
in the terrifying moments before it nose dived into the sea Monday, killing all
88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed after a pilot reported problems with the horizontal
stabilizer, a wing-like structure on the tail that keeps the plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   The first of three remote-operated underwater vehicles was set to dive
Wednesday night to 700 feet beneath the Pacific in search of Flight 261's
``black box'' voice and flight data recorders.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier dozens of ships were ordered to abandon the search for survivors and
shift their focus to recovering flight recorders and wreckage that could explain
why the plane went down about 10 miles off the Southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The search was officially called off over the protest of some family members
who held out hope that some of the plane's passengers and crew might still be
alive in the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   On shore, investigators interviewed airline employees about the report that
a different crew of pilots complained of problems with the aircraft's horizontal
stabilizer as they headed toward Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The jetliner crashed hours later on the return trip to San Francisco and
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that the crew had reported problems
with the stabilizer on the southbound leg of the flight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know if it's true, we are investigating that,'' John
Hammerschmidt, a member of the NTSB, said of the report.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about the report, airline spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle again
said there had been no previous problem with the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand by what we said earlier this week which is that we're not aware
of any maintenance anomalies with this aircraft,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots who reported the problem will be interviewed, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to land in Phoenix 20 minutes after takeoff Wednesday, said Phil Frame, a
spokesman for the NTSB in Washington. The plane, which had been headed toward
Dallas, is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines incident and the crash
investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators interviewed pilots who were flying in the area of the crash
and may have seen Flight 261 go down.
</P>
<P>
	   The audio tapes of the pilots and the Seattle maintenance crew apparently
capture an exchange that took place as the pilots tried to troubleshoot what was
going wrong, Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said on morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time. It's going to be very important to
this investigation,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape was handed over Tuesday to federal investigators by Alaska Airlines
in Washington, D.C., Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 family members had arrived at an assistance center in the
Renaissance Hotel in Los Angeles by Tuesday night and another 50 were expected
to show up Wednesday, said Chris Thomas, an American Red Cross volunteer.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those who had arrived at the hotel remained in a state of shock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will be able to deal with the emotional responses; they'll be able to
see the search-and-rescue recovery process,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, several ships used for salvage arrived
at Port Hueneme, including Navy vessels equipped with advanced side-scan sonar
that can be used to map debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The gear will be used to locate the wreckage of the airplane and the flight
recorders. Searchers on Tuesday said they had detected pinging from one or both
of the devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down. Divers cannot operate below about 300
feet, so the search will be carried out by three unmanned vehicles. One, the
Scorpio, was at the crash site aboard the ship Kellie Chouest, and was scheduled
to dive Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   If one of the plane's two recorders -- the flight data recorder -- was
programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it might reveal the condition of the
stabilizer when the jet went down. If not, officials would have to deduce what
happened by studying how other systems performed before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Survey Details Airline Delays  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America West airlines had the worst on-time arrival
record and highest rate of customer complaints of any major U.S. carrier last
year, according to a Transportation Department survey.
</P>
<P>
	   The most punctual airline of 1999 was TWA, with close to 81 percent of its
flights delivering passengers on time, according to the Air Travel Consumer
Report issued Wednesday. The Transportation Department report does not specify
the reasons for flight delays, which might be caused by severe weather, air
traffic control decisions, passenger problems or equipment failures.
</P>
<P>
	   The report showed that more than 30 percent of Phoenix-based America West's
flights arrived late in 1999. The airline also had the most arrival delays in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Doing only slightly better than America West in terms of flight delays was
Alaska Airlines, with 29 percent of its flights coming late. U.S. Airways
rounded out the bottom three with close to 29 percent of its flights being
tardy.
</P>
<P>
	   America West also had the highest rate of passenger complaints, most of them
relating to cancellations, delays and poor customer service. The airline drew
nearly four consumer complaints for every 100,000 passenger boardings. That
compared with an average of roughly 2 1/2 complaints per 100,000 passengers for
all 10 major airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said she couldn't comment until
reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the number of passenger complaints to the 10 major airlines more
than doubled last year, ballooning to 13,709 complaints in 1999 from only 5,808
in 1998. This increase occurred at a time when passenger boardings increased by
about 16 million between 1998 and 1999, a growth of about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, a passenger
advocacy group, said a record numbers of passengers has led to full planes and
strained airline resources.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The irritation level is just a lot higher,'' he said. ``We keep demanding
of the airlines that they provide low fares and one of the ways they do that is
by tightening up the seat rows, by reducing the amount of food, by reducing the
number of flight attendants. Then we complain about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the Transportation Department's inspector general began
accepting complaints from consumers concerned about airline overbooking and
ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerning reports of mishandled bags, United Airlines had the worst record,
with 543,491 complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwest Airlines had the lowest rate of complaints overall last year, with
only 0.4 for every 100,000 passenger boardings. The airline also had the lowest
percentage of reports concerning bags that were damaged, lost or delayed. In
1998, Southwest had been the on-time winner but slipped to No. 2 with an 80
percent on-time record last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest came in third with almost 80 percent on-time arrivals, a big
improvement for the airline, which had ranked No. 9 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Converge on S.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush said with a smile Wednesday that it
``feels a lot warmer here'' as he laid out a conservative message tailor-made
for South Carolina. GOP rival John McCain said he'd gotten ``a mandate'' in the
snows of New Hampshire and hoped for another here.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, bruised by his trouncing a day earlier by McCain in New Hampshire,
retooled his stump speech to focus on morality and the military as he addressed
a student audience at a Christian college.
</P>
<P>
	   To make his point clear, he opened by using the word ``conservative'' six
times in a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also picked up the support of former Vice President Dan Quayle, who
said at a news conference with the Texas governor, ``We know that we have
prosperity today, but let us be very clear that prosperity without values is no
prosperity at all. Governor Bush has the values to be president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   To Bush, South Carolina represents his political ``firewall,'' a place where
he hopes to stop McCain's challenge. The Arizona senator skipped the Iowa
caucuses and focused for months on New Hampshire. He has spent most of the rest
of his time campaigning here.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, who finished second to Bush in the Iowa caucuses and third in
New Hampshire, is also appealing to conservatives with a strong anti-abortion
and tax-overhaul message in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes, who came in fourth in New Hampshire, also was campaigning in
South Carolina. Gary Bauer, who lagged badly on Tuesday, spent the day the
assessing whether he would stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, said, ``I look forward to publicly defending my
conservative philosophy, and I look forward to making it clear to the people of
this state and other states that our conservative philosophy will lead to
compassionate results.'' He addressed a crowd of more than 5,000 -- his largest
audience as a presidential candidate -- in the cavernous auditorium at Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The school lost its tax-exempt status in the 1970s for refusing to admit
blacks. It now does accept black students but still bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the same city, McCain was still reveling in his triumph in the New
Hampshire primary, where he beat Bush 49 percent to 30 percent. The senator, a
former Vietnam prisoner of war, hopes to win support among South Carolina's
large military population in the Feb. 19 GOP primary here.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina voters are older, less well-to-do, more conservative and more
likely to identify with the religious right than voters at large. One potential
area for McCain to exploit: In 1996, voters here said their top quality for a
presidential candidate was standing up for his beliefs, a quality that New
Hampshire voters hands-down identified with McCain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got a mandate last night and I'm going to get a mandate, I hope, in
about 18 days,'' McCain said at a news conference. ``If there's anything
different here, it's that there's more concern about the military.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a speech to students and supporters at Presbyterian College in
Clinton, McCain focused on his signature issue: campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our victory last night gave me the megaphone,'' McCain told a packed
gymnasium. ``Gave me the opportunity to talk to millions and millions of
Americans. Talk to them about how badly we need to reform, how badly we need to
give the government back to the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In another speech to the college crowd at the University of South Carolina
in Columbia, McCain portrayed him self as anti-establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of the establishment is against me and I'm proud of it,'' he said to
thunderous applause. ``If you want business as usual, you don't want me as
president.''
</P>
<P>
	   One negative for McCain in South Carolina: his sponsorship in 1998 of a
Senate bill that would have raised cigarette taxes sharply and given the federal
government new power to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
	   This state has a tradition of rejecting the verdict of New Hampshire voters,
giving Bob Dole a win in 1996 after he narrowly lost to Pat Buchanan up north.
In 1992, it voted for Bush's father, former President Bush, after Buchanan
nearly beat him in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   A series of polls last month had Bush leading McCain by as many as 22
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As I said last night, there's bumps in the road'' to the presidency, Bush
said at his news conference. ``There's not going to be a bump in the road here
in South Carolina. There's going to be a long, smooth highway.''
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said he planned to portray McCain as a liberal in the staunchly
conservative South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He came at me from the left on the education plan and he came at me on the
left on the tax plan -- and it worked,'' Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Time and again, the governor said his challenge in the South would be to
``solidify our base,'' and he set out to accomplish that by making a beeline for
Bob Jones University as soon as his plane touched down.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's appearance opened with a hymn and the Pledge of Allegiance. The
student body, whose attendance was compulsory, gave standing ovations to Bush
and to former Gov. David Beasley, who focused on Bush's anti-abortion efforts in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor told the students it was important for the government to
restore standards and discipline to American schools. He also pledged to rebuild
the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From the current administration, it seems like they think a strong defense
is something they expect from their lawyers,'' Bush said. He said he would
``restore honor and dignity to the White House,'' a comment that earned him his
largest round of applause.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Warns of New Arms Race  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Calling efforts toward global disarmament deplorable,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Wednesday that ``a dangerous new arms
race looms on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are even to dream of a world free of nuclear weapons by the end of
the 21st century, we should start taking new and effective measures of nuclear
disarmament and nonproliferation right now,'' he said in a speech to the U.N.
Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan urged the world's main disarmament forum -- the Geneva-based
Conference on Disarmament -- to show ``far greater urgency and flexibility in
its search for a compromise on its program of work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 66-nation conference held an eight-month session which ended in
December. But it was so divided over calls for nuclear disarmament that it was
unable even to agree on an agenda for negotiations during the session.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, the conference has negotiated bans on chemical weapons and
nuclear test explosions. But it has now been deadlocked for more than two years
between countries that demand a sweeping approach to nuclear disarmament and
nuclear powers that insist on sticking to a step-by-step process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``More countries have nuclear-weapon capability than ever before,'' the
secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited ``a discouraging list'' of nuclear disarmament measures that are
stalled and initiatives that haven't gotten off the ground. Among them:
</P>
<P>
	   --The START II accord, signed in 1993 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in
1996, was intended to halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500
warheads each. But Russia's parliament has balked at ratifying the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   --Passage of START II would clear the way for a proposed START III treaty,
which could reduce the sides' nuclear arsenals to as few as 2,000 warheads each.
But Moscow won't consider further cuts unless the United States backs down on
its plans to amend the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to build defenses against
possible limited missile attacks. Russia views the plan as a threat to its own
security.
</P>
<P>
	   --The nuclear test ban treaty, championed by the United States, was rejected
by the U.S. Senate in October, and negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament
on a treaty banning the production of plutonium and highly enriched uranium used
to make nuclear weapons have not even begun, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan's comments come less than three months before a scheduled conference
to review the 186-nation Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The treaty, signed in
1970, commits nuclear countries to work for disarmament and non-nuclear
countries to refrain from developing their own arsenals.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Evolution Disclaimer Rejected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Oklahoma's attorney general ruled Wednesday that a
state committee had no authority to require that biology textbooks carry a
disclaimer saying evolution is a ``controversial theory.''
</P>
<P>
	   The disclaimer provoked criticism from education groups, scientists and even
some religious groups.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nine-page opinion, Attorney General Drew Edmondson said the State
Textbook Committee has a constitutional duty to prepare multiple textbook lists
but lacks authority to add statements or pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclaimer approved by the committee for all new biology books stated
that evolution is a ``controversial theory'' that can refer ``to the unproven
belief that random, undirected forces produced a world of living things.'' It
was unanimously adopted Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee member John Dickmann, who introduced the disclaimer, has said it
was added because biology texts do not devote enough space to alternate
explanations of how life began. He did not return a telephone call to his home
by The Associated Press Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclaimer was identical to one that was added last year to textbooks in
Alabama. Kansas' board of education also removed evolution from state-mandated
tests, resulting in an avalanche of state and national criticism.

   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- An unmanned vehicle recovered one of the ``black
box'' recorders Wednesday that could hold the answer to the cause of the Alaska
Airlines crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The remote controlled vehicle, operating in up to 700 feet of water, brought
up the cockpit voice recorder, said Terry Williams, spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar device that records flight data was not immediately recovered, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers had a fix on the data recorder using pinging signals emitted by
its locator beacon, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The recorder -- actually painted bright orange despite its popular name --
was brought to the surface clutched in the mechanical claw of the boxy yellow
submersible.

<HEADLINE> McCain: More Than POW in Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By EUN-KYUNG KIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- He has a millionaire wife and a penchant for telling
jokes, some of them off-color. He has admitted to adultery and relishes tales
about his rebellious days as a Navy cadet. And he was labeled a carpetbagger
long before being tagged as a maverick politician who tells it like it is.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Sydney McCain, the landslide victor of New Hampshire's GOP
presidential primary, is more than the POW hero portrayed in his television
campaign commercials, videotapes and a recent book he wrote about himself and
his namesakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to his rapport with reporters, particularly those traveling with him
on his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus, elements of the Arizona senator's
blunt, loose-talking personality and his bawdy sense of humor are claiming more
attention as well. And with it, closer scrutiny on his open-book life.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has long been a darling of the national media because of his
willingness to buck the party line on such issues as overhauling federal
campaign finance laws and pressing for passage of anti-tobacco legislation. His
penchant for rankling the party leadership led to the maverick reputation that
McCain wears as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I get in trouble all the time. I will continue to get in trouble,'' McCain
said early in the campaign. ``I say what's on my mind to the frustration of my
campaign people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other components of McCain's bad-boy image come from his days at the U.S.
Naval Academy, where he piled up demerits and led a group of troublemaker
midshipmen who dubbed themselves, ``the Bad Bunch.'' McCain, the son and
grandson of Navy admirals, ended up graduating fifth from the bottom, a fact he
discloses, smugly, during interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   But he redeemed his dismal military beginnings through 5 1/2 years spent in
a Vietnam prisoner-of-war camp, where he endured long periods of solitary
confinement and regular beatings for displaying what his captors said was ``a
bad attitude.''
</P>
<P>
	   He has been married for nearly two decades to Cindy Hensley, the millionaire
daughter of an Arizona beer distributor. Together, they have four children, the
oldest one a 15-year-old daughter whom McCain escorted to last year's MTV Video
Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has three grown children from his first wife, Carol, whom he divorced
shortly before remarrying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me say that I am responsible for the breakup of my first marriage,''
said McCain, who has made no secret of his post-Vietnam womanizing.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's first election was in 1982, when he won a seat in the House of
Representatives. The former military brat had dismissed opponents who labeled
him a carpetbagger by telling them, ``the place I lived longest in my life was
Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
	   But being a media darling hasn't prevented McCain from receiving his share
of bad publicity. His most notable notoriety came during the ``the Keating
Five'' scandal, when he and four other senators were accused of improperly
intervening with federal banking regulators to help Charles Keating, a wealthy
developer who owned a failing savings and loan -- and occasionally loaned his
Caribbean vacation home to the senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain eventually was cleared of any impropriety -- other than for ``showing
poor judgment'' -- but has said the episode ``will probably be on my
tombstone.''
</P>
<P>
	   He has a simple damage control strategy: reveal everything.
</P>
<P>
	   After coming under fire recently for letters pressing federal regulators to
act in cases involving campaign donors, McCain's campaign staff made public
hundreds of letters to various agencies over the last several years. He is
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and argued that it was the everyday
business of Congress to prod the government to act. ``I was doing my job ...,''
McCain said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has been criticized for an explosive temper that supposedly has
led him to tell off Senate colleagues and storm out of hearing rooms. And then
there are the off-color jokes that often land him in water as hot as his temper.
</P>
<P>
	   He has told reporters about referring to the ``Leisure World'' senior
citizens home as ``Seizure World,'' and quipped that ``the nice thing about
Alzheimer's (disease) is you get to hide your own Easter eggs.'' And a joke, at
a GOP fund-raiser, about Chelsea Clinton had him apologizing to President
Clinton days afterward. McCain later said he deeply regretted the ``insensitive
and stupid and cruel'' attempt at humor.

<HEADLINE> Capt. Claims Innocence in Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The captain of an oil tanker that split in two off France's
western coast last month told reporters Wednesday that he is not to blame for
the spill that is still soiling beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   Karun Mathur, an Indian citizen, is under formal investigation for maritime
pollution and placing others in danger in the Dec. 12 spill. He is forbidden
from leaving France.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not guilty of the sinking and I congratulate myself for saving my
crew,'' Mathur said Wednesday in his first meeting with reporters since the
spill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As far as I knew the boat was safe,'' he said. ``But it's not my duty to
check.''
</P>
<P>
	   The aging Maltese-registered tanker Mathur was piloting, the ``Erika,''
spilled 3 million gallons of thick, gummy fuel into the Atlantic Ocean. The
spill has soiled hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and polluted oyster beds.
</P>
<P>
	   The 24-year-old vessel was transporting oil for Franco-Belgian oil giant
TotalFina from the Netherlands to Italy. The two halves of the vessel, still
underwater, contain about 6 million gallons of heavy oil, and more of it has
been seeping out.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary government report said the tanker's structure was probably at
fault. The report also criticized the tanker's owner and an Italian company
responsible for the ship's safety checkups.

<HEADLINE> Tuvalu Recommended for U.N. Seat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A Security Council committee has recommended U.N.
membership for Tuvalu, but the tiny Pacific island's diplomatic ties to Taiwan
could prove a stumbling block in its effort to become the world body's 189th
member.
</P>
<P>
	   The council's committee on admissions backed Tuvalu in a report circulated
Monday. However, the report noted that China declined to join the recommendation
for reasons it did not reveal.
</P>
<P>
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has the option to veto
Tuvalu's application when it comes before the 15-member council for a vote on
Feb. 17. Last year, Beijing delayed consideration of U.N. membership for the
Pacific island nation of Nauru because of Nauru's diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. The Security Council eventually voted 14-0 to let Nauru join, with China
abstaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu is a country of 9,000 people inhabiting nine small coral atolls 620
miles north of Fiji. It has a total land area of 10 square miles. If the
Security Council approves Tuvalu's application, the U.N. General Assembly will
vote in September on whether to accept the country.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Judge Sentenced for Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A former judge was sentenced Wednesday to 18 months in
jail and fined $5,000 for bashing a state legislator in the head with a handgun.
</P>
<P>
	   Luther C. Edmonds did not speak during the nearly four-hour hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonds, 57, also was ordered to stay away from Del. William P. Robinson
Jr., be evaluated to see if he needs to take an anger management class and pay
court costs of $5,796.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit Judge Paul Peatross also tacked on a three-year prison sentence,
suspended that and said Edmonds will be under probation for three years when he
is released from jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonds, who spent seven years as a judge in General District Court and one
year in Circuit Court, was convicted in November of unlawful wounding and
unlawfully wearing a mask in the Dec. 29, 1997 attack on Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, a Democrat, was attacked by a masked man in the parking lot
outside his Norfolk law office. He needed 30 stitches.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonds and Robinson were friends but parted ways when Robinson disputed
Edmonds' statement that other judges conspired to force him to resign from the
bench in 1996 during a misconduct inquiry. Robinson said Edmonds resigned
because of an ethics violation.

<HEADLINE> Amway Corp. To Reorganize  </HEADLINE>
    By LISA SINGHANIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Citing a changing world economy and slow sales,
direct-selling giant Amway Corp. announced Wednesday it will restructure its
global business and cut jobs to become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
	   No details were immediately released about how many of the Ada-based
company's 12,000 employees worldwide might be affected by the restructuring,
which is expected to play out over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Bain, a spokesman for the privately-held company, said the changes are
designed to make Amway more competitive in a world where the Internet is
increasingly significant.
</P>
<P>
	   Amway, which sells soaps, cosmetics, vitamins and a range of other products
had estimated retail sales of $5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bain said cost savings are not a primary factor, although sales have slowed
in North America, as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. Amway recently
completed buybacks of shares of Amway Asia Pacific Ltd. and Amway Japan, Ltd.,
its only publicly held subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our cash position is solid, our debt is manageable, we're financially very
strong," Bain said. "Our sales are a bit behind what we hoped they would be, but
that's not the driving force here."
</P>
<P>
	   Bain said tentative plans call for Amway to reorganize into three divisions:
</P>
<P>
	   -- A direct-selling unit that concentrates on Amway's traditional business,
while overseeing Quixtar, Amway's Internet-retailing sister company launched
last fall;
</P>
<P>
	   -- A manufacturing and business unit;
</P>
<P>
	   -- An entrepreneurial division to come up with new ways to direct-market to
the public, possibly incorporating some of the Internet technologies used by
Quixtar.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the reorganization, Doug DeVos, who had been running Amway's
Asia-Pacific region, becomes responsible for Amway business worldwide as well as
Quixtar.
</P>
<P>
	   David Van Andel, who had been Amway's senior vice president for the North
America, Latin America and Europe, will head the unit charged with creating
entrepreneurial opportunities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Koop, who heads Amway's operations, will continue to be responsible for
Amway's worldwide distribution and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Van Andel and Dick DeVos will retain their jobs as chairman and
president, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Amway's free-lance work force, also known as independent business owners,
should not be affected, Bain said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Secret Service agents called it unprecedented: a vice
president (or president, for that matter) sitting on a commercial flight,
snoozing like any other New York-to-Washington commuter.
</P>
<P>
	   So it was Wednesday morning on the 9 a.m. shuttle -- US Airways flight 6355
out of LaGuardia -- when Al Gore decided to make a mad dash for Washington and
Air Force Two wasn't ready to go. Gore hurried to Capitol Hill for a
tie-breaking Senate vote that ultimately wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight attendants looked surprised -- routine-weary commuters mostly didn't
notice -- as Gore boarded with his armed Secret Service agents and a military
aide carrying nuclear codes. ``Has anyone ever carried the Football on a
commercial flight?'' one aide wondered, speaking of the locked code box.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore tipped his head against the window to sleep, ignoring the bagel snack
that a flight attendant dropped on his tray. He also seemed blissfully unaware
of the interview with Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush being
broadcast on the cabin's small overhead TVs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore did wake up in time to bring his seat back and tray table into the
full, upright and locked position.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BY THE NUMBERS:
</P>
<P>
	   19 -- percentage points separating winner John McCain (49 percent) from Bush
(30 percent) in Tuesday's New Hampshire Republican primary
</P>
<P>
	   4 -- percentage points separating winner Gore (50 percent) from Bill Bradley
(46 percent) in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   VOTER'S VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's good and bad when you have two strong personalities. It sort
of tears the party apart, but they're both good candidates. I believe our
presidential candidate ought to be a Washington insider because he would know
the ins and outs.'' -- Steve Auerbach, Democrat, at the Stage Deli in New York
City. He was torn between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   Attacks against publisher Steve Forbes piled up from his GOP presidential
rivals. Lamar Alexander said Forbes couldn't win a mayoral race without his
family's money. ``If his name was Forbes Malcolm, he wouldn't be a serious
candidate for mayor of a city in New Jersey,'' Alexander said in Manchester,
N.H. Phil Gramm cited an editorial Forbes wrote in 1973 in which he supported a
health care plan that called for nationalized insurance run by a federal health
security board.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign consultant Dick Morris leaked internal poll results to an
adviser to Republican Bob Dole, arguing it would be in Dole's interest to cut a
budget deal with the president. Clinton concluded Morris' intentions were
honorable, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   WEDNESDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   Gore greeted commuters at Grand Central Station in New York but interrupted
his campaign to go to Washington to cast a tie-breaking abortion vote that
became unnecessary. McCain said his win ``interfered with the coronation'' of
Bush. McCain, Bush and Alan Keyes campaigned in South Carolina. Gary Bauer, back
in Virginia, reassessed his candidacy after trailing the GOP field in New
Hampshire. Forbes, third in New Hampshire, spent the day at home in New Jersey
discussing strategy and preparing for a week of campaigning in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley held rallies in Connecticut and New York before flying to San
Francisco. He told supporters in Hartford, Conn., ``the warmups are over, the
national campaign has begun.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   THURSDAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaigns in San Francisco. Gore also is in California before flying

Carolina, with the governor breaking off for a Detroit event. Forbes is in

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Diallo Shot Without Warning  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Four white New York City policemen accused of killing
an unarmed black man unleashed a 41-shot barrage with no warning and kept firing
as the victim was down on the ground, prosecutors said Wednesday as the
officers' murder trial opened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They never called out commands like `Stop, police!' or `Don't move!'''
before gunning down Amadou Diallo in an apartment house vestibule in the Bronx,
prosecutor Eric Warner told a jury of four blacks and eight whites.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers -- Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss and Richard
Murphy -- ``acted recklessly and with depraved indifference to Amadou Diallo's
life,'' Warner said. ``For that, they are guilty of murder.''
</P>
<P>
	   The defense in the racially charged case disputed the prosecution's claim
that the shots came without warning.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense attorneys said the officers were forced to make a split-second
decision using rapid-fire weapons. And they portrayed Diallo's Soundview
neighborhood in the Bronx as one of the city's most dangerous sections.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from West Africa, was shot 19 times a
year ago by members of an elite street-crime unit looking for violent criminals.
The officers said they thought he was holding a gun; it turned out to be a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The officers identified themselves with their shields out, as they are
trained to. Mr. Diallo doesn't listen to their orders to stop, which they are
trained to give,'' defense attorney Bennett Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time Diallo turned around, ``he had taken them into the no-man's land
that is every police officer's nightmare,'' Epstein said. Carroll, after
realizing the mistake, tried to resuscitate Diallo, saying, ``Don't die, please
don't die,'' the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a case about five good men,'' Epstein said. ``One of them was Mr.
Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, face 25 years to life
in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off protests alleging widespread brutality against
minorities. The trial was moved 150 miles north to Albany after the judge ruled
that the officers couldn't get a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   In his opening statement, Warner detailed how the 19 bullets tore through
Diallo's vital organs. He alleged many were fired while Diallo was falling down
and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Stephen Worth asserted that the officers were only on trial
``because there was a furor created by people who have their own agendas'' -- an
allusion to activists who say the case exemplifies racism.
</P>
<P>
	   Detective Joseph Flannio, the only witness to testify Wednesday, described
finding the sidewalk, stoop and vestibule where Diallo was shot littered with 41
bullet shells and 27 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   One bullet had pierced the wall and was found inside Diallo's apartment,
Flannio said. He said four more bullets fell from Diallo's body it was removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Photos of the scene, including ones showing Diallo's body, were passed among
the jurors. None had visible reactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courtroom, the Rev. Al Sharpton accused Worth of trying to
manipulate white jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   The civil rights leader also complained that the defense gave the impression
that Soundview -- located in a precinct where violent crime has dropped more
than 22 percent in the past two years -- is ``the wild, wild West.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's insulting,'' he said. ``It shows why this should have been a Bronx
jury.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Conn. Crane Collapse  </HEADLINE>
   By DIANE SCARPONI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The steel skeleton of a power plant collapsed at a
construction site Wednesday, killing two workers and trapping a crane operator
for nearly eight hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Fitch, 62, was alive and talking inside the crane's cab, but the cab
was partially crushed beneath steel girders and buried in debris, said fire
Capt. Robin Tummins.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency crews handed blankets through an opening in the mound of twisted
metal beams, while workers using welding torches and hand saws cut away chunks
of steel pinning Fitch's chest and legs. He was removed shortly after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Bridgeport Hospital spokesman John Cappiello said Fitch had a dislocated
foot and was suffering from the cold weather, but otherwise appeared uninjured.
</P>
<P>
	   The steel frame of the power plant was about 45 feet high at the point of
the collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crane is a big one, and everything came down on top of it,'' Tummins
said. ``It's almost like pickup sticks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other cranes at the site and tow trucks were removing the rubble Wednesday
evening while crane inspectors from the state fire marshal's office surveyed the
site.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men killed in the collapse were identified as Kevin Winslow, 43, of
Newington and Wayne Most, 38, of West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   Another worker, George Scrivner, 36, was hospitalized with injuries that did
not appear life-threatening, said Bonnie Lukacs, spokeswoman for the Hospital of
St. Raphael in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   The power plant was being built for Houston-based El Paso Energy Corp. and
Power Development Co. of Auburn, Mass. The two-year construction project started
in March under the oversight of Black &AMP; Veatch, a consulting engineering firm
based in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman John Allen said an investigation is underway into the
cause of the collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the first priority had been to free the
trapped crane operator, then the investigation could proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really don't have an exact cause of what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Milford is on the Connecticut shoreline, about 60 miles northeast of New
York City.

<HEADLINE> FTC Rejects BP Amoco, Arco Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission moved Wednesday to block BP
Amoco's takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., setting the stage for the biggest
oil antitrust court fight since the breakup of Standard Oil nearly a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission voted 3-2 to direct its staff to seek an injunction that
would scuttle the $30 billion merger, concluding the new company would dominate
Alaska oil production and West Coast markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This particular merger is anticompetitive," Richard Parker, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition, said at a news conference after the vote. "We're
going after this merger and we're going to try to stop it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the proposed company was "a colossus" that could dictate prices to
West Coast refiners who rely on Alaska crude oil. Other critics of the merger
have argued that such dominance could translate into higher retail gasoline
prices in California and other West Coast states that rely heavily on Alaska
crude.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would create the second largest nongovernment oil company behind
Exxon Mobil, whose merger was completed in November hours after receiving FTC's
approval. BP Amoco itself was created only a little more than a year ago with
the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco pledged to "argue the case vigorously" in court. "We
believe we have a compelling case," the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield, or Arco as it is commonly
known, together account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil production.
They dominate oil activities in the state, from drilling to transporting crude
to market.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said the government would go to court in San Francisco, as early as
Friday, seeking an injunction that would prevent from completion of the merger
as planned by the two companies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco had said it would sell off 13 percent of the production as well as
part ownership in two Alaska oil fields. But Parker said the new company still
"would control overwhelming proportions of the (Alaska) production."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the proposed divestitures, the combined company would account for
55 percent of the oil flowing from Alaska's North Slope, the FTC estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco said claims the new company dramatically could affect West Coast
prices, which are pegged to world oil markets, were "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
	   While the company said it remained receptive to negotiations and "any
reasonable options," it acknowledged "the only course now open to us is to
resolve the issue through litigation."
</P>
<P>
	   If the request for an injunction is successful, the case likely would go
before an FTC administrative law judge, whose decision can be appealed in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The litigation could take months and eventually may end up before the
Supreme Court if BP Amoco persists in fighting the biggest antitrust challenge
to the oil industry since the Standard Oil breakup nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been other industry challenges and price fixing cases, said
Victor Goldberg, an antitrust scholar and law professor at Columbia University.
But, he said, "this would be the first one attacking the basic market structure
of the oil industry" since the Standard Oil case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court in 1911 ordered the breakup of the Standard Oil holding
company because of its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg and other antitrust scholars said the government may have a tough
time proving its case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil flows. They're going to have to find some sort of argument to show why
the international (market) is not going to solve the problem," said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco contends the merger would produce efficiencies that would lead to
$1 billion in savings worldwide, about a fifth of that in Alaska, and "drive
down Alaskan production costs" so its crude would be more competitive in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any suggestion that there is a special West Coast market for Alaskan crude
oil that functions independently of world crude prices is without foundation,"
the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wednesday's vote, FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky and commissioners Mozelle
Thompson and Sheila Anthony voted to block the merger. Commissioners Orson
Swindle and Thomas Leary voted against seeking an injunction.

<HEADLINE> Austria Govt. Decision Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Facing European sanctions and worldwide scorn,
Austria's president on Wednesday delayed approving a new government that
includes Joerg Haider's rightists until leaders of the coalition pledge to
respect democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage over the coalition between Haider's Freedom Party and the
center-right Austrian People's Party was debated in world capitals and spilled
into the streets of this stately, baroque city.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 10,000 people rallied Wednesday night in front of the People's
Party headquarters to protest the coalition deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prove yourself to be a patriot,'' theater producer Andre Heller told the
crowd in remarks directed to People's Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel. ``No
alliance with meanness. No alliance with right-wing radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the executive committee of Schuessel's party adopted the
coalition pact in a session that ended shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil's office said Haider and Schuessel would meet with
the chief of state Thursday to sign a ``declaration of values of European
democracy.'' The new government was expected to be approved shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil's declaration was designed to spare the country political and
diplomatic isolation within a European Union whose other members doubt Haider's
commitment to liberal democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview to be published Thursday, Klestil told the magazine News
that he fears Austria will suffer ``international damage'' if a government
including Haider's Freedom Party takes power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising Adolf
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has also spoken out against the EU's expansion
and has predicted the new government will impose a nearly complete ban on
immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has sought repeatedly to distance himself from previous statements.
He told reporters this week that the Freedom Party has no sympathy for the
Nazis, adding they were responsible for the ``greatest crimes of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assurances by Haider and Schuessel that their new government would respect
democratic values did little to quiet the furor that swept through Israel and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Haider ``dangerous'' to democracy
and recalled his ambassador from Vienna ``for an unlimited period,'' said
</P>
<P>
	   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said any coalition with Haider
would bring diplomatic isolation for Austria. Norway issued a similar warning
Wednesday. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel urged his countrymen to cancel
ski holidays in Austria in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   And in Poland, Haider opponents rallied in front of the Austrian Embassy in
Warsaw. Earlier in the day, the Austrian Consulate in the southern Polish city
of Krakow was pelted with eggs.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked how the Clinton administration viewed the situation, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said, ``We share their (Europeans') concerns. We'll be
watching, and we'll take appropriate steps.'' Albright spoke in Zagreb, Croatia,
where she had stopped on her way home from talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   With an agreement between Haider and Schuessel in place, attention has
shifted to President Klestil. Although his post is largely ceremonial, the
president must swear in a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither party leader has confirmed the makeup of the new Cabinet. The
Austria Press Agency, however, said the Cabinet would be split evenly between
the two parties, with Schuessel as chancellor and a Freedom Party member as vice
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Ministry would go to a member of the People's Party, the agency
said. The Interior Ministry is responsible for immigration policies and
overseeing the police -- high priorities for the Freedom Party, which wants to
restrict immigration and has a tough law and order image.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Flight Recorder Recovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- An unmanned vehicle recovered one of the ``black
box'' recorders Wednesday that could hold the answer to the cause of the Alaska
Airlines crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The remote controlled vehicle, operating in up to 700 feet of water, brought
up the cockpit voice recorder, said Terry Williams, spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   A similar device that records flight data was not immediately recovered, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers had a fix on the data recorder using pinging signals emitted by
its locator beacon, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The recorder -- actually painted bright orange despite its popular name --
was brought to the surface clutched in the mechanical claw of the boxy yellow
submersible.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Flight 261 plunged into the Pacific off Southern California on Monday
as the pilots struggled with mechanical problems. Killed were 88 crew and
passengers returning home to San Francisco and Seattle from vacations in Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said Wednesday they were looking into a report that the plane
had problems with a part of the tail called the horizontal stabilizer on the
flight to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Records of radio conversations between the pilots and air traffic
controllers showed the crew was struggling with stabilizer problems before the
plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also began analyzing recordings of the pilots' conversations
with a Seattle maintenance crew, which were made while the pilots tried to
control the plane in the terrifying moments before it nose dived into the sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, dozens of ships were ordered to abandon the search for survivors
and shift their focus to recovering flight recorders and wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors was called off over the protest of some family
members who held out hope that some of the plane's passengers and crew might
still be alive in the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   On shore, investigators interviewed airline employees about the report that
a different crew of pilots complained of problems with the aircraft's horizontal
stabilizer as they headed toward Puerto Vallarta on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer keeps the plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle denied the Seattle Times
report: ``We stand by what we said earlier this week, which is that we're not
aware of any maintenance anomalies with this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt confirmed that the agency was looking into
the newspaper report. Pilots from the earlier flight were to be interviewed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to land in Phoenix 20 minutes after takeoff Wednesday, said Phil Frame, a
spokesman for the NTSB in Washington. The plane, which had been headed toward
Dallas, is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines incident and the crash
investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators interviewed pilots who were flying in the area of the crash
and may have seen Flight 261 go down.
</P>
<P>
	   The audio tapes of the pilots and the Seattle maintenance crew apparently
capture an exchange that took place as the pilots tried to troubleshoot what was
going wrong, Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said on morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time. It's going to be very important to
this investigation,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape was handed over Tuesday to federal investigators by Alaska Airlines
in Washington, D.C., Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 family members had arrived at an assistance center in the
Renaissance Hotel in Los Angeles by Tuesday night and another 50 were expected
to show up Wednesday, said Chris Thomas, an American Red Cross volunteer.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those who had arrived at the hotel remained in a state of shock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will be able to deal with the emotional responses; they'll be able to
see the search-and-rescue recovery process,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, several ships used for salvage arrived
at Port Hueneme, including Navy vessels equipped with advanced side-scan sonar
that can be used to map debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down. Divers cannot operate below about 300
feet, so the search is being carried out by three unmanned vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   If one of the plane's two recorders -- the flight data recorder -- was
programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it might reveal the condition of the
stabilizer when the jet went down. If not, officials would have to deduce what
happened by studying how other systems performed before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Notified of Bombing Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Federal building bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols
appeared before an Oklahoma judge Wednesday for a formal reading of the 160
first-degree murder charges he faces in state court.
</P>
<P>
	   It was his first appearance since he was returned to the state on Monday
from a federal prison in Colorado. A date for a preliminary hearing, when
Nichols will enter a plea, has not been set.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols, 44, was convicted in federal court in Colorado and sentenced to
life in prison for conspiracy and eight counts of involuntary manslaughter in
the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy is attempting to get the death
penalty for the 160 charges of first-degree murder, representing the bombing
victims not included in the federal trial. Macy filed the murder charges last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Bombing co-conspirator Timothy McVeigh, also convicted of federal murder
charges, is already sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy formally denied bail for Nichols on Wednesday and set a Feb. 11
hearing to consider attorneys' requests for a gag order.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese share prices rose sharply in early trading Thursday,
with the planned launch of several large-scale investment trusts buoying market
sentiment. The dollar fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 273.38 points, or 1.40
percent, to hit 19,852.29 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, the
average closed up 155.53 points, or 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 108.12 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
down 0.38 yen from Wednesday and below its late New York level of 108.26 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, traders were upbeat about the Nikkei's outlook. The
launch of several large-scale investment trusts over the next few weeks was
expected to draw individual investors into the market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nomura Asset Management, a subsidiary of Japan's biggest brokerage house,
raised about $7.4 billion on Wednesday, the launch day for its "Big Project-N"
fund.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 11,003.20.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose 21.98 points, or 0.54
percent, to finish at 4073.96.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index was up 14.63 points, or 0.85 percent, at
1,726.49 points. On Wednesday, the index rose 14.71 points, or 0.87 percent, to
1,711.86.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency markets, traders sold the greenback to take profits after buying
up dollars on anticipation of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed announced Wednesday it had decided to raise key rates, prompting
investors to cash in on their dollar holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said the outlook for the U.S. currency remained strong. The
increase in interest rates makes the dollar more attractive to Japanese
investors because it leads to a higher yield on dollar-denominated assets, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 105.39 yen early Thursday, above its
level of 104.77 yen late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8400
from its close at 1.8350 Wednesday. Its price fell 0.05 point to 98.80.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Union Agree To Delay Strike  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Engineers and technical workers at The Boeing Co. agreed
Wednesday to return to contract talks next week -- postponing a threatened
strike -- after the federal government's top negotiator offered to sit at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
had threatened to strike Thursday. Union officials on Wednesday were counting
mail ballots on a pair of new, three-year contract offers but both were expected
to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said workers were being asked not to stage a wildcat
walkout, but that their members were so angry over the contract talks, some
might walk out anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA Executive Director Charles Bofferding said talks with the company
would resume Monday and Tuesday with Richard Barnes, head of the federal
Mediation and Conciliation Services agency, sitting at the table.
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding said Barnes's offer to join the talks was highly unusual and that
he should be given a chance to help resolve the contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very hard decision to make," Bofferding said of calling off
immediate strike plans and opting for more talks. "We think it would be a shame
to not give the strength and power they (workers) have exerted already a chance
to succeed and give them the contract they deserve."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company agreed to resume talks to
"honor the request" of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   "While we hope the meeting on Monday is constructive ... our participation
in the meeting should not imply to anyone that Boeing intends to make additional
proposals," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike preparations have been under way for more than two weeks, and SPEEA
headquarters has at least 500 "On Strike" signs ready for picketers, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not stopping this strike forever," SPEEA President Craig Buckham
said. "We're simply giving this new turn of events a chance to succeed. We hope
it will, but we're not throwing away the signs."
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing's previous offers for the engineering segment and the technical
workers were rejected by 99 percent and 98 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting on the latest offers began by mail two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The union represents 22,352 Boeing engineers and technicians, though only
about 13,780 of those workers actually are union members.
</P>
<P>
	   In its latest offers, Boeing backed off proposals for mandatory weekend
shifts for some workers. However, the company's offer reduced life insurance
benefits and altered health benefits -- a sticking point with many SPEEA
members.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Boeing offers, professional workers would make a minimum of
$35,000 per year, with a maximum of more than $105,000. Technical workers would
have a minimum of $20,500 with a maximum of $88,200.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing made its first contract offers Nov. 11. The SPEEA negotiating team
recommended they be voted down and they were rejected Dec. 1, the day the old
contract expired.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks resumed Dec. 8 and Boeing made its latest offer Jan. 13. The SPEEA
team has recommended approval, but union officials acknowledged it is unlikely.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If New Hampshire polling was like sports betting, most of
the players would have gotten the winner right but still lost on points.
</P>
<P>
	   Most pollsters picked Vice President Al Gore to win the Democratic primary
and Sen. John McCain to win the Republican contest. But almost nobody
anticipated that McCain would win by 19 percentage points, winning both the

about a four-point margin, close to the margin of several tracking polls just
before Tuesday's primary.

	   In 1996, some polls of the Republican race had Bob Dole ahead, and some had
Pat Buchanan ahead. Buchanan eventually won.
</P>
<P>
	   One pollster who came close to the right margins for both of Tuesday's races
was Robin Marra of Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., a relative newcomer
to the state's intensive polling scene.
</P>
<P>
	   When Marra got his last numbers that showed McCain leading by 11 points, he
shared them with his students and warned them they were out on a limb together.
``We'll all go down together,'' he told them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Or rise together,'' a cheerful Marra said Wednesday, while scanning his
results. He had seen McCain's momentum building through the final week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like a tsunami,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was leading Bush by 30 points among independents in several polls,
but few picked up that he also would win among Republicans. And some felt that
independent turnout would be in the low 20s, hurting McCain's chances.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicated that turnout for registered independents and those who
weren't registered to vote was well over 30 percent of the total. State election
officials don't expect to have final numbers for about a week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no poll that said McCain would win by 20 points,'' said
Secretary of State Bill Gardner. ``There's a big number of people who wait until
the end to make up their minds. They watched it play out before they made a
decision. That's pretty customary here.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's strong performance among Republicans surprised many pollsters, who
generally agreed he was 30 points ahead among independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This Republican electorate is a moderate-to-liberal Republican electorate
and a guy like McCain fits in with that,'' said Andy Smith, director of the
University of New Hampshire's survey research center. ``This was John McCain
territory -- an outsider willing to stand up to the party -- that really helped
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's stand on campaign finance reform helped, even though the issue was
not foremost on people's minds, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It made him look like a standup guy who's willing to take the heat and
stand up to his party,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keating Holland, whose CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, was one of the first to
show Bush losing ground rapidly, said he noticed McCain steadily improving his
performance among women voters in his tracking poll. McCain, who finished with
about half the total primary vote, got about equal support from men and women in
the primary. Bush had been doing better among women, both nationally and in New
Hampshire, prior to the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's 275,000 independents are the state's largest voting group
and they can decide on election day which party's primary they want to vote in.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollsters in New Hampshire will have to study their turnout models and
reconsider earlier estimates that independents don't turn out at the rate that
registered party members do, said Smith. ``Historical patterns just got thrown
out the window,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Pedophile Ex-priest Goes Free  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- A Roman Catholic priest convicted of widespread child
molestation left jail Wednesday after a judge ruled his detention on a later
charge violated the terms of an earlier plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert Gauthe, 59, first pleaded guilty in 1985 to 33 charges involving 11
boys, but he admitted that he had molested dozens of others. In exchange for his
guilty plea, prosecutors had given Gauthe immunity from any other charges
involving children molested before 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   He was released in 1995 after serving 10 years of a 20-year sentence. But
Gauthe was arrested two years later, charged with raping a 12-year-old girl in
1982.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, a judge ruled that Gauthe's 1997 arrest and detention pending
trial had violated his earlier plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The former priest didn't speak to reporters as he stepped into a relative's
car outside jail. He was headed toward Texas, escorted by sheriff's deputies as
security, said his attorney G. Paul Marx.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if his client planned to sue for false imprisonment, Marx
replied: ``My reading on him is he's real sorry for all the trouble he's caused
in this part of the state for so many years and would just as soon not come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gauthe is still on seven years probation for fondling a 3-year-old boy in
1996 -- the year after he was released from prison. Gauthe pleaded no contest to
the child injury charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Lafayette Parish District Attorney Mike Harson, who charged Gauthe in 1997,
said prosecutors who negotiated the 1985 agreement never meant for Gauthe to be
let out of prison early.
</P>
<P>
	   State law at the time gave most convicts one day off of their sentences for
every day of good behavior in prison. The law has since been changed to require
sexual or violent offenders to serve 85 percent of their sentences.

<HEADLINE> Premium Juice Cos. To Merge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HALF MOON BAY, Calif. (AP) -- Odwalla Inc., the upscale juice company that
survived a lethal E. coli outbreak in 1996, said Wednesday it would merge with
Maine juice company Fresh Samantha Inc., in a stock deal valued at $27 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Odwalla said merging with the East Coast's leading premium juice maker will
strengthen Odwalla's position in that section of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are excited about bringing Fresh Samantha together with Odwalla," said
Stephen Williamson, Odwalla's chairman and CEO. "This combination creates a true
national leader in the fast growing, super premium, refrigerated juice
category."
</P>
<P>
	   Privately owned Fresh Samantha is headquartered in Saco, Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Levin, the CEO and a founder of Fresh Samantha, will be president of
Odwalla when the merger is complete.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years ago, Odwalla's image was tarnished by a deadly E. coli outbreak
linked to its juice. A Colorado girl died and 66 others were sickened by
bacteria in Odwalla's unpasteurized apple juice.
</P>
<P>
	   The company immediately recalled the juice, but sales plummeted.
</P>
<P>
	   Odwalla now flash pasteurizes its apple juices, a process it said keeps
juices fresher and more nutritious than traditional pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
	   The company that helped establish the premium natural juice and fruit
smoothie category continues to work to regain sales lost to competitors who
grabbed market share while Odwalla was mired in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, Odwalla has unveiled a new, slimmer bottle with a screw cap
and a bolder, more colorful label that keeps its juices fresher longer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also expanded its product line to include energy bars and
dairy-free shakes, a wellness drink loaded with vitamin C and echinacea to fight
colds, and several fruit and vegetable blends.
</P>
<P>
	   While annual sales finally have surpassed peak 1996 levels, Odwalla's stock
remains at less than half of what it traded for before the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Odwalla, which has its production facilities in Dinuba, Calif.,
were up 25 cents, or nearly 4 percent, Wednesday at $7.12 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key Interest Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, still seeking to slow the
supercharged U.S. economy, raised borrowing costs for millions of Americans for
a fourth time since June by pushing a key interest rate up a quarter point to
5.75 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed action to boost its federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, was quickly followed by announcements from major banks around
the country that they were raising their prime lending rate a similar quarter
point to 8.75 percent, the highest level for this benchmark consumer and
business rate since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which had been worried that the central bank might feel the
need to raise rates by a half-point, turned in a mixed performance Wednesday
with the Dow Jones industrial average down 37.85 points at 11,003.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said while the Fed stopped with just a quarter-point increase,
investors were clearly worried by the tone of the Fed announcement, which
indicated further increases were in store.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a much more hawkish statement from the Fed today than any of the
statements that accompanied its three rate hikes last year," said David Jones,
chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists predicted the Fed would raise rates again at the next
meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on March 21 and again at the May 16
meeting. Some analysts said the unrelenting strength of the economy could prompt
a seventh quarter-point move at the June 28 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed wants to bring this high-flying economy down to a soft landing,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research Corp. "The rate increases
so far haven't really taken a toll on the economy, especially the consumer
sector."
</P>
<P>
	   While private economists saw the economic logic behind the Fed's actions, a
small band Fed critics complained that the central bank was fighting a phantom
menace, given that outside of rising energy costs, inflation has remained
exceptionally low despite a strong economy that has pushed unemployment to a
30-year low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding pretty
badly," Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said of the four rate increases in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., complained that the Fed's rate increases "impose
a tax on every single American citizen through higher interest rates," all to
fight what Dorgan said was a nonexistent inflation threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin and Dorgan spoke on the Senate floor as the Senate debated whether to
confirm Alan Greenspan, 73, for a fourth four-year term as Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was expected to win the confirmation vote easily, with Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying his 12-year record as Fed
chairman could be used to build "a strong case that Alan Greenspan is the
greatest central banker in the history of the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate was scheduled to vote on Greenspan's nomination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to boosting the federal funds rate, the Fed increased its
largely symbolic discount rate, the rate the Fed charges to make direct loans to
banks, by a quarter point to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the statement announcing the Fed decisions, the policy-makers said they
remained concerned that the strong economy and tight labor markets will produce
rising wage demands that will not be offset by gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's record economic expansion," the Fed said in explaining its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   While productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has shown big
gains in recent years, Greenspan has expressed growing worries that the
dwindling supply of available workers will eventually overwhelm these
productivity increases, forcing employers to raise product prices to cover their
higher wage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he
expected upcoming unemployment reports to be the biggest factor guiding Fed
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed does not want to see further declines in the unemployment rate,"
Steinberg said, forecasting that Friday's report will show the jobless rate
dipping in January to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first use of its new disclosure policy, the Fed said it viewed future
risks "weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures."
</P>
<P>
	   A string of recent indicators have shown the economy, which set a record
this month for the longest expansion in U.S. history, was growing at a rate of
5.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the government reported that sales of new single family homes
set a record for the second straight year with 904,000 homes sold in 1999, up 2
percent from 1998, indicating that rising mortgage rates have had little effect
so far in slowing sales demand.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second report, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
predict future economic activity, rose a strong 0.4 percent in December, its
biggest gain in nearly a year, indicating the current expansion is in no danger
of faltering.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Guards Charged in Inmate Death  </HEADLINE>
   By RON WORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- Four prison guards were arrested and charged with
second-degree murder Wednesday in the fatal beating of a death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Timothy Thornton, Sgt. Jason Griffis, and Sgt. Charles A. Brown all
turned themselves in at the Bradford County Jail, where they were being held on
$100,000 bond, according to jail officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers arrested Sgt. Robert W. Sauls
at his girlfriend's home. Officers handcuffed him and drove him to the jail,
where he was held on $100,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffis and Brown, both 26, Thornton, 34, and Sauls, 37, are among nine
guards being investigated in Frank Valdes' death. A grand jury investigating the
death issued sealed indictments Wednesday. The indictments were expected to be
unsealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   All were scheduled to make their first court appearance Thursday morning.
They face up to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a travesty of justice,'' said Thornton's attorney, Gloria Fletcher.
``The man didn't do anything. He was doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
	   The nine prison guards have been suspended since Valdes died on July 17
after a confrontation with guards inside a disciplinary area at Florida State
Prison near Starke.
</P>
<P>
	   Guards claimed Valdes, 36, had severely injured himself by throwing himself
off his bunk onto the concrete floor of his cell.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner said an autopsy showed Valdes was beaten to death. The
inmate had boot marks on his body, his ribs were broken and his testicles were
swollen.
</P>
<P>
	   Valdes was sentenced to death for the fatal shooting of a prison guard while
attempting to help a fellow inmate escape in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Protestants Sentenced in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Two Protestant militants were convicted and
sentenced to life in prison Wednesday for the 1998 murders of a Catholic man and
his Protestant best friend.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of Northern Ireland's peace accord, however, the pair could win
paroles within months.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Brian Kerr convicted Stephen McClean and Noel McCready of murdering
Catholic Damien Trainor and Protestant Philip Allen as they sat discussing
Allen's wedding plans in a pub in the village of Poyntzpass.
</P>
<P>
	   McClean and McCready smirked and joked as the judge pronounced them guilty,
but relatives of the two victims gasped with relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said McClean, McCready and the man driving their getaway car, Ryan
Robley, had targeted the bar in the mistaken belief that everybody inside would
be Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   Robley pleaded guilty already to murder and received a life sentence
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kerr said the trio would be eligible for early parole in accordance with the
April 1998 Good Friday peace accord. The accord says all imprisoned members of
truce-observing groups convicted of offenses committed before the accord should
go free by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Poyntzpass pub attack happened in March 1998. The anti-Catholic gang
that took the blame called a cease-fire the month after the accord to qualify
for the parole program.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Allen's mother, Ethel Allen, said she opposed the killers' early
release.
</P>
<P>
	   But ``at least they will be labeled guilty for the rest of their lives for
the murder of my loving son,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban: Nun Is Instrument of Exiles  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- A senior Cuban official on Wednesday accused the Roman
Catholic nun involved in last week's meeting between Elian Gonzalez and his
grandmothers of being an ``instrument'' of Miami's anti-communist exile
community.
</P>
<P>
	   That communist officials remained focused on the meeting a full week after
it took place shows the depth of their anger about the way it was handled, as
well as their growing frustration as the international child custody dispute
over the 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor drags into its third month. The
political rhetoric from communist officials has grown especially harsh in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne O'Laughlin, a nun of the Dominican order, served as ``an instrument''
for anti-Castro exiles during the Jan. 26 meeting at her Miami Beach home, said
Ricardo Alarcon, Fidel Castro's key man on Cuba-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin said following the meeting that she favors keeping Elian in the
United States with his second cousin partly because the boy ``has transferred
his maternal love to her'' following the loss of his mother. She said the
grandmothers seemed fearful -- apparently of their own government.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since
shortly after being rescued off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy's mother
and 10 other people died when the boat carrying them from Cuba to the United
States sank.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father and grandparents want the child returned to them in Cuba, but
the boy's paternal great-uncle and second cousin are fighting to keep him in the
United States, saying they can give him a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, and maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez, traveled to the United States late last month. Their first
attempt at a meeting with their grandchild failed on Jan. 24, when the
grandmothers refused to meet with the boy at the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, which was surrounded by television cameras and anti-Castro
protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government ordered the Miami family to hold the meeting at a
neutral site and O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, offered her
home.
</P>
<P>
	   But speaking Wednesday night during a second consecutive television program
with Elian's grandmothers, Alarcon complained that the reunion was interrupted
numerous times by another nun who brought notes asking that the grandmothers
meet with the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   During the meeting, Elian's second cousin was allowed to stay next door
where she could listen in and later share details about the meeting with Miami's
news media, Alarcon said. Later, O'Laughlin met for dinner with the Miami
relatives and then announced that she thought Elian should stay in the United
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin's behavior ``has nothing to do with Christianity,'' said Alarcon,
president of Cuba's National Assembly and a former ambassador to the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tanker Searched for Iraq Oil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Navy ship patrolling the Persian Gulf detained a
Russian tanker Wednesday and was taking oil samples to determine whether it was
carrying Iraqi oil in violation of the U.N. trade embargo, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The USS Monterey stopped the Russian merchant vessel off the coast of the
United Arab Emirates and the captain was cooperating, Defense Department
spokesman P.J. Crowley said. The tanker was traveling away from Iraq, through
the Straits of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the world's oil passes.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowley did not say if the Pentagon knew where the Russian ship had picked
up the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   A second Pentagon spokesman, Jim Kout, said stopping a Russian ship was
``not new but it is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the oil is found to have come from Iraq, the boarding party likely would
request permission from an Emirates port to haul the ship to a nearby port and
dispose of the contraband, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said U.S.
officials have been communicating with the Russians through normal diplomatic
channels, but they haven't received any kind of protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made very clear we're going to vigorously enforce the
sanctions,'' Leavy said. ``It is a top priority to us to continue to deny
smuggling opportunities to the Iraqi regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been unable to sell its oil on the open market since sanctions were
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In 1996, the U.N. Security Council
launched the oil-for-food program to allow Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
to buy humanitarian goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military said in October that American sailors had diverted at
least five ships carrying cargo to Iraq after boarding parties had problems
searching for contraband over the past month. The United States and Britain are
the main enforcing parties.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman said at the time that inspectors query ``every ship
that goes into the Gulf'' and board a vessel ``if there is any question about
the cargo.''

<HEADLINE> Austria Govt. Decision Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Facing European sanctions and worldwide scorn,
Austria's president on Wednesday delayed approving a new government that
includes Joerg Haider's rightists until leaders of the coalition pledge to
respect democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   The outrage over the coalition between Haider's Freedom Party and the
center-right Austrian People's Party was debated in world capitals and spilled
into the streets of this stately, baroque city.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 10,000 people rallied Wednesday night in front of the People's
Party headquarters to protest the coalition deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prove yourself to be a patriot,'' theater producer Andre Heller told the
crowd in remarks directed to People's Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel. ``No
alliance with meanness. No alliance with right-wing radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the executive committee of Schuessel's party adopted the
coalition pact in a session that ended shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil's office said Haider and Schuessel would meet with
the chief of state Thursday to sign a ``declaration of values of European
democracy.'' The new government was expected to be approved shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil's declaration was designed to spare the country political and
diplomatic isolation within a European Union whose other members doubt Haider's
commitment to liberal democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview to be published Thursday, Klestil told the magazine News
that he fears Austria will suffer ``international damage'' if a government
including Haider's Freedom Party takes power.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety about 10 years ago by praising Adolf
Hitler's ``orderly'' employment policies and lauding veterans of the murderous
Waffen SS as ``men of honor.'' He has also spoken out against the EU's expansion
and has predicted the new government will impose a nearly complete ban on
immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider has sought repeatedly to distance himself from previous statements.
He told reporters this week that the Freedom Party has no sympathy for the
Nazis, adding they were responsible for the ``greatest crimes of the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assurances by Haider and Schuessel that their new government would respect
democratic values did little to quiet the furor that swept through Israel and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called Haider ``dangerous'' to democracy
and recalled his ambassador from Vienna ``for an unlimited period.''
</P>
<P>
	   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said any coalition with Haider
would bring diplomatic isolation for Austria. Norway issued a similar warning
Wednesday. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel urged his countrymen to cancel
ski holidays in Austria in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   And in Poland, Haider opponents rallied in front of the Austrian Embassy in
Warsaw. Earlier in the day, the Austrian Consulate in the southern Polish city
of Krakow was pelted with eggs.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked how the Clinton administration viewed the situation, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said, ``We share their (Europeans') concerns. We'll be
watching, and we'll take appropriate steps.'' Albright spoke in Zagreb, Croatia,
where she had stopped on her way home from talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   With an agreement between Haider and Schuessel in place, attention has
shifted to President Klestil. Although his post is largely ceremonial, the
president must swear in a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither party leader has confirmed the makeup of the new Cabinet. The
Austria Press Agency, however, said the Cabinet would be split evenly between
the two parties, with Schuessel as chancellor and a Freedom Party member as vice
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Ministry would go to a member of the People's Party, the agency
said. The Interior Ministry is responsible for immigration policies and
overseeing the police -- high priorities for the Freedom Party, which wants to
restrict immigration and has a tough law and order image.

<HEADLINE> FTC Rejects BP Amoco, ARCO Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission moved Wednesday to block BP
Amoco's takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., setting the stage for the biggest
oil antitrust court fight since the breakup of Standard Oil nearly a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission voted 3-2 to direct its staff to seek an injunction that
would scuttle the $30 billion merger, concluding the new company would dominate
Alaska oil production and West Coast markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This particular merger is anticompetitive," Richard Parker, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition, said at a news conference after the vote. "We're
going after this merger and we're going to try to stop it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the proposed company was "a colossus" that could dictate prices to
West Coast refiners who rely on Alaska crude oil. Other critics of the merger
have argued that such dominance could translate into higher retail gasoline
prices in California and other West Coast states that rely heavily on Alaska
crude.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would create the second largest nongovernment oil company behind
Exxon Mobil, whose merger was completed in November hours after receiving FTC's
approval. BP Amoco itself was created only a little more than a year ago with
the merger of British Petroleum and Amoco.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco pledged to "argue the case vigorously" in court. "We
believe we have a compelling case," the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield, or Arco as it is commonly
known, together account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil production.
They dominate oil activities in the state, from drilling to transporting crude
to market.
</P>
<P>
	   Parker said the government would go to court in San Francisco, as early as
Friday, seeking an injunction that would prevent from completion of the merger
as planned by the two companies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco had said it would sell off 13 percent of the production as well as
part ownership in two Alaska oil fields. But Parker said the new company still
"would control overwhelming proportions of the (Alaska) production."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the proposed divestitures, the combined company would account for
55 percent of the oil flowing from Alaska's North Slope, the FTC estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco said claims the new company dramatically could affect West Coast
prices, which are pegged to world oil markets, were "unfounded."
</P>
<P>
	   While the company said it remained receptive to negotiations and "any
reasonable options," it acknowledged "the only course now open to us is to
resolve the issue through litigation."
</P>
<P>
	   If the request for an injunction is successful, the case likely would go
before an FTC administrative law judge, whose decision can be appealed in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   The litigation could take months and eventually may end up before the
Supreme Court if BP Amoco persists in fighting the biggest antitrust challenge
to the oil industry since the Standard Oil breakup nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been other industry challenges and price fixing cases, said
Victor Goldberg, an antitrust scholar and law professor at Columbia University.
But, he said, "this would be the first one attacking the basic market structure
of the oil industry" since the Standard Oil case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court in 1911 ordered the breakup of the Standard Oil holding
company because of its market dominance.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg and other antitrust scholars said the government may have a tough
time proving its case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil flows. They're going to have to find some sort of argument to show why
the international (market) is not going to solve the problem," said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco contends the merger would produce efficiencies that would lead to
$1 billion in savings worldwide, about a fifth of that in Alaska, and "drive
down Alaskan production costs" so its crude would be more competitive in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any suggestion that there is a special West Coast market for Alaskan crude
oil that functions independently of world crude prices is without foundation,"
the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wednesday's vote, FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky and commissioners Mozelle
Thompson and Sheila Anthony voted to block the merger. Commissioners Orson
Swindle and Thomas Leary voted against seeking an injunction.

<HEADLINE> Man Acquitted After 25 Years in Jail  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A former transvestite prostitute who served 25 years
in prison was acquitted of murder Wednesday after being put on trial a second
time for the bludgeoning and strangling of a businessman in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   John Duval, 47, freed last spring on the basis of new evidence, broke down
in tears and his relatives sobbed and whooped ``hallelujuh'' when jurors cleared
him of the killing after a week of testimony and two days of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel overwhelmed,'' Duval said, dabbing his eyes. ``I always maintained
my faith.''
</P>
<P>
	   If he had been convicted again of second-degree murder, he would have been
returned to prison and remained there until he died or was granted parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Haworth, 52, a consultant from Philadelphia to Eastman Kodak Co.,
left his hotel the night of May 24, 1973, apparently in search of a prostitute.
He was found dead in an alley the next morning.
</P>
<P>
	   In the absence of physical evidence, Duval and fellow prostitute Betty Tyson
were convicted on the basis of confessions they insist were beaten out of them
by a rogue detective, and on the testimony of two teen-age runaways. They were
sentenced in February 1974 to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the teen witnesses, Wayne Wright, recanted his testimony in 1997,
saying he had lied about seeing Duval and Tyson with the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors then came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with the
other teen, Jon Jackson, in which he denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the
victim -- contrary to what the teens had testified in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling that evidence was wrongfully suppressed, a judge freed Tyson in May
1998 and Duval last April. While prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson -- the
city gave her $1.2 million in compensation -- they went after Duval again. While
Tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his
guilt before a parole board.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Gilda Sherrod-Ali, said in closing arguments that Duval lied to
the parole board in 1995 and in 1997 because ``he believed that was the only way
he could get out.''
</P>
<P>
	   A week ago, Wright testified that chief detective William Mahoney terrorized
him into lying on the stand, at one point spinning the barrel of his gun as they
sat in a jail cell.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney, who was investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing
suspects, resigned in 1980 after he was convicted of fabricating evidence in an
unrelated case. He died in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Flight Recorder Recovered  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Searchers recovered one of the ``black box''
recorders Wednesday that could reveal more clues about what caused an Alaska
Airlines jet to crash in the ocean off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   A remote-controlled underwater robot called Scorpio broke the surface of the
Santa Barbara Channel shortly before sundown clutching the cockpit voice
recorder, which contains tape of conversations between crew members, air traffic
controllers and any other sounds in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Terry Williams confirmed the
box was the cockpit recorder. The search continued for a companion box -- the
flight data recorder -- that records data on the planes mechanical operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Flight 261 plunged into the Pacific on Monday as the pilots struggled
with a jammed horizontal stabilizer on the tail of the plane, according to radio
conversations between the pilots and air traffic controllers. Killed were 88
crew and passengers on the flight to San Francisco and Seattle from Puerto
Vallarta, a Mexican vacation spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators confirmed Wednesday they were looking into a report that the
plane had problems with a part of the stabilizer on the flight down to Mexico.
The device keeps the plane flying level. The airline said it was unaware of any
problems with the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities also began analyzing recordings of the pilots' conversations
with a Seattle maintenance crew made while the pilots tried to control the plane
in the terrifying moments before it nose-dived into the sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Wednesday, dozens of Coast Guard and Navy ships were ordered to
abandon the search for survivors and shift their focus to recovering flight
recorders and wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage is about 700 feet down. Divers cannot operate below about 300
feet, so the search is being carried out by three unmanned vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors was called off over the protest of some family
members who held out hope that some of the plane's passengers and crew might
still be alive in the chilly waters of the Santa Barbara Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have far exceeded our estimate of survivability,'' Coast Guard Vice
Adm. Thomas Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   On shore, investigators interviewed airline employees about a report in The
Seattle Times that a different crew of pilots complained of problems with the
aircraft's horizontal stabilizer as they headed toward Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans in Seattle denied the report: ``We
stand by what we said earlier this week which is that we're not aware of any
maintenance anomalies with this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB member John Hammerschmidt said the agency is investigating the
newspaper report, and is interviewing pilots from the earlier flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile a jammed horizontal stabilizer forced an American Airlines MD-80
to land in Phoenix 20 minutes after takeoff Wednesday, said Phil Frame, a
spokesman for the NTSB in Washington. The plane, which had been headed toward
Dallas, is part of the same series of aircraft as the Alaska MD-83 that crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal investigators were having the flight data recorder from the American
Airlines plane sent to them. Frame knew of no link between the American Airlines
incident and the crash investigation, but ``it may have piqued their interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also interviewed pilots who were flying in the area of
the crash and may have seen Flight 261 go down.
</P>
<P>
	   The audio tapes of the pilots and the Seattle maintenance crew apparently
capture an exchange that took place as the pilots tried to troubleshoot what was
going wrong, Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB, said on morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously these pilots were struggling to maintain control of this
aircraft for a significant period of time. It's going to be very important to
this investigation,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for survivors had gone on for 41 hours and included dozens of
Coast Guard, Navy and civilian ships, boats and aircraft that combed a
1,100-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
	   About 80 family members had arrived at an assistance center in the
Renaissance Hotel in Los Angeles by Tuesday night and another 50 were expected
to show up Wednesday, said Chris Thomas, an American Red Cross volunteer.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those who had arrived at the hotel remained in a state of shock, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just want to know that our family members didn't suffer and that it was
just fast,'' said Janis Ost Ford, whose brother Bob Ost was on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines and Red Cross officials planned to take family members to
the coast near the crash site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will be able to deal with the emotional responses; they'll be able to
see the search-and-rescue recovery process,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the operation entered a third day, several ships used for salvage arrived
at Port Hueneme, including Navy vessels equipped with advanced side-scan sonar
that can be used to map debris on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   If the flight data recorder was programmed to monitor the stabilizer, it
might reveal the condition of the stabilizer when the jet went down. If not,
officials would have to deduce what happened by studying how other systems
performed before the crash.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Major's Hearing Canceled  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- An Air Force major who faces a possible court-martial
for refusing to take an anthrax vaccination waived his right Wednesday to a
hearing that would have given him details of the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Sonnie Bates faces up to five years in a military prison for disobeying
an order. Bates, a veteran pilot with nearly 14 years of service, says he fears
the anthrax vaccine may be harmful to his health.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Defense has ordered all of its 2.4 million active and
reserve soldiers, sailors and airmen to be vaccinated against anthrax, a
chemical weapon thought to be a biological threat against the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Several soldiers have refused the shots, but Bates is believed to be the
highest-ranking officer in the Air Force to face court-martial for his refusal.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigating officer would have laid out evidence against Bates at
Thursday's Article 32 hearing and made a recommendation on whether to pursue a
full court-martial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Force was planning to use the hearing as a stage to promote the
vaccine instead of addressing the charge, Bates said in a telephone interview
from his Ellendale home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because the officer in charge of the investigation has no authority to
drop the charges, the hearing wasn't going to do me any good anyway,'' Bates
said. ``I refused to be exploited for this reason.''
</P>
<P>
	   The decision of whether to continue with a court-martial lies with Col. S.
Taco Gilbert III, Bates' commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates, 35, grew concerned about the anthrax vaccine after he said members of
his squadron in the 436th Airlift Wing got sick following the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Frank Smolinsky, chief of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base, says
the vaccine has not sickened an inordinate number of service personnel.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Jolt Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices ended the Thursday morning session sharply
higher amid hopes that the planned launch of several new investment trust funds
will draw more investors to the market. The dollar fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended the morning session up
217.45 points, or 1.11 percent, at 19,796.36 points. On Wednesday, the average
closed up 155.53 points, or 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 107.98 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
down 0.52 yen from 108.50 yen of late Wednesday and also below its late New York
level of 108.26 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, optimism about the Nikkei's outlook prevailed ahead of
the launch of several large-scale investment trusts over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders expected the funds to draw more individual investors into the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   But some cautioned that the Nikkei's morning rise was based largely on
market sentiment, rather than any fresh factors.
</P>
<P>
	   "For now, the market is supported merely by investor hopes for good demand
for investment trust funds," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo
Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Nomura Asset Management, a subsidiary of Japan's biggest brokerage house,
raised about $7.4 billion on Wednesday, the launch day for its "Big Project-N"
fund.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.85 points, or 0.3
percent, to close at 11,003.20. The technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index rose
21.98 points, or 0.54 percent, to finish at 4073.96.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index was up 13.57 points, or 0.79 percent, at
1,725.43 points. On Wednesday, the index rose 14.71 points, or 0.87 percent, to
1,711.86.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency markets, traders sold the greenback to take profits after buying
up dollars on anticipation of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Fed announced it had decided to raise key rates, prompting
investors to cash in on their dollar holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said, however, the outlook for the U.S. currency remained strong.
The increase in interest rates makes the dollar more attractive to Japanese
investors because it leads to a higher yield on dollar-denominated assets, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese government officials repeated their concerns about an excessively
strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda told
reporters Thursday morning that the ministry's foreign exchange stance remained
opposed to a higher-valued yen.
</P>
<P>
	   An excessively strong yen hurts export-based Japanese companies, as it
decreases their profitability when dollar earnings are repatriated back into
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 105.22 yen early Thursday, above its
level of 104.77 yen late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8550
from its close at 1.8350 Wednesday. Its price fell 0.17 point to 98.68.

<HEADLINE> Devils 3, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Elias scored a goal and assisted on another
Wednesday night as the New Jersey Devils stretched their unbeaten streak against
New York to 17 games, 3-1 over the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Devils have not lost to the Rangers in the regular season since Jan. 12,
1997 (12-0-5).
</P>
<P>
	   Elias set up Jason Arnott for his 15th goal at 14:32 of the third period,
sending a cross-ice pass from the left boards to Arnott, who stuffed the puck
past Rangers goalie Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Graves gave New York a 1-0 lead 2:08 into the second when he converted
a goal-mouth pass from Theoren Fleury for his 17th goal. Graves beat Devils
defenseman Sheldon Souray to the spot directly in front of Martin Brodeur and
deposited Fleury's crisp pass into the open side of the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias made it 1-1 at 12:23 of the second on a counter play. With the Rangers
pressing in the New Jersey zone, Brian Rafalski chipped an outlet pass,
springing Elias down the left side on a breakaway. Elias beat Richter with a
wrist shot for his 22nd goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Claude Lemieux put New Jersey ahead 2-1 at 19:04 of the period with his 18th
goal. Lemieux intercepted the puck in the Devils end, took it all the way up ice
behind the New York net, then banked in a shot from behind the net off the skate
of Rangers defenseman Kevin Hatcher.

<HEADLINE> Fed Raises Key Interest Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, still seeking to slow the
supercharged U.S. economy, raised borrowing costs for millions of Americans for
a fourth time since June by pushing a key interest rate up a quarter point to
5.75 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed action to boost its federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, was quickly followed by announcements from major banks around
the country that they were raising their prime lending rate a similar quarter
point to 8.75 percent, the highest level for this benchmark consumer and
business rate since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which had been worried that the central bank might feel the
need to raise rates by a half-point, turned in a mixed performance Wednesday
with the Dow Jones industrial average down 37.85 points at 11,003.20.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said while the Fed stopped with just a quarter-point increase,
investors were clearly worried by the tone of the Fed announcement, which
indicated further increases were in store.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a much more hawkish statement from the Fed today than any of the
statements that accompanied its three rate hikes last year," said David Jones,
chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists predicted the Fed would raise rates again at the next
meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on March 21 and again at the May 16
meeting. Some analysts said the unrelenting strength of the economy could prompt
a seventh quarter-point move at the June 28 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed wants to bring this high-flying economy down to a soft landing,"
said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research Corp. "The rate increases
so far haven't really taken a toll on the economy, especially the consumer
sector."
</P>
<P>
	   While private economists saw the economic logic behind the Fed's actions, a
small band Fed critics complained that the central bank was fighting a phantom
menace, given that outside of rising energy costs, inflation has remained
exceptionally low despite a strong economy that has pushed unemployment to a
30-year low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "A little nick here, a little nick there; pretty soon you're bleeding pretty
badly," Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said of the four rate increases in the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., complained that the Fed's rate increases "impose
a tax on every single American citizen through higher interest rates," all to
fight what Dorgan said was a nonexistent inflation threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin and Dorgan spoke on the Senate floor as the Senate debated whether to
confirm Alan Greenspan, 73, for a fourth four-year term as Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was expected to win the confirmation vote easily, with Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying his 12-year record as Fed
chairman could be used to build "a strong case that Alan Greenspan is the
greatest central banker in the history of the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate was scheduled to vote on Greenspan's nomination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to a group of state legislators Monday night, President Clinton
praised Greenspan and said he helped sustain the long economic growth by not
intervening too aggressively in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   While traditional economic theory said the rapid growth would bring high
inflation, "he had the courage to look at the evidence over the arguments of the
past to see that something fundamentally different was going on in our economy,"
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to boosting the federal funds rate, the Fed increased its
largely symbolic discount rate, the rate the Fed charges to make direct loans to
banks, by a quarter point to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the statement announcing the Fed decisions, the policy-makers said they
remained concerned that the strong economy and tight labor markets will produce
rising wage demands that will not be offset by gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such trends could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's record economic expansion," the Fed said in explaining its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   While productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, has shown big
gains in recent years, Greenspan has expressed growing worries that the
dwindling supply of available workers will eventually overwhelm these
productivity increases, forcing employers to raise product prices to cover their
higher wage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he
expected upcoming unemployment reports to be the biggest factor guiding Fed
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed does not want to see further declines in the unemployment rate,"
Steinberg said, forecasting that Friday's report will show the jobless rate
dipping in January to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first use of its new disclosure policy, the Fed said it viewed future
risks "weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures."
</P>
<P>
	   A string of recent indicators have shown the economy, which set a record
this month for the longest expansion in U.S. history, was growing at a rate of
5.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the government reported that sales of new single family homes
set a record for the second straight year with 904,000 homes sold in 1999, up 2
percent from 1998, indicating that rising mortgage rates have had little effect
so far in slowing sales demand.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second report, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
predict future economic activity, rose a strong 0.4 percent in December, its
biggest gain in nearly a year, indicating the current expansion is in no danger
of faltering.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Bias Ruled On  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California courts make it too hard to prove
discrimination in jury selection, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   California judges require a defense lawyer who challenges the prosecutor's
removal of a juror to show a ``strong likelihood'' of bias before the judge will
order the prosecutor to give an explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said this method violates the U.S.
Supreme Court's rules for the type of proof needed to require a hearing on juror
challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's high court requires only evidence that creates a ``reasonable
inference'' of bias before a hearing is ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   The California test, in effect at least since 1994, is ``impermissibly
stringent'' and violates defendants' rights, said Judge William Fletcher in the
3-0 appellate ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court nevertheless upheld the convictions of two men for firing
shots through an apartment door that wounded two Richmond police officers in May
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were black. The jury included one black member, but two other
blacks were removed by the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense failed to offer enough evidence of discrimination to justify a
hearing into the removal of a black female juror, even under the more lenient
federal standard, Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the state did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Seasonal rains were not enough to ease a drought in
large parts of this east African nation, leaving at least 2 million Kenyans in
need of food aid, the U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The WFP appealed to donor nations for $43 million to purchase food for the
needy over the next five months.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya has a long rainy season between March and May and short rains between
October and December, but for the past several years they have not been enough.
</P>
<P>
	   According to reports compiled by the government and aid agencies, the
situation remains most critical in the north, where inhabitants are suffering
from three successive crop failures as well as drought and floods, the agency
said.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Demands Nuke Compensation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea blamed the United States Thursday for
an unexpected delay in building two nuclear power plants and demanded
compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first time that the communist country has officially asked for
compensation for the anticipated delay in building the light-water reactors,
which were promised under a 1994 nuclear accord with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The demand came as a U.S.-led international consortium prepared to start
working talks with North Korea ``within a few weeks'' on revising the target
date for completing the first reactor, which was set for 2003. The second
reactor was set to be completed the next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the consortium, called the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization, have unofficially said that ``several years of delay'' will be
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korean Vice Premier Jo Chang Dok said in a report released by the
North's foreign news outlet, KCNA, that his country had faithfully fulfilled its
end of the 1994 accord and frozen its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, however, has failed to hold up its end of the accord,
causing a long delay in building the reactors and in turn an acute power
shortage in North Korea, the report quoted Jo as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Jo claimed in the report that if his country had built a Soviet-designed
graphite-moderated reactor as scheduled, its power problem would not be as
serious as it is now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. should own responsibility for having caused such acute shortage
of electricity in (North Korea),'' Jo said.

<HEADLINE> Orange County Bankruptcy Report OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge approved Orange County's final
bankruptcy report on Wednesday, clearing the way for the distribution of $871
million in settlements recovered from Wall Street investment firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling, 3 1/2 years after Orange County emerged from bankruptcy, brings
to an end the $1.64 billion ordeal for most of the schools, cities and special
districts involved in the largest municipal insolvency in U.S. history
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the end of an incredibly successful case that started as a disaster
and has been resolved as successfully as any major bankruptcy case in history
has," said Patrick Shea, an attorney who represented many members of the
investment pool.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan approved the report submitted by former
state Treasurer Thomas Hayes, who oversaw the county's litigation against
investment firms held responsible for the for losses, including Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very happy with the results," Hayes said. "This has got to be one of
the highest collections in the history of the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear when the money would be released, an additional $21
million in interest that was earned while it was held in escrow will also be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
	   A small group of investors turned down an agreement to share in litigation
proceedings with the county, and a trial in their case is set for later this
year in Contra Costa County.
</P>
<P>
	   Orange County emerged from bankruptcy in June 1996 under a recovery plan
that included the sale of $880 million in bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The bankruptcy came after then-Treasurer Robert L. Citron took a $7 billion
investment pool, borrowed another $14 billion from brokerages and invested
heavily in interest rate-sensitive securities. When the Federal Reserve forced
interest rates sharply higher to curb inflation in 1994, what had been a
spectacularly successful strategy turned sour.
</P>
<P>
	   Citron blamed Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., his chief investment house, accusing it
of failing to disclose risks associated with such investments. Merrill Lynch
officials said they had warned him.
</P>
<P>
	   Citron was forced to resign after revealing the losses. Soon after,
brokerages began liquidating securities they held as collateral, a process that
continued even after the county filed for bankruptcy in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The county sued Merrill Lynch, which agreed to pay more than $450 million to
settle the suit and end a criminal investigation. The county recovered more than
$860 million from a series of lawsuits against brokerage firms.

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Testifies in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CIA Director George Tenet says there is no evidence that
classified material improperly kept on former director John Deutch's home
computer fell into the wrong hands via the Internet. Still, ``We cannot exclude
that possibility,'' he told a Senate committee looking into the security lapse
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was sloppy in what he did,'' Tenet said of his former boss and
predecessor. ``He worked around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tenet denied he
deliberately delayed an investigation into Deutch's computer practices. But, he
conceded, ``The internal investigation took too long. The process was not
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet stripped Deutch of his security clearances in August, even though the
CIA investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified materials began in
December 1996, the month Tenet became acting director.
</P>
<P>
	   An internal report by the CIA's inspector general faults Tenet and other
senior CIA officials for waiting too long before notifying the Justice
Department or congressional intelligence oversight committees of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet agreed the CIA was slow in notifying appropriate officials and
lawmakers. ``There was no excuse for that,'' he said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch was CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996. When he left his CIA
post, agency technicians went to his home and found 31 classified documents on a
CIA-issued computer not configured for work with secret documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet said most of the classified documents on Deutch's computers were not
ones he took home from secure CIA computers but ones he created in writing
reports. Even so, Tenet said, there were ``high levels of classified materials''
on Deutch's home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence community officials, speaking later on the condition of
anonymity, said a chief concern was that the computer used byDeutch for CIA work
at home also had an America Online account used by Deutch and other family
members to access the Internet and send and receive e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators concluded that, in at least one instance, an e-mail message
was sent to Deutch's AOL account from an individual who identified himself as a
former Russian scientist, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators determined that the e-mail came from a European country,
said the officials. The e-mail was incoming, and not solicited or answered by
Deutch, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS News, meanwhile, quoting unidentified current and former intelligence
officers, said that pornography sites were among ``high risk'' sites visited by
someone in the Deutch household.
</P>
<P>
	   Several sources familiar with the investigation suggested that a review of
data on the hard drive of the computer did, in fact, show that such sites were
among those logged onto by someone using the computer. But the times of the
visit did not match up with times when Deutch was home, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to those familiar with the still-classified inspector general's
report, Deutch deleted more than 1,000 secret documents on the computer when he
became aware of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized. Although the CIA eventually referred the case to the
Justice Department, Deutch has not been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet was grilled on the security lapses during a hearing on world trouble
spots. In that testimony, Tenet said:
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a ``high potential'' for a military flare-up across the Taiwan
Strait this year because of increasing tensions between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   --Over the next 15 years, U.S. cities could be within range of ballistic
missiles from ``North Korea, probably Iran and possibly Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The CIA, working with foreign governments, has helped to bring ``more than
two dozens terrorists to justice'' since July 1998. More than half were
associated with suspected fugitive terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia's economic difficulties are weakening the government's ability to
safeguard its nuclear arsenal. `While there is no evidence weapons are missing,
``We remain concerned by reports of lax discipline, labor strikes, poor morale
and criminal activities at nuclear storage facilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Deutch matter was one of ``grave concern,'' said the committee chairman,
Sen. Richard Shelby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people have a keen interest in the performance of senior
officials charged with upholding our laws and policies with respect to the
protection of classified information, '' said Shelby, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby asked Tenet if he could assure Congress that foreign powers or other
unauthorized parties had not gotten access to Deutch's materials via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   While there was no evidence of that, Tenet said: ''``We cannot exclude that
possibility. I can't give you a statement that it absolutely didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch clearly violated CIA security rules on the handling of classified
documents, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tenet balked at questions on whether the Deutch material posed as much
damage to U.S. security if it were to fall into the wrong hands as information
passed on by convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Jonathan Pollard.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a case of espionage, Tenet said. ``I would not put the Deutch
case in the same category as Ames and Pollard. I don't think it's fair.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Zapatista Rebel Supporters Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Three supporters of the leftist
Zapatista rebels were killed in an ambush in the southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were attacked Tuesday in Chavajebal, 185 miles north of San
Cristobal de las Casas, said Bartolo Perez, a spokesman for the regional Indian
group CIRSA.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the three were shot while in their way home from a shopping trip.
</P>
<P>
	   A police official, Santiago Solis, confirmed the killings, but said he had
no details because the area is controlled by Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not known who was responsible for the attack. The area has been the
site of clashes between Zapatista supporters and paramilitaries who support the
governing party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in January 1994 in the name of Indian
rights and greater democracy. Peace talks have been stalled for almost four
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting between Zapatistas and soldiers has been infrequent in recent
years, but one of the biggest battles occurred in Chavajebal in June 1988, when
eight Zapatistas and two soldiers were killed.

bank fraud, mail fraud and making a false statement in connection with an
allegedly falsified loan application for his home, the U.S attorney's office
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Tyrone ``Ty'' Courtney said he did nothing wrong and questioned

<HEADLINE> Search Continues for Alaska Musher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Three days after rookie dog sled racer Rod Boyce
disappeared in a blizzard, search crews Wednesday still had found no trace of
the 38-year-old or his dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce, a recreational musher from Two Rivers, was competing for the first
time in the Tustumena 200 Sled Dog Race.
</P>
<P>
	   He was last seen a few minutes after midnight Saturday when he passed a
checkpoint about a quarter of the way along the 200-mile trial. He never made it
to the next checkpoint 18 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   The path wasn't treacherous, just a straight stretch that rises into the
hills, Alaska State Trooper John Brown said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ten dogs and a person disappear at once. It seems like we should have seen
something,'' said Sgt. Jim Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in Homer.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen people on snowmachines searched the surrounding
recreational trails for Boyce on Wednesday, and a state trooper helicopter with
heat-detecting equipment was being sent from Anchorage to scan the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce, the city editor for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, had 10 dogs when
he was last seen by race officials. He was carrying all the survival equipment
required in the race, including a heavy sleeping bag and an ax, and he had
enough food for him and the dogs for two days.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LIVINGSTON MANOR, N.Y. (AP) -- Lewis A. Head, a longtime Associated Press
reporter and editor in New Jersey and New York, died at age 87 of congestive
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was one of those dedicated editors who trained a large army of young
journalists," said Robert A. Dubill, executive editor of USA Today and a former
AP bureau chief in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Head's wife, Lois Guthrie Head, said he died at his home Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Head was born in Winnipeg, Canada, in 1912 and grew up in Glen Rock, N.J. He
graduated from Lafayette College in 1934. Head worked as a photo editor at The
New York Times from 1936 to 1941 and joined the AP in 1941.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lew turned out to be a delightful writer and a great feature reporter,"
said Bob Haring, a retired executive editor of the Tulsa World who was the AP's
bureau chief in Newark when Head worked there in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Head retired in 1976 after a 35-year career.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to his wife, Head is survived by a daughter, Tamar Losec of Long
Island City, N.Y., and a sister, Jessie Broadfoot of Middletown, N.J.

<HEADLINE> No. 7 Connecticut 74, Villanova 60  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Albert Mouring tied his career high with 22 points,
hitting 8-of-9 shots and all four of his 3-pointers as No. 7 Connecticut beat
Villanova 74-60 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn (16-4, 5-3 Big East) won its third straight conference game after an
0-2 start and had a big shot to answer every Villanova run.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats (11-8, 2-5) got 19 points on 8-of-14 shooting from Malik Allen
but got no closer than seven points down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Khalid El-Amin, the Huskies' crafty point guard, played sporadically and
grabbed his stomach while taking himself out of the game several times. He was
healthy enough to score 12 points and hit a 3-pointer to give UConn a 70-60 lead
in the closing minutes when Villanova tried to mount a comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin scored 12 points, but had six turnovers and only three assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Souleymane Wane made two free throws to give UConn a 60-47 lead with 12:06
left. Villanova scored the next three baskets -- a one-handed putback slam by
Ricky Wright, a jump-hook by Allen and a dunk by Brooks Sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Mouring stopped the run with a 3-pointer from the corner, ending his perfect
night from beyond the arc and giving UConn a 63-53 lead with 8:17 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Freeman scored inside, but Sales made a layup and Brian Lynch hit a
3-pointer from the corner to cut it to seven points again, 65-58 with 4:56 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmund Saunders hit a tough turnaround jumper, and El-Amin hit a 3-pointer
to make it 70-60 with 4:24 left and shut the door on Villanova.
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin played hurt in the Huskies' 66-56 victory over Seton Hall on Sunday
after suffering a deep thigh bruise last Thursday against Providence. He was
obviously hobbled, and looked to pass instead of forcing the action and then
made the shot he had to with 3:44 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Buchanan, Villanova's best shooter who averaged 22 points the last two
games, played only nine minutes in the first half and heard a mouthful from
coach Steve Lappas when he went to the bench. He finished 3-for-10 for seven
points.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn made nine straight field goals in the final 8:02 of the first half to
take a 46-34 lead.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi St. 68, No. 22 LSU 66  </HEADLINE>
    By RALPH D. RUSSO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- Derrick Zimmerman hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with
24 seconds left and Mississippi State overcame a 12-point deficit in the final 5
1/2 minutes to beat No. 22 LSU 68-66 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Tang Hamilton had 13 of his 17 points in the second half for the Bulldogs.
Robert Jackson scored 14, all after halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Torris Bright led LSU (16-4, 3-4 Southeastern Conference) with 17. Stromile
Swift had 14, but just two in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   LSU looked to be in control, up 63-51 with 5:30 left, but Mississippi State
went on a 14-0 run. The Bulldogs (12-8, 3-4) took the lead when Hamilton slashed
to the basket for a slam with 1:16 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Jabari Smith tied it for LSU with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   LSU nearly forced a turnover on Mississippi State's next possession, but the
Bulldogs retrieved a loose ball and Marckell Patterson alertly called timeout
with three seconds left on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimmerman caught the inbounds pass from Todd Myles, let it fly from about 26
feet and swished the shot to give Mississippi State a 68-65 lead and cap the
comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Swift made a windmill slam that gave LSU a 47-36 lead and prompted a timeout
by Mississippi State with 15:49 left. Hamilton kept the Bulldogs in the game by
scoring nine straight points.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton's 3-pointer with 11:29 left got the LSU lead down to 52-43 and
started an 8-0 MSU run.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith momentarily restored order for LSU with a hoop that started an 11-3
run that built the lead back to 63-51, but the Tigers went cold offensively
after the spurt.

South Carolina daily newspapers, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 71.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   LIVINGSTON MANOR, N.Y. (AP) -- Lewis A. Head, a longtime Associated Press
reporter and editor in New York and New Jersey, died Jan. 10. He was 87.

	   As an editor in the AP's Newark, N.J., bureau, Head was a mentor to a
generation of young AP journalists that included Victor Simpson, the news
cooperative's Vatican reporter; James Gerstenzang of the Los Angeles Times, and
Chris Connell, former assistant chief of the AP Washington bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert A. Dubill, executive editor of USA Today, said Wednesday, ``He was
one of those dedicated editors who trained a large army of young journalists.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dubill, while AP's New Jersey bureau chief in the early 1970s, gave Head the
assignment to travel the state writing offbeat features and columns.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked as a photo editor at The New York Times from 1936 to 1941 and
joined the AP in 1941.

</P>
<P>
	   He joined the Chronicle as a copy boy in 1949 and was soon promoted to

	   At the peak of the space race, he went to the African nation of Zambia,
where he described how astronauts were being trained by being rolled downhill in

Gil Kane
</P>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Gil Kane, the comic book artist who spent more than half a
century sketching such memorable characters as the Atom, Green Lantern, the
Hulk, Captain Marvel and Spider-Man, died Monday of cancer. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans and collectors revered the work Kane did from 1956 to 1969. During that
period, he redesigned the costumes of Green Lantern and Captain Marvel.
</P>
<P>

other producers of the genre. He illustrated a variety of DC's lines from
mysteries and westerns to Rex the Wonder Dog and science fiction.
</P>
<P>
	   Moving to Marvel, Kane drew the Hulk, Conan the Barbarian, Captain Marvel,
Spider-Man, Captain America, the Avengers and others.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, Kane spent about five years in Los Angeles, working on
animation concepts for Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears. But he soon returned to
comics, illustrating the ``Ring'' for writer Roy Thomas in 1990 and drawing new
versions of Superman and illustrating ``The Edge.''
</P>
<P>

	   Suskind came to Cincinnati General Hospital to complete an internship in

Willie B.
</P>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Willie B., the Zoo Atlanta gorilla who spent 27 years in
isolation with only a caretaker and a television for company before being
introduced to other gorillas and finally becoming a father, died Wednesday. He
was 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Willie had been sick since early January, when he caught the flu and then
contracted pneumonia, which caused stress on his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   The silverback gorilla, named for former Atlanta Mayor William B.
Hartsfield, was captured in Africa and spent more than two decades in a
concrete-and-steel-bars cage at the former Atlanta-Fulton County Zoo. Besides a
caretaker, his only companion was a TV set on a shelf in the corner of the cage.
He played on a tire swing.

	   Willie was one of the first gorillas released into the new habitat in early
1988.

strong-mayor form of government, died Monday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   He was elected to the Toledo City Council in 1955 and became mayor two years
later.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time, council members selected the mayor, and a city manager was the
top government official. Toledo changed to the direct election strong-mayor
system with the election in 1994 of the current mayor, Democrat Carty
Finkbeiner.
Si Zentner
</P>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Si Zentner, the Trombonist who started a highly successful
big band years after the era had passed, died Monday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Zentner became well-known when he recorded the hit ``Up A Lazy River'' in
1961. He went on to record more than 30 albums and hundreds of songs for Liberty
Records.
</P>
<P>
	   He played with the bands of Les Brown and Jimmy Dorsey before settling in
Los Angeles as a session musician.
</P>
<P>
	   Using a revised version of ``Lazy River,'' Zenter recorded what he called
``the first big-band record you could twist to.'' The song became a Top 40 hit
and a Grammy Award winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Zentner recorded hundreds of songs for Liberty, continuing his knack for
recasting contemporary hits into a big-band sound aimed at older ears. During
the James Bond craze he reworked the movies' themes, and when the Beatles
exploded, he recorded a swinging version of ``I Want to Hold Your Hand.''

<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Janet C. Zink, a philanthropist whose volunteer work
ranged from the fine arts to the Girl Scouts, died Monday. She was 60.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- Clifford Robinson bounced back from his All-Star snub to
score a game-high 21 points as the Phoenix Suns beat the Los Angeles Clippers
114-68 Wednesday night for the most lopsided win in nearly 11 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns' 46-point margin of victory matched the second-largest in franchise
history and the largest since they beat Sacramento 140-85 on April 17, 1989
after having beaten San Antonio 137-91 two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers have lost 11 straight road games and 16 of their last 18
overall. Los Angeles was without starting forward Lamar Odom, who did not dress
because of flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson, who was not picked as an All-Star reserve Tuesday despite a
team-best 20.0-point scoring average, was 8-for-15 from the floor over the first
three quarters. Luc Longley was the only Suns starter to play in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta scored 14 points, and Jason Kidd, Anfernee Hardaway and Randy
Livingston had 12 each for the Suns, who have won nine straight against the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyrone Nesby scored 17 and Eric Piatkowski added 10 for the Clippers, who
are 3-21 on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Nesby converted a three-point play with 3:07 left in the first quarter to
pull Los Angeles within 19-17. But the Suns outscored the Clippers 25-5 over the
next 10:03 en route to a 58-32 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers missed their first six shots in the second quarter and were
held scoreless until Piatkowski's 3-pointer with 6:29 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd kept the Suns rolling in the second half, scoring four of Phoenix's
first six points as the Suns opened a 64-34 lead with 9:38 left in the third
quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Nick Van Exel scored 28 points on 10-of-17 shooting Wednesday
night as the Denver Nuggets started strong and never cooled off in a 135-112
victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess added 26 points and 10 rebounds for the Nuggets, who scored
the game's first nine points and shot 63 percent for the game -- including 70
percent in the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing their first game since trading leading scorer Ron Mercer to Orlando
on Tuesday, the Nuggets finished with season highs in field goal percentage,
points and assists (41).
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Allen, named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team Tuesday, led the
Bucks with 22 points, but only four in the second half. Sam Cassell had 21
points and Glenn Robinson finished with 19 for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets, who have won four straight at home and four of five overall,
opened a 36-18 lead in the game's first nine minutes and were never seriously
threatened throughout.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks got as close as 80-73 on a jump shot by Cassell midway through the
third period, but Van Exel scored eight straight points, hitting two 3-pointers
over Cassell, and the lead never went below double figures the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Chris Gatling, acquired Tuesday in the trade that sent
Mercer, Chauncey Billups and Johnny Taylor to Orlando, finished with seven and
nine points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets came out strong from the start, hitting six straight shots to
open the game and scoring a season-high 45 points in the first quarter. Despite
Denver's 64 percent shooting for the half, the Bucks did a good job keeping pace
and trailed just 72-62 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   McDyess had 20 points at the break on 8-of-9 shooting and finished 11-of-15
from the field.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Conn. Crane Collapse  </HEADLINE>
   By DIANE SCARPONI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The steel skeleton of a power plant collapsed at a
construction site Wednesday, killing two workers and trapping a crane operator
for nearly eight hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The crane's cab was partially crushed beneath steel girders and trapped
Robert Fitch, 62, said fire Capt. Robin Tummins.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitch, of North Branford, suffered crush injuries to both legs and
hypothermia from the 20-degree weather, said Dr. Natil Atweh of Bridgeport
Hospital. Fitch was listed in critical but stable condition Wednesday night.
Atweh said he believed both of Fitch's legs could be saved.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency crews handed blankets through an opening in the mound of twisted
metal beams, while workers using welding torches and hand saws cut away chunks
of steel pinning Fitch's chest and legs. He was removed shortly after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The steel frame of the power plant was about 45 feet high at the point of
the collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crane is a big one, and everything came down on top of it,'' Tummins
said. ``It's almost like pickup sticks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other cranes at the site and tow trucks were removing the rubble Wednesday
evening while crane inspectors from the state fire marshal's office surveyed the
site.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men killed in the collapse were identified as Kevin Winslow, 43, of
Newington and Wayne Most, 38, of West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   Another worker, George Scrivner, 36, was hospitalized with injuries that did
not appear life-threatening, said Bonnie Lukacs, spokeswoman for the Hospital of
St. Raphael in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   The power plant was being built for Houston-based El Paso Energy Corp. and
Power Development Co. of Auburn, Mass. The two-year construction project started
in March under the oversight of Black &AMP; Veatch, a consulting engineering firm
based in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman John Allen said an investigation is underway into the
cause of the collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the first priority had been to free the
trapped crane operator, then the investigation could proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really don't have an exact cause of what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Milford is on the Connecticut shoreline, about 60 miles northeast of New
York City.

<HEADLINE> NFL Extends Pro Bowl Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DIPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- The Pro Bowl is staying in Hawaii at least through 2005
under an extension announced Wednesday between the state and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the agreement weren't made public, but it will keep the game in
Hawaii through the 2005 season and removes an option in the old deal that would
have allowed the game to move for one season to Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Under its old contract, the league is to be paid $3.5 million for this
year's game and $4 million for next year. Orlando had an option in that contract
to host the Pro Bowl in 2002 or 2003, but that option is removed with the
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
	   "Orlando definitely wanted the game," Mark Rolfing of the Hawaii Tourism
Authority said. "They made it very public that they did want it. We were looking
at a situation where we needed to do something after the 2001 game and the time
to do it was now."
</P>
<P>
	   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen announced the agreement, and the part-time
Hawaii resident said he was glad the game is staying.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard for me to imagine that we wouldn't have the Pro Bowl in Hawaii,"
Bowlen said. "As far as the NFL is concerned, the players, coaches and everybody
who attends the game love it here."
</P>
<P>
	   Bowlen said owners will vote on the deal in March, and he sees no problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we'll have a 31-0 vote," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawaii Tourism Authority board will vote on the deal next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The new deal also gives the state more tickets for the game, an increase
from 1,000 to 5,000, and will partner the state and NFL in marketing Pro Bowl
vacations, a move the state hopes will help it recoup some of the money it
spends to host the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think there's a huge amount of revenue that we can derive from this
game," Rolfing said. "There are a lot of people who come here for the Pro Bowl.
What we wanted to do was to be able to derive direct revenue from people who
come here for the game."
</P>
<P>
	   The 2000 Pro Bowl is scheduled for Sunday at Aloha Stadium, and is the 21st
game in Hawaii. All but one game -- the 1983 game that followed the
strike-shortened 1992 season -- has been a sellout.

<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Mike Modano scored his 21st goal late in the second period of
a scoreless game and Guy Carbonneau added a third-period short-handed goal as
the Dallas Stars beat the Atlanta Thrashers 2-1 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carbonneau scored his seventh goal, the eventual game-winner at 11:16, when
Blake Sloan's centering pass glanced off Carbonneau's skate, hit the shoulder of
Thrashers defenseman Yannick Tremblay and went into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta's Andrew Brunette made it 2-1 on a deflection with 2:06 to play.
Brunette's 19th goal spoiled rookie goalie Manny Fernandez's bid for his first
career shutout.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez stopped 28 shots, 18 in the third period,
</P>
<P>
	   Modano notched his 332nd career goal at 16:29 of the second, tying him with
Dino Ciccarelli for second in franchise history. Brian Bellows leads with 342.
</P>
<P>
	   Modano brought the puck up center ice, passed to Brett Hull, and Hull sent
it ahead to Modano, who lifted a shot over Norm Maracle from the lower edge of
the right circle. Fernandez was credited with his first career assist on the
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In his last six games, Modano has five goals and four assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars are 5-2 in their last seven games, while the Thrashers are 0-6-2-1
in nine.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the Dallas' key players are out with injuries:
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas, missing Derian Hatcher, Joe Nieuwendyk and Jere Lehtinen with
injuries, held a 13-5 first-period shot advantage. Stars left wing Aaron Gavey
suffered a hyperextended knee in the first period and did not return.

   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Seasonal rains were not enough to ease a drought in
large parts of this east African nation, leaving at least 2 million Kenyans in
need of food aid, the U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday.

situation remains most critical in the north, where inhabitants are suffering
from three successive crop failures as well as drought and floods, the agency

<HEADLINE> Nine Convicted in Argentina Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A tribunal sentenced eight people to life in
prison Wednesday in the death of a crusading journalist, ending a case that
shocked Argentines and drew international outrage.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge panel found three former provincial police officers, a former
security guard and four civilians guilty of conspiring to kill Jose Luis
Cabezas, an investigative photojournalist. A fourth police officer was sentenced
to four years on a fraud charge related to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm comfortable with the decisions handed down by the tribunal,'' Cabezas'
mother, Maria Cristina Robledo, after the verdicts were announced following the
near three-month trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabezas was found dead Jan. 25, 1997, in the glitzy Atlantic coast resort of
Pinamar, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires. He had been handcuffed, beaten, shot
in the head and burned.
</P>
<P>
	   To some, the mafia-style murder was eerily reminiscent of the work of
military death squads during Argentina's 1976-83 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying spurred nationwide rallies, church services and vigils and drew
protest from abroad. Argentine journalists condemned the killing as evidence of
an increasing threat against freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
	   The 36-year-old photographer had been shadowing Alfredo Yabran, a camera-shy
businessman whose links to government officials and vast business empire had
come under question.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his death, Cabezas had published a few photographs of the reclusive
Yabran.
</P>
<P>
	   The businessman immediately became a prime suspect in Cabezas murder case,
along with his chief security guard -- who was among those sentenced to life in
prison Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Yabran, known to be unnerved by Cabezas' coverage of him, repeatedly denied
allegations he was involved in the photographer's death.
</P>
<P>
	   But last year Yabran, who was wanted for questioning, went on the run and
became the focus of a nationwide man hunt. He shot himself to death as police
closed in on him at his country resort last May. A handwritten note left by his
side professed his innocence.

Wednesday.

	   The child was in the back seat of a Chrysler minivan taken from outside

<HEADLINE> Eight Convicted in Argentina Murder  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A tribunal sentenced eight people to life in
prison Wednesday in the death of a crusading journalist, ending a case that
shocked Argentines and drew international outrage.
</P>
<P>
	   A three-judge panel found three former provincial police officers, a former
security guard and four civilians guilty of killing Jose Luis Cabezas, an
investigative photojournalist. A fourth police officer was sentenced to four
years on a fraud charge related to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm comfortable with the decisions handed down by the tribunal,'' Cabezas'
mother, Maria Cristina Robledo, after the verdicts were announced following the
near three-month trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabezas was found dead Jan. 25, 1997, in the glitzy Atlantic coast resort of
Pinamar, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires. He had been handcuffed, beaten, shot
in the head and burned.
</P>
<P>
	   To some, the mafia-style murder was eerily reminiscent of the work of
military death squads during Argentina's 1976-83 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   The slaying spurred nationwide rallies, church services and vigils and drew
protest from abroad. Argentine journalists condemned the killing as evidence of
an increasing threat against freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
	   The 36-year-old photographer had been shadowing Alfredo Yabran, a camera-shy
businessman whose links to government officials and vast business empire had
come under question.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his death, Cabezas had published a few photographs of the reclusive
Yabran.
</P>
<P>
	   The businessman immediately became a prime suspect in Cabezas murder case,
along with his chief security guard -- who was among those sentenced to life in
prison Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Yabran, known to be unnerved by Cabezas' coverage of him, repeatedly denied
allegations he was involved in the photographer's death.
</P>
<P>
	   But last year Yabran, who was wanted for questioning, went on the run and
became the focus of a nationwide man hunt. He shot himself to death as police
closed in on him at his country resort last May. A handwritten note left by his
side professed his innocence.
