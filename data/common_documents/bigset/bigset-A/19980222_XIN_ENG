<HEADLINE> More U.S. Computer Makers Sell Products Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 20 (Xinhua) -- While American customers
are becoming more comfortable buying clothing and books online,
analysts said that they have not yet begun making major purchases.
</P>
<P>
Websites offering advice about cars, computers and travel have
expanded over the past two years in the United States. Customers
do their research on the Net and go to stores to pick up things
they want to buy. But this is beginning to change. More and more
businesses have started to realized that the Internet can be
a cheaper method of selling products.
</P>
<P>
Major computer makers, such as Apple Computer Inc., Compaq
Computer Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., are selling their products
over the Web. Dell Computer Corp. boasts of more than four million
U.S. dollars worth of products and services sold over the Internet
each day.
</P>
<P>
For a time, IBM seems not to envious, lavishing money on television
ads touting its E-commerce software suite. Now it also plans to
start selling PCs over the Web. One IBM senior executive said
recently that the manufacturer intended to offer a way for
customers to configure and order computers via its Website in
the "near future." In fact, the decision is part of a larger
initiative to improve the performance of the PC company, which now
ranks second in worldwide market share behind Compaq and ahead of
Dell and NEC.
</P>
<P>
IBM has resisted taking this step for fear it might alienate
the company's resellers. However, under the proposed plan,
resellers will ship the products to customers in a move designed
to undercut any possible opposition from its distribution channel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the kinds of customers who buy computers over
the Web tend to be experienced users shopping for price and
performance. It's still unclear whether the popularity of
Web-based PC sales will transfer into major incremental gains in
the business for computer makers.
</P>
<P>
With ever-increasing online sales, banks, credit card companies
and businesses will have to figure out better ways to communicate
with each other. Analysts say it may take some time for those
issues to be settled. The adoption of the Security Electronic
Transaction (SET) specification used to verify all the parties
engaged in a credit card purchase, for instance, is at least a
year away.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Visits UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh arrived here Saturday on a three-day visit, mainly
for discussions on the lastest developments in the Gulf region,
especially the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates' official Wam news agency said Saleh
is expected to hold talks with President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan
Al-Nahyan and other senior officials on "the latest developments
in the Gulf" and "ways of strengthening bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Wam gave no further details, but informed sources here said his
visit will focus on the current Iraq-U.N. crisis triggered by
Iraq's refusal to grant full access to U.N. weapons inspectors to
sites suspected of containing chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threaten a military strike if
diplomatic efforts fail to persuade Baghdad to open up suspected
sites to U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Yemen was cautious to make its stand clear towards the
U.S. war talks, but the UAE has openly opposed the use of force
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Yemen was treated coldly by the UAE and other Gulf Arab states
- all anti-Iraq allies of the U.S. in the 1990-91 crisis - in the
past seven years due to its sympathy for the Iraqi authority. It
began to seek ways of improving ties with the Gulf neighbors after
the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Sanaa has applied to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a
political, economic and defense alliance formed by the Gulf Arab
countries in 1981, but the GCC has so far given no reply.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Thailand Wish to Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 21 (Xinhua) --Senior officials of Vietnam and
Thailand expressed confidence Saturday that Southeast Asia would
continue being the most dynamic region in the world once the
financial crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Manh Cam Saturday met with visiting Thai Prime Minister Office
Director Somboon Rahong in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam News Agency (VNA), Rahong said, "The thai
business people always consider Vietnam a reliable and attractive
investment venue."
</P>
<P>
He said political stability, timely adjustment of the
government, and qualification of the workforce in Vietnam
attracted Thai investors.
</P>
<P>
The Thai official admitted that the current financial crisis
produced adverse impacts on Thailand's investment in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) would strengthen solidarity to solve the aftermath
caused by the current regional financial crisis, and make hostile
schemes designed by outside forces null and void.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should strive to boost bilateral ties to
become a good model for other members of ASEAN, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam expressed his deep sympathy to the Thai
government and people's difficulties caused by the financial
crisis and hoped that Thailand and other regional countries would
soon get rid of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister affirmed the Thai official that
Vietnam always pursues a foreign policy of independence and
sovereignty. Cooperation should be boosted on the principle of
respecting each other's national sovereignty and free from
outside imposition, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cam said more than ever before, it is now time for ASEAN
countries to enhance mutual solidarity, cooperation and assistance
for development since a prosperous nation will add strength to its
region, and a prosperous region will add strength to the world.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Thailand share great potential to accelerate their
comprehensive cooperation in the interest of each nation and for
stability and development in the region, he added.

UNITED NATIONS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan remained optimistic about his efforts to head off U.S.
military strikes against Iraq as he resumed his talks with Iraqi
officials, U.N. officials said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is now in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on a critical
mission to peacefully resolve the Iraqi crisis, held talks for
more than three hours earlier in the day with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz and other Iraqi officials, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"I am still optimistic," the U.N. chief said after briefing
diplomats on his talks.
</P>
<P>
But no details of the talks were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Annan was holding an evening round of talks with Aziz, the

DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Air Tanzania Corporation
(ATC) has hired one Boeing 737-730 from a Mexican airline, TASEA, in
an effort to improve its flight services.
</P>
<P>
The ATC Public Relations Officer, Innocent Mungy told reporters
Saturday in Dar es Salaam that the aircraft has a carrying capacity of
130 passengers and is expected to arrive in Tanzania next week.
</P>
<P>
The flight will be used for both local and international flights,
Mungy said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the corporation has expanded its international
flights to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique, there
is need to hire planes in order to survive in the cut-throat
competition.
</P>
<P>
" We are expecting to start our flights to the Democratic Republic
of Congo, particularly to Goma and Luxbumbashi towns, and the famous
tourism town of Pemba in Mozambique, a situation which forces us to
have a good aircraft," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mungy said that flights to Pemba are expected to start next month
and those to Goma and Luxbumbashi are scheduled to take off early April.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Wants Joint Projects to Harness Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian delegation left here
Saturday for the Rwandan capital Kigali to attend a five-day
conference on the Nile river, scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Public Works and Water
Resources Ahmed Fahmi, who led the team, told reporters before
departure that the conference will deal with ways of overcoming
problems facing the Nile Basin countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will submit a working paper expounding its water policy,
means of upgrading regional cooperation on the use of the Nile
water and the possibility of launching projects to make optimal
use of the river, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin countries - Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda,
Rwanda, Eritrea, Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia - hold a
conference every year to address the Nile water problems.
</P>
<P>
There are differences among those countries over development
projects on the river, with some claiming that the water projects
have infringed on their rights.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been accused of consuming more than its due by
setting up ambitious projects to irrigate deserts into arable
land. But it rejected the charge and urged the Nile countries to
launch joint ventures for their common good, instead of coming up
with a new Nile agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Nile countries are bounded by an agreement signed in 1959
as regards how much water they are entitled to, but some are
asking to amend it.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Egypt has access to 55.5 billion cubic
meters of Nile water, which accounts for 99 percent of its sweet
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, eager to revise the 1959 agreement, has suspended the
joint meetings between its water experts and those of Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Annan, Aziz Start Second Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan entered into a second round of talks Saturday evening with
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to find a diplomatic way of
the Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
After they finished the first round of talks earlier Saturday,
U.N. spokesman said that their talks were constructive, but
refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Friday evening, is expected to hold
talks Sunday directly with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if his
talks with Aziz go on well.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said upon arrival in Baghdad that he is
"reasonably optimistic" that he can find a solution to the crisis
in order to avert a military confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
But the United States has been reiterating that it may reject
any deal reached between Annan and Iraq that does not meet
U.S. demand and relevant U.N. resolutions on eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to an allegation made by U.S. President Bill
Clinton that one of Saddam's palaces was "about the size of
Washington D.C.," some 162 square kilometers, a U.N. technical
team which surveyed eight Iraqi presidential sites said Friday all
the eight sites altogether comprise an area of 31.5 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been accusing Iraq of concealing weapons of mass
destruction in those presidential sites and demanding free access
by U.N. arms inspectors to those areas declared "off-limits" by
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of Arab support for Iraqi people, a delegation of the
United Arab Emirates Red Cross Society Saturday arrived in Baghdad
on board a plane carrying 40 tonnes of medicines and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
With talks between Annan and Aziz going on, eleven U.N. arms
inspection teams carried out their work smoothly Saturday and
inspected nine sites, said an Iraqi official. The Iraqi side was
very cooperative, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a technical team of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which arrived in Baghdad last week, proceeded with its
meetings Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit here is seen as a "last-ditch" effort to bring
about a political and diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis. The
U.S. said a military strike can come at any time if diplomacy
fails to secure Saddam's compliance.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Residents Spend a Day without Power, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of
Zanzibar residents Saturday endured sweatering heat and a
breakdown of water supply following a day-long power
interruption, said a report reaching here from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
State Fuel and Power Generation (SFPC) attributed power
interruption to major technical repairs made at Ras Kilomoni on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar isles in the Indian Ocean are connected to the
national power grid, receiving electricity via a submarine cable
from the mainland of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Business came to a standstill while most residents went out of
doors in anticipation of some cool sea breeze.
</P>
<P>
Women and children in almost all residential areas in the
Zanzibar municipality were seen rushing here and there in search
of water as taps went dry immediately after 9 a.m. when power was
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
Shopping proved a nightmare as customers grope into darkness.
Major hospitals in the Zanzibar municipality have suspended
operations due to lack of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar urban residents get water supply from natural springs
at Chunga, Mwanyanya, Bweleo and Kijitoupele by use of
electricity-powered pumping machines.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses Japan to Play Bigger Role in Asia Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- America pressed Japan to play a
bigger role in helping Asia recover in a G-7 meeting of finance
ministers and central bankers which opens here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an hour-long bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G-7
gathering, U.S. Treasury Secretary Rober Rubin delivered a stern
warning to his Japanese counterpart, Hikaru Matsunaga, reminding
him that Japan's measures to stimulate growth at home were simply
not good enough.
</P>
<P>
Rubin expressed his concern that "the Japanese economy is weak
and the Japanese external surplus is increasing," a Treasury
official told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, Hikaru Matsunaga told Rubin that Japan's
first priority now was to pass the 1998/99 budget, a Japanese
Ministry of Finance source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, it was believed that the ministers agreed that the
Asian crisis "makes strong domestic demand-led growth especially
important in all G-7 countries."
</P>
<P>
The issue of what Tokyo can do to help its neighbors by
stimulating demand at home has taken center state at Saturday's
meeting. The U.S. and its European partners maintain that
strengthening Japan's economy is the key to recovery in the entire
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Japan is considering calling for a common
currency system for Asia as part of its plan to support Asian
economies affected by the recent currency crisis.

<HEADLINE> G-7 ECAs' Joint Statement in Support of Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The G-7 ECAs (export credit
agencies) and their relevant national authorities approved a
practical and immediate initiative to help stabilize the Asian
market.
</P>
<P>
This initiative will allow for continued trade flows that will
benefit the economies and support employment of all involved
countries, according to a joint statement released at a meeting of
G-7 finance ministers here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Export credit agencies have a unique role in international
trade and are positioned to support and supplement the financing
of trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Given the fundamental long-term strength of the Asian
economies, the reform programs being adopted by a number of
affected countries, and the commitments which the ECAs already
have in the region, the G-7 ECAs believe that there is a strong
case and need to maintain trade finance support to the region.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ECAs supported some 15 billion U.S. dollars of
short-term credits to Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand alone.
</P>
<P>
The initiative builds on existing G-7 ECA programs and each
agency will continue to operate under its independent rules and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, these G-7 ECAs noted they remain open for medium-
and long-term creditworthy business.
</P>
<P>
In pursuing this multi-lateral initiative, the G-7 ECAs
recognize the importance of working with Asian nations in
overcoming current difficulties in order to maintain trade flows
and foster stable long-term growth.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advises Americans to Quickly Leave Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
Saturday advised U.S. citizens to leave Iraq as soon as possible,
sending another sign that a military attack on Iraq may be
imminent.
</P>
<P>
"While diplomatic options have not been exhausted, the
government of Iraq continues to make provocative and
confrontational statements indicating its unwillingness to comply
with U.N. resolutions," the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
"Due to these ongoing tensions, all U.S. citizens are strongly
urged to avoid all travel to Iraq, and those already in Iraq are
advised to depart as soon as possible," it added.
</P>
<P>
The State Department could not say how many U.S. citizens are
in Iraq, but it was reported that the number would be small as
there is no U.S. embassy in Baghdad and severe restrictions
prevented U.S. businessmen from going to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also warned, in a memorandum, Saturday that
journalists who stay in Iraq may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
"You should be aware that there is substantial risk involved in
sending people to Iraq during a period that could be highly
dangerous," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to minimize civilian casualties; however,
the safety of any particular group of people, including
journalists, could be jeopardized in the event of military
action," it added.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the State Department advised dependents and
non-emergency staff from U.S. diplomatic missions in Kuwait and
Israel to leave the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The warnings were made at a time when United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan was in Baghdad to avert the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he remained optimistic as he sought a diplomatic
solution to the confrontation over Iraqi restrictions on U.N.
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The United States is threatening to attack unless Iraq gives
the inspectors free access to all sites.

<HEADLINE> Anti-US Sentiments on Rise in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Arab journalists on Saturday
staged a sit-in and issued furious statements against the
U.S. government and its threat to bomb Baghdad to end the
Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
During the four-hour sit-in organized by the Egyptian Press
Syndicate, journalists set fire to American and Israeli flags in
front of its premises.
</P>
<P>
They chanted slogans against what they called "arrogance and
double-standard in dealing with Israel and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Arab Affairs Committee at the organization also decided on
Saturday to declare a "Week of Solidarity" with the Iraqi people
soon.
</P>
<P>
This week will feature a photo exhibition and a video session
portraying the suffering of the Iraqi children, women and the
elderly caused by the embargo imposed more than seven years, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the event, a number of meetings will be held by
those concerned with the cause of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cairo-based Arab Journalists Federation issued a
statement here Saturday, appealing to the international community
for utmost efforts to avert a military strike against Iraq and to
show solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The federation criticized the U.S. policy for seeking to
convert the United Nations into a tool to serve its policies based
on "hegemony, arrogance and double standard."
</P>
<P>
"While the U.S. is amassing a huge military force to strike
Iraq for the alleged possession of biological weapons, it rejects
any attempt to discuss Israel's arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Washington to re-consider its policies that
"raise tension in the region" and to respond to international and
Arab diplomacy aiming at reaching a peaceful settlement of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been speeding up its military buildup in the
Gulf in preparation for a strike if diplomatic moves fail to bring
an end to the crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in Baghdad Friday in
a last-ditch effort to persuade Iraq to give arms inspectors free
and complete access to all sites suspected of hiding secret
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The past few days saw a surge of protests by students,
intellectuals and politicians against American military
muscle-flexing.
</P>
<P>
Although people differ on how much Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein is to blame for the crisis, there is a consensus of anger
against what they deem as America's "aggressive intentions."
</P>
<P>
According to a public opinion survey published by Al Arabi, the
mouthpiece of opposition Nasserist Democratic Party, 79 percent of
Egyptians polled are against any form of U.S. military action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed 61 percent believed that the aim of the
strike would be to support Israel and 75 percent called for an
Arab summit to discuss the issue.

<HEADLINE> Three Former Zairean Generals Leave S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Three former Zairean
generals, whose extradition was demanded by the Kinshasa
government, have left South Africa for an unknown destination,
Reuters quoted sources as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the three -- former defense minister
Mavua Mudima, former presidential guard commander Nzimbi Nzale
and former army chief of staff Baramoto Kpama -- left South
Africa last week by road.
</P>
<P>
The generals of late Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko were
accused by Kinshasa of plotting to kill President Laurent Kabila,
whose forces overthrew Mobutu last May and renamed the country
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The generals, who had been living in South Africa since
Mobutu's fall, were arrested last December on charges of entering
the country with false documents. They were released later
without any charges by a Pretoria judge.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted senior security and military officers in
Kinshasa as saying that they were aware of the generals'
departure but had no knowledge of their destination.
</P>
<P>
"We know they have left South Africa. But we are still trying
to verify their new home of exile," a senior commander in
Kinshasa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At least this ends our standoff with South Africa. Our job
now is to find out where these guys have gone because they are
always plotting against us," another source said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hopes Annan to End Iraqi Crisis Politically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Saturday expressed the hope that the visit of U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan would lead to a political solution
to the ongoing Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi told
visiting Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin
Alawi Bin Abdullah that military operations should be replaced by
political understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that cooperation between Baghdad and Annan
would lead to the implementation of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and avert "any unfavorable event in Iraq as well as
the region."
</P>
<P>
Annan is currently in Baghdad to mediate a political solution
to the standoff between the U.N. and the Iraqi government over
arms inspections and to avoid a U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Despite Washington's continuous threat to attack Iraq, Tehran
believed that it was possible to solve the Iraqi issue through
Annan's mission.
</P>
<P>
As Iraq's neighbor and chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, Iran encouraged Annan to visit Iraq and said
it would actively contribute to finding a peaceful solution,
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that resort to war will not be in the interests
of anyone, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Omani official said that his country is also
interested in solving the crisis through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the two sides underlined the need for Iraq
to cooperate with the U.N chief to implement the U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Omani official arrived here earlier Saturday for a one-day
visit and left here for home after delivering a message from Omani
Sultan Qaboos Bin Said to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Sign Fishing Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An intergovernment agreement on
fishing cooperation on the South Kuril islands was signed here
Saturday by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and
Japanese Foreign Minister Keydzo Obuti, according to the Interfax.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hoped that the agreement will promote bilateral
economic cooperation, there will be no more illegally fishing and
people will be able to work safely in the area.
</P>
<P>
The report said the agreement defines the areas and rules of
fishing for Japanese fishermen around the South Kurils on a
commercial basis and the control mechanism over the observation of
Japan's quotas.
</P>
<P>
It said that in 1998 Japanese fishermen are allowed to catch
about 2,300 tons of walleye pollack and raps and 120 tons of
octopuses in the area.
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not give any quotas for catching the
Kamchatka crab because its resources are exhausted, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
After almost three years of negotiations, Russia and Japan
reached in December 1997 a final agreement to sign an accord on
cooperation in fishing off the South Juril Islands.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is for the first time in about 50 years of the
Russia-Japanese dispute over whom they belong to to define rules
of cooperation in the area.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Territorial Goal in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has said it has no
territorial ambitions in playing a leading role in peacekeeping
operations in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
With the belief that "we should do whatever we can to assist
our neighbors", Nigeria involved itself actively in peacekeeping
in both Liberia and Sierra Loene, said Nigeria's Chief of Defense
Staff Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The successful peacekeeping operations have put an end to the
seven-year civil war in Liberia and brought down the military
junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The achievements helped Nigeria's neighbors change their
previous resentment against it because they had realized that
Nigeria had no territorial goals, Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, now on an official assignment in New York, said over
the weekend that Nigeria's involvement in west African affairs had
been guided by its concern for peace and tranquility in the
sub-region, the Nigeria News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos on Friday, Chief of Navy Staff Okhai
Akhigbe also denied any imperialist motive in the foray into
Sierra Leone of the Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG, which last week ousted the junta.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have territorial ambition or any desire to dominate
any country within our sub-region," the officer said.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Army Experts Blow Up Belfast Car Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland army technical
officers carried out a controlled explosion on a car bomb in west
Belfast Saturday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
It was discovered near a black taxi at Norglen Parade in the
Turf Lodge area late in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The new discovery stepped up the strain on Northern Ireland
peace efforts after the suspension of Sinn Fein from negotiations
Friday and a huge blast outside a small town police station. Seven
police officers and four civilians were wounded by Friday night's
blast in the town of Moira near Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), was expelled from the talks for two week until March 9 as a
punishment for the IRA's involvement in two killings last week.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for Friday night's
explosion. But Ronnie Flanagan, the province's police chief,
accused unidentified Republicans of the bomb attack in Moira.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it is the work of Republican extremists. Exactly
what organization is responsible, it is too soon to say at this
stage," Flanagan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein in turn accused pro-British Protestant extremists of
planting Saturday's bomb. Reports said the taxi with bombs inside
was owned by a former Republican prisoner who had been targeted
before.
</P>
<P>
Despite the two incidents in Northern Ireland over the past two
days, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said the IRA cease-fire -- a
condition for Sinn Fein's admission to the talks -- remained
intact.

</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from east and central
African countries, in a communique published here Saturday, reaffirmed
their determination to find a lasting solution to the conflict in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day conference on Burundi, the leaders agreed
to continue to implement all previous decisions including those
concerning sanctions on the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders pledged to review the sanctions if the
conditions matured, and an all-party talk was recommended under
the auspices of Julius Nyerere, the facilitator of the Burundi
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The sixth regional summit held in Kampala Saturday was
attended by heads of state and government from Uganda, Kenya,
Tanzania, Zambia, Ethiopia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, Tanzania's former president, Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of Africa Unity, and
representatives from Zimbabwe, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic
of Congo were also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Buyoya, President of Burundi, briefed the conference on
the political situation in Burundi and various steps taken by his
government to meet the decisions made by the fifth summit held in
Dar-es-Salaam in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
After a review of the situation in Burundi, the leaders noted
that there was no significant improvement in the political
situation in the country and agreed that there is no alternative
to a negotiated solution to the problem in the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Official trade links between Burundi and its neighbour
countries have been cut since the sanction was imposed in July
1996 to punish the coup that brought Buyoya to power.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the mountainous country is still going on almost
every day.

<HEADLINE> Annan Expects to Meet Saddam Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan expected to meet Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein Sunday for talks on diplomatic solutions on the
Iraqi crisis, U.N. officials here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the officials said that the U.N. chief, who arrived in
Baghdad Friday for a critical peace mission to avert the
threatened U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq, could not set
the time of his meeting with the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
Annan began his official meetings Saturday morning at the Iraqi
Foreign Ministry. Half of the three-hour morning session was
devoted to a private meeting between Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"We started well. It's not easy," Annan told reporters at the
state guest house where he is staying.
</P>
<P>
"We still have quite a lot of work to do, but had a good
meeting," he said of his morning talks with Iraqi leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general said he expected to get a document
and an agreement out of his weekend diplomacy in the Iraqi
capital.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to report his visit to the U.N. Security
Council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Annan's trip to Baghdad was widely believed to be the
last-ditch effort to seek a peaceful solution to the weapons
inspection crisis in Iraq, France said Saturday that Anna's talks
in Baghdad may not be the last attempt.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that Annan's
mission could be a clear success or a total failure, but could
also produce a compromise which the Security Council would have to
accept or reject.

<HEADLINE> Bonn, Paris, Warsaw Pledge to Deepen Trilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
POZNAN, Poland, February 21 (Xinhua) -- France, Germany and
Poland Saturday pledged to intensify trilateral cooperation after
a summit meeting of French President Jacques Chirac, his Polish
counterpart Alexander Kwasniewski and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the summit in the western
Pleit of PKnan, Kwasniewski said that the three countries had
agreed not only to continue their existing political and economic
cooperation, but also to promote cultural contacts among young
people of the three nations.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the historical significance of the summit,
which is the first one since the foreign ministers of three
countries started in 1991 in the eastern German city of Weimar the
so-called Weimar Triangle mechanism to conduct regular
consultations, and first of all to pave the way for Poland's
integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers of the three countries have also started
to meet regular meetings every year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said that experience gathered from the regular
trilateral contacts was very important for European integration.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, both Kohl and Chirac
stressed that Bonn and Paris want Poland to join NATO and the EU
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed the hope that trilateral cooperation
among Paris, Bonn and Warsaw could become a driving force behind
European integration in the future.
</P>
<P>
Poland was among the three Eastern European countries which was
invited to join NATO in 1999, which still needs approval by the
parliaments of all current NATO members.
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the five Eastern European countries with
which the EU is due to start membership negotiations at the end of
March this year.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told reporters that Germany and France would continue to
help Poland during the integration process, but he also stressed
that Poland should first of all make its own efforts to meet the
necessary conditions for joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the upcoming summit between himself,
Chirac and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Kohl stressed that the
summit was not meant to direct against anybody.
</P>
<P>
It was in the interests of Europe as well as the United States
to make all efforts to ensure that democracy and market economic
reforms would prevail in Russia at a time of dramatic changes,
Kohl said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan is interested in
promoting Russia's economic reforms and ready to help Russia enter
the world economic system, in particular the APEC and the WTO, the
Japanese embassy in Moscow has said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax received Saturday the report dealing with the
implementation of the Hashimoto-Yeltsin plan developed at the
informal summit in Krasnoyarsk last November.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in order to promote Russia's admission
to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation organization (APEC)
Russian experts dealing with APEC matters will be invited to Japan
in March.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, full-scale bilateral talks on admission to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) are expected to be held.
Besides, Japan is considering to offer further technical
assistance in the matter.
</P>
<P>
As for the Russian reforms, Japan will continue steps launched
in November 1997 to cushion the terms of foreign trade insurance
in Russia. For instance, it plans to significantly reduce
insurance rates for Russia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy report also said that Tokyo is drafting an
agreement on the protection of Japanese investments in Russia. The
first round of talks on such an agreement was held in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
It said last December investment contracts totaling 3.39
million U.S. dollars were signed on three projects involving small
and medium-sized companies in the Russian Far East and Eastern
Siberia.

<HEADLINE> Liberian President Amends Relations with ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor is trying to amend relations with the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), which has helped end his country's
seven-year civil war and ousted the military junta in neighboring
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Liberia has recalled its ambassador to Nigeria in
protest over ECOMOG's arrest of 25 senior junta officials
arriving in Liberia in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government regarded it as a violation of its
sovereignty and demanded ECOMOG hand over the helicopter and
junta officials.
</P>
<P>
The action has led to speculations that other junta leaders
still at large might seek refuge in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a statement of the ECOMOG high command
based in the capital Monrovia, Taylor has assured that the
Liberian government will arrest the junta leader Johnny Paul
Koroma if he enters Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued on Friday quoted Taylor as saying that
the decision was necessary because "Liberia is a member of ECOWAS
(Economic Community of West African States), which is working to
ensure that peace returns in Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
This is the latest official position of the Liberian
government on the Sierra Leonean crisis since it complained
ECOMOG's arrest of the fleeing junta officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the British Broadcasting Corporation Saturday,
Taylor has held talks with ECOMOG force Commander Timothy Shelpidi
on bilateral relations and the
development in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting held over the weekend, Taylor impressed
upon ECOMOG the urgent need to screen thousands of Sierra Leonean
refugees streaming into northern Liberia daily.
</P>
<P>
He then sent an appeal to the United Nations and the
international community to rush to the aid of the more than
100,000 Sierra Leoneans who entered northern Liberia as a result
of the latest military situation.

<P>
The refugees are in dire need of food and safe drinking water,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also called on the ECOMOG high command to bridge the
communication gap between the Liberian authorities and the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has had friction with ECOMOG for some
time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it had opposed to ECOMOG's use of its territory to
launch attack on the military junta in Sierra Leone and asked the
peacekeeping force to leave Liberia.
</P>
<P>
It is also against the planned ECOMOG involvement in the
restructuring and training of the country's post-war army.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has also been accused of sending his former warring factional
fighters to help the junta in its fight against ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> Berger: Military Preparations Go Ahead Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger said Saturday that U.S. military preparations are
proceeding without regard to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
talks with Iraqi officials over settlement of the weapons
inspection crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that U.S. military preparations are proceeding
without regard to these talks," Berger said after meeting with
President Bill Clinton and his top foreign policy advisers for
more than 90 minutes in the Oval Office Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
And his remarks to reporters came as hundreds of anti-war
demonstrators gathered in a park across the street from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly whenever there is military action, it provokes and
evokes strong feelings on the part of many people," Berger said,
underscoring that the United States was going ahead with plans for
air strikes on Iraq despite Annan's last-ditch diplomatic mission.
</P>
<P>
Berger said Annan, in Baghdad meeting with the Iraqi officials,
has been charged with pressing two fundamental conditions to
ending the standoff over the weapons inspections: access to all
sites and total control of the inspection process by the U.N.
Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
"There could be details that would not undermine those two
objectives that we would not object to," he added.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Saturday no signs are
evident that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants to resolve the
crisis "in a peaceful fashion."
</P>
<P>
"There continue to be provocative statements issued from
Baghdad and no indication of a complete willingness to resolve
this in a peaceful fashion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the State Department issued a warning to Americans in
Iraq to "depart as soon as possible." The Pentagon also sent a
memo to U.S. news executives alerting them to potential dangers
that journalists could face in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges More Health Care for Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday called for an end to the disparity in the health of the
country's minorities, who suffer from some diseases more than five
times the rate of white Americans.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton announced measures that
include spending 400 million dollars over five years in an effort
to improve the health of minorities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We must not be blind to the alarming fact that
too many Americans do not share in the fruits of our progress, and
nowhere are the divisions of race and ethnicity more sharply drawn
than in the health of our people."
</P>
<P>
He said infant mortality rates are twice as high for
African-Americans as for white Americans, and African-American men
suffer from heart disease at nearly twice the rates of whites.
</P>
<P>
African-Americans are more likely to die from breast cancer and
prostate cancer, and overall cancer fatalities are
disproportionately high among both Latinos and blacks, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
There are similar disparities among native Americans and some
Asian-Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Research shows that overall all these groups are
less likely to be immunized against disease, less likely to be
routinely tested for cancer, less likely to get regular checkups."
</P>
<P>
The president's five-point plan includes a new outreach
campaign led by newly-confirmed Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher,
more than 400 million dollars to develop new approaches to address
racial and ethnic health disparities, a new foundation/public
sector collaboration to address disparities, more effective ways
to target existing federal programs to address health disparities,
and a national challenge to involve communities, foundations,
advocacy organizations, and businesses to develop ways to target
racial and ethnic health disparities.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects UN Call to Open Border to Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Saturday flatly
rejected an appeal by the United Nations to open its borders for
refugees fleeing a possible military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for us to let them in," Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit was quoted by the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit's remark was in response to a call made last week by
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, requesting the neighboring
countries of Iraq not to shut their doors to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that large numbers of Iraqi Kurds might
pour into southern Turkey if the U.S. troops launched a
large-scale military strike against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no need to concern," Ecevit said, "Turkey has the
capability to protect them just across its borders."
</P>
<P>
Turkish government forces have reportedly been deployed along
the Turkish-Iraqi borders in case of any emergency.
</P>
<P>
It was also said that some Turkish military and civilian
personnel had been sent to northern Iraq to establish "observation
posts" for a possible flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier that Ankara was ready to
provide necessary humanitarian aid to those Iraqis who might surge
toward the border in the event of a U.S. military operation.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports had said that Turkish government intended
to build a "security zone" in northern Iraq aimed at curbing the
infiltration of militants of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
which is outlawed in Turkey for their separatist struggle. The
reports, however, were denied by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old war against the Turkish
government for an independent state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
As a neighbor of Iraq, Turkey has called on Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to comply fully with the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions to avert a U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders has time and again said that Turkey does not
want to see a new war breaks out in this region, stressing that
more efforts should be made to find a diplomatic solution to the
current crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey suffered huge economic losses as a result of the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War,
which drove Saddam's troops out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Annan Holds Lengthy Talks With Iraqi Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan held lengthy talks Saturday night local time with Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz in an intense effort to seek a
diplomatic way out of the U.S.-Iraq standoff over the weapons
inspection, informed U.N. sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the second round of its kind in the day, lasted
three hours, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials accompanying the U.N. chief's mission told
reporters that they were optimistic about the outcome of Annan's
mediation in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who flew in to the Iraqi capital Friday, is struggling
to avert threatened U.S. and British military strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He is trying to persuade Baghdad to grant U.N. arms inspectors
unrestricted access to eight Iraqi "presidential sites." He has
made clear to Iraqi leaders that any accord would have to include
two key elements.
</P>
<P>
These were full compliance with U.N. resolutions and no
dilution of the role of the U.N. Special Commission charged with
scrapping prohibited Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Annan told reporters after his three-hour morning talks with
the Iraqi leaders that they "started well."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the talks had been substantive, the U.N. chief said,
"Yes, that's why I say I'm rather optimistic."
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped there would be an agreement from his talks to
open all suspected weapons sites.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Iran for Brotherly Ties With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday that the Iranian nation
seeks no war, but brotherly relations with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Khamenei
made the remark in a meeting with a group of residents of Iranian
islands in the Persian Gulf in Bandar Abbas, capital of the
southern province of Hormozgan.
</P>
<P>
"We feel brotherly towards the nations and countries of the
region and insist that they feel and value our brotherhood," he
said, adding that "Islamic Iran seeks security and exaltation for
all Muslim states in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that exaltation of the Muslim world would be possible
only through unity, which is the "secret of the victories of the
Iranian nation."
</P>
<P>
This was yet another signal of goodwill the Iranian leadership
sent to the Gulf Arab neighbors. Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani is on a landmark visit to Saudi Arabia as part of the
effort to improve relations with Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who chairs Iran's powerful State Expediency
Council, is accompanied on the visit by ministers of agriculture,
oil and labor and Majlis (parliament) members to discuss issues of
the Muslim world and cooperation among regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Gulf states cooled down after
Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979 but warmed up last year
following the election of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
who underlined friendly relations with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Khamenei attacked foreign military presence
in the region, saying that "enemies of Islam" have always tried to
portray the region as insecure or render it as such in order to
legitimize their presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, Iran manages, through its might, to
achieve and maintain security for itself and seeks security for
all the regional states.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Sue Against Census Sampling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S.
House of Representatives have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the
Census Bureau from using statistical sampling as part of the
population count in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court, alleges that
sampling "is prohibited by the Constitution, which requires that
an `actual enumeration' be obtained by `counting the whole number
of persons in each state.'"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a letter House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a
Republican, urged President Bill Clinton to join the Republicans
in seeking a prompt ruling on the merits of the suit, rather than
resort to "technical justiciability arguments" that could delay a
decision until after it is too late to affect the census.
</P>
<P>
But Commerce Department general counsel Andrew Pincus said the
administration is obligated to challenge the suit if it falls
outside the jurisdiction of the courts, and that the
constitutional issue is being weighed by attorneys.
</P>
<P>
However, Pincus said, "We look forward to proving the legality
of sampling in court."
</P>
<P>
The legal action is the latest development in a politically
charged attempt by the Republicans to force the administration to
abandon sampling in the Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau officials want to use statistical sampling to
adjust for expected errors in the head count, particularly as it
affects minorities.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans argued that sampling is unconstitutional.
Republicans reportedly fear that if sampling is used, their
majority in the House could be affected when census figures are
used to redraw legislative district lines in several states before
the 2002 elections.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Unable to Increase Oil Output: Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi diplomat said Saturday
that Baghdad is unable to increase oil output before its
infrastructure is repaired, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"At present Iraq can not sell more than 4 billion dollars worth
of oil (every six months) due to damages made to its refineries
and oil fields by the long embargo imposed on Baghdad," Iraq's
permanent representative to the Arab League Nabil Nejm was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If oilfields, refineries and pumps were not repaired, Iraq
could not increase its oil sales," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to ease the humanitarian situation in Iraq, the
U.N. Security Council voted Friday to allow Baghdad to more than
double the amount of oil it can sell under the U.N. oil-for-food
plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution passed unanimously by the 15-member
council, Iraq is allowed to sell up to 5.2 billion dollars worth
of oil every six months, from the present 2 billion.
</P>
<P>
"We do not reject the draft but Iraq simply does not possess
the ability to increase oil pumping operations," Nejm explained.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, began in December l996, permits Iraq to
use part the proceeds to buy food and medicines for its 22 million
people suffering from crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad first rejected raising the ceiling of the oil-for-food
deal, demanding instead the embargo be removed altogether.
However, the sanctions can only be lifted after Iraq is certified
to have eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi diplomat, Baghdad is also objecting to
the fact that the U.N., rather than Iraqi government, is taking
charge of the allocation of the oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
"According to Security Council resolution 987, Iraq should
prepare the plan of proceeds distribution, but the U.N. Sanctions
Committee and the U.S. seem to dodge this resolution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new oil-for-food proposal can not be implemented until Iraq
submits a distribution plan to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
is in Baghdad to find a peaceful solution to Iraq's standoff with
the U.N. over weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Striking Plan Against Iraq Approved Four Weeks Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and his top military and foreign policy advisers have approved an
intense, four-day, round-the-clock bombardment, The New York Times
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, aimed at undermining the Iraqi military apparatus and
diminishing its ability to produce and deliver biological and
chemical weapons, was passed at a meeting chaired by Clinton on
January 24, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon planners have named the military campaign "Desert
Thunder."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the planning was framed by several
considerations, including the assumption that Iraq would never
give the inspectors the full access they need to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The bombing salvos would pound Iraq's air defense, fighter
planes, command posts, missile factories, Republican Guard
compounds, intelligence headquarters and sites that can produce
chemicals, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
There are no immediate comments available about the report from
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration said Saturday that it hopes U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's last-ditch diplomatic mission to
Iraq succeeds, but "U.S. military preparations are proceeding
without regard to these talks."
</P>
<P>
The warning came from Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger after a 90-minute meeting with the president and his top
foreign policy advisers in the Oval Office Saturday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests to Killing of Two Iranians in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
Saturday summoned the Pakistani ambassador to Iran Javid
Hussein, lodging strong protest to the killing of two Iranian
engineers in Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh handed over a
note of protest to hussein, strongly criticizing the the Pakistani
government and called on Islamabad to clarify the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Aminzadeh as
saying that terrorist acts had claimed lives of Iranians in
different parts of Pakistan during the recent years due to the
fact that the Pakistani government officials had failed to
seriously pursue and punish the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The two Iranian engineers named as Ali Mohammad Habibzadeh
and Morteza Adibzadeh in charge of constructing a bridge
project in Karachi were gunned down Saturday afternoon by
unidentified gunmen. But no reports were available here so far
about details about the killing.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh warned the relations between Tehran and Islamabad
would be gravely affected if the Pakistani government failed to
take severe measures against the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern that Pakistan has been transformed
into "an insecure state for the Iranians," calling on the
Pakistani government to closely review their policy in order
to counter such terrorist acts of the enemies of the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran radio reported that the Iranian Majlis
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Saturday also condemned the
killing of the two Iranians in Pakistan, calling on Islamabad
to take serious measures to fight against terrorists in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last September, five Iranian air force trainees were killed by
unidentified gunmen in Pakistan, damaging the relations between
the two countries. Reports said that so far the Pakistani
authorities failed to identify the real killers in that
incident.

UNITED NATIONS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan resumed his talks in Baghdad with Iraqi Deputy Prime

make a breakthrough for a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi weapons
inspection crisis, informed U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived in the Iraqi capital Friday, held two rounds
of intense talks with Aziz in the morning and the evening. The
talks were aimed at averting U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
The on-going talks were the third session, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The earlier session lasted more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word from the U.N. or the Iraqi side on

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan resumed late night talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, despite the fact that mediation has been "difficult."
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency in a brief dispatch described
the talks over the inspection of Iraqi presidential sites by
U.N. weapons experts as "difficult," but said discussions
nontheless continued.
</P>
<P>
The critical circumstances have prompted Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to chair a joint meeting of the Revolution Command Council
and the Command of Socialist Arab Baath Party earlier Saturday
night to study the Annan-Aziz talks.
</P>
<P>
The third round of Annan-Aziz talks, which started at 11
p.m. local time (2100 GMT), are now under way, and officials here
have no idea when and how they will end.
</P>
<P>
After their first round Saturday afternoon, a U.N. spokesman
said Annan-Aziz talks were "constructive," but refused to disclose
any details.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said he was "rather optimistic" about striking a
deal with Baghdad giving U.N. weapons inspectors' free and
unrestricted access of all suspected sites to avert a military
confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Friday evening in a last-ditch effort to
find a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi-U.N. standoff over the
inspection of presidential sites suspected of concealing secret
illegal weapon programs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Growth May Go on Through 2000: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of U.S. business leaders
think the current economic expansion may continue through the year
2000, a recent poll shows.
</P>
<P>
They believe that low inflation, strong productivity and steady
Federal Reserve (Fed) policy deserve the credit, said the
Investor's Business Daily Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted this month by the Investor's Business
Daily and the Technometrica Institute of Policy.
</P>
<P>
The 101 business leaders responding to the poll represent U.S.
top companies, based on their earnings' growth instead of size.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight percent of the respondents saw low inflation as a
driving force of growth. Consumer prices edged up 2.3 percent in
1997, down from a 3 percent hike in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the interest rate front, the outlook for continued low
inflation has prevented the Fed from raising the rate for 11
months. The current rate of 5.5 percent was set last March when
0.25 percentage point was added.
</P>
<P>
Ongoing falls in commodity prices and cheap imports from Asia
are expected to keep the Fed on hold, many believe.
</P>
<P>
As productivity has been on the rise, though at a lower pace
last year, weak productivity was ranked as the seventh threat to
the economic growth, after higher taxes, Fed policies, government
regulation, inflation, decline in the stock market and rising
wages.
</P>
<P>
Jitters about higher taxes were eased when the federal budget
deficit was shrinking.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, over two thirds of respondents said
they have planned to increase employment over the next six months
and 88 percent of them look forward to growing profits and are
ready to invest more in new technology.

<HEADLINE> Asia Could Recover From Crisis: G-7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven said
Saturday that Asia could recover from the current financial crisis
through adoption and vigorous pursuit of significant and
far-reaching reforms.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 agreed in a
communique that reform in Asia should ensure the effects of the
financial crisis on world growth were "manageable" this year.
</P>
<P>
"Where countries pursue the necessary reforms, the prospects of
a return of confidence top global investors and a resumption of
vigorous growth in the medium term are good," the G-7 said.
</P>
<P>
But the communique used stern words for Japan, saying its
outlook for growth was weak and that fiscal stimulus was needed to
boost a stubbornly sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism, Japan insisted that its European
and Norther American partners simply misunderstood the program for
growth already underway in Japan.
</P>
<P>
As far as Europe is concerned, the G-7 said that growth was
below potential in Germany, France and Italy and that they needed
"significant" structural reforms to cut unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Britain and Canada, the G-7 took comfort
from the fact that inflation was weaker than expected given their
strong growth records.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the communique stressed that one clear lesson to
date was that emerging and transition countries which strengthen
their economic policies help avoid the consequences of contagion.
</P>
<P>
In the interest of the longer term proper functioning of the
financial markets, it was essential for the private sector to play
its role in resolving crises, it added.

ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
wrote a letter Saturday to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
reiterating Pakistan's support for a diplomatic solution of the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman from the Foreign Ministry, Pakistan is

<HEADLINE> Living Buddha Wishes for National Unity and Ethnic Consolidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Living Buddha Jamyang
Losang Jigme Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, the head of Lapuleng Monastery
in China's Gansu Province, said that the aspiration and duty of
every Tibetan is to safeguard national unity, strengthen ethnic
consolidation, and oppose splittist activities.
</P>
<P>
He has just been elected deputy to the Ninth National People's
Congress which is to hold its first annual session in March.
</P>
<P>
Lapuleng Monastery is one of the largest Tibetan monasteries in
China and attracts many people from Gansu and Qinghai provinces
and the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Living Buddha Jamyang, who is 50, was a Standing Committee
member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) for 20 years before he was made an
NPC deputy from Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past he helped manage state affairs by
participating in political affairs in the CPPCC, but can now
directly exercise the power of the state as an NPC deputy. For
many years, he has made an effort to guard the unification of the
motherland. In the coming NPC session in Beijing, he will continue
to make an appeal for national unity and ethnic consolidation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government has a policy of freedom in religious belief and
protects normal religious activities, he says, so yearly religious
services have been successful. Tens of thousands of Buddhists
took part in services this year.
</P>
<P>
Living Buddha Jamyang just presided over religious activities
lasting for 15 days in the first month of the lunar calendar, which
were attended by Tibetan, Mongolian and han Buddhists. " Many
people came a long way through mountains on horses or donkeys, but
now highways lead to the monastery and people are coming by bus,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government believes that all ethnic groups are
equal and provides autonomy in areas inhabited by ethnic groups,
to ensure their position in the country's political affairs, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ma'an Returns to Calm After Two Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has tightened security in
the southern city of Ma'an in an effort to prevent recurrence of
riots, which over the last two days have left one dead and 10
others injured.
</P>
<P>
The security force issued a statement Sunday saying that
security and calm have been fully restored in the city, which
witnessed two pro-Iraqi and anti-U.S. riots breaking out Friday
and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local people were defying a government ban on march and
movement and taking to the streets to express their support for
Iraq and vent their anger over a threatened U.S. military strike
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations turned into riots and clashes with the
police, killing one man and injuring two on Friday, and leaving
eight more wounded on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The security force statement said that as part of the measures
to curb further violence, all the unlicensed weapons in the city
would be confiscated. A demonstrator shot to the sky with a
sub-machine gun during Saturday's riot, residents said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local parliamentary deputies were being contacted by
the police to spot organizers of the consecutive riots, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
There is a heavier presence of police force in the city, where
destroyed automatic cash-dispensing machines beside the main
streets could still be seen and electricity remains out of reach
in some parts - power lines were cut off during the riots.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein went to Ma'an on Saturday after the riot was
stopped to persuade the residents not to help "infiltrators,
vandalists and elements" endanger national security.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian popular support for Iraqi people remained strong,
despite strained Jordanian-Iraqi ties and Amman's much closer
links with Washington since it signed a peace treaty with Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The first rally this month expressing solidarity with Iraqi
people erupted more than a week ago when over 1,000 prayers took
to the streets around the famous Al-Hussein Mosque in downtown
Amman.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened military attacks to force Iraqi
compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions and the free
and full access by U.N. weapons inspectors to the "off-limits"
presidential palaces suspected of hiding prohibited weapons.

Belgium, one for each.
</P>
<P>
With two gold medals from the opening day's competitions,
24-year-old Volker continued her triumphant advance on Sunday to
take the 100 meters freestyle and 100 meters backstroke events.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the victries as this is the first competition
since the World Championships in Perth," she said.
</P>
<P>
Volker said she expected her teammates and herself do better in
the Beijing leg of the World Cup series, where she competes in the
very same events as here.
</P>
<P>
But the German star declined to predict how fast she could be
in the third leg there.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to take a long rest after the World Cup series since
I had been competing ever since the Olympic Games (in Atlanta),"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Volker said she had no idea what would be her next competition
and whether she would come back to Hong Kong for the short-course
World Championships in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Her male teammate and world breaststroke record holder Mark
Warnecke further boosted the team moral when he took his second
gold at the event on Sunday. With little difficulty, he won the
men's 100-meter breaststroke final, to add on his victory in the
50 meters breaststroek on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Popov won his second gold medal at the current short-course
tournament here, with a clocking of 22.08 seconds in the men's 50
meters freestyle final on Sunday. He keeps the event's world
record of 21.50 seconds set in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, with members out of form after the recent
holidays during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, showed up
in a below-par performance. They just took three silver, six
bronze medals to total at nine.

<P>
DHAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi minister Sunday
called upon local and foreign entrepreneurs to invest in the
infrastructural development of the oil and gas sector in the
country, reported the national news agency BSS.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has enough mineral resources, including huge
quantity of gas, for the economic development of the country, BSS
quoted Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Mohammad Nooruddin
Khan as saying at a seminar Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"But due to lack of modern technology and financial
constraints, we are not fully able to use those," he said, adding
that investors could take the opportunity in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The present government has been trying hard to create a
congenial investment atmosphere in the gas sector by presenting
liberal and attractive incentives to entrepreneurs, the minister
said.

BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is on the verge of a breakthrough to resolve the crisis over
weapons inspections in Iraq, his spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after Annan, who arrived here Friday
on a last-ditch mission, held a three-hour meeting with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of those discussions he feels he is on the verge
of a breakthrough," U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said at a press

<HEADLINE> UAE Urges US to Be "Justice" On Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan said Sunday that the
United States should "be characterized by justice" in dealing
with the current crisis between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
While urging the U.S. to avert to resort to the logic of force
against Iraq, the UAE president said "the United States is a
major world power, and its policies should be characterized by
justice and by providing support to those things which are
right."
</P>
<P>
"A (U.S.-led) military action against Iraq is something
rejected by us. It is hateful and repugnant," he said in a
statement issued following the departure of visiting Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
"It would cause endless problems and would also damage the
relations of friendship between the West and the Arab and Muslim
peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch attacks on Iraq
if U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan fails in his last-ditch
mission in Baghdad to persuade Baghdad to comply with U.N.
resolutions related to dismantling weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has openly opposed a military solution to the crisis
triggered by Iraq's refusal to allow U.N. arms inspectors free
access to presidential sites suspected of hiding biological
or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The UAE president stressed in his statement that he "appeals to
the international community...to exert its efforts in all
sincerity to avert military showdown...so that the U.S. will not
accelerate its resort to military action."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected U.S. warnings that Iraq formed a potential
threat to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"There is no threat from Iraq toward its neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the different Arab stands toward the Iraq crisis, the
president complained "no solidarity" in this field.
</P>
<P>
"There is no mutual solidarity among the Arab states at
present...There is no indication of Arab mediation in the
crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important there should be a unifying of our ranks. We
should work with sincerity to re-establish Arab solidarity,
especially at this critical time," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's meeting Sunday with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
was held in a "positive atmosphere," said an Iraqi official
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Saddam and Annan had a two-hour private
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz and Foreign Minister
Saeed Sahhaf were present when Saddam received Annan and his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Annan held four rounds of "difficult" talks with Aziz in the
last one and half days before having a meeting with Saddam in the
presidential Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said Annan and Aziz made progress in
their talks, but they did not reach an agreement on the time
limit on the inspection of Iraqi presidential sites by U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Annan had said he would meet with Saddam to clarify with him a
number of thorny issues before he went to meet Saddam.
</P>
<P>
Annan is reportedly going to meet Aziz again later Sunday on
the remaining obstacles blocking the way to an agreement on the
U.N. inspections of the presidential sites in Iraq which have been
suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant unfettered and unrestricted access to
U.N. arms inspectors to all sites suspected of hiding weapons of
mass destruction if Annan fails to persuade Iraq to back down.

<HEADLINE> Second Phase of Indian General Elections Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the
general elections to the 12th Lower House of Parliament in India's
nine states and the Union Territory of Pondicherry off the coast
of Bay Bengal ended Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Barring sporadic incidents of violence that left five people
dead and more than 30 others injured, the polling in the country
passed off peacefully for 183 Parliamentary seats out of 543 in
the House.
</P>
<P>
The turnout was reportedly moderate to fairly heavy in the nine
states and the Union Territory of Pondicherry with 45 to 50
percent of voters casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
According to the election schedule announced by the Election
Commission, the current general elections are divided into four
main phases of February 16, 22, 28 and March 7.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Lower House of Parliament, which was elected in
April-May 1996, was dissolved by President R. K. Narayanan on
December 4 last year as no political party could muster enough
support to form the next government after the Gujral government
resigned on November 28.
</P>
<P>
The fate of 405 members out of 543 MPs has been sealed in the
two phases of elections. Another 136 MPs will be elected in the
third and fourth phases of elections on February 28 and March 7.
</P>
<P>
Polling in Mandi and Ladakh for two seats in northern India has
been postponed to June on account of cold weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Security has been beefed up in all the 183 constituencies on
Sunday in view of violence-marred first phase of polls on February
16 when massive rigging and killing were reported in the country,
especially in Bihar State of eastern India.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed in Bihar and one was killed in Orissa
State of eastern India in the second phase of general elections on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two Bihar ministers were detained following disturbing polling
process in the state. This is the first time that the senior
officials have been detained in the elections since February 16.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Raid Hezbollah Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua)--Israeli Air force (IAF) jet
fighters raided Sunday morning several Hezbollah positions in
South Lebanon in retaliation against the Hezbollah's Saturday
attacks on South Lebanese Army (SLA), Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The IAF jet fighters launched their air raids on the
Hazbollah positions around the Soujud area in the northeast of
the security zone and all the fighters returned safely, the
Radio quoted the IAF as saying.
</P>
<P>
But there were no reports of casualties on the side of
Hezbollah, it added.
</P>
<P>
Several squads of Hezbollah gunmen on Saturday launched an
attack against the SLA position in Soujud under the cover of
heavy mortar fire. The Attackers advanced to within a few hundred
meters of the Soujud outpost of the SLA and opened fire with
light machine guns and automatic rifles, according to IDF.
</P>
<P>
The IDF and SLA fired back with machine guns, rifles,
mortars and artillery, forcing the attackers to retreat, and
there were no IDF or SLA casualties.
</P>
<P>
Some Hezbollah may have been hit in the fighting which
lasted more than an hour, IDF said.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Saturday followed four days of relative
quiet in the security zone which coincided with the longest-ever
session of the Grapes of Wrath Monitoring Committee.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation Committee began its discussions on Tuesday into
complaints from Israel over mortar fire last week at Kiryat
Shmona and Shiheen village in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties in Kiryat Shmona, five people were
wounded in Shiheen.
</P>
<P>
The monitors have recognized Israel's complaint regarding the
mortars which fell in Kiryat Shmona, despite strong denials by
the Lebanese delegation.
</P>
<P>
The committee determined that the incident was a clear breach
of the understanding between the two sides in April 1996.

UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua)-- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has made "substantive progress" in talks with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, a U.N. spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard said that an official announcement

"We feel a deal within reach," the spokesman told reporters

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi
Province has made great progress in increasing cooperation and
exchanges with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The province has kept a favorable balance of foreign trade for
several years, growing by four percent annually. Local exports
rose to 1.3 billion US dollars-worth in 1997 from less than 1.1
billion US dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi exports nearly 10,000 varieties of products to more
than 130 countries and regions. Exports of high-value-added and
hi-tech products, mainly machinery, electronic, light industrial
and textile goods, have been increasing remarkably.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province has been going all-out to attract
overseas investment. During the 1993-1997 period it used 2.1
billion US dollars of such investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the transfer of shares and managerial rights, and
auction activities have been brisk.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are becoming keen on funding local
infrastructure construction projects, especially in the fields of
petroleum, power and coal, and the development of local resources.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has established friendly relations with 30
overseas cities. Over the past five years nearly 2.4 million
overseas tourists have visited Shaanxi, bringing in 750 million
US dollars-worth of foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> AL Optimistic Over Peaceful Solution to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid Sunday voiced optimism over a possible
peaceful solution to the Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons inspection,
the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general tendency to solve this crisis peacefully
and avoid a military strike against Baghdad, a matter which is
strongly supported by the Arab League," he said.
</P>
<P>
While calling upon Iraq to implement the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, he urged Washington to give room to peaceful means
to solve the crisis, which was sparked off by Iraq's refusal to
grant the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief also attributed the current Iraq-U.N. standoff
"behavior and statements made by international arms inspectors'
chief Richard Butler."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also noted the flexibility shown by the
U.S. government recently in seeking a political way out.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. approval of the current mission by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan in Baghdad mirrored the American side's
readiness to seek a political settlement to this standoff," he
said.
</P>
<P>
After a day of "difficult negotiations," the U.N. chief Sunday
met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to try to reach an
agreement on arms inspections to avert a U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Middle East Affairs Martin Indyk reiterated that Annan's visit is
fully supported by the Security Council's five permanent member
states, including the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"The visit represents a last-ditch attempt of the ongoing
diplomatic efforts to persuade Saddam Hussein to abide by the
international legitimacy resolutions," he said in an interview
with Egyptian daily Al Ahram Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat also ruled out a widespread concern that the
Middle East peace process is being overshadowed by the current
crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to delay the peace process. We deal with the
peace process in the same time we tackle the crisis with Saddam
Hussein," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stranded since
last March over Israel's settlement building and dragged into
deeper recession following two suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem in last July and September.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has failed to broker an end to the peace deadlock when
it gets involved in the U.N-Iraq standoff since November over
Baghdad's refusal to let the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM in
charge of scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction) to enter
its presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been reinforcing its military presence in the Gulf

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have scored
new progress in research into radioactive ion beams, as a heavy
ion accelerator went into operation in this capital city of
northwest China's Gansu Province recently.
</P>
<P>
Established by the Institute of Modern Physics under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the accelerator has passed
appraisal by nuclear physicists recently.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the accelerator began in 1995. It underwent
more than 2,100 hours of stable operation before it was given the
go-ahead. Scientists have obtained more than 30 kinds of nuclide
from it.
</P>
<P>
The accelerator features all the major advantages of similar
installations in other countries, Chinese scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Research into radioactive beams is an advanced topic in nuclear
physics which helps scientists to learn more about the microcosmos
inside the atomic nucleus.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Becomes China's Second Largest Vegetable Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
province last year produced 34.2 million tons of vegetables,
becoming the second largest vegetable producer of China, after
east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 million farmers in Hebei benefited from vegetable
growing.
</P>
<P>
The vegetable growing area in Hebei reached 723,000 hectares in
1997, with 213,600 hectares in greenhouses, 10 times that of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government and vegetable growers in
Hebei invest a combined 10 billion yuan annually in vegetable
production, starting from 1993.
</P>
<P>
With the advantage of neighboring Beijing and Tianjin
municipalities, Hebei has set up four vegetable production and
sales bases in the counties around Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables from Hebei now cover 36 percent of the vegetable
wholesale markets in Beijing. Hebei has also established vegetable
wholesale relations with over 20 cities. It sells some 18 million
tons of vegetables a year to other Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has also adjusted its vegetable growing structure,
shifting from quantity to quality by improving growing techniques.
</P>
<P>
The province now grows 130 types of fine brand vegetables, of
which are eight state-level and 30 province-level brand name
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, 84 percent of vegetables produced in the
province entered the market.
</P>
<P>
The province has also formed 52 vegetable processing
enterprises with an annual capacity of 420,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> In-Depth Reform Vital to Large Enterprises: State Councilor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The revitalization of large
enterprises must be based on the deepening of reform, scientific
management, a better industrial lineup, advanced science and
talented personnel, according to State Councilor Li Tieying.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remark Saturday
at a seminar on the successful experience of Jiangsu Province's
Chunlan Group, one of the country's major air-conditioner
producers.
</P>
<P>
Chunlan emerged in the mid-1980s as an amalgamation of three
small factories. At that time it only had fixed assets amounting
to 2.8 million yuan. But by June 1996 the total assets of the
group had reached three billion yuan (about 361 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This accomplishment is attributed to the in-depth reform of the
company's investment and operation mechanism, Li said, adding that
Chunlan's experience indicates that reform acts as the driving
force behind enterprises and can raise economic returns to a great
extent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that correct strategic decisions are vital to an
enterprise's existence, and strict and scientific management has
played an important role in helping Chunlan reach its goals.
</P>
<P>
In market economy conditions an optimized industrial pattern
and product mix have brought about remarkable returns and rapid
growth in the group, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the emphasis on advanced science and talented
professionals has helped the group reduce costs, raise economic
returns and achieve robust progress, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq accuses US of threatening Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Sunday accused the United
States of posing a real threat to stability, security and peace in
the Middle East, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tends to interfere in regional affairs and seeks to
control the oil resources in the region, an official spokesman of
the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and Information said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. damages the peace in the Middle East by supporting
Israel's policy of continued occupation of Arab lands, the
spokesman said while commenting on a report broadcast by the
"Voice of America" (VOA) radio Saturday.
</P>
<P>
VOA's report said that there is no bigger threat to the Middle
East security than that posed by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
It is a continuation of "lies made by American President Bill
Clinton and his aides," that the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) "detected and destroyed Iraq's banned
weapons," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is Iraq which destroyed its banned weapons in 1991 and
informed the UNSCOM of that," he said, adding that Iraq then
eliminated the rest in 1994 under the supervision of the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. commission must verify that Iraq has dismantled all
its weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council will
lift the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM has found no banned weapons by itself in Iraq, the
Iraqi spokesman said adding that its discovery of Iraq's banned
weapons has been dependent on Iraq's cooperation and compliance
with the U.N. Resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of being the first country to use weapons
of mass destruction against Japanese civilians at the end of the
Second World War, and later against the peoples of Cambodia and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
It is an illusion of the U.S. that show of military muscle
would intimidate Arabs and Muslims and induce them to kneel down
and accept its aggression on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has vowed to attack Iraq if it does not grant full and
unfettered access to the U.N. arms inspectors to all sites
suspected of hiding the banned weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in central China
has begun a second-phase resettlement project for the construction
of the gigantic Three Gorges Power Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
According to a meeting here on the resettlement, in the next
six years, the province will move 71,000 farmers and urbanites as
well as 52 industrial and mining enterprises in the project area
to other places, build a floor space of 2.19 million square
meters, 80 kilometers of roads, and some harbors.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase resettlement project ended last November, when
the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges was dammed.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the second-phase resettlement will be more
difficult than the first-phase project.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Speaker Sadoun Hammadi called on the U.N. Security
Council Sunday to stop the United States from launching a
military attack on Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency INA said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker denied as "a lie" the U.S. allegation that there
are banned weapons in presidential sites, saying the allegation
was designed to create a pretext for taking military actions
against Iraq, according to INA.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has implemented all relevant U.N. resolutions on
disarmament in Iraq and cooperated with U.N. arms inspectors, who
have conducted around 2,500 visits to suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi made the remarks at an assembly meeting, which decided
to present a note to members of the U.N. Security Council, urging
them to stop a possible U.S. military aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The note said 42 international organizations stand by Iraq and
oppose to the use of force in solving the standoff between Iraq
and the United States over U.N. weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also called for the implementation of
U.N. Security Council resolution 687 and the lifting of economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
The assembly met as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan concluded
another round of talks with Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz Sunday
morning and left to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the
presidential palace here.

Security Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the remaining unresolved issue was the
time limit for U.N. arm inspectors to Iraqi sites suspected of
housing chemical or biological weapons.

<P>
Ding, also head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central

reporters and managers so as to meet the demands of the new
situation in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> China to Open First Round-the-Clock AIDS Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading anti-AIDS
organization in China plans to open the country's first 24-hour
hotline as a new channel for the public to acquire knowledge about
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).
</P>
<P>
The hotline's host will be a computer-controlled
voice-simulator for which telephone callers only need to press
buttons to get answers, according to the China Association for the
Control of AIDS and Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs).
</P>
<P>
Almost all of China's provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have similar hotlines, which are staffed by medical
professionals, but they only operate during certain hours.
</P>
<P>
"All relevant topics may be discussed between callers and the
hotline staff, such as homosexuality, the nature of AIDS, and how
to avoid and cure STDs,'' said a lady surnamed Wang, who works as
a volunteer at an AIDS hotline opened by the Health Education
Institute under the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that China has at least 150,000 people
infected by HIV -- the AIDS virus. They blame the epidemic on
prostitution and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health is working on a plan to effectively
control HIV infection among drug users by year 2000, while keeping
the annual increase rate of STDs under 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the number of HIV cases will not surpass 1.5
million by the year 2010, according to the plan.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian, Russian Win Hong Kong New Airport Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- It was neither the most
favored Ethiopian Turbo Tumo nor Australia's lone participant
Patrick Carroll that outshone others.
</P>
<P>
The crown of the 1998 Hong Kong Standard Chartered New Airport
Marathon was taken away here on Sunday by Tumo's teammate Bellay
Wolashe, who got one toe hurt midway.
</P>
<P>
With that bleeding toe, the 28-year-old Wolashe clocked two
hours 13 minutes nine seconds at the finish line for the men's
event, the first marathon race for him this year.
</P>
<P>
The time, lower than his personal best of 2:10.57, set in 1993
in France, is a new record for Hong Kong international marathon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak Hussein from Kenya won the second place in 2:13.52 and
Tanzanian Onesmo Ludago finished third in 2:14.16.
</P>
<P>
The women's top honor also went to a 28-year-old athlete.
Russian college student of physical culture Alina Ivanova won in
2:39.26, followed by Ethiopia's Senalt Teklu in 2:44.00 and
Tanzanian Maimuna Margwe in 2:56.46.
</P>
<P>
A newly-bought pair of training shoes cost Wolashe the chance
to improve his personal best. One of his left toes was badly hurt
and began bleeding after some 25 kilometers' run.
</P>
<P>
But the Ethiopian prison police in his home town Addis Ababa
managed to take over the lead from Tumo at the 35km mark and he
never let any chance for others in the rest of the race.
</P>
<P>
"If not under such a humid weather, I should have run faster,"
he said after the victory.
</P>
<P>
He praised the flat course, especially the closing section on
the runway of the new airport and hoped to come back next year to
give a better show.
</P>
<P>
Tumo, 27, finished a disappointing sixth.
</P>
<P>
Russian winner Ivanova, 28, had revealed at a pre-race press
conference that she had been training in Florida, the United
States, for the past month. But she did not owe her victory to
this factor. "It was very hot there," she said.
</P>
<P>
It did not seem to bother her that she failed to improve her
personal best. "To run on the runway of a new airport made me very
excited and the triumph made the feeling even better," she said.
</P>
<P>
Local runners Lam Weng Hei and Ng Lai Chu won the men's and
women's titles in the separate 10 kilometers races on the
airport's runway, clocking 34 minutes 50 seconds and 38 minutes
and eight seconds respectively.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is to be named as Hong Kong International
Airport, when it is opened for business on July 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
An impressive field with 1,200 entries for the marathon and
another massive batch of 5,000 runners and 18 wheelchair athletes
made Sunday's event the biggest ever athletic gathering in Hong
Kong.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The development zones in
north China's Hebei Province are developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 21 development zones had been built in the
province. They had had 2,003 operational enterprises, with another
532 under construction. Last year, the development zones generated
more than 18 billion yuan in industrial and agricultural output
value, 630 million yuan in taxes, and 210 million yuan in foreign
exchanges from exports.
</P>
<P>
The first development zone in the province was set up in
Qinhuangdao in 1984. Of the 21 development zones, 19 are economic
and technological development zones and the rest two are
state-level hi-tech development zones.
</P>
<P>
The zones have introduced distinctive methods involving
infrastructure construction, the use of overseas investment and
the improvement of investment environment, to promote their
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the capital of Beijing and the port city of
Tianjin, the province borders on the sea in the east and is one of

BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Shi Tianshu, vice chairman of
the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA), emphasized that China will
strengthen its anti-doping measures as the 1998 FINA Diving Grand
Prix is to be opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shi said on Sunday that China will continuously cooperate with
FINA, the world swimming ruling body, and other nations to make
this sport free of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The CSA is determined to take more effective actions to tackle
the drug-taking offences, such as anti-doping education and a
drug-free written guarantee from each participant prior to each
event, and the association is duly to resort to more strict
penalties than the rules of FINA to punish any offender, the
Chinese sports official said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Shuwei, Barcelona Olympic champion and winner of the
synchronized event in the World Swimming Championships last month,
will skip the event due to tiredness, together with Guo Jingjing,
runner-up of the women's 3-meter springboard in Perth.

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The largest skiing rink
in north China has opened to tourists at the Saihanba Forest Park
in Weichang County of Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The skiing rink, covering an area of two million square meters,

<HEADLINE> Emergency Medical Assistance Available for Chinese Travelers Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- An emergency medical
assistance service has been introduced for Chinese who travel
overseas, as more and more Chinese people nowadays are planning
trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
The service is jointly provided by the France-based Europ
Assistance and China International Travel Service (CITS), the
standard-bearer of China's booming tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the service will have a huge market potential, even
though it is still a new concept in China," said Stephanie
Olivier, chief representative of Europ Assistance in Beijing, a
global provider of medical assistance services for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Europ Assistance has established a worldwide network of local
agents, report centers and hospitals. Medical assistance teams
swing into action as soon as a customer calls for help, Olivier
said.
</P>
<P>
The company has seen a sluggish increase in the number of
customers since the service was launched last year.
</P>
<P>
"It is understandable, because many travelers don't think
they'll need it," said Zhu Jingyan, manager of CITS Overseas
Economic Cooperation, the domestic agent for Europ Assistance.
</P>
<P>
"But I believe more and more people, especially elderly
tourists, will choose the service in future," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese people travelling abroad has been
climbing continuously in recent years. A total of 2.56 million
Chinese citizens went abroad for personal reasons last year, a
rise of seven percent over the figure for 1996, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Among them, more than 1.06 million were tourists, a rise of 5.6
percent over 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mammoth Exhibition to Commemorate Lei Feng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- China's younger generation,
born and raised in the period of reform, opening-up and market
economy, will soon get an opportunity to learn about the life and
achievements of Lei Feng, the country's leading model of altruism.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, an exhibition titled "The
Everlasting Spirit of Lei Feng" is to be held in the Museum of the
Chinese Revolution in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The museum, located on the eastern side of Tiananmen Square, is
regarded as one of the country's most prestigious sites for
exhibitions. At the moment it is hosting a memorial exhibition on
the 100th anniversary of the birth of China's late Premier Zhou
Enlai.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the Lei Feng exhibition, from northeast
China's Liaoning Province, claim that the exhibition will be the
biggest one dedicated to Lei Feng since the 1960s, when China's
late Chairman Mao Zedong personally prompted a national campaign
to learn from this model soldier of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA).
</P>
<P>
A truck driver with the PLA's Shenyang Military Area Command,
stationed in Liaoning Province, Lei Feng took great pleasure in
helping others and doing good deeds for society. After his tragic
death at the age of 22 in an accident in 1962 he was held up as a
model of the new socialist man, and publicity about his life and
contributions was spread throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Lei Feng is the only hero in China who has been honored with
inscriptions from New China's three generations of leaders," said
Tian Jingxiang, deputy director of the city People's Congress of
Fushun, where Lei Feng was based when he served in the army.

In 1963 Mao Zedong wrote an inscription urging the whole
country to "Learn From Comrade Lei Feng". Deng Xiaoping and Jiang
Zemin, top Chinese leaders after Mao, wrote their inscriptions in
the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian, the exhibition will be held in the North
Hall of the museum, which has a floor space of 1,500 sq m, with
178 photographs and 200 objects relating to Lei Feng on display.
</P>
<P>
The organizers have also invited eyewitnesses to major events
in Lei Feng's life to serve as guides and answer questions of
curious young visitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that middle-aged and old people, who were quite
familiar with Lei Feng in their younger days, would also be
interested in the exhibition, for 20 photographs and 27 objects
are on display for the first time.
</P>
<P>
They include a story and a poem written by Lei Feng in his own
handwriting, and a notebook in which he recorded all his donations.
</P>
<P>
"The visitors will also be able to hear the recorded voice of
Lei Feng recollecting his own miserable childhood before
Liberation in 1949,'' said Tian. He added that it was recorded in
Fushun in 1961.
</P>
<P>
The organizers plan to open the exhibition February 27 and run
it through March 27. It will then tour all the other major Chinese
cities.

<HEADLINE> Blackout Looms in Nigerian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Abuja, Nigeria's
capital, who used to take for granted stable supply of water and
electricity, are beginning to feel the degeneration of power
supply.
</P>
<P>
Abuja has only one source of electricity supply, which is the
132 kv power line from Shiroro dam, some 100 km away in the
north.
</P>
<P>
But the line has been over-stretched, a development that has
led to instability of supply to communities in the federal
capital territory (FCT), an administrative division with the same
status as the 36 states under the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The pressure of serious electricity supply situation has
forced the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in the FCT to
connecting electricity to new buildings since last October.
</P>
<P>
The trend has heightened anxiety that unless the 132 kv power
line is beefed up urgently, the electricity supply position to
the FCT could snap, leaving the territory in darkness.
</P>
<P>
However, it is feared that NEPA's refusal to grant
applications for meters could slow down the tempo of construction
activities in the FCT, which has remained high since the movement
of the federal government from Lagos to Abuja in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the line should be upgraded to 330 kv to
cater to the fast pace of development in the FCT, according to
NEPA officials.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost 10 billion Naira (about 125
million U.S. Dollars), according to the Sunday Champion newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
But the government in ~? year's budget only plans to
allocate two billion Naira (about 25 million Dollars) for the
project.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expects Good Maize, Wheat Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is likely
to have good harvest of maize and wheat in the 1998/99 season,
the National Crop Estimates Committee said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The first official maize and wheat crop estimates for the
season suggest that earlier estimates of El Nino's impact on
crops were exaggerated. Good crops should give the economy a
slight boost this year, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998/99 commercial maize crop, to start in May, would be
6.86 million tons -- 2.8 million tons of yellow maize and 4.06
tons of white one, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Last season's bumper crop amounted 8.5 millions tons.
</P>
<P>
The committee raised its total maize acreage estimate on the
crop to 3.1 million hectares from the 2.81 million announced last
month.
</P>
<P>
If this estimate proves to be correct, it would meet domestic
consumption needs of between six and seven million tons,
agricultural department officials said.

The good rains during the past few months are likely to boost
South Africa's economy by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter last
year from 0.3 percent in the first quarter, some economists
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted economist Peter Worthington as saying that
the figures were an improvement on October estimates when El Nino
was expected to shave one percentage point off this year's GDP
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
"May be the hit will be only about 0.3 or 0.4 percentage
points, depending on the degree to which farmers have substituted
other crops for maize in anticipation of a bad drought,"
Worthington said.
</P>
<P>
South African economists expect economic growth of about two
percent this year, a figure which could now move up to 2.3
percent.

<HEADLINE> 3.2 Million People in Mountainous Area of Anhui Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 3.2 million poor
people in the mountainous area in east China's Anhui province have
bidden farewell to poverty in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The economy in the Dabieshan mountain area in Anhui grew slowly
10 years ago, mainly because of poor transport conditions and
hostile environment. More than half of the seven million people
in the area were living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
To help them out of poverty, the local government began to take
measures to tap the abundant resources in the mountain area.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, 71 large bases have been built in the
area to produce local special products such as tea and Chinese
chestnuts. These production bases cover a total of 140,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 special markets have also been built to attract
traders across the country. The transaction volume of these
markets has totaled one billion yuan so far.
</P>
<P>
Processing of mountain-based products has also been given green
lights to develop. So far, more than 100 such firms have been set
up.
</P>
<P>
The development of the mountain resources has increased
farmers' income. In 1997, the per-capita income for farmers in the
area reached 1,700 yuan, 260 yuan more than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The local government has promised to help another 20,000 poor
people shake off poverty this year.

</P>
<P>
The number of crime cases rose from 87,902 in 1996 to 121,176
last year, Bernama said quoting Federal Crime Investigation

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Strives to Stabilize Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Central Bank has
pumped 350 million U.S. dollars to stabilize the financial market,
a local radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources were quoted by the Voice of the People radio as
saying that the Central Bank was forced to make the intervention
last week to meet a sharp rise of demand for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the rise to reports on Lebanese economic
situations presented by two international economic rating agencies
early this month, which they said exerted negative influence on
Lebanon's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The reports of the Standard and Poor and the Fiche IBCA have
downgraded Lebanon's credit rating from neutral to negative in the
view of its current difficult economic situations.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Lebanon may face a financial crisis
if the government does not take measures to curb the huge budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lebanon's deficit rose by 59 percent, 22 percentage
points more than that outlined in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget set the deficit at no more than 42 percent, but
the deficit in January still broke the ceiling, reaching 45
percent.

<HEADLINE> Weather, Records, Medals and Marijuana Form Nagano Olympics  By Xinhua s portswriter Zhou Jie, Liang Xiyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Weather, records, medals and
marijuana. That was the 1998 Nagano Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
When the curtain of the 18th Winter Olympics dropped down and the
Olympic flame faded out on Sunday, many believed that the games was a
success, though it could not be compared with Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
Before the games began, many concerns came to the weather and
weather had really become a trouble-maker to the organizers in the
first 13 days.
</P>
<P>
Since the first day of the games, weather had been playing havoc on
many competition sites. Wind, snow, fog and rain washed out Alpine
skiing events in six complete days.
</P>
<P>
The organizers had to compete against weather and arranged three
Alpine events in a single day, the most in winter Olympic history when
blue sky appeared.
</P>
<P>
For sure, the games was not the best ever in history when the
organizers failed to have IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch's
traditional accolade.
</P>
<P>
However, it could be certain that this was the biggest ever in
winter Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,300 athletes from 72 countries and regions took part in
the 16-day games, which featured 68 events in 14 sports, including
three new ones -- women's ice hockey, snowboarding and curling.
</P>
<P>
Germany, third in medal standing at last Olympic Winter Games in
Lillehamer, regained its leading status with 12 golds, nine silvers
and eight bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Norway, second in Lillehammer, remained runners-up with 10-10-5.
Russia, top finisher four years ago, was third in 9-5-3.
</P>
<P>
Athletes from China, Asia's sports power, did not display a
performance in Nagano as in Atlanta. For the sixth consecutive winter
Olymics, the Chinese athletes failed to grab a gold.
</P>
<P>
However, they had made some improvement in competition, if that was
a kind of progress. Chinese skaters and skiiers collected six silvers
and two bronze in Nagano, two medals more than the total they bagged
in their previous five appearance.
</P>
<P>
During the two-week games, the last in this century, many great
moments occured to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
In speed skating ice rink, five world records have been set by
skaters from the Netherlands, Norway and Germany, all of whom were
armed with slap skates.
</P>
<P>
Dutch speed skating trio, one of them racing for Belgium, deserved
a special mention. The three skaters, donning top-secret rubber
strips, lowered the world record three times in the men's 5,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 5,000m distance, German Marianne Timmer and Gunda
Niemann-Stirnemann twice broke the world mark which had been held for
four years by Niemann-Stirnemann.
</P>
<P>
Another speed skater, Hiroyasu Shimizu, won Japan and Asia's first
gold medal with a world-beating run in the 500 meters sprint.
</P>
<P>
Two world records fell in short track speed skating in the events
of women's 3,000m relay and 1,000m sprint.
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular was when Austria's Hermann Maier crashed out
of the men's downhill as Alpine skiing's big race finally went ahead
on Friday 13th.
</P>
<P>
Maier, overall World Cup leader, crashed and broke two protective
safety nets after losing grip on a turn which ended up claiming 13
racers.
</P>
<P>
But two days later, he recovered from the crash and geared up to
win the giant slalom. The ex-brick layer collected two titles at the
games.
</P>
<P>
Italian ski legend Alberto Tomba had his great career ended in
disappointment. After he crashed in the giant slalom, he finished
17th in the first run of the slalom, which gave him no hope to win a
medal in Nagano, thus smashing his dream to win a medal in four
consecutive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian cross-country skier Bjorn Daehlie became the brightest
star in the games. On snow hills and slopes, he had not only to
compete against rivals in Nagano, but also race against those in
history. In the final, he defeated all. After spearheading the
Norwegian team to win the men's 4x10km relay, he became the most
successful Winter Games athlete in history with seven golds.
</P>
<P>
On the closing day of the games, Daehlie continued his power to win
the 50km free skiing, adding his Olympic gold total to eight.
</P>
<P>
Ice hockey professionals made their debut at winter Olympics, stars
from the NHL made the competition a "Dream Tournament", in which Czech
Republic became a surprising winner with a 1-0 victory over Russia on
game's closing day.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana became a story in the games. When snowboarding announced
its arrival in the games, it also began to challenge the power of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati, who won the men's giant
slalom, was disqualified by the IOC and was told to hand back his gold
medal after he tested positive for traces of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Rebagliati, who said he gave up pot since last April and had
inhaled second-hand smoke, was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration
for Sports which ruled that there was no legal ground for his
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
The IOC could do nothing but to obey the rule. The world sports
governing body, with its drugs rules in disarray, decided to set up a
top-level taskforce to formulate a policy on marijuana and other
"social drugs, " so as to have a unified code till the year 2,000,
when the next Olympic Summer Games is held in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Transportation and language had been headache for many attending
the games. The Japanese organizers became flexible to arrange the
transportation to meet demands, but not enough. Most volunteers have
been ready to help foreign press and visitors, but they could do
little with difficulties in communication.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake City Organizing Committee, which will host the next
Winter Olympics in 2002, stayed in Nagano for three weeks to learn for
experience. They promised everything would be ready at that time.
</P>
<P>
It is definitely certain that there would be no language barrier in
Salt Lake City. But for transportation, who knows?

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urges Baghdad to Accept UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah urged
Iraq to accept unconditionally all the U.N. Security Council
resolutions to avoid a perilous situation for its people.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad's remarks, which coincided the U.N. General
Secretary Annan's good offices in Baghdad, were made Saturday
night after attending an open session of Kuwaiti National
Assembly, according to local press Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must "see
reason and act pragmatically for the sake of the helpless
and impoverished Iraqi people," adding that "Saddam must
implement all U.N. resolutions, without exception."
</P>
<P>
He said this is the last chance for Saddam, referring Annan's
talks in Baghdad aimed at ending the current Iraq-U.N. stand-off
through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Annan held lengthy talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz in Baghdad Saturday to try to avert a U.S. military
strike and said he was optimistic that an agreement with Iraqi
government would be reached. He will hold talks with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein at noon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam backed down in a previous crisis over arms
inspections in 1993 after American air strikes, whereas a swift
U.S. military buildup and threats made him withdraw troops he had
moved toward the Kuwaiti border in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As the talks were going on, the U.S. President Bill Clinton,
having already approved a plan "Desert Thunder" for massive air
strikes on Iraq, met his top security advisers including Secretary
of State Madelaine Albright in the White House Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has assembled a strike force of over 30 ships and 300
warplanes in the Gulf and the plan was reportedly foreseeing four
days of round-the-clock strikes which would target Iraq's
military infrastructures.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. chief Kofi Annan said
here Sunday the negotiations over arms inspections with Iraq is
"making progress" and that he is "still optimistic."
</P>
<P>
The talks held on Saturday were "serious and difficult," but
"we are making progress," Annan told reporters before talks were
resumed Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Annan held three rounds of talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz on Saturday. They carried on until 2
a.m. Sunday (2300 GMT), but failed to resolve the final details of
an agreement to grant access to the United Nations arms inspectors
to all Iraqi sites.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed diplomatic sources said that Iraq's demand for a
time limit on the inspections of its presidential sites appears to
be the main hurdle to reach the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary general said he would meet with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein at Sunday noon to clarify with him a
number of thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
"After that I will have a better idea of where we are," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has vowed to take military actions to force
to grant unfettered and unrestricted access to U.N. arms
inspectors to all sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction if Annan fails to persuade Saddam to back down.

<HEADLINE> Manila Resolves Trade Dispute With Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has
successfully resolved its pork and poultry trade dispute with the
United States after nearly 10 months of negotiations between the
two countries, a senior official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Salvador H. Escudero III told reporters
that a memorandum of understanding between the two governments was
formally signed in Washington Friday after 10 months of
negotiations in Geneva under the auspices of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"This settlement would not have been possible without the
cooperation of our hog and poultry industries," Escudero said.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Washington brought to the attention of the WTO its
complaints regarding the Philippines implementation of its pork
and poultry tariff quotas.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that the Philippines was not providing its trading
partners with full access to its quotas.
</P>
<P>
Under the Uruguay Round Final Act, all WTO members are obliged
to replace quantitative restrictions on agricultural products with
tariffs, and establish a tariff quota system that allows the entry
of imports at lower tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations turned sour when Washington threatened to withdraw
trade concessions given to Philippine exports. Bilateral talks
took a positive turn last month after the U.S. government
indicated that it would not ask the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to
look into the pork and poultry issue.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of letting the U.S. complaints escalate into a formal
dispute in the WTO, both parties decided to work out an amicable
settlement," Escudero said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Department of Agriculture recently modified its
Minimum Access Volume (MAV) rules to allow a faster transfer of
under-used quotas to bona fide importers.

<HEADLINE> Regional Disarmament Meeting Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A regional disarmament
meeting organized by the United Nations Regional Center for Peace
and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific opened here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting falls on the 10th anniversary of the establishment
of the regional center, often referred to as "The Kathmandu
Process."
</P>
<P>
Attending the three-day meeting are 38 diplomats, government
officials, scholars and experts from 22 countries and five
non-governmental organizations in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N. under
secretary-general for disarmament affairs, noted that the annual
gathering in Kathmandu has become an increasingly important means
to assist in identifying and addressing disarmament and security
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that through its ten-year existence, the regional
center has tried to meet new challenges and to play a distinctive
role by responding to the significant changes in the international
situation.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he said, the center has tried to develop a
region-oriented approach for disarmament, taking into account the
specific conditions prevailing in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The center, a non-governmental security dialog mechanism,
intends to further encourage states within the region to elaborate
and employ measures for increasing transparency in military
matters, he added.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it provided the Asia-Pacific states with an
additional forum for them to narrow down differences and search
for a common position in disarmament negotiations and
deliberations, the senior UN official said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, it has helped introduce principles or guidelines for
the region. And fourthly, in addition to disarmament, dealing with
region-specific issues is another characteristic of the Kathmandu
process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, the center has acted as a hinge connecting and
coordinating dialog and activities being conducted in each
sub-region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting are expected to take stock of
the work done during the first decade and discuss prospects of the
center.
</P>
<P>
Established and given a clear mandate by U.N. General Assembly
resolutions, the center is the broadest based dialog mechanism in
the region, encompassing South Asia and Central Asia in addition
to all of East Asia, Oceania and the United States.

to exert and consolidate the nation's due position in the world
trade.
</P>

21st century, which would be an age of tough competition in global
business," she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her belief that the fair would contribute
considerably to the ample demonstration of Bangladesh's products
as well as to increase fraternity among the participating nations.
</P>

the international trade arena, the prime minister stated.
</P>
<P>
Jointly organized by the Ministry of Industries and Commerce
and the Export promotion Board, the trade fair occupies a total
area of about 140,000 square meters, with 35 pavilions, 57 mini

Pakistan and the United States. Besides nearly 300 local firms
including joint venture enterprises.
</P>
<P>

products from the latest model computers to fast food.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh holds trade fair every year since 1995 and local
firms earned 1.7 million, 2.2 million and 2.4 million U.S. dollars
respectively from DITF '95, DITF '96 and DITF '97.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Kill Man-eating Crocodiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Tourism Minister
Amusaa Mwanamwambwa has directed the country's parks and wildlife
services to take immediate action to eliminate man-eating
crocodiles, Zambia's Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The tourism minister issued the directive in Zambia's western
border city Zambezi Saturday following reports from many parts of
the country that crocodiles are threatening people's lives.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that human life is more important than that of
any wild animal that threatens or kills human beings.
</P>
<P>
Mwanamwambwa appealed to the affected people to report any
vicious crocodiles in their areas to the relevant authorities so
that the reptiles could be killed.
</P>
<P>
The tourism ministry, said the minister, has approached local
hunters to harvest some crocodiles especially in localities of
conflicts between human beings and the reptiles.
</P>
<P>
In Zambezi, there have been reports from villagers that their
lives are in danger from vicious crocodiles where even some lives
have been lost through crocodiles in the country's largest river
the Zambezi and other rivers.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Elimination Project Launched in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has launched a project aimed at helping youth and
women groups in the campaign of eliminating poverty across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The three-year project, known as Community-based Initiatives
for Poverty Eradication, is financed by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) with 877,300 U.S. Dollars, Sunday News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Project Coordinator, Joel Mwakitalu, said at a
seminar in Kibaha Saturday that the project will provide advocacy
education and training to the community-based organizations
(CBOs) so that they can help the poor learn how to eradicate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said the project is a continuation of the other two
projects, Domestic Development Services (DDS) and Partners in
Development Program (PDP), both of which have helped women and
youths in different productive activities.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the project is to help the beneficiaries
especially in the villages who have already shown interest in
escaping poverty to work harder after receiving education and
training, Mwakitalu explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the project will first start in the poorest four
regions in the country -- Coast, Dodoma, Kigoma and Lindi, and
then extend to other regions.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankans Asked Not to Go to Kuwait for Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Employment Board
of Sri Lanka has asked local people who applied for employment in
Kuwait not to go to that country in view of a pending war in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan employees have been requested not to leave for
Kuwait with immediate effect, the TNL Radio Station reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a request by Sri Lanka's counselor in
Kuwait due to the increasing tension between Iraq and the United
States, which has threatened to stage massive military strikes
against the Middle East nation, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has asked all its citizens working in Kuwait to
return home. However, many other countries, including Sri Lanka,
are yet to make a similar decision.
</P>
<P>
Many Sri Lankans are working in the Middle East as laborers or
housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka on Saturday voiced its support for a peaceful
political solution to the crisis over weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement on the
situation in Iraq, saying any military action would gravely affect
the people in Iraq and Sri Lanka therefore welcomes the diplomatic
efforts of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is currently in Iraq holding talks with Iraqi
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Send Team to Europe for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Tourism Minister Henry
Kosegey announced in Mombasa Saturday that a promotion team would
be sent to Europe next week to market Kenya as one of the best
tourists' destination in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The local weekly paper Sunday Standard quoted the minister as
saying that the team would visit BIT Fair in Milan, Italy, and
other tourism fairs in Germany, France, Britain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Kosegey said that his ministry would aggressively market this
East African country and improve its image abroad, especially in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his ministry is set to embark on a major
project of repairing roads, clearing garbage, increasing security
and improving water and power supply to boost tourism in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The minister blamed the decline of kenya's tourism industry on
the negative publicity abroad by the foreign media and the
breakdown of the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said, "let's not start pointing fingers over who is to
blame for the fall in tourism. The government and the private
sector must quickly come up with immediate solutions to save the
industry from collapse."
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Standard featured a front-page story entitled "Top
Industry Faces Collapse", saying that thousands of Kenyans face
an economically difficult future as one of the country's top
mass-employer industries struggles to survive the negative
effects of natural and man-made tragedies.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that kenya's tourism which is the country's
number one foreign exchange earner was undergoing "the worst
times since independence in 1963".
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Kenya attracted some 850,000 tourists with the
tourism industry earning the country 28 billion Kenyan Shillings
and four years later the number of tourists declined to about
60,000 with the bed occupancy currently being between 30 to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the decline of the country's tourism
to the stinking mounds of uncollected rubbish everywhere, badly
damaged roads, insecurity and violence, water and power
shortages, and harassment by beach boys.
</P>
<P>
In order to boost tourism industry, the paper said in its
comment Sunday, "we must put our house in order first".

<HEADLINE> More Remarried People in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of remarried people
has been on the rise in China in recent years, as remarriage
becomes increasingly understandable and acceptable for the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the State Statistical Bureau, a total
of 862,000 people were registered for remarriage in 1996 in China,
up from 500,000 in 1985 and 788,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Civil affairs departments say that the proportion of the
remarried people among the newly married stood at 3.05 percent in
1985, and it rose to 4.14 percent in 1990 and 4.61 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, all three with rich culture
and growing economy, the proportion reached 14.67, 10.08, and
13.36 percent, respectively, far above the national average.
</P>
<P>
Remarriage is more consequent in cities, compared with rural
areas. Remarried people accounted for 2.95 percent of the married
in cities and counties, 0.43 percentage points higher than in the
rural areas, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the remarriage of the old people has got more
concern from the society and their legal rights have been better
protected. Statistics show that in 1996, out of 100 married people
above the age of 50, five were the remarried.

80 kilometers from Iringa town, had already been battered by
floods.
</P>
<P>
Following the breakdown of the bridge, a number of people had
to travel by the Tanzania-Zambia railway.
</P>

vehicles weighing more than 52 tons not to pass the bridge
fearing that part of it will collapse again.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic claimed
the last gold medal of the 18th Olympic Winter Games on Sunday when
they defeated Russia 1-0 in the men's ice hockey final.
</P>
<P>
The lone goal was scored by Petr Svoboda in the third and last
period.
</P>
<P>
During the first period, both teams played tight man-to-man
defense, holding each other to few passes and clear shot-on-goal
attempts.
</P>
<P>
In the 19th minute of play, Jaromir Jagr took a hefty body check by
Russia's Alexei Zhitnik putting him on the bench holding an orange
towel to his face.
</P>
<P>
But the dominating forward was back out on the ice early in the
next period and nearly scored at 10:19 but the puck ricocheted off the
goal post.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic re-grouped during the break, coming back on to
the ice playing a more effective passing game against their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock ended at 48:08 when Svoboda salmmed a slapshot past
Russian goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov for the first and only goal of the
game.
</P>
<P>
Coming off of a face-off, Svoboda stayed near the blue line and was
fed the puck from Pavel Patera and Libor Prochazka.
</P>
<P>
The Russian team, attempting to level the score, pulled their
goalie in the final seconds of the game but did not succeed in marking
the board.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for the bronze medal Saturday, Finland beat Canada
3-2.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Moslems Slam US Plans of Raiding Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Council of Kenya
Moslems (SUPKEM) has condemned the U.S. for its planned military
attack on Iraq and urged the world community to force Washington
to drop its invasion plans.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation quoted a SUPKEM statement issued Saturday as
saying that the Arab states and most countries of the world
including three permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
were opposed to military invasion, and preferred a diplomatic
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
SUPKEM urged those opposed to the military invasion to "garner
all our energies and efforts to condemn the U.S. aggression
against innocent people."
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the seven-year blockade against Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War had "denied the people of Iraq means to
earn their livelihood and availability of medicine for their sick
and dying".
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there is a much more serious scenario unfolding
where Britain and U.S. are beating war drums to bomb and destroy
the nation state and people of Iraq," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that "this is under the guise of
protecting neighboring Arab states and the world community from
(possible) Iraq aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Is the U.S.A. more concerned about the security of the Arab
people than the Arabs themselves? Is the U.S.A. really upholding
the U.N. resolution?" SUPKEM questioned.
</P>
<P>
If so, it noted, "how about the Zionist state of Israel that
continues to flout 29 U.N. resolutions and persists in denying
the rights of the Palestine people?"
</P>
<P>
The council urged the world community to spare a moment to
pray for the Iraqi people and forced the U.S. government to drop
its invasion plans.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Prepares Strike on Iraq Despite Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
Saturday continued its preparation for possible air strikes on
Iraq despite peace efforts made by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and demonstrations by Americans against such strikes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department advised U.S. citizens to leave Iraq
as soon as possible, accusing the Iraqi government of continuing
to "make provocative and confrontational statements indicating its
unwillingness to comply with U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the State Department said, "all U.S. citizens
are strongly urged to avoid all travel to Iraq, and those already
in Iraq are advised to depart as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The administration fears that the American citizens could be
targets of terrorism because any military attack would deepen the
anti-American sentiment of the Arabs, particularly the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Besides the warning from the State Department, the Pentagon
also warned in a memorandum Saturday that journalists who stay in
Iraq may be at risk.
</P>
<P>
The State Department could not say how many U.S. citizens are
in Iraq, but it was reported that the number would be small as
there is no U.S. embassy in Baghdad and severe restrictions
prevented U.S. businessmen from going to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"You should be aware that there is substantial risk involved in
sending people to Iraq during a period that could be highly
dangerous," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to minimize civilian casualties; however,
the safety of any particular group of people, including
journalists, could be jeopardized in the event of military
action," it added.
</P>
<P>
In the White House, President Bill Clinton and his top advisors
met for about 90 minutes in the afternoon focusing on the
development in Iraq while about 3,000 anti-war demonstrators
protested outside.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said that U.S. military preparations are proceeding without regard
to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's talks with Iraqi officials
over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said no signs are evident
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"There continue to be provocative statements issued from
Baghdad and no indication of a complete willingness to resolve
this in a peaceful fashion," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the top administration officials met, some demonstrators
gathered in a park across the street from the White House.
</P>
<P>
The protesters chanted "No more war" all the way marching about
a mile through city street before they gathered in front of the
White House with a banner holding high, which reads: "Do not bomb
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
One of the protesters said he could no longer remain silent on
the Clinton administration's marketing campaign for military
action.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to take action if we're going to stop the
killing of a lot of innocent people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another protester said he was "flabbergasted" that the Clinton
administration has decided to contain Iraq with bombing.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that such a big rally took place outside
the White House. The size of Saturday's protest surprised
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Annan resumed late night talks with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz although the U.N. Chief said that the
mediation has been "difficult."
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency in a brief dispatch described
the talks over the inspection of Iraqi presidential sites by U.N.
weapons experts as "difficult," but said discussions nontheless
continued.
</P>
<P>
The critical circumstances have prompted President Hussein to
chair a joint meeting of the Revolution Command Council and the
Command of Socialist Arab Baath Party earlier Saturday night to
study the Annan-Aziz talks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was "rather optimistic" about striking a deal
with Baghdad giving U.N. weapons inspectors' free and unrestricted
access of all suspected sites to avert a military confrontation in
the region.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Marcelo Rios of
Chile was beaten by Australian big-server Mark Philippoussis 6-4,
7-6 (7-5) in the semi-finals of the St. Jude ATP tournament at
Memphis, late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, the fourth-seeded player at the tournament, shot
17 aces to beat Australian Open losing finalist Rios.
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely confident on my serve," said Philippoussis, "I
felt like at nearly any time I could come up with a big one."
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis will play against second seed Michael Chang in
Sunday's final. Chang needed two tiebreakers to beat Gustavo
Kuerten of Brazil 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-4) earlier in the other

<HEADLINE> 24 Suicides Per Day in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 8,900 Sri Lankans
committed suicides in 1997, or more than 24 suicides per day, The
Island newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Lakshmi Ratnayake, head of a local
organization, as saying that the latest statistics put the death
toll of suicides at 8,900 in 1997, which constituted one of the
highest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
Ratnayake said suicide was mainly a rural phenomenon in Sri
Lanka as the highest suicide rates were reported in remote rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The rate of suicide death was higher among males than females
and the highest age groups were the 20-30 group and the over-60
group.
</P>
<P>
Inability to cope with feelings was blamed to be the main
reason for people to take their lives. "The main reasons behind
suicides were mental depression, inability to cope with feelings
and drug and alcohol abuses," Ratnayake said. Her organization is
devoted to lending emotional support to those lonely and depressed
people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other experts here say poverty is another major
reason for people to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced to restrict access to pesticides
and other poisons last December in an effort to curb suicide
attempts of the local people.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Want Earlier Admission of Poland to NATO, EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Saturday that
France and Germany are willing to see an earlier admission of
Poland to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Kohl made the remarks after holding talks with
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski in the Polish city of
Poznan.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany will also help Poland achieve the goal, they
noted at a post-summit joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
Last July at NATO's special summit in Madrid, Hungary, Poland
and the Czech Republic were invited to enter NATO in the first
batch. They will be accepted as new members by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said that the German parliament will adopt in March or
April a draft proposal on absorbing Poland into NATO. Chirac said
the French parliament will pass the same proposal this summer.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said that his country will help Poland transform its
agriculture, heavy and military industries in its effort to join
the EU.
</P>
<P>
All the three top leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation
among the three countries in the field of culture, besides
politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski proposed establishing a European University in
Poland to enhance cultural exchanges among the young generation of
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions about the Iraq crisis, all the three
leaders wished U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's mission to
Baghdad a success.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming French-German-Russian summit, Chirac and
Kohl agreed to brief Kwasniewski of the results of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac noted that it is imperative to keep dialogues with
Russia for maintaining security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
France, Germany and Poland began to hold the three-nation
annual meetings of foreign ministers in 1991 and the regular
meetings of defense ministers in 1994. This is the first time for
the three countries to hold a summit.

<HEADLINE> Security Beefed up in 183 Constituencies in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Security has been beefed up
in all the 183 Parliamentary constituencies as the second phase of
general elections to the 12th Lower House of Parliament began in
nine States and Union Territory of Pondicherry off the coast of
Bay Bengal on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Armed with shoot-at-sight orders, about 5,000 men drawn from
the police and paramilitary forces will be on hand to try and
ensure a "free and fair" poll in Sambhal constituency in Uttar
Pradesh. The situation has turned more tense following the
political development of government change in the State Saturday
evening with fears of large-scale violence and rigging being
fueled by statements issued by leaders of various parties.
</P>
<P>
In view of the impending developments, the police have taken
measures to prevent trouble. Apart from 1,000 men of the local
police, reinforced by 800 from nearby areas, there would be 10
companies of paramilitary forces. Besides, 100 women constables
will be deployed in the constituency, which is regarded as the
hyper-sensitive constituency in Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has directed the Bihar State, where the
specter of violence looms large over the 21 Parliamentary
constituencies where the second phase of general elections is
being held Sunday, to tighten its belt and ensure that the
paramilitary forces are compulsorily deployed effectively.
</P>
<P>
According to Home Secretary R. K. Singh, the government was
keeping a strict watch on sensitive constituencies where it
apprehended violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of general elections held on February 16,
massive rigging and killing were reported in States of Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and other places of the
country. Over 60 people were killed and more than one hundred were
injured in various violent incidents in the elections in 222
constituencies. The Election Commission has thus forced to
announce repolling in the country time and again.
</P>
<P>
"More blasts in Coimbatore, curfew in Ajmer, home guards
looting the armory, there is little doubt that the atmosphere has
suddenly become far more tense and worrisome in the last few
days," the Hindustan Times said in its editorial on February 19.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Economists Warn Against Devaluation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka should not panic and
devalue its currency, the Rupee, as a reaction to the current
Southeast Asian currency crisis, economists here said.
</P>
<P>
The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka said in a news
release, which was made available Sunday, that economists,
bankers, fund managers and foreign exchange dealers of the country
gathered recently to discuss possible impacts of the crisis on Sri
Lanka's economy.
</P>
<P>
It said the participants have reached a consensus that the
country should not devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
A devaluation of the Rupee may yield short-term benefits to
exporters who are facing stiff competition from Southeast Asian
countries which have drastically devaluated their currencies.
However, in the long run, the impact is detrimental, they
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the Rupee as a remedy will cause bad side
effects: rising inflation, swelling interest rates and a resultant
upward wage push, which will nullify the advantage gained by the
devaluation, an economist warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, those participated in the discussion identified the
areas most affected by the currency turmoil as natural rubber and
rubber products, coconut products, garments and ceramic ware.
</P>
<P>
Local businessmen have already begun to import cheaper tires
and other rubber products, they said.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that the crisis will slow down foreign
investment flow into Sri Lanka and propel the withdrawal of
foreign investments already made in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's exports will also lose competitiveness, especially
those dependent on local materials.
</P>
<P>
The economists pointed out that the way out is not devaluation
of currency but improvement of productivity and local savings.
Currently, the national savings in Sri Lanka is about 15 percent,
according to the bankers.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Expands Operation in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Toyota Lanka Limited, a
subsidiary of the Toyota Japan Corporation, has decided to invest
500 million Rupees (8.1 million U.S. dollars) to strengthen its
presence in Sri Lanka, General Manager Suren Abeygoonesekera said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company began operation in Sri Lanka in 1995 after
it canceled contracts with a local agency, which had represented
the company for over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The new investment will be used mainly to upgrade their
services and to move the company's operations to more spacious
premises along the Negombo-Colombo road.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to expand its services to other cities
across the country by setting up a network of Toyota Lanka
Authorized Service Stations, the general manager said. They hope
to start 30 such stations by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the total brand new Japanese vehicles marketed in Sri Lanka,
Toyota has been able to reach the number one position in 1997 in
terms of market share.
</P>
<P>
Abeygoonesekera said out of the 2,939 new vehicles imported
from Japan last year, 950 were Toyotas.
</P>
<P>
Currently 120 to 150 brand new Toyota vehicles are imported
monthly, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Thailand Keen to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Political stability, timely
government adjustment measures and qualified workforce in Vietnam
have attracted more and more Thai investors, a visiting senior
Thai official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When meeting Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, director of Thai Prime Minister's Office
Somboon Rahong said, "Thai businessmen always consider Vietnam as
a reliable and attractive investment venue," a report of the
Vietnam News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Rahong admitted that the current financial crisis in Southeast
Asia triggered by the sharp fall of Thai baht in August 1997
produced an adverse impact on Thailand's investment in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
But he said he believed that Southeast Asia would continue to
be the most economically dynamic region in the world when the
crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed the hope that members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should strengthen
solidarity to solve the aftermath caused by the crisis, and make
hostile schemes designed by outside forces null and void.
</P>
<P>
He added that Thailand and Vietnam should strive to boost
bilateral ties and set an example for other members of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam said that more than ever before, it is time for
ASEAN countries to enhance mutual cooperation under the principle
that a prosperous nation will add strength to a region, and a
prosperous region will add strength to the world.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Thailand share great potential to accelerate their
comprehensive cooperation not only in the interests of the two
countries but also for the maintenance of regional stability and
development, the deputy prime minister said.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper said Saturday that his government always keeps the
door open to continued peace talks with the rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

"We are expecting some answers from the FARC to see if they

Samper said, adding that the government did not want to impose a

With the negotiators' personal safety taken into consideration,
the site should be a place which is not involved in the conflict,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is one of the older and stronger of the two guerrilla
groups in Colombia still fighting a civil war in the country.

<HEADLINE> Used Cars From 56 Closed Firms Go Under Hammer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 20,000 bargain-hunters
flocked to three auction houses Saturday to bid for 535 cars, the
first batch of some 7,000 vehicles repossessed from the 56 closed
financial firms, the Nation newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These vehicles were put up for sale by the financial
restructuring authority (FRA) which is responsible for the
liquidation of the failed financial firms.
</P>
<P>
FRA officials were satisfied with Saturday's auction as the
average bidding turned out to be about 10 percent above the FRA's
benchmark prices.
</P>
<P>
They expected to receive some 150 million baht (3.4 million
U.S. dollars) from the first auction, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, some people, who planned to bid for a car but returned
empty-handed, said that the prices were not as low as they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
Many people criticized the bidding arrangements as overcrowded
and chaotic. Some complained that they were not given detailed
information about the vehicles and were not allowed to drive to
test the engine.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's auction is the prelude of a series of FRA-arranged
open auctions of non-core assets, including vehicles, art crafts
and other company properties.
</P>
<P>
Sales of core assets, held through auctions to qualified
bidders, are expected to start in April and run through to the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The book value of the assets of the 56 firms is 866 billion
baht (19.7 billion dollars), but they will be auctioned at
discounts ranging from 30 to 60 percent, the FRA said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A public poll conducted by a
major English newspaper in Hong Kong showed that an overwhelming
majority of Hong Kong people back the first budget of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region presented by Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive poll commissioned by the Sunday Morning Post,
the weekend edition of the South China Morning Post, 90 percent of
respondents were satisfied with Tsang's fiscal blueprint for
1998-99, which he delivered at the Provisional Legislative Council
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lower tax rates and higher allowances were among the budget
features most warmly welcomed by respondents, with 92 percent
giving the changes their backing, according to the result of the
poll, which was published Sunday by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bigger relief for dependent parents and grandparents ranked
second, with 91 percent of those questioned in favor.
</P>
<P>
About 84 percent of the respondents approved of the increased
expenditure on education, while 80 percent hailed the new mortgage
tax allowance, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the respondents believed Tsang had struck the
right balance between caution and stimulation in the face of the
Asian economic crisis, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 449 people was conducted on Wednesday and
Thursday, immediately after Tsang announced his financial plan.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Border Trade Bucks Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Although general trade between
China and Russia dipped last year, border trade between the
neighbouring giants hit new heights, according to Business Weekly
of China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs statistics indicate that bilateral trade in
1997 stood at 6.12 billion US dollars, down 10.5 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, border trade conducted by business people in
Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, soared. According to customs
statistics, the region's border trade last year was worth 710
million US dollars, jumping 52.6 percent from 1996. the figure was
35 percent higher than in 1993, the former record year.
</P>
<P>
In Suifenhe, the border trade hub of the region, goods worth
540 million US dollars changed hands, 52 percent up from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the national figure for Sino-Russian border trade is
not yet available, experts believe border trade is experiencing
its second boom after overheating in the 1991-93 period.
</P>
<P>
And, the quality of this boom is better than last time. Experts
said that most of the border trade last year was done by several
large firms. The structure of the trade was also more rational.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Pressure from the woes of
Southeast Asia and the demands of industrial restructuring is
building on China's chemical industry, which is seeking a way out
by exploring overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Developing nations in Africa, Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States will become the priorities in
market expansion, reported today's China Daily quoting Gu Xiulian,
minister of chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
She also encouraged domestic chemical companies to accelerate
investment in Southeast Asia, which is experiencing unprecedented
currency depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged chemical enterprises to establish production
bases for exports and sales in other nations.
</P>
<P>
"The financial turmoil in Southeast Asia will inevitably affect
out exports in 1998, therefore we must spare no efforts to bring
down costs, improve quality and increase productivity," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) has set the target of
this year's exports at 16 billion US dollars, up one billion US
dollars from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The major chemical items for export include dyestuff,
pesticides, tyres, rubber shoes, soda ash and caustic soda.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Keeps Down Oil Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Venezuelan
basket of crudes and by-products exported by Venezuela will
continue dropping because of the downward trend of the prices in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan Energy and Mines Ministry said that the
country's crude price closed last week at 12.08 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
This figure means an 11 dollar cents over the 11.97 dollars in
which the average price was quoted last Friday 13, although it is
7 cents under the 12.15 dollars of Feb 19.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan crudes basket registered last Wednesday its
lowest average level of the last 20 years, when it closed at 11.70
dollars per barrel and a significant advance in the month of
February when it rose 40 cents the next day.
</P>
<P>
Until February 19, the quotation of the Venezuelan basket
averaged 12.81 dollars per barrel, 1.19 dollars below the average
price of liquidation of 14 dollars per barrel estimated in the
budget of the nation for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the matter say there is no signal of recovery for
the prices in two or three months, save for some unexpected change
that could make the market react, but in general the prices will
continue in their downward trend.

LOME, Feburary 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt reached the semi-finals of
the African Nations' Cup on Saturday by beating Cote D'Ivoire 5-4
on penalties after the two teams had played to a goalless draw
after extra time.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will now face hosts Burkina Faso in the semi-finals on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The match was disappointing with both teams stuck in the
midfield and seldom coming to threat on front.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Hossam Hassan, top scorer in the competition with five
goals, was left to battle alone against two or three defenders and
rarely had a scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
And the Cote D'Ivoire attack, which had produced 10 goals in
three first round games, got no change out of a well organised
Egyptian defence.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Februray 21 (Xinhua) -- Holdups to teamsters in
the Brazilian highways caused last year economic losses for more
than 118 million dollars, sector sources said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the Sao Paulo Syndicate of Cargo
Transportation Companies of Sao Paulo and Regions (SETCESP) showed
that 1,069 cargo trucks were held up in all the country, a figure
that represents a 16.06 percent increase over the number
registered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the products most frequently stolen
were textiles and apparel, and foodstuffs. The country registered
in 1997 168 robberies of textile and apparel products, 15 percent
of the thefts of cargo on the roads. The theft of foodstuffs was
second with 128 cases of theft, 11.98 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
SETCESP informed that the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo
registered last year 439 cases of robbery of cargoes, meaning
41.07 percent of the total number of stick-ups.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Brazilian Association of the Frigorifics
Industry (ABIF), said that 64 of its trucks were held up in the
city of Sao Paulo in the last days of this month, causing a loss

<HEADLINE> Anti-War Protest Held in Front of White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 people Saturday
mounted a protest against a possible U.S. air strike on Iraq in
front of the White House.
</P>
<P>
They chanted "No more war" all the way to the front gate of the
White House through city street, holding high a banner which reads
"Do not bomb Iraq."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was at the time holding a meeting
with his foreign policy team on how to proceed with military
preparations during U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's talks with
Iraqi officials on possible ways to defuse the current crisis over
weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that an anti-war protest has been taken
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson were
greeted with anti-war protests at Ohio State University when they
tried to spell out the reason for a military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A protester said he could no longer remain silent on the
Clinton administration's marketing campaign for military action.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to take action if we're going to stop the
killing of a lot of innocent people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another protester said he was "flabbergasted" that the Clinton
administration has decided to contain Iraq with bombing.
</P>
<P>
The size of Saturday's protest surprised passers-by.

<HEADLINE> Development Zones Urged to Emphasize Industrial Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Council's
Office of Special Economic Zones recently called on the nation's
development zones to attach greater importance to industrial
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The call came during a forum on the country's major development
zones held in Langfang Prefecture, north China's Hebei
Province. The office requires development zones to integrate
foreign and domestic funds, while at the same time expanding
exports and maintaining domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Director Wan Jifei stressed that development zones must
intensify industrial restructuring efforts to develop hi-tech
industries and those suitable to local conditions, in addition to
altering their modes of economic growth at the earliest possible
date.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that all the 32 major development zones of the
country recorded 10 percent or more increases in industrial output
value, GDP and export volume during 1997. This in turn signaled
the fact that these zones have entered a profitable period.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Banana Workers' Strike Causes Big Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The strike of more than
4,000 banana workers of Panama's Chiriqui Land Company, now on its
third day, has already caused big losses while some 28,000 heads
of banana per day cannot be processed in time.
</P>
<P>
Experts in banana business estimated a loss of 1.3 million
U.S. dollars a week if the stoppage, which started Thursday,
continued.
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the paralyzing of a dock along the
Pacific coast two months ago.
</P>
<P>
A drop in banana demand along the eastern coast of the United
States prompted Chiriqui to stop using Port Armuelles. Instead,
the company decided to ship the fruit from other ports along the
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
The decision left 270 employees idle at Port Armuelles, and the
striking workers wanted the company to address the needs of the
idle employees.
