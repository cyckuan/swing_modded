Official says Japan's economy may shrink again in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Giving little hope for a quick recovery, a top
Japanese economic official said Sunday that the troubled economy
could shrink again in the fiscal year starting next April, a news
report said.
	   ``There is a considerably strong concern,'' Economic Planning
Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya said on the ``Sunday Debate'' TV
program, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The show is aired by national broadcaster NHK.
	   Japan's economy, the world's second largest, shrank 0.7 percent
in fiscal 1997 and the EPA recently revised the initial projection
of 1.9 percent expansion for the current fiscal 1998 to minus 1.8
percent.

Taylor wins in Ferrari
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASELTON, Georgia (AP) _ Wayne Taylor made it a sweep of North
American endurance races for Ferrari on Saturday by winning the
inaugural Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta.
	   Ferraris had won the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of
Sebring earlier this year.
	   The victory gives Taylor a spot in the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans
in France next year. Taylor won his class Le Mans this year.
	   Taylor, who won the World Sports Car championship in 1994 and
1996, and co-drivers Eric Van de Poele and Emmanuel Collard, of
France, completed 391 laps in just under the 10-hour time limit at
an average speed of 102.0684 mph.
	   Michele Alboreto of Italy, Stefan Johansson of Sweden and Jorg
Muller of Germany finished second in a Porsche LMP1-98, 1:12.520
behind the winners.
	   Thierry Boutsen of Belgium, Ralph Kellener of Germany and Bob
Wollek of France finished third overall and first in GT1 class.
	   The top finishing World Sports Car was the Ford R and S MK III
of Scott Schubot Henry Camferdam, of Indianapolis, and Butch
Leitzinger Leitzinger, the reigning WSC series champion, retained
his 1998 series points lead with one race left.
	   Michel Ligonnet of France, J.P. Janier and Lance Stewart
finished seventh overall and first in GT2 class. The team of Peter
Argetsinger Richard Polidori and Angelo Cilli finished ninth
overall and first in GT3 class.

Baiocchi, Lundstrom and Sigel share second-round lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE M. PETERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAPA, California (AP) _ David Lundstrom would have liked to play
a few more holes.
	   Lundstrom birdied the final six holes at the Silverado Country
Club on Saturday in a 4-under-par 68 that left him in a three-way
tie for the lead after two rounds of The Transamerica senior
tournament.
	   ``How about that?'' he exclaimed. ``I ran out of holes.''
	   After falling to three over par on No. 8, Lundstrom recovered
with the big finish and was at 7-under 137, tied with Hugh Baiocchi
and Jay Sigel going into Sunday's final round.
	   ``The putts started going in and the shots started coming
closer,'' he said. ``I just stayed patient.''
	   Lundstrom, who has four top-10 finishes but no wins this season
and is fighting for an exempt spot on the tour next year, said he
started getting excited after No. 16, his fourth straight birdie.
	   ``That's when I felt, `Wow, I've really got a chance to do
something with this round,''' he said.
	   Baiocchi, ranked fifth on the Senior PGA Tour money list, had
consecutive wins last month at the Comfort Classic and the Kroger
Classic. He had seven birdies in a 67 Saturday under virtually
cloudless skies.
	   ``Those two weeks made quite a huge difference, obviously,''
said Baiocchi, a native of South Africa who played 22 years on the
PGA European Tour. ``I'm enjoying myself a lot more.''
	   Sigel, the two-time US Amateur champion, also shot a
second-round 67.
	   Sigel, who has 11 top-10 finishes this year, including a victory
at the Bell Atlantic Classic, had five birdies to make his run for
the lead.
	   Jim Colbert and John Bland were one shot back at 138, while
Leonard Thompson and Jose Maria Canizares were at 139.
	   John D. Morgan, who shot a 67 in the first round to take the
early lead, shot a 74.
	   Dave Eichelberger, who recovered from three bogeys over the
first four holes for a four-stroke victory here last year, shot a
75 and was at 147.
	   Local favorite Johnny Miller, who lives in Napa, withdrew
because of continued knee problems. He has been sidelined since
breaking a kneecap in a car accident in January.
	   Other no-shows included the three top senior money leaders: Hale
Irwin, Gil Morgan and Larry Nelson.

Cambodian opposition rejects accounting of election ballots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Insisting they lost national
elections because of fraud, Cambodia's two opposition parties
Sunday disputed a new statement by election officials that almost
all the ballots had been accounted for.
	   The National Election Committee said Saturday that a review of
statements written by provincial- and commune-level election
offices had determined less than 200 ballots were misplaced during
the July 26 polls.
	   But opposition politician Pok Than said the statement did not
adequately address allegations that widespread electoral fraud and
intimidation was committed by strongman Hun Sen, whose ruling party
won the race.
	   ``That is not what we are asking for. We want to see the actual
ballots,'' said Pok Than, a new member of parliament for the senior
opposition party FUNCINPEC. ``The 4 million ballots that weren't
used, where are they?''
	   An accounting for all the 9 million ballots was the single
concession the opposition won from Hun Sen in efforts to iron out
the two sides' post-election differences and form the next
government.
	   A spokesman for the junior opposition party led by former
Finance Minister Sam Rainsy added that his party was not satisfied
with the NEC statement.
	   ``Looking at that sheet of paper doesn't show anything,''
spokesman Rich Garella said. ``There is no substitute for seeing
the actual ballots.''
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election,
but did not gain the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to
form the government alone.
	   A series of negotiations between the three parties ended in
deadlock on Friday. The unproductive sessions were abandoned and
Hun Sen's side called for a summit of top party leaders chaired by
King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Pok Than said FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh _ who
has stayed in Bangkok since parliament's ceremonial opening on
Sept. 24 _ agreed in principle to the talks over the weekend.
	   At Hun Sen's request, the king has delayed a trip to Beijing for
medical treatment to try and help break the deadlock.
	   Details of the second summit have yet to be worked out by the
two sides, especially whether Sam Rainsy, a vocal critic of Hun
Sen's, will be asked to participate.
	   Hun Sen's party called for talks to be limited to the ruling
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC, but Pok Than
said his party insists Sam Rainsy must attend.
	   The threat of arrest against opposition politicians that
participated in antigovernment street demonstrations after the
election must also be removed before talks can proceed, he added.
	   Sam Rainsy and others have been summoned by a Phnom Penh court
for questioning about their roles in the protests. The summonses
from the court, widely seen as controlled by Hun Sen's party, have
not been answered.
	   Sam Rainsy and the 14 other members of parliament from his party
have since left Cambodia in what Garella has described as an escape
from intimidation.

	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Jesse Marsch scored with four
minutes to play Saturday night as the Chicago Fire beat the Los
Angeles Galaxy 1-0 Saturday in the opening game of the MLS Western
Conference finals at the Rose Bowl.
	   The Fire were awarded a free kick just outside the penalty area
after Steve Jolley fouled Chris Armas. Goalie Kevin Hartman made a
save on Lubos Kubik's free kick, but the Galaxy defenders failed to
respond and Marsch sprinted to collect the rebound, scoring on a
10-yard shot from the left side.
	   Los Angeles, which set an MLS record this season with 85 goals,
had a chance to tie in the final minute, but Wellington Sanchez's
shot sailed high.
	   Goalkeeper Zach Thornton made three saves for his second
consecutive playoff shutout. Hartman made one save as the Galaxy
outshot Chicago 11-5 and led 4-2 in shots on goal.
	   The second game of the best-of-3 series will be Friday night at
Chicago.

Malaysian police arrest nine at anti-government rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police arrested nine people after
thousands rallied in downtown Kuala Lumpur denouncing Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule, news reports said Sunday.
	   A demonstration of more than 3,000 people Saturday demanding
reforms and the release of arrested dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim
ended peacefully after police urged protesters to disperse.
	   But city Police Chief Kamaruddin Ali was quoted as saying by the
Star newspaper Sunday that nine people were arrested Saturday for
illegal assembly, including one Indonesian.
	   On Sunday, two police helicopters circled the capital's downtown
area. Many protesters had vowed that demonstrations would continue
through the weekend.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy and finance minister on Sept.
2, after they clashed over economic policies. Anwar was arrested 18
days later and faces trial on charges of sexual misconduct and
corruption. He has denied guilt on all charges. The trial begins
Nov. 2.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, police have repeatedly warned against
illegal political gatherings _ defined by Malaysian law as more
than four people.
	   Peaceful rallies have continued, however, drawing a
cross-section of Malaysians to the streets, denouncing their
current leadership, demanding the release of Anwar and the repeal
the harsh Internal Security Act, under which he is detained.
	   Saturday's street demonstration, which lasted five hours, began
when about 7,000 people clogged both sides of a major shopping
street in the downtown Kuala Lumpur area.
	   The crowd later marched to the nearby National Mosque and then
to Independence Square.
	   Some minor scuffles broke out as plain clothed police mixed with
the demonstrators to make arrests. Witnesses said police fired
pepper spray from within the crowd and beat some protesters.
	   After a stand-off of more than 15 minutes, and repeated requests
by the police, the crowd dispersed.
	   Anwar's case has drawn international attention. World leaders
from the United States, the Philippines, Indonesia and elsewhere,
expressed shock and concern after Anwar appeared in court last
month with a black eye and bruises on his body, that he alleged
came from police beatings.

Police blame murder of Indonesia activist on burglar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Police have arrested a man suspected of
murdering a teen-ager who was counseling women raped during
Indonesia's riots in May, and said his motive was robbery.
	   But another woman activist questioned that finding Sunday,
saying nothing was stolen from the victim's home.
	   ``This police statement is totally unbelievable,'' said Ratna
Sarumpaet, an activist with National Coalition.
	   ``Police were too quick to reach a conclusion that it was
robbery. Given how many activists have been threatened, police have
to look into this further,'' she said in an interview.
	   The body of Martadinata Haryono, 17, a counselor with the
Volunteers for Humanity group, was found in her home Friday night.
She had suffered many stab wounds and a slashed neck.
	   Miss Haryono, the first activist to be killed since the May
riots, was a member of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority. Other
activists have received death threats from people demanding they
stop counseling rape victims or investigating their cases.
	   Many ethnic Chinese homes and businesses were targeted by mobs
that killed about 1,200 people during the widespread unrest, which
led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   Human rights groups say at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the unrest.
	   The government has confirmed that rapes occurred, but doesn't
know how many. The military and police have repeatedly said they
have no hard evidence that sexual assault was widespread.
	   On Saturday night, police arrested a neighbor of Miss Haryono's,
22-year-old Suryadi, and said the unemployed man appears to have
killed her when she found him robbing her home.
	   Police had first said that nothing was stolen from Miss
Haryono's home, but Jakarta's police spokesman, Lt. Col. Edward
Aritonang, said Sunday that Suryadi was found with the victim's
imitation jewelry and with his own clothes stained with blood.
	   On Sunday, Miss Haryono was cremated during a Buddhist ceremony
in northern Jakarta. As a wood fire burned beneath her coffin,
about 100 mourners, including members of her Volunteers for
Humanity group, wept and sang songs of mourning.

Survey: Thais see no positive effects of new constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ One year after Thailand adopted a
reformist constitution, nearly 60 percent of Thais see no positive
effects of the new charter, according to a poll released Sunday.
	   Despite vigorous political opposition, the government of former
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh passed the constitution last
October after more than 90 percent of Thais polled said they wanted
it enacted.
	   But 59 percent of the 13,847 Thais surveyed during the first
week of October by the Suan Dusit polling unit said things had not
changed for the better.
	   About 36 percent said the charter had not been effective because
people don't fully understand it, while 29 percent said it simply
wasn't being enforced.
	   The poll had no margin of error.
	   The charter was designed to give Thais more freedoms and civil
rights and provide safeguards against corruption.
	   About 29 percent said the charter had led to greater rights, but
28 percent also said the biggest problem facing the country was
still corruption.

Fleury scores three goals as Flames beat Sharks 5-3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Theoren Fleury scored three goals and assisted on
two others Sunday, leading the Calgary Flames to a 5-3 victory over
the San Jose Sharks.
	   The two teams had tied 3-3 Saturday in their season opener in
Tokyo. This series and two games last season between the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks and the Vancouver Canucks have been the only regular
season NHL games ever played outside North America.
	   Fleury clinched victory with a breakaway with 2:33 left. He
started down the ice alone, stumbled, regained his footing and beat
San Jose goalie Mike Vernon from about 15 feet.
	   The first period was a 1-1 standoff even though the Flames had a
man advantage for a 5 1/2-minute stretch starting at 11:12 because
of a 5-minute game misconduct penalty against San Jose's Bryan
Marchment for checking Jason Wiemer from behind.
	   Fleury put in his own rebound from the left corner of the net at
12:19, while the Flames had a two-man edge with San Jose's Patrick
Marleau also off for hooking.
	   San Jose had scored the first goal at 7:01, also on a power
play, when Bill Houlder flipped in a perfect pass across in front
of the net by Marco Sturm.
	   Starting the second period, Fleury needed only 20 seconds to
score, skating in unchecked from the left for a blast past Vernon.
	   Fleury assisted on the next two goals, which put Calgary ahead
3-1 at 6:37 and 4-2 at 11:41 of the period. First, he drew away the
defense and passed to scorer Derek Morris, left unmolested in the
right faceoff circle. Then, charging across from the bench, he set
up a goal by Dave Roche.
	   San Jose closed the gap to 3-2 and then 4-3 on goals by Tony
Granato at 7:42 and Patrick Marleau at 12:43, both from right in
front of Calgary goalie Ken Wregget. Granato took a pass across
from Dave Lowry, and Marleau was fed from behind by Alex Hicks.
	   San Jose was unable to score in the final period despite three
power plays to Calgary's one.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As many as 175,000 Singaporeans could lose
their jobs next year, nearly tripling the unemployment rate to 9
percent, a newspaper Sunday quoted a government official as saying.
	   Lim Swee Say, deputy secretary-general of the National Trade
Union Congress, was quoted as saying by The Sunday Times that the
regional financial crisis was not the only factor feeding
unemployment.
	   Lim said picky job-seekers and unrealistic employers were also
to blame.
	   ``We have to work hard at changing attitudes,'' Lim said, adding
that employers have to learn to accept older workers, since 40
percent of Singapore's work force is above 40.
	   Singapore's unemployment rate is currently 3.2 percent
	   For years unemployment has been very low in this wealthy nation
of 3.1 million. Though Singapore has been least affected by the
regional economic turmoil, its trade, tourism and financial sectors
have proved increasingly susceptible to the crisis over the past
few months.
	   The grim projection by far exceeds the recession in 1985 and
1986, when the number of unemployed reached 20,000.
	   The government has repeatedly said it will not introduce
unemployment benefits for Singaporeans who lose their jobs, and
that the real solution is to create jobs and retrain the jobless.
	   To keep unemployment low in Singapore, the economy would have to
grow between 2.5 percent and 4 percent a year. But the forecast for
this year has recently been revised downward to between 0 percent
and 1 percent.
	   Lim warned national unity could be at stake if the jobless don't
accept new realities.
	   ``These picky workers staying unemployed would create social
problems,'' he said, adding that ``this sort of social segregation
would weaken national unity and it would be very difficult for any
society to function if people are not united.''

Thai Cabinet will consider options for reviving train project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet will soon be asked
to choose one of four options for reviving the Hopewell road and
rail project that was canceled last year, the Bangkok Post reported
on Sunday.
	   A contract to build the dlrs 3.2 billion elevated road and rail
project was signed by the Thai government and Hong Kong's Hopewell
Holdings, run by magnate Gordon Wu, in 1990.
	   The government canceled the contract last year because the
developer had completed less than 20 percent of its construction.
	   The project was needed to help solve Bangkok's massive traffic
jams and provide a vital commuting link to the site of the Asian
Games, an Olympic-style event Bangkok will host in December.
	   The Post said the Transport and Communications Ministry will
forward four options to restart the project. They are:
	   _ The government chooses a new consortium to run the project
with investment of about dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   _ The project is scaled down and the government allows the State
Railway of Thailand to invest in it using government funds.
	   _ The SRT invests in building the system but a private company
will operate it.
	   _ The SRT will be allowed to take over and invest in the full
project as originally planned.
	   The Post did not say when the Cabinet will be presented with the
four options.

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with
China, has long been the kind of man Beijing just can't help but
like, even though it considers his brother a renegade.
	   Koo, 81, is widely respected and leads a proud and prosperous
extended business family. He is also well versed in the arts and
culture of China and Taiwan.
	   Today, he spends more time handling state affairs than the
multi-billion dollar business empire now run by his relatives.
	   Because of Taiwan's status as an international outcast, Koo,
head of the Koo's Group _ one of the island's largest business
conglomerates _ attends international meetings that Taiwan's
government leaders are prevented from going to.
	   Five years ago, Koo met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan, in the first formal encounter between the two sides since
1949, when they split following a civil war on the mainland.
	   Koo is now given the tough task of resuming regular contacts
that Beijing broke off in 1995, in anger over a Taiwanese drive to
gain international recognition. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade
province.
	   A composed man, Koo has handled the sensitive topic of Taiwan's
independence skillfully with China, which has repeatedly threatened
to use force if the island declares formal independence.
	   China has accused Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, of only
paying lip service to the concept of reunification and of covertly
pushing for Taiwan's independence.
	   But Beijing has never openly questioned Koo's commitment to
reunification, even though his younger brother, Koo Kuan-min, is a
senior member of the island's independence movement.
	   Koo Chen-fu, whose ancestors immigrated from southern China two
centuries ago, has a good knowledge of Chinese culture, and that
suits China, where nationalism runs high.
	   He knows Chinese poetry and literature well. As an opera lover,
he built a theater in Taipei for the performance of Chinese operas
and even sings a few arias himself at social gatherings.
	   In fact, aides say Koo knows the operas so well that he has
drawn his political skills from the stories they contain about
ancient court disputes and fights.
	   His career as an ambassador-at-large dates back to 1956, when
then-President Chiang Kai-shek selected him as an envoy to attend
an international labor meeting in Switzerland.
	   When Taiwan severed diplomatic ties with Japan in 1972, Koo
represented the island to sign a pact with Japan to set guidelines
on their unofficial relations.
	   The past three years, he has represented President Lee at summit
meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, a forum of
Pacific Rim countries that promotes free-trade.
	   Since taking over the family business from his father in the
1940s, Koo has sought to cultivate good connections with the Taiwan
government. He became a member of the ruling Nationalist Party's
decision-making Central Standing Committee in 1981.
	   The Koo's Group, which started with cement and securities, now
includes banking, insurance, real estate, petrochemicals and
television. Much of the family business is run by his two sons and
a nephew, Jeffrey Koo, a banker and also an ambassador-at-large.

Texas A and M stops Nebraska's 19-game winning streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UCLA-Arizona; RECASTS top to fix references to
Texas A and M's streaks against top teams &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Nebraska's 19-game winning streak
was snapped by Texas A and M, which beat the second-ranked
Cornhuskers 28-21 for its first victory over a Top 5 team since
1975.
	   Sedrick Curry's interception with 59 seconds left stopped
Nebraska's final drive, ended the nation's longest major-college
winning streak and handed Huskers coach Frank Solich his first loss
since replacing Tom Osborne.
	   ``We're down and hurt right now,'' Solich said. ``We're not
accustomed to taking a loss.''
	   Nebraska, which has won or shared three of the last four
national titles, lost for just the fourth time in 69 games and
suffered its first defeat since a 37-27 loss to Texas in the Big 12
championship game in 1996.
	   No. 18 Texas A and M beat Nebraska (5-1, 1-1 Big 12) at its own
ground game.
	   The Huskers were outrushed 259-141 by the Aggies (5-1, 2-0). Two
A and M runners gained over 100 yards _ Dante Hall with 113 and
Ja'Mar Toombs with 110.
	   ``We've been so close so many times to beating Top 10 teams like
Florida State and UCLA,'' offensive lineman Cameron Spikes said.
``This time we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot.''
	   Nebraska, which beat A and M 54-14 last December in the Big 12
title game, fell behind 28-7 in the fourth quarter before rallying.
But the comeback fell short when Curry intercepted a pass by Bobby
Newcombe.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Ohio State 41, Illinois 0;
No. 4 Tennessee 22, No. 7 Georgia 3; No. 5 Kansas State 16, No. 14
Colorado 9; No. 6 Florida 22, No. 11 LSU 10; No. 8 Florida State
26, Miami 14; No. 12 Wisconsin 31, Purdue 24; No. 13 Penn State 27,
Minnesota 17; No. 15 Oregon 51, Washington State 29; No. 16 West
Virginia 37, Temple 7; California 32, No. 19 Southern California
31; No. 20 Arkansas 23, Memphis 9; No. 21 Missouri 35, Iowa State
19; No. 22 Notre Dame 28, Arizona State 9; Georgia Tech 47, No. 23
North Carolina State 24; and No. 24 Syracuse 63, Cincinnati 21.
	   In the late game, it was No. 3 UCLA at No. 10 Arizona.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 41, Illinois 0 &QC; 
	   At Champaign, Illinois, Joe Germaine threw for 307 yards and
three touchdowns as Ohio State (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten) shut out
Illinois.
	   The Buckeyes' defense scored a touchdown, kept constant pressure
on Illinois quarterback Kurt Kittner and limited Illinois (2-4,
1-2) to 57 yards rushing.
 &UR; No. 3 UCLA 52, No. 10 Arizona 28 &QC; 
	   At Tucson, Arizona, DeShaun Foster and Keith Brown, the UCLA
tailbacks who took over in the absence of suspended starter
Jermaine Lewis, each rushed for a pair of touchdowns as the Bruins
pulled away from Arizona.
	   Cade McNown passed for two TDs and ran for another as UCLA (4-0
overall, 2-0 Pac-10) won its 14th in a row, the longest winning
streak in Division I.
	   Foster, who rushed for 118 yards in 20 carries, had scoring runs
of 37 and 1 yards in the first half. Brown, with 91 yards in just
nine carries, scored on runs of 54 and 20 in the fourth quarter.
	   Arizona (5-1, 2-1) had its nine-game winning streak snapped.
 &UR; No. 4 Tennessee 22, No. 7 Georgia 3 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, Tee Martin threw two 3-yard TD passes in the
third quarter and Tennessee's defense shut down Georgia.
	   Tennessee (5-0, 3-0 SEC) extended its winning streak over
Georgia (4-1, 2-1) to eight games and handed the Bulldogs their
ninth straight loss at Sanford Stadium against Top 25 opponents.
The Volunteers played without injured running back Jamal Lewis, who
gained 232 yards against Georgia last year.
 &UR; No. 5 Kansas St. 16, No. 14 Colorado 9 &QC; 
	   At Boulder, Colorado, Eric Hickson ran for 137 yards, Martin
Gramatica kicked three field goals and Kansas State withstood a
late Colorado rally to win its 13th straight game.
	   The Wildcats (5-0, 2-0 in Big 12) led 16-0 early in the fourth
quarter before Colorado (5-1, 2-1) rallied. Kansas State matched
the longest winning streak in school history.
 &UR; No. 6 Florida 22, No. 11 LSU 10 &QC; 
	   At Gainesville, Florida, receiver Travis McGriff took a lateral
from Doug Johnson and threw a 49-yard TD pass to Travis Taylor for
the clinching score.
	   The victory avenged LSU's 28-21 upset victory last year and kept
Florida (5-1, 3-1 SEC) one game behind Tennessee in the SEC East.
Mistake-prone LSU (3-2, 1-2) lost its second straight.
 &UR; No. 8 Florida St. 26, Miami 14 &QC; 
	   At Miami, Peter Warrick caught a 62-yard scoring pass and set up
another touchdown with a 50-yard catch as Florida State beat Miami
for the fourth consecutive year.
	   Warrick finished with 190 yards on seven catches for the
Seminoles (5-1). Chris Weinke became only the second Florida State
quarterback in 14 years to beat Miami (3-2) in the Orange Bowl,
throwing for 316 yards and two TDs.
 &UR; No. 12 Wisconsin 31, Purdue 24 &QC; 
	   At Madison, Wisconsin, Mike Echols had an interception in the
end zone and Jamar Fletcher had a 52-yard interception return for a
touchdown as Wisconsin (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) overcame a record-setting
performance by Purdue quarterback Drew Brees.
	   Brees tied an NCAA record with 55 completions _ 18 to Randall
Lane _ and set an NCAA record with 83 attempts. He threw for 494
yards but had four passes intercepted.
 &UR; No. 13 Penn St. 27, Minnesota 17 &QC; 
	   At Minneapolis, Penn State broke open a close game with Corey
Jones' 65-yard TD catch in the third quarter.
	   Penn State (4-1, 1-1 Big Ten), which rallied to beat Minnesota
by a point last year, got a career-best four field goals from
Travis Forney and seven sacks from its defense against Minnesota
(3-2, 0-2).
 &UR; No. 15 Oregon 51, Washington St. 29 &QC; 
	   At Pullman, Washington, Reuben Droughns ran for 217 yards and
scored four touchdowns as Oregon routed Washington State.
	   Akili Smith, the nation's leading passer, was 15-of-22 for 280
yards and three touchdowns for Oregon (5-0, 2-0 Pac-10). Washington
State (3-3, 0-3) had an eight-game home winning streak broken.
 &UR; No. 16 West Virginia 37, Temple 7 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, backup Alvin Swoope rushed for a career-high
141 yards and two touchdowns _ all in the first half _ as West
Virginia won its Big East opener without star Amos Zereoue.
	   Zereoue, the league's second-leading rusher, didn't play because
of a bruised thigh. But the Mountaineers (4-1, 1-0) didn't miss him
against winless Temple (0-6, 0-2).
 &UR; California 32, No. 19 Southern California 31 &QC; 
	   At Los Angeles, Marcus Fields scored on a 3-yard run with 3:30
left as California overcame a 21-point, second-half deficit.
	   Southern California (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10) led 31-10 in the third
quarter, but Cal (4-1, 2-0) scored 16 points in a five-minute span
over the end of the third and start of the fourth to rally for only
its second win in the Coliseum since 1970.
 &UR; No. 20 Arkansas 23, Memphis 9 &QC; 
	   At Memphis, Clint Stoerner made up for a poor first half with a
52-yard TD pass to Michael Williams early in the third quarter as
Arkansas (5-0) beat Memphis (0-5).
	   The Razorbacks led 13-3 at the half even though Stoerner
completed only 11 of 29 passes. His third straight completion of
the second half was good for Williams' first career touchdown.
 &UR; No. 21 Missouri 35, Iowa St. 19 &QC; 
	   At Ames, Iowa, Devin West ran for 252 yards and Corby Jones
accounted for three scores despite a sore toe.
	   Missouri (4-1, 2-0 Big 12) capitalized on a muffed punt and an
interception for touchdowns and hurt Iowa State (2-4, 0-3) on
Jones' option pitchouts to West, whose rushing total was the
second-best in Missouri history.
 &UR; No. 22 Notre Dame 28, Arizona St. 9 &QC; 
	   At Tempe, Arizona, Autry Denson scored twice on 1-yard runs and
A'Jani Sanders returned one of three Notre Dame interceptions 25
yards for another score.
	   Jarious Jackson threw a 7-yard TD pass to Malcolm Johnson for
the Irish (4-1). Arizona State (2-4) was limited to a 22-yard field
goal by Stephen Baker and J.R. Redmond's 1-yard TD run.
 &UR; Georgia Tech 47, No. 23 N.C. State 24 &QC; 
	   At Raleigh, North Carolina, Jason Bostic scored on a blocked
punt and fumble return and Joe Hamilton added three touchdowns as
Georgia Tech used a 28-point second quarter to beat North Carolina
State.
	   The Yellow Jackets (4-1, 3-0 ACC) moved into a tie for the
league lead with No. 9 Virginia. North Carolina State (3-2, 1-1),
which has beaten Florida State and Syracuse this season, had
trouble with its special teams.
 &UR; No. 24 Syracuse 63, Cincinnati 21 &QC; 
	   At Syracuse, New York, Donovan McNabb threw four TD passes in
the first half, including two to Kevin Johnson, as the Orangemen
beat winless Cincinnati.
	   Syracuse (3-2), coming off a 38-17 loss at North Carolina State,
scored on its first five possessions to build a 35-7 halftime lead
against the Bearcats (0-6).

Fleury scores three goals as Flames beat Sharks 5-3

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Theoren Fleury likes to shoot, and he is almost as
dangerous when he doesn't.
	   Even with the defense on the alert, he scored three goals Sunday
in Calgary's 5-3 victory over San Jose. When it crowded him too
closely, he passed to open teammates for the Flames' other two.
	   The Sharks' Mike Ricci had scored with 2:18 left in regulation
for a 3-3 tie in the two teams' season opener in Tokyo Saturday.
This series and two games here last season between the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks and the Vancouver Canucks have been the only regular
season NHL games ever played outside North America.
	   ``As I was skating on to the ice for the third period, a lot of
the Japanese fans were yelling, `One more, one more.' It was nice
to be able to do that,'' said Fleury.
	   ``It was just one of the nights that happen every once in a
while, when every shot you take goes into the net. This will give
us a good feeling to go back to North America,'' said the scorer of
the NHL's only hat trick in Japan so far. In all, he took seven
shots.
	   Tony Granato, who scored one of the Sharks' goals, said,
``Tonight, we got beat by their superstar. He was a one-man show,
and we didn't find a way to neutralize him.''
	   Fleury clinched victory with a breakaway with 2:33 left. He
started down the ice alone, stumbled, regained his footing and beat
San Jose goalie Mike Vernon from about 15 feet (5 meters).
	   The first period was a 1-1 standoff even though the Flames had a
man advantage for a 5 1/2-minute stretch starting at 11:12 because
of a 5-minute game misconduct penalty against San Jose's Bryan
Marchment for checking Jason Wiemer from behind.
	   Fleury put in his own rebound from the left corner of the net at
12:19, while the Flames had a two-man edge with San Jose's Patrick
Marleau also off for hooking.
	   San Jose had scored the first goal at 7:01, also on a power
play, when Bill Houlder flipped in a perfect pass across in front
of the net by Marco Sturm.
	   Starting the second period, Fleury needed only 20 seconds to
score, skating in unchecked from the left for a blast past Vernon.
	   Fleury assisted on the next two goals, which put Calgary ahead
3-1 at 6:37 and 4-2 at 11:41 of the period. First, he drew away the
defense and passed to scorer Derek Morris, left unmolested in the
right faceoff circle. Then, charging across from the bench, he set
up a goal by Dave Roche.
	   San Jose closed the gap to 3-2 and then 4-3 on goals by Granato
at 7:42 and Patrick Marleau at 12:43, both from right in front of
Calgary goalie Ken Wregget. Granato took a pass across from Dave
Lowry, and Marleau was fed from behind by Alex Hicks.
	   San Jose was unable to score in the final period despite three
power plays to Calgary's one.
	   Compared to sellouts last year in the 10,000-seat stadium built
for swimming for the 1964 Olympics, this year's games brought out
crowds of only 8,400 and 7,100, although enthusiasm was high.
	   NHL jerseys were everywhere in the stands, and there were roars
for every goal, every near miss and every angry confrontation on
the ice.
	   This year, the NHL brought its own ice-making equipment and
avoided a repeat of last year's problem, when a pipe under the ice
broke, leaving holes that had to be patched up near the end of the
second game.
	   Steve Solomon, a senior NHL vice president, said the league
probably would not have any regular-season games in Tokyo next
year, figuring the best way to keep up interest would be to stage
regular but less frequent games here.

Nine Russian servicemen released from captivity in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nine Russian servicemen were released from prison
in Chechnya Sunday after negotiations between Chechen officials and
the Russian financier Boris Berezovsky, a news agency said.
	   The Russian Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service
also assisted in gaining the soldiers' release, the Interfax news
agency said, citing unidentified sources in Berezovsky's office.
The report gave no details on the soldiers or how long they had
been held in the breakaway republic in southern Russia.
	   The report did not detail the role played by Berezovsky, the
Executive Secretary of the Commonwealth of Independence States. He
played a role in the release last month of two British hostages
held in Chechnya, though the extent was also unclear.

Yeltsin leaves for central Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin left for central Asia on
Sunday to discuss improving ties with ex-Soviet republics on his
first trip abroad since Russia was hit by a major economic crisis.
	   On his first stop, Yeltsin was to meet Uzbek President Islam
Karimov on Sunday and sign agreements aimed at boosting bilateral
trade, cooperation in the oil industry, and expanding economic
ties, Uzbek officials said.
	   He will then go to Kazakstan on Monday, where he and Kazak
President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on
economic, science and technical cooperation and on combating drug
trafficking.
	   Meeting with reporters last week, Yeltsin said he also planned
to discuss the situation in Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak
counterparts. Russia and the two republics fear an influx of
refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, and possibly a spill over of
fighting that has wracked the country.
	   Despite economic crisis in Russia, Yeltsin has avoided the
spotlight this summer and has spent much of his time at a country
residence outside Moscow. His last trip abroad was to Britain in
May, when he attended a summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations.
	   Yeltsin was to be accompanied by a delegation of officials from
the Federal Border Guard Service, the State Customs Committee, the
Defense Ministry, and the Russian Academy of Sciences, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.

Azerbaijani president expected to win re-election

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Amid a boycott by opposition groups,
Azerbaijan held presidential elections Sunday with an easy victory
expected for the incumbent, who led his oil-rich nation during the
Soviet era and retook power in a 1993 coup.
	   Under sunny skies, polling stations opened in Baku and other
towns. An enormous blimp floating above downtown and hundreds of
posters bearing President Geidar Aliyev's photograph adorned the
city.
	   But the main opposition leaders, who are boycotting the vote
because they said it was unfair, were crying foul over the expected
outcome.
	   They criticized an announcement by the country's main election
commission that voting results would not be known for four days,
calling the delay a chance for the government to commit voter
fraud.
	   The opposition has long claimed that the 75-year-old Aliev, who
took power in a bloodless 1993 coup, is stacking the ballot box in
his favor and has not fulfilled his promises to bring prosperity to
Azerbaijan.
	   The five other presidential contenders are close to the
government and are widely believed to be running only to give the
election the appearance of competitiveness.
	   But stability that has taken hold in the country of 7.5 million
once plagued by war and political chaos worked in Aliyev's favor
Sunday. ``I voted for Aliyev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov.
``Before he became the president we had instability. It was
impossible to do business and a lot of people carried guns. But now
we are moving towards a market economy.''
	   Aliyev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, while other countries in the region have suffered from
endless delays in exploiting the huge reserves.
	   He casts himself as the only candidate capable of continuing the
country's development and market reforms.
	   In preparation for the vote, Aliyev has also tried to rework his
authoritarian image by introducing Western-style election laws,
abolishing media censorship and agreeing to permit limited
anti-government rallies.
	   ``I believe in my victory and I will be a worthy president,''
Aliyev said after casting his vote Sunday. ``My main task has been
the settlement of the (Nagorno) Karabakh problem, and the
strengthening of independence and the economy.''
	   Chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices have meant that
Azerbaijan has yet to enjoy an economic windfall that Aliyev has
been predicting for years.
	   Unemployment remains high and monthly salaries rarely exceed
170,000 manat (dlrs 43). Also, the country's bitter dispute with
Armenia over the Armenian-controlled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh
within Azerbaijan remains unresolved.
	   Aliyev ``has not done anything to return our territory,'' said
Isaak Gamidov, a refugee from the Lachinsky district, which is
occupied by Armenia. ``I don't care that we are very poor because
the main thing now is to return our land, which is occupied by the
enemy.
	   On Friday, police blocked an opposition rally attended by about
10,000 people in central Baku and beat several people demonstrating
against the elections.

Forest fires in Russia's Far East continue to rage out of control 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Huge forest fires are still burning out of control
in Russia's Far East, despite reports last week that firemen had
almost contained the blazes, a news agency reported.
	   Damage from fires in just the Khabarovsk territory is now
estimated at 450 million rubles (dlrs 30 million), the Interfax
news agency said.
	   The blazes across the Far East have destroyed some 1.5 million
hectares (3.7 million acres) of woodlands in recent months. The
fires have killed huge amounts of local wildlife, and threaten the
rare Amur tiger, of which less than 500 are believed to exist.
	   Firefighters have been unable to control the blazes because of
severe funding shortages and an unusually dry summer. It is now
likely the fires will continue burning until snow or rain
extinguishes them, officials say.

Carbon monoxide at reception sickens 162, 13 seriously
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Carbon monoxide gas at a packed
wedding reception sickened more than 160 people, with 13 in serious
condition, authorities said Sunday.
	   Fire-rescue officials blamed a faulty gasoline generator for the
gas buildup inside the reception hall Saturday night, while about
400 people feted a wedding in this working class suburb north of
Paris.
	   Medics examined 260 people on site and released them. But 162
people were found sickened by the gas, 11 of them in serious
condition and two in very serious condition.
	   The injured were rushed to several hospitals in the Paris area.
Forty-eight people remained hospitalized Sunday, authorities said.
	   Police laboratory experts were sent to the hall to investigate.
Authorities suspected the generator that was used to heat the hall.
	   Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can come from
combustion engines, causing headaches, vomiting, unconsciousness,
or even death.

Kidnappers threaten to kill two captives

<TEXT>
	   BASILAN, Philippines (AP) _ Suspected Muslim rebels have
threatened to kill two Filipino traders they separately abducted in
the southern Philippines if ransoms were not paid, an official said
Sunday.
	   The two were among several people, including an Italian
missionary, who remain in kidnappers' hands despite continuing
massive military and police search and rescue efforts.
	   Wahab Akbar, governor of the southern island province of
Basilan, said the kidnappers have relayed the threats but did not
give a deadline for payment of ransom for Michael Diaz, a fishpond
owner, and rice miller Modesto Natividad.
	   Diaz was seized in Zamboanga del Sur province in July and
Natividad was taken in nearby Zamboanga city last month by armed
men believed to be former members of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, one of two separatist rebel groups battling government
forces in the southern Mindanao region.
	   The rebels are believed to have taken the two to a hinterland
area near Basilan's Tuburan town, said Akbar, who is leading
negotiations with the kidnappers for the traders' release.
	   Last week, Natividad asked his family in a letter to sell their
land and other property to raise the two million peso (dlrs 46,500)
ransom being demanded for his release but the family raised only a
small amount, which the abductors rejected, police sources said.
	   Akbar said government troops are massing in Tuburan but families
of the traders have appealed to give civilian negotiators more time
to talk with the rebels, fearing the two, who are being held
separately, could get hurt in a government offensive.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti, the family of a
Taiwanese businessman, two Hong Kong nationals and a Malaysian are
still in captivity after being separately abducted last month in
Mindanao.
	   Ransom kidnappings remain rampant in the Philipines despite a
high-profile government crackdown.
	   On Sunday, anti-crime crusaders turned the funeral in
metropolitan Manila of a Chinese trader slain by kidnappers into a
protest. The trader, Willyson Ong, was shot to death by his
abductors after his family raised only a part of a ransom being
demanded by the kidnappers.

Thousands evacuated from Haifa hills as fire ravages homes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Thousands of Israelis were evacuated from their
homes in the northern city of Haifa Sunday as one of the worst
forest fires in Israel's history ravaged a neighborhood, destroying
several homes and large tracts of forest.
	   The fire, fed by strong winds and hot, dry weather conditions,
burned some 20 homes in the exclusive Deniya neighborhood perched
atop the Carmel mountain range above the Mediterranean Sea. Israel
radio reported that some 5,000 dunams (1,250 acres) of surrounding
forest was also lost.
	   Air force helicopters, airplanes and soldiers were called to
help fight the blaze that fire officials said started overnight in
a nearby picnic area. Local residents said they were awakened by
the smell of smoke as police called on thousands of them to
evacuate the area.
	   The radio said authorities believe the fires were started
accidentally by weekend picnickers in the forest who failed to
properly extinguish fires or barbecues at camping sites.
	   But Haifa fire chief Moshe Ribak said the reason for the fire
was not yet clear and that arson was a possibility. Officials have
blamed several smaller fires in the area over the past few days on
Israeli -Arabs from a nearby town who clashed with troops in a land
dispute recently.
	   Israel radio said the fire was one of the worst in Israel's
50-year history.

Minister blames South Koreans for ship sinking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INVERCARGILL, New Zealand (AP) _ The watch crew of a South
Korean fishing boat which hit rocks and sank, spilling tons of oil,
were at fault in the disaster and the boat's owner would have to
pay for the clean up, Conservation Minister Dr. Nick Smith said
Sunday.
	   South Korean vessel Dong Won 529 foundered on rocks off Breaksea
Island on Stewart Island's eastern tip Tuesday. It sank Thursday
with an estimated 350 tons of diesel fuel on board.
	   ``The first thing would be for the Koreans to steer their boat
properly and not run into rocks _ that is where the primary
responsibility lies,'' Smith said.
	   The full cost of the clean up would rest with those responsible,
not the taxpayer, Smith said.
	   Maritime Safety Authority on-scene commander Ian Niblock said
the affected area had been declared off limits because of the risk
to fisherman from the oil dispersant used.
	   Gale force winds halted oil spill operations in Foveaux Strait
Sunday, but authorities hoped the rough seas would disperse the
remaining fuel leaking from the sunken Dong Won.
	   Niblock said the gusts had come just as crews had begun to bring
the spill under control.
	   ``Any light sheens that are left out there from the diesel oil
will be broken up by the wind without a doubt,'' Niblock said.
``Our concern is that our operations will be stopped.''
	   Contingency plans were in place should the ship break up in the
weather and release more oil, he said.
	   Helicopters and a tug have been using detergent to disperse the
drifting oil, which has spread up to 12 miles (20 kilometers) long
and 2 miles (4 kilometers) wide over the past three days.
	   Most of the ship's diesel fuel oil had seeped from the vessel by
late Sunday, Niblock said, and the worst of the ecological risk was
expected over the next five days.
	   Department of Conservation staff continued ground searches for
oiled wildlife, starting at the southern tip of the spill area, and
making their way to Paterson Inlet, a large bay near the site where
the vessel foundered.
	   Niblock said that while the number of wildlife recovered so far
was low, it could increase in the next few days.
	   ``Although the majority of the oil has now been leaked from the
vessel, it may take some time for birds to be affected,'' Niblock
said. ``Birds that may have ingested oil or have coated feathers
could take a few days to show the effects and then to be found.''
	   The authority said there were no plans to scale down the
operation, already estimated to have cost almost NZ dlrs 500,000
(U.S. dlrs 250,000).

Two strong earthquakes damage buildings in northern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with second strong earthquake also
striking the area. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two strong earthquakes rocked an area
of northern Indonesia and destroyed buildings, but no casualties
were reported, an official said Sunday.
	   The quakes, with magnitudes 6.1 and 5.5, struck the towns of
Donggala and Palu around 11:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) Saturday, said Waan
Tarmin of Meteorology and Geophysics agency in Jakarta.
	   Two houses and a stall in a vegetable market collapsed, and the
walls of scores of other homes cracked in Donggala town in
Sulawesi, an island northeast of Jakarta, Tarmin said.
	   Donggala also lost its electricity, and the Antara national news
agency reported that people who rushed out of their homes refused
to go back inside, fearing aftershocks.
	   In the town of Palu, 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the north,
the foundations of many homes and buildings also cracked under the
force of the temblors, including an office of the Antara news
agency and a hotel, Tarmin said.
	   The epicenter of the first quake was 18 kilometers (11 miles)
northwest of Donggala, and the second one was about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) north of the town.
	   Earthquakes with a magnitude of five can cause considerable
damage, while ones of six can lead to severe damage.

Iran denies German businessman sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that an appeals court
upheld a death sentence on a German businessman convicted of having
a sexual relationship with a Muslim woman.
	   No new ruling has been issued for the 56-year-old Helmut Hofer,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted as saying
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   Hofer's lawyer and several newspapers reported Saturday that the
death sentence against Hofer was upheld by the appeals court.
	   The denial seems to be an attempt by the Iranian government to
mollify Germany, which reacted angrily to news of the verdict.
	   It could reflect, too, infighting within the fractured Iranian
government, where hard-line factions and moderates centered around
President Mohammad Khatami are vying for influence. Hard-liners, in
particular, control the powerful judiciary.
	   The Iranian ambassador in Bonn was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry to hear a protest over the verdict. German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said the court ruling ``inevitably throws a
new shadow on both sides' wish to improve relations.''
	   Mohammadi said that Hofer's case has already been presented to
the supreme court. Another court routinely examined the case for
possible errors before forwarding it, he said.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, a medical student.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   The appeals court had earlier assured German officials that
Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied that he was a
Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had
warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed, relations would sour.
	   Ties between the two had only recently started to recover from
strains caused by a German court's ruling last year implicating
senior Iranian officials in the 1992 assassination of
Iranian-Kurdish dissidents at Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Declaring that the advance of democracy
depends on the progress of women, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced a dlrs 15 million grant Sunday to bolster civil
society in southeastern Europe.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' Mrs. Clinton told the opening session
of the two-day ``Women in the 21st Century conference.''
	   The conference is focusing on the role of women in social issues
confronting southeastern Europe, much of which is still recovering
from a half century of Communist rule.
	   ``Democratic progress depends on the progress of women,'' Mrs.
Clinton told the delegates. ``Economic progress depends on progress
of women. A vibrant civil society depends upon the full
contribution of women.''
	   The first lady said the dlrs 15 million grant will be channeled
through the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of
its democracy networking program.
	   About dlrs 6 million of the grant will be used to support the
work of non-governmental organizations in Bulgaria working to
improve the social and economic status of women in this former
Communist country.
	   In his remarks to the conference, Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov said he hoped the meeting would show that ``besides
banging of weapons from our region, optimistic prognosis for a
better future for southeastern Europe can also be heard.''
	   He was referring to the conflicts which have raged in the
Balkans during this decade, most recently in the Serbian province
of Kosovo.
	   After delivering her remarks, Mrs. Clinton went to visit a
center for former street children in the Bulgarian capital Sofia.
	   The children's facility, the Faith, Hope and Love Center, is
home to 20 children, mainly from Bulgaria's 300,000-strong Gypsy
minority.
	   ``I am very much pleased with conditions here,'' said
14-year-old Stefka Trayanova, whose parents were unable to care for
their 10 children. ``We are all proud that Mrs. Clinton is coming
to see us.''
	   The center is run by the Free and Democratic Bulgaria Foundation
of John Dimitry Panitza, a Bulgarian-born U.S. businessman, with
the cooperation of the British charity Child Hope.
	   Foundation teams provide homeless children with food, clothes
and medical aid. They also have organized literacy classes and
advise the children on crime, sex, drugs and smoking.
	   Mrs. Clinton is to travel to Prague later Monday to meet with
Czech leaders and speak at a conference organized by President
Vaclav Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.

 &UR; Philippine president praises Filipino maids in Singapore in his
first foreign trip
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Estrada arriving in Singapore, meeting with
Filipino maids, ADDS byline
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; With AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada arrived in
Singapore Sunday to address an international economic forum and
strengthen ties with a country once vilified by many Filipinos for
hanging a Filipino housemaid.
	   Estrada's visit to Singapore is his first foreign trip since
assuming the presidency in June. He will deliver the keynote
address to the 7th East Asia Economic Summit sponsored by the World
Economic Forum on Tuesday, and hold separate talks with Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and President Ong Teng Cheong.
	   But his first meeting upon the arrival, as Estrada emphasized,
was with Filipino maids and other members of the Filipino
community.
	   ``You are the saviors of our country,'' Estrada, speaking in
Tagalog, told the gathering of about 2,000 Filipino maids and other
Philippine nationals working in Singapore.
	   ``You are the one supporting our economy, and if it wasn't for
your contribution, our country would be suffering even more,''
Estrada said, adding: ``This is why I came to talk to you first.''
	   About 100,000 Filipinos work as domestic servants or maids in
Singapore, bringing back billions of dlrs into the Philippine
economy. They earn an average of 350 Singapore dollars (dlrs 205) a
month, often toiling many hours a day and living in uncomfortable
conditions.
	   Estrada told the cheering Filipino women he would continue to
work for the poor and the downtrodden. He also said he would work
to have their salaries raised.
	   Estrada is also scheduled to meet with Indonesian President B.
J. Habibie on Tuesday on Indonesia's Batam Island south of
Singapore.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said in Manila the
discussions between the two leaders may include immigration and
refugee problems, as well as fishing and rights to other natural
resources in the area.
	   At the economic summit, Estrada said he would explain steps the
Philippines is undertaking to extricate itself from Asia's 15-month
financial crisis.
	   ``We cannot underestimate the value of putting across these
messages,'' Estrada said in a departure speech, adding he would
invite potential investors to the Philippines.
	   Estrada praised Singapore's strong economy, which he said
enabled it to deflect the effects of the regional crisis ``in a
remarkable way.''
	   The relations between the two countries were suspended in 1995,
when Singapore hanged a Filipino housemaid, Flor Contemplacion, who
was convicted of killing another Filipino maid and the 4-year-old
Singaporean she cared for.
	   Singapore insists Contemplacion confessed, but many Filipinos
believed she was a victim of injustice. Mass protests forced the
Philippine government to withdraw its ambassador, and Singapore
responded by doing the same.
	   Relations between the two countries were officially normalized
in 1996 with the exchange of new ambassadors.
	   Singapore is one of the Philippines' largest trading partners,
with total trade reaching dlrs 3.8 billion last year. Singapore
also is the fourth-largest importer of Philippine products and is
an important source of development assistance.
	   Estrada, accompanied by his wife, Cabinet members and business
leaders, flew to Singapore aboard a Philippine Airlines plane, the
first to make an international flight since the national
flag-carrier reopened after a 13-day shutdown.
	   During his meeting with the Filipino community, Estrada said he
would do his best to save PAL.
	   The debt-laden PAL resumed domestic flights on Wednesday after
settling disagreements with its largest labor union over a
management-proposed recovery plan. It plans to resume regular
international flights later this week.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Concealed in giant swaths of blue
cloth, a woman steps out of the shadows and whispers in accented
English: ``I am an educator. Do you have a job for me, not in
Kabul, in the provinces?''
	   The rancid smell of an open sewer hangs heavy in the
mid-afternoon heat and the bark of stray dogs makes the whisper
barley audible.
	   Another woman outside a blue-tiled mosque eyes a foreigner.
Quickly she tucks her chin to her chest and stoops her shoulders
trying it seems to bury herself deep inside her burqua. She steps
forward her hand outstretched.
	   ``I'm not a beggar, but I have no choice. I need food for my
family,'' says a voice from within.
	   In the beleaguered capital, ruled by Afghanistan's hardline
Taliban religious army, women have been on the receiving end of
most of the militia's Islamic edicts.
	   Women cannot work, girls do not go to school. Women are not
allowed to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.
Taxi drivers routinely are beaten if their fare is a woman alone.
	   Devastated by relentless fighting between rival Islamic
factions, aid workers say an estimated 30,000 widows are among the
hardest hit by the Taliban's rigid rules regarding women.
	   Forced off the job in 1996 when the Taliban took control of
Kabul some women have resorted to begging, others to sending their
young children on to the street to scavenge and beg.
	   These so-called street children in Kabul, according to a survey
by one aid group, is about 28,000.
	   ``There are a a lot of widows in Afghanistan who have lost their
husbands, their bread winners, in the war. . . these women have to
do something for their survival,'' said Huma Saeed, a member of a
small, but vocal Afghan women's group called the Revolutionary
Afghan Women's Association. Their members, like Saeed, are mostly
in neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``They have lost the male members of their family and they
themselves cannot have a job,'' says Saeed. ``Begging is the only
way.''
	   The Taliban defend their edicts in the name of Islam and remind
its critics that the previous rulers of Kabul, led by ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, destroyed the city in four years of
bitter factional fighting that killed 50,000 people, many of them
women and children.
	   They say the streets were not safe from marauding bands of men
who would steal and rape.
	   But for women it seems the Taliban's harsh edicts is taking a
toll on their mental health.
	   At Kabul's only mental health hospital, Dr. Shaheen Shah Wasah,
says since the Taliban takeover the number of women patients is on
the increase.
	   Theirs is a small shabby ward. Even behind closed doors several
women bury themselves in their burqa, lying listlessly on the bed.
Some moan and rock back and forth. Others squat in a corner.
	   Depression is their greatest enemy, says Wasah.
	   ``Some of them were students or teachers or worked in the
government,'' he said. ``Now she is in her home. She has no
picnics. She can't go anywhere . . . anymore. Of course it affects
her brain.''
	   There have been reports, although not documented, that suicide
among women in Afghanistan has increased dramatically in Kabul
since the Taliban takeover.
	   Wasah agreed, but said that suicide in Islamic Afghanistan is
shameful and victims are buried quickly and quietly.
	   ``Many more women are coming to my hospital . . . they are
suffering from depression,'' he said. ``But many more are coming
for medicine and going back home.''
	   But the medicine is running out, says Wasah.
	   International aid workers, who have left Kabul to protest a
Taliban order relocating them to abandoned school dormitories, were
supplying Kabul's only mental health hospital with its medicines.
	   Another week and Wasah's stock of medicines will be gone.
	   ``Then I don't know what I will do,'' he said. ``Maybe I will
take them and leave them outside the presidential palace.''
	   On the street outside the mental health hospital, children
scramble and jostle for a place in front of the World Food Program
bakeries that supply subsidized bread to some of Kabul's poorest.
	   Children, clutching their WFP slip _ proof that they are in need
_ wrap the warm bread in their tattered scarves and trudge back
home.
	   Six-year-old Laila rubs her inflamed eye, squinting into the
sun, as she explains that the bread and rice is the only food her
family is likely to eat that day.
	   ``I come every day . . . there are six of us in my family,'' she
says.

Army: Inquiry shows wounding of news photographer was accidental
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli military said Sunday it had
concluded the wounding of a news photographer during violent
clashes in the West Bank town of Hebron last week was accidental.
	   Hussam Abu Alan, a Palestinian photographer on assignment for
Agence France-Presse, suffered a skull fracture Thursday when he
was struck in the head with a rubber bullet fired by a soldier.
	   The shooting occurred as Palestinian youths approached
Israeli-manned checkpoints and threw rocks at soldiers guarding
Jewish enclaves.
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel had filed an angry
complaint with the government and the army over the shooting and
called for ``a thorough investigation and disciplinary action as
warranted, along with a guarantee the army will take steps to
ensure there is no indiscriminate shooting of journalists in the
future.''
	   In a statement Sunday signed by Brig. Gen. Oded Ben-Ami, the
army said its investigation indicated journalists had been standing
close to the rioters. It also noted Abu Alan was not wearing a
helmet or flack jacket ``and thus he was not identified (as a
journalist) by the soldiers.''
	   Journalists who were present at the time, however, said they had
been standing well away from the stone-throwers, and that not all
of them were wearing helmets and flack jackets.
	   The army said its policy was to allow journalists to carry out
their duties, but that there were inherent risks.
	   ``During such events, being violent as they are, there is always
a chance that members of the media inside a rioting mob can be
hit,'' the army said, adding that ``there is no intention
whatsoever to hurt them.''
	   In the past, Palestinian journalists have complained of being
deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers during disturbances.
	   As of Sunday, Abu Alan remained hospitalized in stable
condition.
	   One Palestinian stone-thrower was fatally shot during the same
clash.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In gray and sometimes drizzly weather,
Poles on Sunday took the final step of Western-style government
reforms by electing new regional and local councils to assume
powers held by the central government during the communist era.
	   During 14 hours of balloting that began at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT),
voters chose from 260,000 candidates to fill 63,767 seats on
provincial, district and various city and neighborhood councils.
Official results were expected Wednesday.
	   Few people were voting Sunday morning, partly due to the autumn
drizzle, but those at a few Warsaw polling stations said they
wanted to show support for Poland's political and economic reforms.
	   ``I believe it can still be better in Poland, although we
already can live a good life after all those years of communism,''
said Barbara Witkowska, a retired accountant who voted in downtown
Warsaw.
	   But officials predicted a turnout of less than 50 percent of the
28.6 million eligible voters, with many people unhappy over
economic hardships such as high unemployment brought by Poland's
post-communist reforms. Being asked to vote a ninth time _ in
either referendums or elections _ since communist rule fell, many
people were expected to ignore the local government balloting.
	   Under the reforms, the number of provinces dropped from 49 to 16
while hundreds of regional, city and town councils city were being
created to take over some of the decision-making power on issues
such as education, roads, housing, water supplies, environment
protection and various services.
	   The new system creates democratic structures at the grassroots
level of government in line with standards of the European Union,
which Poland hopes to join early next century.
	   But Sunday's election was considered more a popularity contest
for Poland's main political parties, as voters confused by the
variety of councils they were choosing were expected to follow
party recommendations.
	   In a backlash against the Solidarity-led rightist central
government, leftist parties with roots in the communist era were
expected to do well.
	   Many Poles are dissatisfied with the broad social and economic
reforms launched by Solidarity after 1989, which introduced
unemployment and raised living costs.
	   Despite the lack of personal freedoms during more than four
decades of communist rule, people were guaranteed jobs and health
care, education and other services were provided by the state.
	   A strong showing by leftist parties would be ironic, as the most
poorly developed regions _ where people would be expected to seek
strong local representation _ are those neglected by communist
rulers of the past.

Aki Takamura wins Takara World Invitational
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANBU, Japan (AP) _ Aki Takamura shot a final round of
1-over-par 73 Sunday and won the 80 million yen (dlrs 650,000)
Takara World Invitational by one stroke over Hiromi Takamura.
	   From midway through the final trek, competition between Aki, the
1996 Japan Women's Open champion, and her overnight co-leader,
Hiromi, seemed like match play, as their nearest contenders lagged
as many as six strokes behind.
	   The two Takamuras, who are not related, remained locked in a tie
for four straight holes through No. 17 before Aki parred the
478-yard (435-meter) final hole, while Hiromi three-putted for a
bogey-6.
	   Hiromi, 45, finished with a 74 en route to a 1-over 289 total,
one shot behind Aki, 26.
	   Aki had a round of four birdies and five bogeys over the
6,226-yard (5,666-meter), par-72 Caledonian Golf Club course, known
for its narrow, doglegged fairways studded with numerous small
mounds, punitive rough and large, slick and undulating greens.
	   Hiromi, winless since her seventh career victory in the 1994
Toyo Suisan ladies, scattered three birdies and five bogeys.
	   Only 50 of the original field of 107 advanced to the final two
rounds. Those who failed to survive the cut at 5-over-par 149
Friday included such big names as American Jane Geddes, Laura
Davies of England and Sweden's Liselotte Neumann.
	   ``It's so difficult today that I just tried to play
conservatively for pars,'' said Aki Takamura. ``I'm happy with the
win although it resulted from her missed putt.''
	   Hiromi missed a 1-meter (3-foot) par putt on the final hole.
	   Aki said she wasn't putting very well and that she has to
further improve her swing and game in order to catch up with Akiko
Fukushima, one of her closest rivals. She and Fukushima joined the
Japan LPGA Tour together in September 1992.
	   Fukushima, the leading money winner in Japan the past two
seasons, skipped the tournament to participate in qualifying play
in Daytona Beach, Florida, for next year's U.S. LPGA Tour.
Fukushima successfully qualified for the tournament on Friday.
	   Aki's victory, her first this season and seventh overall, was
worth 14.4 million yen (dlrs 117,000).
	   Natsuko Noro, winner of the Japan Women's Open in June, went
around in 72 and placed third at 293.
	   South Korean rookie Han Hee-won came in another shot back at 294
after a final round of 72, followed by Nayoko Yoshikawa, who shot a
fat 79 for fifth at 295.
	   Yoshikawa was seeking her 30th career title that would have
given her a permanent exempt status on the tour.

Ethnicity rises as issue in Taipei elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taipei's mayoral race took on strong
ethnic overtones Sunday as incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian cast
himself as the defender of native Taiwanese against more recent
immigrants from China.
	   Seizing on an endorsement of his rival by an elder of the
strongly pro-Chinese New Party, Chen called Nationalist candidate
Ma Ying-jeou a pawn in a campaign to seize back Taipei and ``sell
out Taiwan to China.''
	   ``Here we have Taiwan's Chen Shui-bian against Ma Ying-jeou of
China's New Party,'' Chen told a rally at his campaign
headquarters.
	   Ma, born in China's Hunan province before his parents fled to
Taiwan with the retreating Nationalists, called Chen's statement
backwards and destructive.
	   ``This is of no help to Taiwan's future. This is 20th century
thinking, and what we need now is 21st century thinking,'' Ma told
reporters.
	   Chen's comments followed statements by Hsu Li-nong, considered a
spiritual leader of the New Party, that he would support Ma rather
than the party's candidate, former legislator Wang Chien-hsuan. Hsu
said he felt compelled to back Ma for the sake of the ``larger
direction of the nation'' and to avoid dividing the anti-Chen camp.
	   With less than two months before the election, Chen and Ma are
running neck in neck while Wang has been unable to poll more than 5
percent support in surveys.
	   Only about 20 percent of Taiwanese are recent immigrants from
China or their offspring, but that proportion is higher in Taipei
and the ethnic question is an explosive issue in elections.
	   Ma's candidacy was widely considered linked to efforts to draw
votes from the New Party, whose mayoral candidate four years ago
consigned the Nationalists to a third place finish.
	   Most Taiwanese immigrated to the island as far as 400 years ago,
bringing with them the southern Fujian dialect and mixing with the
island's aboriginal inhabitants. Taiwan was declared a province of
China in 1885, but ruled by Japan as a colony for fifty years
before 1945.
	   Taiwan and China separated again politically in 1949, when the
ruling Nationalists fled to the island ahead of Mao Tse-tung's
Communists.
	   China continues to threaten to use force against Taiwan to
reunify with it, and Taiwanese politicians frequently allude to the
creation of a pro-Chinese fifth column here.
	   Animosity between Taiwanese and recent Chinese immigrants was
fanned by a 1947 massacre of Taiwanese political activists by the
Nationalists and repression of Taiwanese language and culture under
the 1949-1987 martial law regime.
	   But intermarriage and a growing consensus about Taiwan's status
as a de-facto independent nation have done much to smooth
hostility.

Nine Russian servicemen released from captivity in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Eight Russian soldiers and a retired soldier were
released Sunday from prison in Chechnya after negotiations between
Chechen officials and the Russian financier Boris Berezovsky, a
news agency said.
	   Eight of the released men returned to Moscow later in the day,
while one returned to his unit in the north Caucasus, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Berezovsky, who helped spring the release of the men,
accompanied them back to Moscow.
	   The men _ four army officers, three Interior Ministry police,
one border guard and one retired soldier _ had been kidnapped
earlier this year, the report said. It gave no other details on how
long the men had been held in the breakaway republic in southern
Russia.
	   Berezovsky said the release was secured by the Federal Security
Service, Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry. He also pledged to
``continue to make efforts to release the hostages who are still in
Chechnya,'' Interfax reported.
	   The report did not detail the role played by Berezovsky, the
executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independence States. He
helped in the release last month of two British hostages held in
Chechnya, though the extent was also unclear.
	   Citing unidentified sources, the ITAR-Tass news agency said the
servicemen had been released by former rebel leader Salman Raduyev.
	   Meanwhile, Raduyev said Sunday that Russian Presidential Envoy
to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, could be released within the next two
days if Russia ``doesn't take any serious counter-actions,''
Interfax reported.
	   Vlasov, who was kidnapped on May 1, is one of an estimated 400
kidnap victims and prisoners in Chechnya, according to statistics
from Russia's Defense Ministry. Others have said the actual number
is much higher.

Missile forces dismiss 20 mentally ill soldiers in two years.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Twenty Russian soldiers who had access to nuclear
weapons were dismissed during the last two years because they were
deemed mentally unfit for service, a news agency said Sunday.
	   The men were in Russia's strategic missile force, the Interfax
news agency said, citing a report by the Russian Military
Prosecutor's Office. The report gave no further details.
	   More than 650 armed forces personnel and 480 Interior Ministry
troops were also dismissed for similar reasons in the same period,
the Prosecutor's Office report said.
	   The men were allowed to join Russia's military because of the
country's determination to fulfill draft quotas. Many conscripts
flee rather than report for duty in the military, where harsh
conditions and hazing are prevalent.
	   More than 4,000 recruits drafted in the spring of 1998 are in
need of medical treatment, and over 8,700 needed a ``thorough
medical check,'' the report said.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Amid a boycott by opposition groups,
Azerbaijan held presidential elections Sunday with an easy victory
expected for the incumbent, who led his oil-rich nation during the
Soviet era and retook power in a 1993 coup.
	   After five hours voting, more than 31 percent of Azerbaijan's
eligible voters had cast ballots, passing the required 25 percent
minimum voter turnout to make the elections valid.
	   But the main opposition leaders, who are boycotting the vote
because they said it was unfair, were crying foul over the expected
outcome.
	   They criticized an announcement by the country's main election
commission that voting results would not be known for four days,
calling the delay a chance for the government to commit voter
fraud.
	   ``Whoever wins, whether it be Aliyev or someone else, will be
illegitimate,'' said Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition group
Musavat and former speaker of Azerbaijan's parliament.
	   The opposition has long claimed that the 75-year-old Aliev, who
took power in a bloodless 1993 coup, is stacking the ballot box in
his favor and has not fulfilled his promises to bring prosperity to
Azerbaijan.
	   The five other presidential contenders are close to the
government and are widely believed to be running only to give the
election the appearance of competitiveness.
	   But stability that has taken hold in the country of 7.5 million
once plagued by war and political chaos worked in Aliyev's favor
Sunday. ``I voted for Aliyev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov.
``Before he became the president we had instability. It was
impossible to do business and a lot of people carried guns. But now
we are moving towards a market economy.''
	   Aliyev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, while other countries in the region have suffered from
endless delays in exploiting the huge reserves.
	   He casts himself as the only candidate capable of continuing the
country's development and market reforms.
	   In preparation for the vote, Aliyev has also tried to rework his
authoritarian image by introducing Western-style election laws,
abolishing media censorship and agreeing to permit limited
anti-government rallies.
	   ``I believe in my victory and I will be a worthy president,''
Aliyev said after casting his vote Sunday. ``My main task has been
the settlement of the (Nagorno) Karabakh problem, and the
strengthening of independence and the economy.''
	   Chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices have meant that
Azerbaijan has yet to enjoy an economic windfall that Aliyev has
been predicting for years.
	   Unemployment remains high and monthly salaries rarely exceed
170,000 manat (dlrs 43). Also, the country's bitter dispute with
Armenia over the Armenian-controlled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh
within Azerbaijan remains unresolved.
	   Aliyev ``has not done anything to return our territory,'' said
Isaak Gamidov, a refugee from the Lachinsky district, which is
occupied by Armenia. ``I don't care that we are very poor because
the main thing now is to return our land, which is occupied by the
enemy.
	   On Friday, police blocked an opposition rally attended by about
10,000 people in central Baku and beat several people demonstrating
against the elections.

County elections in southern Croatia test for Tudjman's rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBROVNIK, Croatia (AP) _ Voters in this southernmost county
went to the polls Sunday in elections that are likely to test
President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party.
	   More than 100,000 residents are eligible to cast ballots in over
240 polling stations.
	   Independent polls predict that Tudjman's ruling party, the
Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, will be unseated in the county
by a united block consisting of five opposition parties, the Social
Democrats, Social Liberals, Liberals, Peasant party and an Istrian
regional party.
	   Elections were re-called in the county because no party was able
to establish a commanding role in the 40 seat house following
nationwide municipal elections in April.
	   Support for Tudjman's party, which currently holds a majority in
19 of 21 counties, has been steadily deteriorating in recent
months, rocked by a series of financial scandals and a splintering
rift within its ranks.
	   The region, centred around the resort town of Dubrovnik, is a
tourist mecca still struggling to reconstruct itself following
heavy destruction in Croatia's 1991 war with rebel minority Serbs.
	   In a bid to boost his party's sagging chances, Tudjman visited
the ancient city on Friday to open works on a new bridge and tour
war damaged villages.
	   The elections for control of wider Dubrovnik are expected to be
a major litmus test for HDZ ahead of parliamentary elections
scheduled late next year.
	   Voting began at 0700 and will end at 7 p.m. (1700 gmt).
Preliminary results are expected by Monday evening.

Butler apologizes for accusing Ritter of breaking the law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector has
apologized for accusing a former inspector of breaking the law by
speaking out about Iraq's weapons capabilities.
	   Richard Butler had accused the former inspector, Scott Ritter,
of breaking the law by releasing details of information he
collected while on official duty. In an interview earlier this
month, Butler asked Ritter to ``desist from doing that.''
	   Ritter's lawyer, Matthew L. Lifflander, asked Butler to retract
the accusation in a letter Wednesday.
	   ``I apologize to Scott Ritter if he understood that I meant he
broke the American law,'' Butler told the respected Arabic daily
Al-Hayat, which is published in London. ``All that I meant was that
he violated his commitments to the United Nations.''
	   The interview with Butler in New York was published Sunday.
	   Since he resigned Aug. 26, Ritter has spoken out several times
on Iraq's weapons programs, accusing the United States and Britain
of failing to stand behind inspectors.
	   He also accused Butler of bowing to U.S. pressure by halting
surprise inspections of sites.
	   Ritter has been quoted by U.S. and Israeli newspapers as saying
he dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking
information on Iraq's weapons program.
	   Iraq has long maintained that the U.N. Special Commission was
not a neutral agency but worked under the United States and that
some of the arms inspectors were spies, Ritter in particular.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in
1990, which led to the Gulf War, will not be lifted until U.N. arms
monitors certify Baghdad has eliminated all its banned weapons.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two U.S. B-52 bombers _ the first of seven due
within hours _ landed Sunday at a British air base to prepare for
possible NATO air strikes against in Kosovo.
	   The bombers, accompanied by a reconnaissance aircraft and tanker
aircraft, flew in to Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in
Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west of London.
	   The B-52s, capable of carrying cruise missiles, are among 260
U.S. aircraft, mostly already in Europe, poised to take part in
strikes which NATO plans to authorize Monday unless there is a
last-minute deal with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over
the ethnic Alabanian majority in Kosovo.
	   ``There is a way out and the way out for Milosevic is to comply
with the will of the world community, the objectives of the U.N.
Security Council and the United Nations,'' said Defense Secretary
George Robertson, speaking on Sky TV. ``If he does that ... then he
can avoid the use of force, If not, he is on the very last
countdown and the B-52s arrive today.''
	   Robertson added that NATO was determined to act before the
winter because of the plight of thousands of refugees living in the
open after being driven from their homes by Serb forces.
	   ``They are in the forests of Kosovo and the tragedy will come
when the winter comes in and they will need shelter. Then thousands
of people will die,'' he said.
	   Among European members of NATO, Britain has been the most
vociferous in urging strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo.
	   The B-52s arrived from Barksdale air base, Louisiana, a
4,000-mile (6,500 km) journey.
	   ``Our motto here is `any time, every time','' said base
commander Lt.-Col. Sheri Andino. ``The length of time the bombers
stay here at Fairford is a political decision, we are just ready if
we are needed.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke insists
``nothing has changed'' in efforts to convince Yugoslavia to accept
international demands for peace in Kosovo, despite the government's
insistence it has met the demands of the international community.
	   Holbrooke met again Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic,
whose crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo seven
months ago has brought NATO to the brink of airstrikes.
	   Following a late night session which ended after midnight
Sunday, the government's Tanjug news agency issued a statement
saying all conditions necessary for a political settlement had been
met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.
	   But Holbrooke gave no hint of an impending breakthrough, saying
``nothing has changed.'' Calling the situation ``very serious,''
Holbrooke said NATO will meet Monday ``to authorize action'' unless
he achieves a breakthrough for ``a peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   The major obstacle to an agreement appears to be Holbrooke's
demand that Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring
mission which would verify compliance with demands of the U.N.
Security Council.
	   Holbrooke alluded this early Sunday, saying his mission ``will
continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully
verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force.
	   But Holbrooke said ``we certainly don't agree.'' The Serbs
appeared to be separating the demand for verification with the
general conditions laid down by the Security Council.
	   On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines
suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in
sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni
Telegraf bannered: '' NATO Threat Removed?''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
and many of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown after the Kosovo Liberation
Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the troubled
province.
	   Sources close to Milosevic, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he had signaled his willingness to comply with six main
demands in order to head off NATO intervention.
	   Those measures include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo,
allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up serious
talks with the secessionists on the restoration of self-rule which
he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources said Milosevic refused to budge on an additional
demand to deploy an international monitoring force in the
secessionist Serbian province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was
living up to his commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   ``Milosevic won't make any concessions that go against the
interests of the Serbian people,'' Dragan Tomic, a close Milosevic
ally, said Saturday.
	   The weekend of intensive diplomacy signals a glimmer of hope in
efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown in Kosovo that has
killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Showing Milosevic it means business if talks fail, Washington
ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible
intervention.
	   Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, Belgium.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force, which would
include some NATO troops, because Milosevic gained a reputation for
breaking promises during Bosnia's civil war. He also violated a
pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive against the ethnic
Albanian militants.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes _ and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``I think that in this case, Russia will have a right to develop
full-scale military cooperation with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia,'' Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov told NTV television station.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion and
joint Slavic roots.

Magnitude 4.7 quake hits eastern Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.7
struck eastern Taiwan at noon Sunday, rocking a fishing port but
causing no injuries or damage.
	   The quake's epicenter was located 6.8 kilometers (4.2 miles)
south of the city of Hualien, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast
of Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau reported.
	   The quake was felt most strongly in the fishing port of Nanao
just north in neighboring Ilan county, and in Hualien and
Chengkung, a coastal town in southeastern Taitung county, the
bureau said.
	   Taiwan is frequently struck by small magnitude earthquakes, and
five people were killed in the mountains near Chiayi, 200
kilometers (124 miles) south of Taipei, in the aftermath of a 6.2
magnitude quake in July.

Report: Israeli Cabinet to oppose 13 percent withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ahead of a crucial Mideast summit this week in
Washington, Israel's Cabinet will oppose a U.S. initiative for its
troops to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, an Israeli
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Such a declaration by the Israeli government ahead of talks
between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could harm chances to
end months of stalemate and complete a peace deal.
	   Netanyahu was meeting with his inner Cabinet Sunday, including
Ariel Sharon, the foreign minister designate who also opposes the
withdrawal plan, to prepare for the Oct. 15th summit.
	   The summit will center around a U.S. peace plan which calls on
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet, which is dominated by hard-liners who
oppose land-for-peace deals with the Palestinians, is scheduled to
meet Tuesday to discuss the deal, a day before the prime minister
leaves for Washington.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that the Cabinet will
oppose a withdrawal from 13 percent and a proposed future
withdrawal from an additional 1 percent. In addition, the Cabinet
will inform Netanyahu that they will only authorize the
implementation of any deal after the Palestinians fulfill a series
of demands which include disarming militants and annulling sections
of the PLO charter, the report said.
	   Netanyahu has come under fierce pressure from far-right members
of his coalition government who have threatened to topple him if he
goes ahead with another pullback.
	   Israel committed to several withdrawals in a separate peace
accords over one year ago, but has since said it would not be able
to withdraw without specific security guarantees from Arafat that
the land it cedes will not be used as havens for terrorists.
	   Meanwhile, several hundred Palestinians burned Israeli and
American flags and pictures of Sharon at an anti-peace rally in the
West Bank city of Nablus.
	   And in the Gaza Strip, an argument between Israeli and
Palestinians policemen over security arrangements there ended in a
scuffle with one Israeli policeman lightly hurt.

	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to give up his full domination over the
southern Serbian province, and the ethnic Albanian side would have
to settle for less than full independence.
	   Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected that
element, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following the
violence. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but rejects
the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic Albanians,
Serbian sources said.

Egyptian's hand cut off for stealing in Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities cut off an
Egyptian man's right hand by sword Sunday for stealing at Islam's
holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saeed Abdul-Razaq Madkour was convicted of numerous counts of
theft and pickpocketing in the Kaaba mosque, the focal point for
prayers by Muslims around the world.
	   Madkour's hand was amputated in the holy city of Mecca in
western Saudi Arabia, the agency said.
	   Last month, an Afghan man had his right hand cut off for
pickpocketing in the Kaaba mosque.
	   A strict interpretation of Islamic law stipulates the cutting
off of a thief's right hand.
	   Amputations are carried out in a public square on the rare
occasions they are implemented in Saudi Arabia. This was the third
time this year an amputation has been carried out.

Izawa wins Tokai Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYOSHI, Japan (AP) _ Toshimitsu Izawa finally proved that his
victory in the 1995 Japan Open wasn't a fluke.
	   Izawa shot a 4-under-par 68 Sunday for a three-stroke victory
with an 11-under 277 total in the 110 million yen (dlrs 894,000)
Tokai Classic.
	   The Japan Open championship was the 30-year-old Izawa's only
previous triumph in a nine-year career.
	   Izawa, teeing off one stroke off the pace, sank six birdies
against two bogeys over the par-72 Miyoshi Country Club course.
	   Izawa surged ahead, improving his score by two strokes before
the turn, as overnight leader Yasuharu Imano shot a 3-over 39 on
the front nine and fell out of contention with a final round of 76.
	   On the back side, Izawa improved his score by two more shots and
held off a late charge by Nobumitsu Yuhara, who also carded a 68 to
place second at 8-over 280.
	   ``Yes, it took three long years,'' a jubilant Izawa said. ``But
I wasn't thinking about victory, yet. Because of injuries last
year, I've been aiming, so far this season, to win an exempt status
for next year.''
	   The top 50 finishers on the money list at the end of the season
will qualify for the 1999 Japan PGA Tour.
	   ``I hope this win will help me speed up momentum and
confidence.''
	   Izawa collected the top prize of 19.8 million yen (dlrs
161,000).
	   Mark Calcavecchia of the United States turned in a 73 and shared
third place at 283 with Kaname Yokoo, Toshiaki Odate and Mamoru
Osanai.

Report: Israeli Cabinet to oppose 13 percent withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ahead of a crucial Mideast summit this week in
Washington, Israel's Cabinet will oppose a U.S. initiative for its
troops to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, an Israeli
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Such a declaration by the Israeli government ahead of talks
between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could harm chances to
end months of stalemate and complete a peace deal.
	   Netanyahu was meeting with his inner Cabinet Sunday, including
Ariel Sharon, the foreign minister designate who also opposes the
withdrawal plan, to prepare for the Oct. 15th summit.
	   The summit will center around a U.S. peace plan that calls on
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian measures against Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet, which is dominated by hard-liners who
oppose land-for-peace deals with the Palestinians, is scheduled to
meet Tuesday to discuss the deal, a day before the prime minister
leaves for Washington.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that the Cabinet will
oppose a withdrawal from 13 percent and a proposed future
withdrawal from an additional 1 percent. In addition, the Cabinet
will inform Netanyahu that they will only authorize the
implementation of any deal after the Palestinians fulfill a series
of demands that include disarming militants and annulling sections
of the PLO charter, the report said.
	   Netanyahu has come under fierce pressure from far-right members
of his coalition government who have threatened to topple him if he
goes ahead with another pullback.
	   Israel committed to several withdrawals in a separate peace
accords over a year ago, but has since said it would not be able to
withdraw without specific security guarantees from Arafat that the
land it cedes will not be used as havens for terrorists.
	   Meanwhile, several hundred Palestinians burned Israeli and
American flags and pictures of Sharon at an anti-peace rally in the
West Bank city of Nablus.
	   And in the Gaza Strip, an argument between Israeli and
Palestinian policemen over security arrangements there ended in a
scuffle with one Israeli policeman lightly hurt.

Butler apologizes for accusing Ritter of breaking the law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector has
apologized for accusing a former inspector of breaking the law by
speaking out about Iraq's weapons capabilities, according to an
Arabic newspaper.
	   Richard Butler had accused the former inspector, Scott Ritter,
of breaking the law by releasing details of information he
collected while on official duty. In an interview earlier this
month, Butler asked Ritter to ``desist from doing that.''
	   In a letter Wednesday, Ritter's lawyer, Matthew L. Lifflander,
asked Butler to retract the accusation.
	   In an interview published Sunday in the daily Al-Hayat, which is
published in London, Butler did just that.
	   ``I apologize to Scott Ritter if he understood that I meant he
broke the American law,'' the paper quoted Butler as saying. ``All
that I meant was that he violated his commitments to the United
Nations.''
	   Since he resigned Aug. 26, Ritter has spoken out several times
on Iraq's weapons programs, accusing the United States and Britain
of failing to stand behind inspectors.
	   He also accused Butler of bowing to U.S. pressure by halting
surprise inspections of sites.
	   Ritter has been quoted by U.S. and Israeli newspapers as saying
he dealt with Israeli intelligence and the CIA in seeking
information on Iraq's weapons program.
	   Iraq has long maintained that the U.N. Special Commission was
not a neutral agency but worked under the United States and that
some of the arms inspectors _Ritter in particular _ were spies.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in
1990, which led to the Gulf War, will not be lifted until U.N. arms
monitors certify Baghdad has eliminated all its banned weapons.

Psychoanalyst Joseph Sandler dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Joseph Sandler, a distinguished psychoanalyst who
worked in Britain, The Netherlands and Israel, has died. He was 71.
	   London's Guardian newspaper said Sandler, who died Oct. 6, had
cancer.
	   Born in South Africa, Sandler received his initial degrees from
the University of Cape Town, and his doctorate from London
University when he was 23.
	   Under Anna Freud at the Hampstead Clinic, now the Anna Freud
Clinic, in London, Sandler made a major contribution to clarifying
psychoanalytic idea in the language of human relationships.
	   He wrote more than 200 papers and co-authored and edited 44
books.
	   Sandler's teaching career began at London's Middlesex Hospital
in 1967. After working at Leiden University in The Netherlands,
Sandler was founder and director of the Sigmund Freud Center at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University where he was the first holder,
between 1979 and 1984, of the Sigmund Freud professorship.
	   He returned to England to take up the Freud memorial chair at
University College, London, where he had been emeritus professor
since his retirement in 1992.
	   Sandler is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie, also a
psychoanalyst, and three children.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Amid a boycott by opposition groups,
Azerbaijan held presidential elections Sunday with an easy victory
expected for the incumbent, who led his oil-rich nation during the
Soviet era and retook power in a 1993 coup. After five hours
voting, more than 31 percent of Azerbaijan's eligible voters had
cast ballots, passing the required 25 percent minimum voter turnout
to make the elections valid. But the main opposition leaders, who
are boycotting the vote because they said it was unfair, were
crying foul over the expected outcome. They criticized an
announcement by the country's main election commission that voting
results would not be known for four days, calling the delay a
chance for the government to commit voter fraud.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In gray and sometimes drizzly weather,
Poles on Sunday took the final step of Western-style government
reforms by electing new regional and local councils to assume
powers held by the central government during the communist era.
During 14 hours of balloting that began at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT),
voters chose from 260,000 candidates to fill 63,767 seats on
provincial, district and various city and neighborhood councils.
Official results were expected Wednesday. Few people were voting
Sunday morning, partly due to the autumn drizzle, but those at a
few Warsaw polling stations said they wanted to show support for
Poland's political and economic reforms. (POLAND-LOCAL ELECTION)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Insisting they lost national
elections because of fraud, Cambodia's two opposition parties
Sunday disputed a new statement by election officials that almost
all the ballots had been accounted for. The National Election
Committee said Saturday that a review of statements written by
provincial- and commune-level election offices had determined less
than 200 ballots were misplaced during the July 26 polls. But
opposition politician Pok Than said the statement did not
adequately address allegations that widespread electoral fraud and
intimidation was committed by strongman Hun Sen, whose ruling party
won the race. (CAMBODIA-ELECTION FRAUD)

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Forty-three Sudanese died of diarrhea
last week in a government hospital in Omdurman following a scare
over contaminated food, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   More than 160 patients, most of them from poor neighborhoods in
Omdurman, were admitted to the hospital, the independent daily
Akhbar al-Sa'a reported. Omdurman neighbors the capital, Khartoum.
	   In a crackdown last week aimed at preventing disease through
contaminated food, health and police authorities closed down nearly
1,500 food kiosks and put on trial more than 6,000 street vendors.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A special U.S. envoy insists
``nothing has changed'' in efforts to convince Slobodan Milosevic
to accept international demands for peace in Kosovo despite the
Yugoslav president's claim he has met U.N. conditions to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Richard Holbrooke met again Sunday with Milosevic, whose
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo seven months ago
has brought NATO to the brink of airstrikes.
	   Following a late night session which ended after midnight

Milosevic saying all conditions necessary for a political
settlement had been met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.
	   But Holbrooke gave no hint of an impending breakthrough, saying
``nothing has changed.'' Calling the situation ``very serious,''
Holbrooke said NATO will meet Monday ``to authorize action'' unless
he achieves a breakthrough for ``a peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   The major obstacle to an agreement appears to be Holbrooke's
demand that Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring
mission which would verify compliance with demands of the U.N.
Security Council.
	   Holbrooke alluded this early Sunday, saying his mission ``will
continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully
verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force.
	   But Holbrooke said ``we certainly don't agree.'' The Serbs
appeared to be separating the demand for verification with the
general conditions laid down by the Security Council.
	   On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines
suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in
sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni
Telegraf bannered: `` NATO Threat Removed?''
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
and many of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown after the Kosovo Liberation
Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the troubled
province. But the crackdown has left hundreds dead and driven more
than a quarter million civilians from their homes, prompting
renewed international efforts to end the crisis before winter sets
in.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
an international women's conference that the world ``must speak
with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian crisis and
violation of humanity'' in Kosovo.
	   Sources close to Milosevic, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he had signaled his willingness to comply with six main
demands in order to head off NATO intervention.
	   Those measures include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo,
allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up serious
talks with the secessionists on the restoration of self-rule which
he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources said Milosevic refused to budge on an additional
demand to deploy an international monitoring force in the
secessionist Serbian province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was
living up to his commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   ``Milosevic won't make any concessions that go against the
interests of the Serbian people,'' Dragan Tomic, a close Milosevic
ally, said Saturday.
	   The weekend of intensive diplomacy signals a glimmer of hope in
efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown in Kosovo that has
killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Showing Milosevic it means business if talks fail, Washington
ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible
intervention.
	   Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, Belgium.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force, which would
include some NATO troops, because Milosevic gained a reputation for
breaking promises during Bosnia's civil war. He also violated a
pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive against the ethnic
Albanian militants.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes _ and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``I think that in this case, Russia will have a right to develop
full-scale military cooperation with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia,'' Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov told NTV television station.
	   Russia is the Serbs' main ally, sharing bonds of religion and
joint Slavic roots.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   A deal would require Milosevic to give up full domination over
Kosovo, and the ethnic Albanian side would have to settle for less
than full independence.
	   Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected that
element, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following the
violence. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but rejects
the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic Albanians,
Serbian sources said.

Egyptian's hand cut off for stealing in Saudi Arabia

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities cut off an
Egyptian man's right hand by sword Sunday for stealing at Islam's
holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saeed Abdul-Razaq Madkour was convicted of numerous counts of
theft and pickpocketing in the Kaaba mosque, the focal point for
prayers by Muslims around the world.
	   Madkour's hand was amputated in the holy city of Mecca in
western Saudi Arabia, the agency said.
	   Last month, an Afghan man had his right hand cut off for
pickpocketing in the Kaaba mosque.
	   A strict interpretation of Islamic law stipulates the cutting
off of a thief's right hand.
	   Amputations are carried out in a public square on the rare
occasions they are implemented in Saudi Arabia.
	   This was the third time this year an amputation has been carried
out. The hand of a Saudi man convicted of stealing was amputated
Friday.

Rawalpindi holds Australia to honorable draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Ijaz Ahmed celebrated his return to
Test cricket with a fine 60, but it was Muhammad Naveed's resolute
unbeaten century which helped Rawalpindi to hold Australia to an
honorable draw in the four-day game Sunday.
	   Chasing a difficult 393-run victory target in two and a half
sessions, Rawalpindi finished the match at an impressive 263 for
three in its second innings. Australia made 355 in its first
innings and then got a lead of 94 runs after restricting the home
team to 261.
	   Ahmed, who sat out Pakistan's first Test innings, was inducted
in the second Test squad, starting in Peshawar on Oct. 15.
	   Naveed had some anxious moments in the nineties as he played out
24 deliveries without a run when he was on 95. However, he finally
got the three-figure mark when he gently pushed spinner Gavin
Robertson on the side for a single.
	   Naveed remained undefeated on a brilliant 115 which featured 17
boundaries.
	   Naveed and Ahmed were involved in a 120-run century opening
partnership in 128 minutes as Australian bowlers got very little
help from a flat track on the last day.
	   Ahmed hit Collin Miller for a straight six and a four off
successive deliveries and in all hit eight boundaries before he
drove medium fast Michael Kasprowicz straight to Ricky Ponting at
covers.
	   Gavin Robertson captured the wicket of Wasim (38) in the last
session when he had him trapped leg before.
	   Earlier, Australian skipper Mark Taylor remained undefeated on a
patient 62 with Australian second innings folding at 298. The
visitors, who took a substantial 94-run first innings lead thus
setup a 393-run victory target for Pindi in two and a half
sessions.
	   Last man Ricky Ponting (27) gave left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed
his seventh wicket of the innings when he edged to wicktkeeper
Nadeem Abbasi. Ahmed finished with a superb figures of 7-71.
	   Australia now travel to Peshawar on Monday where the second Test
starts on Oct. 15.

Woods blunder means Americans ousted by Spain

 &UR; Eds: will be updated with quotes, final &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods missed a 4-foot putt at
the last after blowing a 4-stroke lead as the United States lost to
Spain in the semifinal of the Dunhill Cup Sunday.
	   After John Daly had won his match against Miguel Angel Jimenez
in another nail-biting finish and with Mark O'Meara trailing Jose
Maria Olazabal by three, Woods and Santiago Luna came to the last
with the Spaniard ahead by one.
	   Putting for an eagle from just off the green, Woods left his
ball only four feet from the hole. Luna then handed the American a
great chance of a playoff when his eagle putt from an almost
identical position only just made the top of the green and rolled
back into the depression known as the Valley of Sin.
	   Luna's follow up putt ended three feet from the hole and Woods
needed to hold his to force a playoff. But he slid it wide and
three feet past and Luna holed his to clinch an upset victory.
	   Woods, who was out in 34 and appeared to be on course to
continue his phenomenal series of low scores here, wound up with a
level par 72 to lose by one. His previous three rounds had gone
66-70-66.
	   Daly, who was 6-up at the turn but level going to the last,
carded 73 to beat Jimenez by two for a personal Dunhill Cup record
of 8-1 having played in the United States' 1993 triumph. O'Meara
limped home with a 76 to lose to Olazabal by four.
	   In the final later Sunday with 300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) at
stake for the winning trio, Spain met defending titlist South
Africa, who downed Australia 2-1.
	   South Africa's David Frost crushed Craig Parry by six after a 72
while Retief Goosen won his ninth Dunhill Cup match in a row with a
71 to beat Stuart Appleby by three and clinch another place in the
final. In the last match, Ernie Els returned a 73 and lost to
Australia's Steve Elkington by one.

It's a long way to go, but NHL says Japan openers worth the trouble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, RECASTS with new quotes
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Both times they've done it, they've been hammered
by coaches and players complaining the trip is just too far to go
for a regular season game.
	   They've had problems with the ice, big cost concerns, and now
even trouble filling the stands.
	   But NHL officials say bringing a couple teams over to Japan to
start the season is still a good idea _ though maybe not next year.
	   The NHL was back in Japan over the weekend with a pair of season
openers between the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks at Tokyo's
Yoyogi Gymnasium, a venue left over from the 1964 Summer Olympics.
	   The game Saturday was a 3-3 tie, and was played before a
spirited but disappointing crowd of 8,400, well under the
10,000-seat capacity.
	   Sunday's 5-3 victory for Calgary featured the first NHL hat
trick in Japan _ Flames' star Theoren Fleury put in three goals and
assisted on the other two _ but still fewer people saw it _ 7,100.
	   The drop in attendance follows sellout crowds when the NHL
season openers debuted in Japan last year, just ahead of the Nagano
Winter Olympics, when the Vancouver Canucks played the Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim.
	   Players and coaches have complained before each trip that the
travel time, jet lag and unfamiliar surroundings are an unwelcome
burden.
	   ``I can tell you that coming over you have a lot of
reservations,'' Fleury said after Sunday's game. He said there were
problems with the ice _ ``there were a lot of holes in certain
parts.''
	   Of course, winning takes the edge off.
	   ``We'll come here anytime,'' said Calgary coach Brian Sutter.
	   Whatever the difficulties, league officials say they intend to
keep spreading the NHL action around.
	   ``What we are in is the entertainment business. For people
around the world to experience it is what we want to do,'' said NHL
senior vice president Steve Solomon. ``Our international objectives
are very important.''
	   Solomon noted that NHL ice hockey has a very strong
international element, with more than 20 percent of the players
coming from outside North America.
	   But he said that while negotiations for future Japan tours are
ongoing, a return next year is unlikely.
	   ``We are still in the discussion stage,'' he said. ``I suspect
we will not be back next year. If we come back, what we will be
looking at is 2000.''
	   He said the league is likely to hold exhibitions or other events
next year in Europe, probably in the preseason, but did not foresee
any actual expansions involving franchises outside North America.
	   ``There are no plans,'' he said. ``It's not something I see on
the radar screen.''
	   Solomon defended the Japan tour, saying that although some
players had complained, most were happy to be here.
	   ``I think overall the attitude of the players is very
positive,'' he said.
	   And though the games failed to fill the 10,000-seat venue,
Solomon said he was satisfied with the level of interest here. He
said the sophistication of the Japanese fans _ many of whom wore
NHL team jerseys or waved team pennants throughout the games _
requires a regular season game, not an exhibition.
	   ``They are very sophisticated,'' he said. ``They know who the
stars are, and they want the real thing. Exhibition games are
possible, but harder to generate interest in.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Six U.S. B-52 bombers, each capable of carrying up
to 20 cruise missiles, landed Sunday at a British air base to
prepare for possible NATO air strikes against in Kosovo.
	   The bombers flew in pairs to Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in
Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west of London.
	   ``This is a warning,'' said Col. Wendell Griffin, detachment
commander, after the aircraft landed,
	   ``We are glad to be here and we are very prepared,'' he added.
`` ... But we are on standby, and we will be ready and able to fly
missions eight or nine hours from now.''
	   He said flying time from Fairford to Yugoslavia would be between
four and 12 hours depending on the route taken.
	   A seventh B-52 which set out on the 4,000-mile (6,500-km)
journey was a spare and turned back, as is customary, to Barksdale
air base, Louisiana, said U.S. Air Force Maj. Robyn Grantham.
	   The B-52s are among 260 U.S. aircraft, mostly already in Europe,
poised to take part in strikes which NATO plans to authorize Monday
unless there is a last-minute deal with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic over the ethnic Alabanian majority in Kosovo.
	   ``There is a way out and the way out for Milosevic is to comply
with the will of the world community, the objectives of the U.N.
Security Council and the United Nations,'' said Defense Secretary
George Robertson, speaking on Sky TV. ``If he does that ... then he
can avoid the use of force, If not, he is on the very last
countdown and the B-52s arrive today.''
	   Robertson added that NATO was determined to act before the
winter because of the plight of thousands of refugees living in the
open after being driven from their homes by Serb forces.
	   ``They are in the forests of Kosovo and the tragedy will come
when the winter comes in and they will need shelter. Then thousands
of people will die,'' he said.
	   Among European members of NATO, Britain has been the most
vociferous in urging strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, the Pentagon said a reconnaissance aircraft and
tanker aircraft would also be based in Britain.

	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)- Forensic experts Sunday began
exhuming more than 240 bodies from the biggest mass grave
discovered so far in Bosnia.
	   The Commission and the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights
found the mass grave five days ago in village of Donja Glumina,
about 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Tuzla in an area controlled
by Bosnian Serbs.
	   The bodies were believed to be those of Bosnian Muslims killed
at the beginning of the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. The grave was found
with the help of witnesses who claimed they saw Yugoslav army
troops bury the remains.
	   The bodies were transported to Tuzla, where experts will try to
identify them.
	   Since 1996, about 1,800 bodies have been already been recovered
from various mass grave in this area, but only a few of them have
been identified.
	   Officials say most of the bodies recovered from mass graves in
the eastern Bosnia region are believed to have been residents of
the town of Srebrenica, overrun by the Serbs in July 1995.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Commission for Missing People,
said he was optimistic that more of those found in the latest grave
will be identified because ``a lot of personal things'' were
recovered with the bodies.
	   Most of the bodies, dressed in civilian clothes, are in military
plastic bags, orderly placed in the mass grave, officials said.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of Muslims demonstrators joined
hands and marched in Turkish towns and cities Sunday to protest a
ban on Islamic-style head scarves in schools and public offices.
	   It was the largest demonstration against the ban since
universities last month refused to register women who failed to
submit ID photographs with bare heads.
	   Protesters, mostly women in scarves or black Islamic chadors,
carried banners reading ``We Want Our Right To Education Back,''
and ``Respect Belief, Free Thought.''
	   Marches took place in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and at least eight
smaller towns and cities.
	   Since chanting anti-secular slogans in Istanbul is illegal,
demonstrators there clapped or blew on whistles instead.
	   The government had declared the nationwide protest illegal and
Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told NTV television it was a
``uprising'' by people hiding behind young girls. Several hundred
people were reported detained nationwide for taking part in the
demonstration.
	   The ban on head scarves is enforced at the urging of the
military, the guardian of Turkey's secular regime. The military
regards scarves as a political statement and radical Islam as a
threat to Turkey's secular system.

Former communists get first chance to govern a German state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By LUTZ JORDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ The former East German communists were
invited to join a state government for the first time Sunday, a
sign of their growing weight in German politics.
	   The Social Democrats in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, who came
out on top in Sept. 27 state elections, offered the ex-communists
talks on forming a government coalition after rejecting a possible
alliance with the Christian Democrats.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism got its chance
because voters swept the Christian Democrats from power in the
economically struggling eastern state, along with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in national elections the same day.
	   Governor-elect Harald Ringstorff announced the offer after
sounding out both the PDS and the Christian Democrats, who had led
a strained coalition with the Social Democrats.
	   Mainstream politicians in Bonn shun the almost exclusively
astern-based PDS as a remnant of the anti-democratic East German
regime. But many easterners feel the party better represents their
interests in a political system dominated by westerners, and the
left's election triumph is changing the picture.
	   The Social Democrats have ruled out working with with the PDS at
the federal level, but party chairman Oskar Lafontaine recently
backed cooperation in state politics as a way to make the
ex-communists more responsible.
	   He told Der Spiegel newsmagazine it would take some of the shine
off the ex-communists and their assertion ``that they would do
everything much better, if only they were allowed to.''
	   The PDS itself has trouble deciding. Party delegates in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania narrowly voted Saturday to leave open
the possibility of staying in opposition and giving only tacit
support to the Social Democrats.
	   Such a model has run another eastern German state,
Saxony-Anhalt, since 1994. The PDS has never officially been part
of a coalition government.
	   Even Kohl's designated heir as chairman of the Christian
Democrats says the traditionally anti-communist party must open up
to former members of the Socialist Unity Party, which once ruled
East Germany.
	   ``We have to accept that there were different life paths when
the country was divided'' during the Cold War, Wolfgang Schaeuble
was quoted over the weekend as telling Focus magazine.
	   Kohl's party lost heavily in eastern Germany in the national
election. Most of the support swung to the Social Democrats, but
the PDS also gained, increasing its voter share to 5.1 percent from
4.4 percent in 1994.

At soldier's funeral, Netanyahu blames Palestinian `incitement'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOMER, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Sunday attended the funeral of a slain female soldier
and blamed her killing on ``incitement'' by Palestinian media.
	   Cpl. Michal Adato, 19, was stabbed to death Friday by a
Palestinian man as she got off a bus at the West Bank settlement of
Tomer, where her family lives. Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
the attacker, who is hospitalized and under arrest.
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian security forces said the assailant,
Imad Rashid Kamil, was mentally unstable and had acted alone. Kamil
told investigators from his hospital bed that God had told him to
kill an Israeli soldier.
	   ``It wasn't in a dream that (God) came to him,'' Netanyahu told
mourners. ``It was each morning when he turned on the Palestinian
radio and television that broadcasts ... words of hate and
incitement and encouragement for murderous acts.''
	   The prime minister repeated his call for Palestinians to stamp
out anti-Israeli groups and incitement as a condition for the
continuation of the peace talks.
	   The Palestinian Authority insisted Sunday that Kamil has been
suffering from mental illness for the past decade. ``Nobody pushed
him to do this act,'' the official Palestinian news agency quoted a
statement from Yasser Arafat's office as saying.
	   The Middle East peace process has been deadlocked for almost two
years, largely over Israeli security demands, including Netanyahu's
insistence that the Palestinian Authority establish a committee to
crack down on incitement against Israel.

Rushdie supporters say new bounty is backlash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Supporters of Salman Rushdie said Sunday that a
new bounty offered by a hard-line Iranian student group to kill the
British author was an expected backlash against Iranian authorities
distancing themselves from an initial bounty.
	   ``This is a very small hard-line group of people who are in a
minority,'' said Carmel Bedford, spokeswoman for the London-based
International Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdief.
	   ``We expected this sort of backlash and fightback,'' she added.
``We are in the run-up to elections in Iran and things are getting
more moderate there. The hard-liners are losing ground and this is
the sort of stunt they pull to regain it.''
	   In Tehran on Saturday, the Association of Hezbollah University
said it has offered 1 billion rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who
kills Rushdie. The group did not say where it would get the money.
	   The student group condemned the government of President Mohammad
Khatami for distancing itself last month from a fatwa, or religious
edict, issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Rushdie,
claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam. A
foundation then offered a reward of dlrs 2.5 million for his death.

Third round of Burundi talks scheduled to begin Monday

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of Burundi peace talks
are scheduled to begin Monday amid Burundi government's veiled
pullout threat if sanctions by regional leaders are not lifted.
	   An aide to the mediator, Tanzania's retired president, Julius
Nyerere, said Sunday the agenda includes forming committee to deal
with various issues, including governance, democracy and security
in the tiny Central Africa nation.
	   Burundi's first Vice President Frederic Bamvuginyunvira is
reported to have arrived in Tanzania on Thursday to discuss the
lifting of sanctions with Nyerere.
	   A sources close to Nyerere said regional leaders are not keen on
lifting the sanctions, imposed when retired army Maj. Pierre Buyoya
seized power in July 1996.
	   ``It will depend on how the military government of Major Buyoya
will conduct itself at this round of talks,'' the source said,
asking not to be identified further.
	   On Saturday, Ambroise Niyonsaba, Burundi's Cabinet minister
responsible for the peace process, called on the lifting of
sanctions, saying to ``continue the talks in a country that has
imposed sanctions would be a problem.''
	   Representatives of interested parties, including the government
of President Pierre Buyoya, political parties, the National
Assembly and the National Council for the Defense of Democracy
(CNDD) _ the political arm of the Hutu rebels _ are to take part in
the talks.
	   Taking part in the talks for the first time will be UPRONA, a
Tutsi-dominated political, whose leader, Charles Mukasi, was
opposed to negotiations with the Hutu-dominated FRODEBU party.
	   Last week, Mukasi was ousted as UPRONA leader and replaced with
Information Minister Luc Rukingama, a Buyoya supporter. to the
talks.
	   Although 65 percent of Burundi's 6 million people are Hutus, the
minority Tutsis who make up 14 percent have controlled the country
for all but four months since independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   At least 200,000 people have died in fighting since the
country's first democratically elected president and a Hutu was
slain by Tutsi paratroopers in failed in 1993 coup attempt.

At soldier's funeral, Netanyahu blames Palestinian `incitement'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOMER, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Sunday attended the funeral of a slain female soldier
and blamed her killing on ``incitement'' by Palestinian media.
	   Cpl. Michal Adato, 19, was stabbed to death Friday by a
Palestinian man as she got off a bus at the West Bank settlement of
Tomer, where her family lives. Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
the attacker, who is hospitalized and under arrest.
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian security forces said the assailant,
Imad Rashid Kamil, was mentally unstable and had acted alone. Kamil
told investigators from his hospital bed that God had told him to
kill an Israeli soldier.
	   ``It wasn't in a dream that (God) came to him,'' Netanyahu told
mourners. ``It was each morning when he turned on the Palestinian
radio and television that broadcasts ... words of hate and
incitement and encouragement for murderous acts.''
	   The prime minister repeated his call for Palestinians to stamp
out anti-Israeli groups and incitement as a condition for the
continuation of the peace talks.
	   The Palestinian Authority insisted Sunday that Kamil has been
suffering from mental illness for the past decade.
	   ``Nobody pushed him to do this act,'' the official Palestinian
news agency quoted a statement from Yasser Arafat's office as
saying.
	   The Middle East peace process has been deadlocked for almost two
years, largely over Israeli security demands, including Netanyahu's
insistence that the Palestinian Authority establish a committee to
crack down on incitement against Israel.

Woods blunder means Americans ousted by Spain

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods missed a 4-foot putt at
the last after blowing a 4-stroke lead as the United States lost to
Spain in the semifinal of the Dunhill Cup Sunday.
	   After John Daly had won his match against Miguel Angel Jimenez
in another nail-biting finish and with Mark O'Meara trailing Jose
Maria Olazabal by three, Woods and Santiago Luna came to the last
with the Spaniard ahead by one.
	   Putting for an eagle from just off the green, Woods left his
ball only four feet from the hole. Luna then handed the American a
great chance of a playoff when his eagle putt from an almost
identical position only just made the top of the green and rolled
back into the depression known as the Valley of Sin.
	   Luna's follow up putt ended three feet from the hole and Woods
needed to hold his to force a playoff. But he slid it wide and
three feet past and Luna holed his to clinch an upset victory.
	   Woods, who was out in 34 and appeared to be on course to
continue his phenomenal series of low scores here, wound up with a
level par 72 to lose by one. His previous three rounds had gone
66-70-66.
	   In the final later Sunday with 300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) at
stake for the winning trio, Spain, a finalist for the first time,
met defending titlist South Africa, who downed Australia 2-1.
	   South Africa's David Frost crushed Craig Parry by six after a 72
while Retief Goosen won his ninth Dunhill Cup match in a row with a
71 to beat Stuart Appleby by three and clinch another place in the
final. In the last match, Ernie Els returned a 73 and lost to
Australia's Steve Elkington by one.
	   With Woods, Masters and British Open titlist O'Meara and Daly, a
Open titlist here, on the lineup, the Americans were strongly
favored to win the 1 million pound (dlrs 1.67 million) championship
for the fourth time.
	   But Woods and O'Meara couldn't maintain their form of the first
three days.
	   ``I had a chance but pulled a couple of putts at the last two
holes,'' Woods said. ``I just didn't hit them the way I liked and
it wasn't good enough to take it into extra holes.
	   ``I had the chance with my putt at the last but I pulled it and
gave him the match. It was a matter of picking the line and
trusting it but I pulled the putt.''
	   Although Daly won, he almost threw his match away too.
	   Daly, who was 6-up at the turn but level going to the last,
carded 73 to beat Jimenez by two for a personal Dunhill Cup record
of 8-1 having played in the United States' 1993 triumph.
	   ``The most important thing was that I won and gave us a
chance,'' said Daly, who double bogeyed the 17th after taking a
penalty drop by the greenside wall, and drove to the back of the
green at the 354-yard last to wind up with a birdie three.
	   ``I drove the green to 20 feet for my eagle at the ninth. That
put me six ahead and I got real conservative from there. I've done
that my last two games and that's not my style. You get defensive
when you're six shots up.''
	   O'Meara limped home with a 76 to lose to Olazabal by four.
	   ``I couldn't read the speed of the greens today,'' said the
American captain, whose previous rounds were 67 against England, 70
against Japan and 68 against Sweden.
	   ``I took two in a bunker at the 13th and my ball moved on the
green at the 16th and I called a penalty on myself.''

Vandal sets fire to critical newspapers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Someone set fire Sunday to about 1,600
copies of an independent newspaper critical of President Franjo
Tudjman's ruling government, officials said.
	   The newspapers, stacked in piles outside a publishing company in
Pula, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) west of Zagreb, were found
ablaze in the early morning before they were to be distributed to
local vendors.
	   Police said the damages amounted to about 8,000 kunas (dlrs
1400).
	   The daily Glas Istre, or Voice of Istra, is a popular paper in
Croatia's north-western peninsula, which is home to many ethnic
minorities. The paper advocates decentralization of government and
greater regional autonomy.
	   Members of the region's most influential political party, the
Istrian regional party, were recently involved in heated debates
with Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union over bilingual
rights.

	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Forensic experts Sunday began
exhuming more than 240 bodies from the biggest mass grave
discovered in Bosnia.
	   The government-run Commission for Missing Persons and the
Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights found the mass grave five
days ago in village of Donja Glumina, about 35 kilometers (22
miles) east of Tuzla in an area controlled by Bosnian Serbs.
	   The bodies were believed to be those of Bosnian Muslims killed
at the beginning of the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. The grave was found
with the help of witnesses who claimed they saw Yugoslav army
troops bury the remains.
	   The bodies were transported to Tuzla, where experts will try to
identify them.
	   Since 1996, about 1,800 bodies have been recovered from various
mass grave in this area, but only a few of them have been
identified.
	   Officials say most of the bodies recovered from mass graves in
the eastern Bosnia region are believed to have been residents of
the town of Srebrenica, overrun by the Serbs in July 1995.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Commission for Missing People,
said he was optimistic that more of those found in the latest grave
will be identified because ``a lot of personal things'' were
recovered with the bodies.
	   Most of the bodies, dressed in civilian clothes, are in military
plastic bags, officials said.

Lebanese man wounded in guerrilla shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired mortar
shells and rockets into Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon on
Sunday, wounding a Lebanese man, security officials said.
	   The guerrilla attack came a day after Israeli troops killed two
guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group.
	   Karim Atwi, 29, and Mohammed Hammoud, 23, were killed Saturday
in a clash with Israeli troops near Rihan, Hezbollah said.
Officials of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army said the men
were trying to sneak into the village in the zone Israel occupies.
	   In apparent retaliation, guerrillas on Sunday opened fire on
Israeli and SLA positions in Rihan, about 10 kilometers (six miles)
north of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied enclave.
	   A Lebanese elderly man was wounded by shrapnel when one of the
shells crashed near his home in Rihan, causing heavy damage, the
security officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word of Israeli or SLA casualties.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading the fight to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
occupied zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territory from guerrilla cross-border attacks.

 &UR; Thousands of fans brave the rain to line route of cycling world
championship's final race

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ A typically-Dutch downpour Sunday
did not deter tens of thousands of fans from lining the route of
the men's road race, the climax of the Cycling World Championships.
	   ``The Dutch just love cycling,'' said Bert Overkleeft, as he
pulled on a waterproof jacket. ``And we are used to the rain.''
	   In a country of 15 million, 12 million people own at least one
bike.
	   Despite a chill wind that whipped rain through the rolling hills
of the southern Limburg province, about 200,000 people were
expected to watch 153 riders take on the 258-kilometer (162.5-mile
mile) course in treacherous conditions.
	   While the bike is mainly functional for the Dutch _ an ideal
means of transport on the thousands of kilometers (miles) of
well-tended cycle paths that crisscross this mainly pancake-flat
country _ professional cycling also has a huge following here with
road racing or recreational cycling among the most popular
participation sports.
	   Attendance at Sunday's race was boosted by legions of Belgian
and German fans _ both neighboring countries are just a short drive
away from this southernmost outpost of the Netherlands.
	   This Dutch town of 18,000 calls itself the beating heart of
Dutch road racing. It is staging the World Championships for the
fourth time and has also hosted two stages of the Tour de France _
precisely because it is less rider-friendly than the rest of the
country.
	   The short but steep Cauberg climb just before the start-finish
line is the last and most challenging hill on a rolling
17.2-kilometer (10.8-mile) course Sunday's competitors were
covering 15 times.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Julio Franco singled home a run in a five-run third
inning to lift the Chiba Lotte Marines to an 11-2 victory over the
1998 Pacific League champion Seibu Lions at Seibu Dome Sunday.
	   Tomohiro Kuroki held the Lions to two hits and one run over six
innings for his 13th victory against nine defeats this season.
	   Franco formerly played for the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   The Lions clinched their second consecutive pennant and 13th
overall last week. They will meet the Central League pennant
winning Yokohama BayStars in the best-of-seven Japan series
starting Saturday at Yokohama Stadium.
	   The Lions meet the Marines again Monday in the league's last
regular season game.
	   In the Central League, rookie Kenshin Kawakami gave up six hits
and three runs over 7 2/3 innings as the second-place Chunichi
Dragons edged the BayStars 4-3 at Yokohama.
	   Kawakami is 14-6 this season.
	   The BayStars play the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Yokohama and the
Hanshin Tigers meet the Dragons at Koshien Stadium on Monday in the
league's last regular season games.

Observer of German post-war conscience wins author's prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Martin Walser, whose novels explore
the conscience of Germans rebuilding the nation after the Nazi era
and World War II, was awarded the prestigious Peace Prize at the
Frankfurt International Book Fair on Sunday.
	   In a ceremony at St. Paul's Church that included President Roman
Herzog, the 71-year-old German author was praised as one of the
country's most important literary figures.
	   Walser's novels and essays ``explained to the world and to
Germans their own country and brought them closer together,'' said
the German Book Trade Association awards committee, which awarded
the 25,000-mark (dlrs 15,300) prize.
	   Walser was an early critic of the Cold War division of Germany.
One of his best known works, the spy novel ``Dorle and Wolf,''
decries the nation's east-west barrier and the political scare
campaigns on both sides of the border.
	   Walser, who has also written for the stage, tries to reconcile
German guilt over the Holocaust with a young postwar generation's
desire to look to the future.
	   He ``struggles with the great paradox of his generation:
objectively not guilty, maybe even having been happy, and at the
same time by birth certificate part of a larger, guilty whole,''
said Frank Schirrmacher, literary editor for the Frankfurter
Allgemeine newspaper.
	   The prize, awarded annually since 1950, is seen as the high
point of the book fair, the world's largest with some 6,500
exhibitors from 105 countries.
	   Last year's winner was Turkish novelist and human rights
activist Yasar Kamal, whose works describe the plight of Kurds in
southeastern Turkey.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ NATO has asked Romania's permission to
use its airspace if the alliance launches airstrikes against
Yugoslavia, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said Sunday.
	   Constantinescu convened the country's Supreme Defense Council on
Sunday to decide how to respond to the request. Romania is anxious
to join NATO, but Yugoslav officials have warned neighboring
countries against being drawn into the crisis over international
demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   ``We will take a decision that will reflect Romania as a factor
of stability and security in the region,'' Constantinescu said
before the meeting. He repeated that Romania wants a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Romania's head of state also said he had conferred on the Kosovo
issue by telephone with the president of neighboring Bulgaria,
Petar Stoyanov.
	   Political leaders said earlier this week that Romania should not
give NATO military support but is prepared to send medics and
backup equipment in the region in case of a NATO air strike.
	   Romania shares a 425 kilometer- (265 mile-) border with
Yugoslavia.

Third round of Burundi talks scheduled to begin Monday

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of Burundi peace talks
is scheduled to begin Monday under the cloud of Burundi's veiled
threat to pull out if regional sanctions are not lifted.
	   An aide to the mediator, Tanzania's retired president, Julius
Nyerere, said Sunday the agenda includes forming committee to deal
with various issues, including governance, democracy and security
in the tiny Central Africa nation.
	   Burundi's first Vice President Frederic Bamvuginyunvira is
reported to have arrived in Tanzania on Thursday to discuss the
lifting of sanctions with Nyerere.
	   A source close to Nyerere said regional leaders are not keen on
lifting the sanctions, imposed when retired army Maj. Pierre Buyoya
seized power in July 1996.
	   On Saturday, Ambroise Niyonsaba, Burundi's Cabinet minister
responsible for the peace process, called for the lifting of
sanctions, saying to ``continue the talks in a country that has
imposed sanctions would be a problem.''
	   Although 65 percent of Burundi's 6 million people are Hutus, the
minority Tutsis who make up 14 percent have controlled the country
for all but four months since independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   At least 200,000 people have died in fighting since the
country's first democratically elected president, who was a Hutu,
was slain by Tutsi paratroopers in failed in 1993 coup attempt.

<TEXT>
	   MIYOSHI, Japan (AP) _ Toshimitsu Izawa finally proved that his
victory in the 1995 Japan Open wasn't a fluke.
	   Izawa shot a 4-under-par 68 Sunday for a three-stroke victory
with an 11-under 277 total in the 110 million yen (dlrs 894,000)
Tokai Classic.
	   The Japan Open championship was the 30-year-old Izawa's only
previous triumph in a nine-year career.
	   Izawa, teeing off one stroke off the pace, sank six birdies
against two bogeys over the par-72 Miyoshi Country Club course.
	   Izawa surged ahead, improving his score by two strokes before
the turn, as overnight leader Yasuharu Imano shot a 3-over 39 on
the front nine and fell out of contention with a final round of 76.
	   On the back side, Izawa improved his score by two more shots and
held off a late charge by Nobumitsu Yuhara, who also carded a 68 to
place second at 8-over 280.
	   ``Yes, it took three long years,'' a jubilant Izawa said. ``But
I wasn't thinking about victory, yet. Because of injuries last
year, I've been aiming, so far this season, to win an exempt status
for next year.''
	   The top 60 finishers on the money list at the end of the season
will qualify for the 1999 Japan PGA Tour.
	   ``I hope this win will help me speed up momentum and
confidence.''
	   Izawa collected the top prize of 19.8 million yen (dlrs
161,000).
	   Mark Calcavecchia of the United States turned in a 73 and shared
third place at 283 with Kaname Yokoo, Toshiaki Odate and Mamoru
Osanai.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In gray and sometimes drizzly weather,
Poles on Sunday took the final step of Western-style government
reforms by electing new regional and local councils to assume
powers held by the central government during the communist era.
	   During 14 hours of balloting that began at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT),
voters chose from 260,000 candidates to fill 63,767 seats on
provincial, district and various city and neighborhood councils.
Official results were expected Wednesday.
	   Few people were voting Sunday morning, partly due to the autumn
drizzle, but those at a few Warsaw polling stations said they
wanted to show support for Poland's political and economic reforms.
	   ``I believe it can still be better in Poland, although we
already can live a good life after all those years of communism,''
said Barbara Witkowska, a retired accountant who voted in downtown
Warsaw.
	   But officials predicted a turnout of less than 50 percent of the
28.6 million eligible voters, with many people unhappy over
economic hardships such as high unemployment brought by Poland's
post-communist reforms. Being asked to vote a ninth time _ in
either referendums or elections _ since communist rule fell, many
people were expected to ignore the local government balloting.
	   After casting his ballot in Warsaw's Wilanow district, President
Aleksander Kwasniewski said any turnout figure above 40 percent
would represent success, while a lower turnout would show the
nation still had to grow as a democracy.
	   Under the reforms, the number of provinces dropped from 49 to 16
while hundreds of regional, city and town councils city were being
created to take over some of the decision-making power on issues
such as education, roads, housing, water supplies, environment
protection and various services.
	   The new system creates democratic structures at the grassroots
level of government in line with standards of the European Union,
which Poland hopes to join early next century.
	   But Sunday's election was considered more a popularity contest
for Poland's main political parties, as voters confused by the
variety of councils they were choosing were expected to follow
party recommendations.
	   In a backlash against the Solidarity-led rightist central
government, leftist parties with roots in the communist era were
expected to do well.
	   Many Poles are dissatisfied with the broad social and economic
reforms launched by Solidarity after 1989, which introduced
unemployment and raised living costs.
	   Despite the lack of personal freedoms during more than four
decades of communist rule, people were guaranteed jobs and health
care, education and other services were provided by the state.
	   A strong showing by leftist parties would be ironic, as the most
poorly developed regions _ where people would be expected to seek
strong local representation _ are those neglected by communist
rulers of the past.

leave for Turkey on Monday in the latest bid by Egypt to calm the

	   Moussa is expected to relay a message from Syrian President

Turkey has threatened to attack its southern neighbor.
	   Syria has denied sheltering the rebels.

India begins work on two 500 mw nuclear reactors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ India has begun work on two nuclear
reactors that will generate 500 megawatts each in five and a half
years, raising the current nuclear power yield of 1,840 megawatts
generated by 10 existing smaller reactors.
	   ``When this unit is commissioned it will be important for the
country because nuclear energy will become an inevitable option not
only for India, but all developing countries,'' R. Chidambaram,
chairman of the Department of Atomic Energy, told scientists and
engineers on Saturday in Tarapore, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north
of Bombay.
	   Atomic reactors are crucial to energy-starved India since it is
cheaper than thermal power.
	   Chidambaram said India's aim of producing 20,000 megawatts of
nuclear power by the year 2020 was hampered by lack of funds.
	   ``Growth is not limited by technology, but availability of
funds,'' he said.
	   The two plants in Tarapore were approved by the Indian
government in 1991, but financial sanction for the project came
only last year.
	   The Nuclear Power Corporation, which builds and operates
reactors in India, secured bank loans for a 10-year period to fund
the Tarapore reactors, said Y.S.R. Prasad, chairman and managing
director of the NPC.
	   Prominent scientists who were in Tarapore for the inauguration
of the project said the reactors were safe and there were no health
hazards for people living near the power plants.

Breakaway faction of Italy's Communists founds new party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A rebellious faction of Italy's hard-line Marxists,
which last week tried to shore up the nation's first center-left
government, made the Communist party break formal on Sunday and
founded a new party.
	   Communist Refoundation fractured last week after its No. 2,
Armando Cossutta, defied party leader Fausto Bertinotti, who
withdraw support for the government over the deficit-cutting 1999
budget.
	   Cossutta resigned as Refoundation's president and his faction
backed Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition in a vote of
confidence. Despite the help, Italy's second-longest government
since World War II fell Friday by a single vote.
	   The creation of Cossutta's new party, the Italian Communists,
badly dilutes the power of Refoundation. Cossutta's faction
represented 21 of Refoundation's 34 seats in the lower house.
	   Communist Refoundation was what was left of Europe's largest
Communist party after the collapse of the Soviet Union inspired
many leftists to move toward the center and form new parties. It
got 8 percent of the vote in the 1996 general election.
	   Although Refoundation was not part of Prodi's coalition, he
depended on its votes to muster a majority in the lower house.
	   With the collapse of Prodi's government, Italy now faces a
number of scenarios: a second Prodi government based on a new
majority, an apolitical government of technocrats, or early
elections, which the center-right opposition wants.
	   Prodi headed Italy's first left-led government and the right
hopes to regain its domination if Italy goes to the polls.
	   Cossutta fears that this is exactly what would happen and in a
speech to about 3,000 followers on Sunday, he blamed Bertinotti for
the crisis and ``opening the door for the worst forces of the
right.''
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has begun consultations with
political leaders and most observers are betting he'll opt for a
so-called ``technical'' government.
	   Cossutta said his new party favors a technical government to
help pass a 1999 budget and get Italy through the launch of the
common European currency in January.

Lebanese man wounded in guerrilla shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired mortar
shells and rockets into Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon on
Sunday, wounding a Lebanese man, security officials said.
	   The guerrilla attack came a day after Israeli troops killed two
guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group.
	   Karim Atwi, 29, and Mohammed Hammoud, 23, were killed Saturday
in a clash with Israeli troops near Rihan, Hezbollah said.
Officials of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army said the men
were trying to sneak into the village in the zone Israel occupies.
	   In apparent retaliation, guerrillas on Sunday opened fire on
Israeli and SLA positions in Rihan, about 10 kilometers (six miles)
north of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied enclave.
	   An elderly Lebanese man was wounded by shrapnel when one of the
shells crashed near his home in Rihan, causing heavy damage, the
security officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word of Israeli or SLA casualties.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading the fight to oust
some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
occupied zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territory from guerrilla cross-border attacks.

Christian group prays for no concessions to Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally
thanked a group of Christian Zionists who came to his office Sunday
to pray he would steadfastly refuse to make peace with the
Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu is to travel to Washington later this week for a
summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat under the auspices of
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Dozens of representatives of the International Christian Zionist
Center went to Netanyahu's office to show support for the hard line
he has taken thus far. They sang, danced, prayed, waved flags and
shook tambourines.
	   ``I think he was really grateful for the love we expressed,''
said Martie Ottens, a spokeswoman for the group.
	   Christian Zionists believe the return of Jews to Israel fulfills
Biblical prophecy and points to an imminent return of the Messiah.
The group opposes Israel's withdrawal from territory in exchange
for peace with the Palestinians.
	   The group also offered prayers at Har Homa, site of a
controversial planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem. Groundbreaking at the site sparked a breakdown of
peace talks in March 1997.
	   Members of the group, which wants to build its headquarters at
Har Homa, gathered there to express support for the project. The
group's founder and director, Jan Willem van der Hoeven, also led
them in prayer for an end to the peace process.
	   Van der Hoeven cited Biblical prophecies of ``false peace'' and
said Arafat cannot be trusted in negotiations.

	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of Burundi peace talks
is scheduled to begin Monday under the cloud of Burundi's veiled
threat to pull out if regional sanctions are not lifted.
	   An aide to the mediator, Tanzania's retired president, Julius
Nyerere, said Sunday the agenda includes forming committee to deal
with various issues, including governance, democracy and security
in the tiny Central Africa nation.
	   Burundi's first Vice President Frederic Bamvuginyunvira is
reported to have arrived in Tanzania on Thursday to discuss the
lifting of sanctions with Nyerere.
	   A source close to Nyerere said regional leaders are not keen on
lifting the sanctions, imposed when retired army Maj. Pierre Buyoya
seized power in July 1996.
	   On Saturday, Ambroise Niyonsaba, Burundi's Cabinet minister
responsible for the peace process, called for the lifting of
sanctions, saying to ``continue the talks in a country that has
imposed sanctions would be a problem.''
	   The groups involved in the talks include the government of
President Pierre Buyoya, political parties, the National Assembly
and the National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD) _ the
political arm of the Hutu rebels.
	   Taking part in the talks for the first time will be UPRONA, a
Tutsi-dominated political, whose leader, Charles Mukasi, was
opposed to negotiations with the Hutu-dominated FRODEBU party.
	   Last week, Mukasi was ousted as UPRONA leader and replaced with
Information Minister Luc Rukingama, a Buyoya supporter.
	   Although 65 percent of Burundi's 6 million people are Hutus, the
minority Tutsis who make up 14 percent have controlled the country
for all but four months since independence from Belgium in 1962.
	   At least 200,000 people have died in fighting since the
country's first democratically elected president, who was a Hutu,
was slain by Tutsi paratroopers in failed in 1993 coup attempt.

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish branch of Haribo, one of the
world's leading candy manufacturers, has started making kosher
sweets to be sold internationally for the Jewish community, news
reports said Sunday.
	   Haribo Spain, whose plant is located in the northeastern city of
Cornella de Terri, makes 50 tons a month of these gelatin sweets,
which are later exported to Israel, the United States, France,
Belgium, the United Kingdom and Argentina, the state news agency
EFE reported.
	   To be certified kosher, the sweets are made following strict
dietary laws that requires rabbis of the Jewish community to
supervise the manufacturing process, the company's director Ferran
Junca told EFE.
	   ``In the sweet world there is little chance of growth unless new
markets can be opened,'' Junco said.
	   Haribo, a family-owned firm, is based in Bonn, Germany. It owns
and operates 14 European plants that make gummi bears, gummi
snakes, gummi fruit and other candy.

Iran denies German businessman sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iranian media criticizing Germany, background on
Hofer's lawyer. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that an appeals court
upheld a death sentence a day earlier for a German businessman
convicted of having sex with a Muslim woman.
	   No new ruling has been issued for the 56-year-old Helmut Hofer,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted as saying
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   Hofer's lawyer and several newspapers reported Saturday that the
death sentence against Hofer was upheld by the appeals court. The
lawyer showed a copy of the verdict to The Associated Press.
	   The denial seems to be an attempt by the Iranian government to
mollify Germany, which reacted angrily to news of the verdict.
	   It could reflect, too, infighting within the fractured Iranian
government, where hard-line factions and moderates centered around
President Mohammad Khatami are vying for influence. Hard-liners, in
particular, control the powerful judiciary.
	   The Iranian ambassador in Bonn was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry to hear a protest over the verdict. German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said the court ruling ``inevitably throws a
new shadow on both sides' wish to improve relations.''
	   On Sunday, Iran criticized Germany for turning Hofer's case into
a political issue that could threaten relations.
	   ``As far as Iran is concerned, Hofer's case is trivial and is a
judicial issue where political considerations do not play a role,''
a commentary on state-run Tehran radio said Sunday.
	   There were conflicting accounts of the appeal Sunday.
	   Mohammadi said that Hofer's case has already been presented to
the supreme court. Another court routinely examined the case for
possible errors before forwarding it, he said.
	   But the head of the court where the trial took place said that
the death sentence had been upheld.
	   The death sentence verdict ``has not been changed,'' Nasser
Seraj was quoted as saying by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper.
	   Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari, was out of town Sunday
and not available for comment. But on Saturday, he said that he had
expected his client to be released.
	   ``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear
Hofer of all charges,'' Qahhari said.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, a medical student.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   The appeals court had earlier assured German officials that
Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied that he was a
Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had
warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed, relations would sour.
	   Ties between the two had only recently started to recover from
strains caused by a German court's ruling last year implicating
senior Iranian officials in the 1992 assassination of
Iranian-Kurdish dissidents at Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under the towering marble figures of the
Jews who founded his church, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed
the first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
	   Every year, he told Catholics, her saint's day must also serve
as a commemoration of all the Holocaust's murdered Jews.
	   ``The value of her testimony is to render ever more solid the
bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he
said.
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square.
	   It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation:
The Roman Catholic Church exercising all its ceremony, pomp and
grandeur in tribute to people of the Jewish faith.
	   Looking on were members of Stein's family, survivors of
Holocaust victims, sharing a stage with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
	   Stein is thought to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
Apostles, but incomplete records, and the prevalence of early-day
conversions, forced and otherwise, make it impossible to say for
certain.
	   Stein was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Germany in
1891, on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. An atheist, she joined
the Catholic church in 1922 and later became a Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, the Nazis ordered all the converts in Holland shipped
to Auschwitz, their way of punishing the bishops of Holland for
speaking out against Adolf Hitler.
	   The Nazis arrested Stein as she prayed in chapel with her
Carmelite sisters. She died at Auschwitz on Aug. 9, 1942.

Miyake kicks off summer shows with exhibition
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Art or fashion? Issey Miyake's exhibition opening
Sunday at the Cartier Foundation for Modern Art was a glorious
combination of both.
	   Clothes shown as puppets on strings were literally jumping for
joy.
	   As an appropriate introduction to a mad nine days of nearly 100
international luxury ready-to-wear shows for summer 1999, Miyake's
exhibition couldn't be beat for class and futuristic appeal.
	   He steers fashion, art and the cyberworld into the next
millennium with his latest techniques.
	   In the opening room called ``Jumping,'' viewers get a great look
at Miyake's styles of the last 10 years, as the jumping wire-puppet
mobiles show his permanent-pleated clothes in fantastic
Japanese-lantern shapes.
	   Suspended from the ceiling, they unfold, then collapse and fold
flat for practicality.
	   This is the line called Pleats Please, made so popular by Miyake
in the past five years, in lower prices for top fashion, around the
dlrs 150 or a bit more per item.
	   ``I would like to make the next generation move in their
fashions, to make people feel free,'' said Miyake as he roamed
around the Exhibition called ``Making Things,'' on until January
17.
	   Miyake loves to collaborate with other artists, who use his
methods and clothes for symbiotic inspiration.
	   There's a squiggly dragon-shaped spot on the Cartier Fondation
floor where last week Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang literally
exploded and burnt a Miyake outfit.
	   He then transferred the gunpowdered patterns onto fabric, in
Pleats Please clothes, hung on the glass walls of the museum.
	   Several other artists' works were on display, including a big
wall hanging quilt made by fusing and ``blowing up'' Miyake designs
as a three-by-eight-meter (12-by-24 foot) pneumatic work inflated
by an air blower.
	   ``His energy and open-mindedness to new ideas are a fabulous
inspiration,'' said artist Tim Hawkinson, 37, of California. ``But
I hated cutting up the Pleats Please outfits.''
	   ``Just before'' is a huge roll of black material; you can see
the dresses coming out from it. ``Shops or customers can gear their
lengths, decolletes, and so on to each shape, cutting as you go, so
to speak,'' said Jun Kanai, of Miyake, New York.
	   With ``A Piece of Cloth'' dresses - whole wardrobes may be cut
from tubes of material, which can be customized by stores or
customers.
	   Miyake, 60, who studied at the Chambre Syndicale fashion school
in Paris and worked briefly at Givenchy, is very aware of women as
wearers of clothes, however high-tech and arty his productions may
seem.
	   ``Yes, I'd like women of the future to participate in the making
of their outfits,'' he said.
	   ``There are no secrets to my methods. Everybody can join in.
It's interactive, if you wish. But remember,'' he said with a wink,
``a computer gives no ideas.''

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Germany qualified for next year's Women's
World Cup on Sunday, tying Ukraine 1-1 in the second game of
European playoffs in Kiev.
	   The draw allowed Germany to advance 6-1 overall in the two-leg
playoff among runners-up in the European group. Four European group
winners _ Sweden, Italy, Norway and Denmark _ have already
qualified for the World Cup set for June 19-July 10, 1999 in the
United States.
	   Birgit Prinz opened scoring for Germany in the 20th minute,
firing from close range when the ball slipped out of Ukrainian
goalie Veronika Shulga's hands as she tried to stop a pass from the
left.
	   Svitlana Fryshko tied up the game in the 50th on a
counterattack.
	   Germany dominated throughout but failed to come through on
numerous scoring opportunities.

Iran denies German businessman sentenced to death

Last miners leave picket outside Russian government building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The last of the protesting miners who camped out
for more than four months at Russia's main government building have
left the site, and some claim they were forced out by police,
strikers said Sunday.
	   The miners had been demanding overdue wages and President Boris
Yeltsin's resignation.
	   The twenty protesters who stayed at the makeshift tent village
after many of their fellow strikers left last week were pushed out
by police Saturday night, and weren't given time to pack up their
belongings, said Konstantin Pimenov, deputy chairman of the
committee that organized the protest.
	   Pimenov said the miners were taken to a police station and 11 of
them were put on a train leaving Moscow later Saturday night.
	   ``More than 200 policemen, showing violence, simply deported
them,'' he said.
	   Six of the miners managed to get off the train at Vladimir,
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of Moscow, and returned to
the capital, Pimenov said. They are now in hiding, and will
probably return to the government building, he said.
	   A police spokesman denied Pimenov's claims, saying the miners
had not been dispersed by anyone.
	   The miners' banners and tents were also removed Sunday.
	   About half of the 50 miners at the site left last week, claiming
they had reached an agreement with the government over their wages.
	   At times there had been as many as 200 after the protest started
June 11, but the miners' numbers dwindled as the protest dragged on
the weather turned colder.

New Sadler's Wells serves theatrical mix, marriage and own water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sadler's Wells, the second-oldest working theater
in London, reopens Monday 315 years young with a dance program and
an entirely new look after a 48 million pounds (dlrs 80 million)
modernization.
	   The low-key building of 1930, the sixth theater on the site, has
been almost totally demolished except for the steel framework and
bits of the auditorium.
	   The 1,500-seat theater is also capitalizing on the natural asset
that gives it half its name _ water from springs beneath the
building is being bottled for sale to patrons and to supply the air
conditioning via a new 650-foot (200-meter) deep borehole.
	   The old well itself has been made a visible feature of the
theater.
	   It used to be under a gangway carpet, and you could feel the
floorboards wobble when you walked over it. Now, it's hoped patrons
will toss money into it to help out with a different liquidity
flow.
	   Another modest moneymaking gambit is to have the theater
licensed to conduct marriages.
	   Richard Sadler founded the theater in 1683. From the 1920s
onward, through the efforts of Lilian Baylis and Dame Ninette de
Valois, it became famous for drama, dance, opera and lyric theater
despite being in Islington, one-and-a-half miles (2.4 kms)
northeast of Leicester Square, the hub of London's theaterland.
	   The rebuilding project has created a landmark by extending the
fly tower used for moving stage sets and displaying the theater's
name on it in bold letters.
	   The auditorium has big screens so that films can be mixed with
opera, dance and drama. It has a proscenium arch, but also a
maneuverable platform, doubling the stage area and permitting
theater-in-the-round performances for the first time.
	   The first scheduled in-the-round work is ``On the Road to
Baghdad'' from a picaresque novel by Turkish-born Guneli Gun, who
lives in Oberlin, Ohio. It will be staged in March.
	   ``It really is a performance space for the next millennium,''
said chief executive Ian Albery. ``We wanted to be able to welcome
the best companies in national and international dance and lyric
theater.''
	   The bulk of the cost of the new building, 36 million pounds
(dlrs 60 million), came from the National Lottery. The theater had
to raise the rest and has still to find 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.6
million).
	   Sadler's first theater was a ``Musike House'' opened 20 years
after the Theater Royal opened in Drury Lane. Then Islington _ now
densely urbanized _ was a place of green fields, orchards, mansions
and gardens.
	   Sadler discovered a well in the garden of his first theater and
turned it into a medicinal spa.
	   On finding two more wells, he named them Sadler's New Tunbridge
Wells after a popular spa in Kent. The name was shortened as
theater buildings succeeded one another over the centuries.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under the towering marble figures of the
Jews who founded his church, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed
the first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
	   Every year, he told Catholics, her saint's day must also serve
as a commemoration of all the Holocaust's murdered Jews.
	   ``The value of her testimony is to render ever more solid the
bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he
said.
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square.
	   It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation:
The Roman Catholic Church exercising all its ceremony, pomp and
grandeur in tribute to people of the Jewish faith.
	   Looking on were members of Stein's family, sharing a stage with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will
leave for Turkey on Monday in the latest bid by Egypt to calm the
mounting crisis between Syria and Turkey.
	   Moussa is expected to relay a message from Syrian President
Hafez Assad to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Egypt's Al-Ahram
newspaper reported Sunday. Its contents were not disclosed.
	   Moussa will later fly to Damascus to relay to Assad the Turkish
response, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Turkey has demanded that Syria end its support for Kurdish
rebels, expel a Kurdish leader and close Kurdish rebel camps in
Syrian-controlled Lebanon. If Syria does not abide by the demands,
Turkey has threatened to attack its southern neighbor.
	   Syria has denied sheltering the rebels.

Tough energy issues dominate German coalition talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens met
Sunday to settle plans for higher energy taxes and discuss
scrapping nuclear power, two of the toughest topics in talks on
forming a new center-left government.
	   The issues are vital to the environmentalist Greens, junior
partner in the negotiations. But Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder, who campaigned as a friend of business, says he's giving
priority to jobs and economic growth.
	   Both party platforms call for shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear
power plants, a prospect that already has utilities threatening to
sue the government for billions of marks.
	   Schroeder says he wants to try to reach an agreement with the
nuclear industry to begin decommissioning nuclear plants. But
Greens leaders are looking for a firm and swift timetable.
	   With double-digit unemployment weighing down the new government
from the start, both sides say they want tax reform as a way to
spur the economy and create jobs.
	   Negotiators reportedly agreed on a modest rise in gasoline
prices of 6 pfennigs (3.75 cents) even before party leaders met in
a building on the Rhine River in Bonn.
	   Schroeder, who sits on the supervisory board of Volkswagen, has
balked at a sharper increase demanded by the Greens.
	   But proposals to raise prices of heating oil and electricity
were also on the table Sunday.
	   Walter Riester, Schroeder's designated labor minister, was
quoted Sunday as saying that the ``ecological tax reform'' was
needed even if it killed jobs at first.
	   ``The worst would be failure to carry out important structural
changes,'' he told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
	   German industry organizations lashed out at the emerging tax
plans over the weekend.
	   Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the Federation of German Industry,
said they amounted to a ``massive increase in the burden on
business'' and would lead to layoffs.
	   However, the Social Democrats say energy-intensive industries,
including automakers, would be largely spared from the new taxes.
	   The incoming government wants to raise energy prices to finance
a cut in contributions to lavish welfare-state benefits _ a burden
shared by companies and employees. The charges make German labor
among the world's most expensive.
	   Negotiators have already agreed on the outlines of other tax
measures: relief for average wage earners, closing loopholes, and
curbing tax breaks for business and well-off individuals.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A new trial of former officials of the Kuwait Oil
Tankers Company accused of embezzling millions of dollars has
opened in Kuwait, Al-Qabas daily reported Sunday.
	   A criminal court had in June 1996 sentenced two Kuwaitis, Hassan
Qabazard and Abdul-Fattah al-Bader, and a Jordanian, Nassim Mohsen,
to up to 40 years in prison. It also ordered them to jointly repay
dlrs 63 million and fined them for the same amount. A British
defendant was acquitted.
	   But an appeals court canceled the convictions in March 1997
because the papers were not dated, and therefore not valid as
official documents.
	   Al-Qabas said the court started hearing the case again on
Saturday. None of the defendants was in Kuwait.
	   Former oil minister and member of the ruling family, Sheik Ali
al-Khalifa al-Sabah, who was accused in the same case is not on
trial.
	   The case against him was dropped, also on a technicality, after
years of maneuvering in several courts. He was accused of ``making
it possible'' for the tanker company officials to embezzle the
public funds.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Foreign investment in the Amman stock
exchange declined by 15 percent to 46 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 64.7 million) in nine months this year, an official said
Sunday.
	   The decline was caused by modest profits made by local firms,
which discouraged investors from coming to the floor, said Bassam
Saket, chairman of the Jordan Securities Commission overseeing the
bourse.
	   He said between January and September this year, non-Jordanian
investors bought shares and stocks worth 97 million dinars (dlrs
136.6 million) and sold what is worth 51 million dinars (dlrs 71.8
million).
	   The Amman bourse is one of the emerging markets in the Arab
world. But political tension between Jordan's neighbors and a
stalemate in Arab-Israeli peace is keeping the cash away from the
market.

Government seeks full cease-fire with southern rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan declared Sunday it wanted a full
cease-fire with southern rebels, but stopped short of agreeing to
adhere to the partial truce that rebels declared last week.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said Thursday that it would
extend by another three months a cease-fire set to end Wednesday in
southern Bahr el-Ghazal province. The truce was designed to allow
relief food to reach civilians stricken by famine.
	   The government has not officially responded.
	   But a statement issued by the office of state minister for
foreign affairs, Bishop Gabriel Roreg, said the government hoped to
``realize peace in the homeland in a comprehensive cease-fire.''
	   The statement called ``on those working with humanitarian groups
to exercise pressure on the rebels ... to halt the shedding of
blood and end the suffering of civilians in the south.''
	   Sudan's army warned that rebels might use the truce to rearm.
	   ``We in the armed forces believe the cease-fire will benefit the
rebel movement'' because the rebels will use the time to prepare
for future fighting, Sudan's army spokesman. Lt. Gen. Abdul-Rahman
Sirul-Khatim, said Saturday.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years, pitting
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy against the
government in the Muslim, Arab north. About 1 1/2 million people
have died in the war and famines caused by the fighting.

Greek municipal ballots seen as test of Socialist policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: To be led after polls close at 1600 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Traveling by car, planes and ferries,
Greeks returned to their hometowns Sunday to cast ballots in a huge
range of municipal elections that were seen as a gauge of the
strength of the governing Socialist party.
	   The races _ ranging from the Athens mayoral contest to hundreds
of city hall and district seats around the country _ were being
widely interpreted as a referendum on government policies,
particularly the economic austerity measures designed to earn the
European Union's poorest country a spot in the bloc's single
currency group by 2001.
	   Many labor groups _ traditional Socialist backers _ have
objected to Premier Costas Simitis' aggressive privatization plans
and efforts to trim Greece's overstaffed public sector.
	   A strong showing by conservative and other opposition candidates
could be a significant setback for the powerful Socialists two
years before general elections. It could also force a rethinking of
the hard-line strategy to take part in the monetary union.
	   Millions of Greeks returned to their places of birth to vote
because of complicated red tape involved in registering their new
residences. More than half of Greece's 10.2 million people live in
the greater Athens area. Voting in Greece is mandatory.
	   Even the city's mayor, Dimitris Avramopoulos, couldn't vote for
himself. He traveled to the tiny mountain village of Elliniko,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) southwest of Athens, to cast his
ballot.
	   Avramopoulos, who is expected to be re-elected in a landslide
vote, is considered a possible conservative challenger to Simitis
in the 2000 elections.
	   Other major cities electing mayors included the port of Piraeus
near Athens and the northern city of Salonica, where two campaign
offices were slightly damaged by arson attacks early Sunday. Many
races were close and will be decided in a run-off vote next Sunday.
	   In total, voters cast ballots in about 900 mayoral and 54
regional governor races.
	   At least a dozen villages staged protests against a government
program to merge their local communities into larger and more
powerful municipalities.
	   Voting was postponed until Wednesday in one tiny community on
the island of Crete, where many inhabitants have a fierce regional
identity. At one village in northern Greece, locals blocked the
roads with tractors in an attempt to stop election officials from
setting up ballot boxes.

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Oscar Camenzind of Switzerland
won the men's elite road race Sunday at the World Cycling
Championships breaking away in the final lap of 258-kilometer
(162-mile) race.
	   Peter Van Petegem of Belgium took second ahead of Michele
Bartoli of Italy.
	   American Lance Armstrong, taking part in his first World
Championships since undergoing successful cancer treatment, came in
fourth to add to his fourth in the time trial.
	   The race in southern Netherlands came down to the final two laps
of the 17.2-kilometer (10.7-mile) circuit.
	   Armstrong, Camenzind, Niki Aebersold of Switzerland and Michael
Boogerd of the Netherlands broke away up the Cauberg climb and were
soon joined by Bartoli and Van Petegem.
	   The six stayed together until less than a lap to go when
Camenzind made a breakaway. Bartoli and Van Petegem gave chase.
	   At the bottom of the Cauberg hill, Camenzind led by seven
seconds over the Bartoli and Van Petegem with the Armstrong trio
about 27 seconds back.
	   Entering the final flat section of about two kilometers (1.25
miles), Camenzind, a 27-year-old from Steinen, Switzerland, had
stretched his advantage, winning by 23 seconds over Van Petegem.
Camenzind's winning time was 6 hours, 1 minute, 29 seconds.
	   Armstrong won the sprint for fourth, 68 seconds behind.
Aebersold was fifth with Boogerd sixth.
	   Armstrong won the worlds in 1993. At this time last year he was
slowly returning to riding after chemotherapy and an operation had
put the cancer into remission.
	   Spain's Abraham Olano, who won Thursday's time trial and was the
1995 road champion did not start with a knee problem.
	   The last three Tour de France winners -- Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis also did not participate. Last year's road
champion, Laurent Brochard and the top-ranked cyclist according to
UCI ratings, Laurent Jalabert, also did not compete due to the
fallout of the Tour de France doping scandal.
	   The championships concluded with the Netherlands' Leontien van
Moorsel taking a gold and silver medal in the elite women's races
in a comeback from weight problems. Diana Ziliute of Lithuania took
the women's road race.

Kabul's poorest hidden behind the all-enveloping burqa

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Concealed in giant swaths of blue
cloth, a woman steps out of the shadows and whispers in accented
English: ``I am an educator. Do you have a job for me, not in
Kabul, in the provinces?''
	   The rancid smell of an open sewer hangs heavy in the
mid-afternoon heat and the bark of stray dogs makes the whisper
barley audible.
	   Another woman outside a blue-tiled mosque eyes a foreigner.
Quickly she tucks her chin to her chest and stoops her shoulders
trying it seems to bury herself deep inside her burqua. She steps
forward her hand outstretched.
	   ``I'm not a beggar, but I have no choice. I need food for my
family,'' says a voice from within.
	   In the beleaguered capital, ruled by Afghanistan's hardline
Taliban religious army, women have been on the receiving end of
most of the militia's Islamic edicts.
	   Women cannot work, girls do not go to school. Women are not
allowed to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.
Taxi drivers routinely are beaten if their fare is a woman alone.
	   Devastated by relentless fighting between rival Islamic
factions, aid workers say an estimated 30,000 widows are among the
hardest hit by the Taliban's rigid rules regarding women.
	   Forced off the job in 1996 when the Taliban took control of
Kabul some women have resorted to begging, others to sending their
young children on to the street to scavenge and beg.
	   These so-called street children in Kabul, according to a survey
by one aid group, is about 28,000.
	   ``There are a a lot of widows in Afghanistan who have lost their
husbands, their bread winners, in the war. . . these women have to
do something for their survival,'' said Huma Saeed, a member of a
small, but vocal Afghan women's group called the Revolutionary
Afghan Women's Association. Their members, like Saeed, are mostly
in neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``They have lost the male members of their family and they
themselves cannot have a job,'' says Saeed. ``Begging is the only
way.''
	   The Taliban defend their edicts in the name of Islam and remind
its critics that the previous rulers of Kabul, led by ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, destroyed the city in four years of
bitter factional fighting that killed 50,000 people, many of them
women and children.
	   They say the streets were not safe from marauding bands of men
who would steal and rape.
	   But for women it seems the Taliban's harsh edicts is taking a
toll on their mental health.
	   At Kabul's only mental health hospital, Dr. Shaheen Shah Wasah,
says since the Taliban takeover the number of women patients is on
the increase.
	   Theirs is a small shabby ward. Even behind closed doors several
women bury themselves in their burqa, lying listlessly on the bed.
Some moan and rock back and forth. Others squat in a corner.
	   Depression is their greatest enemy, says Wasah.
	   ``Some of them were students or teachers or worked in the
government,'' he said. ``Now she is in her home. She has no
picnics. She can't go anywhere . . . anymore. Of course it affects
her brain.''
	   There have been reports, although not documented, that suicide
among women in Afghanistan has increased dramatically in Kabul
since the Taliban takeover.
	   Wasah agreed, but said that suicide in Islamic Afghanistan is
shameful and victims are buried quickly and quietly.
	   ``Many more women are coming to my hospital . . . they are
suffering from depression,'' he said. ``But many more are coming
for medicine and going back home.''
	   But the medicine is running out, says Wasah.
	   International aid workers, who have left Kabul to protest a
Taliban order relocating them to abandoned school dormitories, were
supplying Kabul's only mental health hospital with its medicines.
	   Another week and Wasah's stock of medicines will be gone.
	   ``Then I don't know what I will do,'' he said. ``Maybe I will
take them and leave them outside the presidential palace.''
	   On the street outside the mental health hospital, children
scramble and jostle for a place in front of the World Food Program
bakeries that supply subsidized bread to some of Kabul's poorest.
	   Children, clutching their WFP slip _ proof that they are in need
_ wrap the warm bread in their tattered scarves and trudge back
home.
	   Six-year-old Laila rubs her inflamed eye, squinting into the
sun, as she explains that the bread and rice is the only food her
family is likely to eat that day.
	   ``I come every day . . . there are six of us in my family,'' she
says.

Pakistan cancels contract with Hub Power, lodges criminal
</HEADLINE>
investigations &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan canceled its contract with
the country's largest private power company and charged some of its
senior officials with fraud and giving kickbacks, a senior
government official said Sunday.
	   The cancellations followed months of wrangling between the
government and the Hub Power Company (Hubco) in which Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif accused the largely British-owned company of
charging inflated prices for electricity it sold to the
cash-strapped state utility.
	   The contract was signed by former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's government.
	   The government lodged two criminal cases of ``fraud, commissions
and electricity theft'' against senior company officials, including
chief executive D.M. Woodroofe, resident engineer Tom Macky and
finance director Khursheed Hussain in the southern port city of
Karachi, the government's accountability chief, Senator Saif-ur
Rehman, told a news conference.
	   Several key officials of Ms. Bhutto's former government also
have been charged, he said.
	   Rehman said Hubco paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to
officials in Ms. Bhutto's government to charge inflated rates.
	   ``We have proof of their corruption and have formed a strong
team of legal experts to fight the cases,'' he said.
	   The state-run Water and Power Development Authority buys
electricity from Hubco at 6.60 rupees (14 cents) per kilowatt
compared to the 1.36 rupees per kilowatt fixed in 1992 by Sharif,
who was in power at the time, he said.
	   ``We have decided to cancel the agreements made during the
Bhutto government and will pay according to the old agreement of
1992,'' Rehman said.
	   There was no immediate comment from Hubco officials.
	   Rehman said the Bhutto government awarded contracts to foreign
power companies to supply more power than Pakistan required.
	   He said Hubco has dropped its production to 400 kilowatts from
1,200 to create power shortage.
	   Since returning to power in 1997 Sharif's government has been
trying to renegotiate power rates with several privately run power
suppliers. The feud has been laced with accusations by the
government of widespread payments of kickbacks to members of Ms.
Bhutto's government in exchange for the inflated rates.

Criminals given names of top police informers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Thirty-three top police informers whose names have
been passed on to the criminal underworld, _allegedly by a rogue
employee in the government's prosecution service _ are being given
new identities in an attempt to protect them, police confirmed
Sunday.
	   A clerk at the Crown Prosecution Service's London headquarters
was charged last week with taking the names from a computer and
passing them to criminals via a nightclub bouncer. Mark Herbert,
30, and bouncer Kevin Sumner, 40, were ordered held in custody
until Oct. 23.
	   On Saturday, two national weekly newspapers, The Observer and
the Mail on Sunday, succeeded in getting a High Court judge to
overturn an injunction obtained by Attorney-General John Morris
banning reporting of the case on grounds this would endanger police
operations.
	   Judge William Gage ruled Saturday that allegations of corruption
in the Crown Prosecution Service _ which deals with serious cases
involving terrorism, drugs and fraud _ should be exposed in the
public interest.
	   ``All the people on the list have been contacted, they all know
about the problem.'' said a spokeswoman for the prosecution
service, speaking on condition of anonymity, as is customary.
``This is a matter of great concern to us, which is why we have
been cooperating with the police. We are also starting a full
review of security.''
	   Police declined to give further details.

Three bombs explode on Corsica amid French govt crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTIA, Corsica (AP) _ Three bombs exploded minutes apart from
each other Sunday afternoon in Corsica's two main ports, in the
latest attacks during a government crackdown on the French island.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the blasts, which
caused some damage but no injuries. But suspicion fell on Corsican
militants waging a 23-year-old campaign for greater autonomy.
	   The first explosion targeted a building adjoining tax offices in
the center of Bastia on the northern end of the rocky island,
police officials said on customary anonymity.
	   A few minutes later, a two explosions occurred near the center
of Ajaccio on the western side of Corsica. One blast struck a
garage belonging to the state utility Electricite de France.
	   The exact location of the other explosion in Ajaccio was not
immediately known.
	   The blasts came less than three weeks after an underground
nationalist group threatened new attacks. It was the same group
that claimed responsibility for assassinating the top French
official on the island Feb. 9.
	   The killing of Prefect Claude Erignac, was a symbolic act
against France's centralized government, triggered a government
crackdown including arrests and the replacement of a number of
local officials.
	   A probe on Corsica released last month found a
``pre-mafia-like'' system of corruption driven in part by militant
intimidation.
	   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported Corsican nationalists had
plotted bombings in Metz in eastern France. The city is the
birthplace of Judge Gilbert Thiel, who was investigating terrorism
on Corsica.
	   A police search two weeks ago at the home of Corsican
nationalist Charles Pieri, a leader of A Cuncolta Independentista,
found documents showing the planned attacks on public buildings,
the newspaper Est Republicain reported. The attacks were never
carried out.
	   Various Corsican nationalist groups have demanded greater
autonomy or outright independence on the island, a tourist haven
that suffers from chronic unemployment and underdevelopment.

Testud beats new No. 1 Davenport in Filderstadt final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Sandrine Testud spoiled the
beginning of Lindsay Davenport's reign as the new No. 1 by beating
the American 7-5, 6-3 to win the Porsche Grand Prix on Sunday.
	   Testud, a 26-year-old Frenchwoman, broke Davenport's serve three
times in the first set and twice more in the second to win in 71
minutes and capture the second title of her career after Palermo in
1997.
	   Davenport, 22, appeared listless in her first final since
dethroning Martina Hingis from the top ranking earlier in the week.
	   ``Sandrine has played incredibly well this week,'' Davenport
said. ``I simply couldn't beat her.''
	   The American had trouble with her serve, a factor of her game
that Davenport has acknowledged needs improving.
	   Testud picked up dlrs 79,000 for her victory, while Davenport
had to settle for dlrs 36,000. In addition, Testud could drive home
across the border in a new sports car donated by the title sponsor
of the tournament.
	   ``It's been a wonderful week,'' Testud said.
	   By reaching the semifinals of the dlrs 450,000 indoor event,
Davenport made sure of rising to No. 1 when the new computer
rankings come out Monday, ending Hingis' 80-week reign.
	   Davenport suffered only her third loss since this summer's
Wimbledon. She was in her seventh final of the year and seeking her
sixth title.
	   Since Wimbledon, Davenport has won four tournaments, including
last month's U.S. Open, her first Grand Slam title.
	   Another showdown between Davenport and Hingis was put on hold
when Hingis pulled out of next week's tournament in Zurich because
of an ankle injury.

Shooting ends Lesotho ruling party rally
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Premier Pakalitha Mosisili fled to safety
Sunday after a gunshot injured a participant at a party rally.
	   The shot scattered about 5,000 supporters of the Lesotho
Congress Party, while some members rushed to protect Mosisili and
his deputy, Kelibone Maope.
	   The LCD called the attack an assassination attempt by opposition
parties who have sporadically blockaded the capital of Maseru since
early August.
	   An opposition leader denied the allegation, saying the remarks
were a smear campaign against the alliance.
	   ``This is absolute trash,'' said alliance spokesman Vincent
Malebo. ``We are not assassins.''
	   A shooting suspect was arrested and questioned, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Along with a rally Sunday by the opposition alliance, the ruling
party gathering fueled ongoing tensions in Lesotho.
	   Scores were killed after last month's South African-led
intervention to end an army mutiny and paralyzing protests by the
opposition, which charged May elections won by the LCD were rigged.
	   The opposition rally took place under heavy security from South
African troops in armored vehicles.
	   ``Our rally will proceed in spite of intimidation by ... forces
and the government, because we want to prove our popularity,''
Malebo said.
	   At its rally, the ruling party said it would oppose amnesty for
rebel soldiers who removed the army's top leadership in September.
	   In an address to the nation, King Letsie III on Saturday
appealed for unity and asked about 100 protesters to leave his
royal palace, where they set up camp in August.
	   Malebo said those encamped at the palace would return home after
the opposition rally.
	   The two sides are to meet on Wednesday with representatives of
the Southern African Development Community, a 14-nation coalition,
to discuss peaceful resolution.

Illegal Viagra shipments impounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Customs officials seized four
illegal shipments of Viagra that entered the country over the past
month, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The action came as South Africa prepares to legally market the
sex potency drug later this month.
	   The illegal pills entered the country via airfreight, the Sunday
Times of Johannesburg reported.
	   The pills will cost about 100 rand (dlrs 18) each in South
Africa. The storage venue for legally imported quantities of the
drug is being kept secret for security reasons, said Medicines
Control Council chairwoman Dr. Helen Rees.
	   Police recently arrested a Polish citizen trying to sell 120
Viagra tablets.
	   The paper said customs officials refused to reveal how many
illegal pills they had impounded.

Fighting kills 11 in northeastern Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDITOR'S NOTE: The Sri Lankan military censors cleared this story
without making any changes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ At least 11 people were killed in
fighting between government troops and Tamil Tiger guerrillas in
northeastern Sri Lanka, the military said Sunday.
	   Four civilians were killed when their van exploded as it passed
over a rebel land mine in the eastern Batticaloa district on
Sunday, said military officials who asked not to be named.
	   Four guerrillas were killed by government troops Saturday near
the northern town of Mankulam, the military said in a statement.
	   Three more rebels were killed at the nearby towns of Kilinochchi
and Paranthan, also on Saturday, the statement said.
	   There were no casualties on the government side, the military
said.
	   Fighting has decreased this month after major battles in
Kilinochchi, Mankulam and Paranthan. Those battles last month left
at least 1,800 dead or missing on both sides, according to the
military.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 55,000 people have died in 15 years of fighting.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with prime minister announces 30 percent cut in
electricity bill. Quotes. EDITS throughout. New to some points &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan canceled its contract with
the country's largest private power company on Sunday and Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif announced a 30 percent cut in electricity
bills.
	   Several senior officials of the largely British-owned Hub Power
Company (Hubco) have been charged with fraud and giving kickbacks,
said Pakistan's accountability chief Saif-ur Rehman.
	   The cancellation of Hubco's contract follows months of wrangling
between the government and privately run power companies in
Pakistan. It was the third private company to have its contract
canceled.
	   The government says the companies charged inflated prices for
electricity sold to the cash-strapped state utility.
	   The private power company contracts were signed by former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's government.
	   According to Sharif the cancellation of the Hubco contract will
save Pakistan 10 billion rupees (dlrs 217 million). ``I am
returning this 10 billion rupees to you. . . by reducing your
electricity bill,'' he said on national television.
	   It will go into effect on Oct. 21.
	   His critics however say that Pakistan's economy is teetering on
the verge of collapse and can ill afford to slash its power rates.
	   Economists and traders on the stock exchange warned that the
cancellation of the Hubco contract will cause chaos when the
Karachi Stock Exchange opens for trading on Monday.
	   ``The share price of Hub power will drop further now and there
will be panic in the stock market when it opens Monday,'' said
Sajjad Mankani, a dealer at BMA Capital Management in the southern
port city of Karachi.
	   In addition to canceling the contract, the government lodged two
criminal cases of ``fraud, commissions and electricity theft''
against senior company officials, including chief executive D.M.
Woodroofe, resident engineer Tom Macky and finance director
Khursheed Hussain in the southern port city of Karachi, Rehman told
a news conference in the federal capital.
	   Several key officials of Ms. Bhutto's former government also
have been charged, he said.
	   Rehman said Hubco paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to
officials in Ms. Bhutto's government to charge inflated rates.
	   ``We have proof of their corruption and have formed a strong
team of legal experts to fight the cases,'' he said.
	   The state-run Water and Power Development Authority buys
electricity from Hubco at 6.60 rupees (14 cents) per kilowatt
compared to the 1.36 rupees per kilowatt fixed in 1992 by Sharif,
who was in power at the time, he said.
	   ``We have decided to cancel the agreements made during the
Bhutto government and will pay according to the old agreement of
1992,'' Rehman said.
	   There was no immediate comment from Hubco officials.

Cypriot president vows to work for return of refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASTROMERITIS, Cyprus (AP) - Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
said Sunday that pressure from the international community was
needed to ensure that Turkey implements Security Council
resolutions for the reunification of the war-divided island.
	   ``We will do everything possible to find a solution within the
framework of the U.N. resolutions,'' Glafcos Clerides told a
protest rally by Greek Cypriot refugees.
	   ``However, our political will is not enough... What is needed is
a more determined intervention on the part of the international
community toward the Turkish side,'' he said.
	   ``We want a Cyprus where all human rights are restored,
including the right of refugees to return to their homes,''
Clerides told a rally of some 3,000 refugees.
	   The refugees from the Turkish-occupied north of the island were
staging their annual protest against the refusal of the Turkish
authorities to allow their return.
	   The refugees fled or were forced from their homes in the wake of
the 1974 Turkish invasion and occupation of north Cyprus which was
sparked by an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   The U.N. resolutions call for the reunification of Cyprus in a
bizonal federation, the return of all refugees and the withdrawal
of the estimated 35,000 Turkish troops and 50,000 mainland settlers
from the north.

Physicians blast South Africa's policy to not treat pregnant HIV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Physicians blasted the
government's decision to withhold anti-AIDS therapy from HIV
victims who are pregnant and poor, a newspaper reported on Sunday.
	   The policy was announced Friday by Health Minister Nkosazana
Zuma, who said the government's new 80 million rand (dlrs 14
million) AIDS awareness campaign money would be better spent on
public education.
	   Doctors complained that the decision shut down five pilot
projects that were to treat HIV positive mothers in the last month
of pregnancy with AZT, a drug that reportedly can reduce by half
the transmission rate of HIV to babies.
	   ``Here's a real way we can prevent transmission and the
government is not intervening,'' Glenda Gray, director of an HIV
research unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, was quoted as
saying.
	   Baragwanath serves the black township of Soweto outside of
Johannesburg.
	   Treatment was estimated to cost up to 750 rand (dlrs 131) per
patient for the last month of pregnancy.
	   Zuma said a large number of women would have to be treated to
save a small number of babies. Without treatment, up to 46 percent
of HIV-positive mothers pass the virus to their babies, the
newspaper said.

Gunpowder explosion kills 11 in southern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Several bags of gunpowder stored in a
house to make fireworks exploded in a southern Indian town Sunday
killing 11 people, including six children, and injuring three
others, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Police said the explosion was so powerful that the house
collapsed on the victims, trapping them under the rubble, the Press
Trust of India said. The explosion took place in the city of
Vijayawada, 1,400 kilometers (850 miles) south of the Indian
capital, New Delhi.
	   It was not clear from the reports if the people killed were
workers making fireworks for the ongoing festival season in India.
Six of the victims were children who are frequently employed by
factory owners as cheap labor in the manufacture of fireworks.
	   Rescue workers were sifting through the rubble to look for
survivors.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under the towering marble figures of the
Jews who founded his church, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed
the first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
	   Every year, he told Catholics, her saint's day must also serve
as a commemoration of all the Holocaust's murdered Jews.
	   ``The value of her testimony is to render ever more solid the
bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he
said.
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square.
	   It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation:
The Roman Catholic Church exercising all its ceremony, pomp and
grandeur in tribute to people of the Jewish faith.
	   Looking on were members of Stein's family, sharing a stage with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

<TEXT>
	   BASTIA, Corsica (AP) _ Three bombs exploded minutes apart from
each other Sunday afternoon in Corsica's two main ports, in the
latest attacks during a government crackdown on the French island.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the blasts, which
caused some damage but no injuries. But suspicion fell on Corsican
militants waging a 23-year-old campaign for greater autonomy.
	   The first explosion targeted a building adjoining tax offices in
the center of Bastia on the northern end of the rocky island,
police officials said on customary anonymity.
	   A few minutes later, a two explosions occurred near the center
of Ajaccio on the western side of Corsica. One blast struck a
garage belonging to the state utility Electricite de France, and
the other a government treasury office.

Yeltsin cancels ceremony for health problems

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, on his
first trip out of Russia since this spring, canceled a welcoming
ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because he wasn't feeling well,
his press service said.
	   Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled during another public
ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, the capital of this Central
Asian nation, and had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam
Karimov. But the two later held their one-on-one summit as
scheduled.
	   The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray since an economic
crisis swamped his country in August. The 67-year-old president,
whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years in
power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight
and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home
outside Moscow.
	   His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when he attended a
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
	   During his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin
is expected to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two
former Soviet republics, whose economies have suffered residual
effects of the crisis that hit Russia after it devalued its
currency in August and effectively defaulted on some of its debt.
	   On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay wreaths at a
monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, and salute
an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled because
``the president wasn't feeling well,'' Alexei Gromov, of Yeltsin's
press service, told reporters.
	   He gave no other details about Yeltsin's condition.
	   Yeltsin and Karimov later met at a government residence outside
Tashkent and signed several agreements on fighting smuggling and
other crime and expanding cultural ties, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. The two sides are expected to sign economic agreements
Monday.
	   Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak
President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on
economic, science and technical cooperation and on combating drug
trafficking.
	   Last week, Yeltsin said he also planned to discuss the situation
in Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. Russia and
the two republics fear an influx of refugees and weapons from
Afghanistan, and possibly a spill over of fighting that has wracked
the country.
	   Yeltsin was accompanied by officials from the Federal Border
Guard Service, the State Customs Committee, the Defense Ministry,
and the Russian Academy of Sciences, ITAR-Tass said.

Ethnic Albanians, central to Kosovo crisis, playing peripheral role
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Ethnic Albanians, central to the
Kosovo crisis, have played only a peripheral role so far in the
intense negotiations being carried out by American troubleshooter
Richard Holbrooke.
	   That will change if diplomacy moves beyond the issue of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands and on
to the next phase: serious negotiations on the future of Kosovo and
the ethnic Albanians' aspirations for independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, have not given up the goal of independence from
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But independence for Kosovo has been rejected by the United
States and its allies. The Western countries want substantial
autonomy for Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation.
	   The ethnic Albanians say they will not be satisfied with any
formula that threatens the goal of independence.
	   Members of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating committee met among
themselves here Sunday, but were tight-lipped about the details.
	   Part of the problem is that Kosovo, where hundreds of ethnic
Albanians have died and tens of thousands have been driven from
their homes, lacks a leader supported by everyone.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, a quiet man who advocates non-violence, is
perhaps the best known of the ethnic Albanian leaders. But he is
essentially powerless.
	   Albanian sources say he agreed to take part in political talks
without the consent of other Albanian political parties, and, more
importantly, without the backing of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA, a disorganized military force which waged a seven-month
hit-and-run struggle against the Serbian military and police, is
key to any real settlement here.
	   But its very nature, scattered around the country with no
single, unified command structure, makes it difficult to deal with.
	   Holbrooke made two trips to Pristina, capital of the province,
during his latest round of talks in Yugoslavia, but Albanian
political sources say it seemed to be more to project the
appearance of high-powered diplomatic shuttling than to conduct
serious negotiations with the ethnic Albanians.
	   Talks in Pristina have concentrated on the compliance and
security aspects of any deal made in Belgrade with Milosevic.
Security is the key to the return of the more than 275,000
refugees, many of whom are still living outdoors.
	   Despite his pacifist background, Rugova and his followers have
been beating the drums for NATO intervention.
	   ``We believe that an urgent NATO intervention against Serb
targets can save the people in Kosovo from a mass ethnic cleansing
and lead to softening of the humanitarian situation in Kosovo,''
Rugova's spokesman, Xhemail Mustafa, said Sunday.
	   Christopher Hill, the American ambassador to Macedonia and one
of the top U.S. negotiators in the region, has been trying to sell
an interim plan for the future of Kosovo. That plan would return
some of the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989, create an
independent police force in Kosovo and an independent parliament
and government for the province.
	   The idea is to bring the police closer to the municipality, said
Veton Surroi, a leading Albanian political figure. Where Serbs are
in a majority, the community would have Serbian police. And where
Albanians are the majority, there would be Albanian police.
	   In all, the police force would be about 2,500, or one for every
800-900 people, close to European standards and far from the more
than 11,000 in the province now.
	   This new police force would be supervised by outsiders, perhaps
something like the U.N.'s International Police Task Force in
Bosnia, combined with a withdrawal of the Yugoslav military to a
point 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border and some kind of
effective outside military monitoring force.
	   The big problem is who, how many and who will run the police and
what kind of military force would monitor the situation on the
ground.

Just elected, German Social Democrats fight over posts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's newly elected Social Democrats
publicly fought over posts Sunday after reports that the party's
leader was seeking to impose appointments.
	   At issue is a week-long push by chairman Oskar Lafontaine to
oust the Social Democrats' leader in parliament, Rudolf Scharping,
a centrist whom he already unseated as party boss in 1995.
	   Lafontaine, considered a largely traditional leftist, reportedly
wants the job to go to a loyal aide. But Social Democratic
lawmakers angered by the power grab rallied behind Scharping in
interviews published Sunday.
	   ``The threat against Scharping doesn't interest me,'' Gerd
Andres told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag. ``I'm behind him and
expect he will have a broad majority.''
	   ``Rudolf Scharping has done a good job,'' Ulla Schmidt, head of
a party caucus on equal rights, told Bild am Sonntag. ``If he runs
again, he will win.''
	   Scharping was expected to announce Tuesday that he wants to keep
the faction leader's job, the No. 3 post in the party. If he does,
it seems unlikely that anyone will oppose him.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Lafontaine and Scharping
have not commented on the reported power struggle.
	   Lafontaine played a key role in Schroeder's Sept. 27 election
victory by suppressing infighting that had hurt the Social
Democrats for years. But he is also highly ambitious.
	   Social Democratic sources said last week that the Finance
Ministry _ which Lafontaine is expected to head _ may take over
some responsibilities for European and global economic policy from
the Economics Ministry.
	   The new government of Social Democrats and Greens is expected to
be in place by the last week of October.

Netanyahu's Cabinet said set to balk at withdrawal plan

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Only days before a peace summit in Washington,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet is reportedly balking
at a U.S.-authored plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
	   The ministers are poised to oppose an American initiative for
Israeli troops to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, an
Israeli newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Such a declaration just prior to talks in Washington between
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could dampen hopes for breaking a
19-month-old Israeli-Palestinian deadlock.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet, which is dominated by hard-liners who
oppose land-for-peace deals with the Palestinians, is scheduled to
meet Tuesday to discuss the deal, a day before the prime minister
leaves for Washington.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that the Cabinet will
oppose a withdrawal now from 13 percent of the West Bank and a
proposed future withdrawal from an additional 1 percent.
	   In addition, the Cabinet will inform Netanyahu that they will
only authorize implementing any deal after the Palestinians fulfill
a series of demands, including disarming militants and annulling
sections of the PLO charter, the report said.
	   The prime minister has come under heavy pressure from far-right
members of his coalition government who have threatened to topple
him if he goes ahead with another pullback.
	   In recent days, Netanyahu has been taking steps seen as meant to
placate hard-liners in his camp. On Friday, he named hawkish former
general Ariel Sharon as his foreign minister.
	   On Sunday, the prime minister attended the funeral for a
19-year-old Israeli soldier stabbed to death by a Palestinian just
outside a West Bank settlement.
	   There, he denounced Palestinian radio and television for
broadcasting ``words of hate and incitement and encouragement for
murderous acts.''
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian security forces said the killer of
19-year-old Cpl. Michal Adato, 19, was mentally unstable and acted
alone.
	   In another nod to the right wing, Netanyahu on Sunday personally
greeted members of a Zionist Christian group that came to his
office and offered prayers he would steadfastly reject a peace
accord with the Palestinians.
	   Afterward, the group went to Har Homa, the site of a
controversial planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem, to offer more prayers for a halt to the peace
process. Talks broke down in March 1997 after the groundbreaking at
Har Homa.
	   In other developments Sunday:
	   _Several hundred Palestinians burned Israeli and American flags
and pictures of Sharon at an anti-peace rally in the West Bank city
of Nablus.
	   _In the Gaza Strip, an argument between Israeli and Palestinians
policemen over security arrangements there ended in a scuffle with
one Israeli policeman slightly hurt.
	   _The army said three firebombs were thrown at Israeli troop
positions at the Jewish enclave of Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts
of the West Bank town of Bethlehem. No one was hurt.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - To some, two fourths can be tough
to handle. But Lance Armstrong was not disappointed after his
return to the World Cycling Championships following a successful
fight against cancer.
	   A fourth in the time trial Thursday and another fourth in
Sunday's road race made the Austin, Texas rider the top overall
men's performer as the world chcampionships ended.
	   ``Looking back on the last 18 months to two years, I really
cannot be disappointed,'' The 27-year old Armstrong said after the
finish of the 258-kilometer (162-mile) road race. ``If I had never
been sick and had been 100 per cent, I might be more disappointed.
I am 100 per cent healthy but my condition is not 100 per cent.''
	   Amstrong, the 1993 world road race champion and winner of two
stages of the Tour de France, could only dream of a comeback after
announcing he had testicular cancer just before the world
championships in 1996.
	   The cancer spread to his lungs and brain and he underwent
chemotherapy followed by brain surgery.
	   By last fall, however, he was back on a bike and looking to ride
again.
	   He tried to return last March, dropped out of the Paris-Nice
race and had to regain his focus and motivation.
	   A return to Europe and a fourth in the Tour of Spain marked his
return to the top level.
	   He came into the world championships labeled as one of the
favorites. He came close to medals.
	   ``Physically im tired, psychologically I'm tired.'' Armstrong
said. ``I'm relieved that it's over.''
	   He was fourth in the time trial, missing bronze by 10 seconds.
He was 68 seconds behind the winner in Sunday's road race after
more than six hours.
	   In the road race he was part of a small group ahead of the pack
entering the final lap of the 17.2-kilometer (10.7-mile) circuit.
	   Oscar Camenzind of Switzerland broke away to take the title.
Armstrong failed to follow two others, Peter Van Petegem and
Michele Bartoli over the last 8 kilometers (5 miles).
	   ``The three in front of me, they deserved to be there,''
Armstrong said.
	   Armstong ended up winning the sprint for fourth over Swiss Niki
Aebersold. ``If it was another 50 meters, I might not have made it
because my calves were cramping,'' Armstrong said.
	   Now, after Bobby Julich's third in the Tour de France, American
cycling hasn't looked so strong since the late 1980s when Greg
LeMond was winning the Tour de France and Andy Hampsten captured
the Tour of Italy once.
	   ``It's a very good time for Americans on the road,'' Armstrong
said. Armstrong now rides for U.S. Postal.
	   ``This team, the U.S. Postal Service team, is a very strong
team. It is a reflection of American cycling with a team made up
laregly of Americans.''
	   Julich rides for Cofidis now, which released Armstrong after a
dispute in his off year.
	   Armstrong thinks he cannot challenge Julich yet in the top race
of the year, the Tour de France.
	   ``Just because I had a good Tour of Spain doesn't mean the Tour
de France is a realistic goal to be on the podium or be in the top
ten. I will try,'' Armstrong said. ``But he's proven that he can do
that and I haven't.''

Turkish Premier threatens Syria over Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's prime minister said Sunday that
his country had a duty to ``poke out the eyes'' of Syria if it
doesn't stop harboring Kurdish rebels.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's harsh words, reported by the
Anatolia news agency, raised the stakes in Turkey's face-off with
its neighbor.
	   Ankara accuses Syria of harboring Kurdish rebels who are
fighting for autonomy within Turkey. It has demanded Damascus to
end its support to the rebels and extradite their leaders.
	   There are unconfirmed reports of a Turkish troop buildup along
the Syrian border and both Iran and Egypt are trying to mediate.
	   According to Anatolia, Yilmaz said that ``if Syria does not come
to its sense, it is our incumbent duty to bring the world down on
them...It is our incumbent duty to poke the eyes of those who have
eyes on our territory.''
	   Yilmaz spoke in southern Kahramanmaras province to a crowd that
replied with cries of ``Down with Syria!'' Anatolia said.
	   Also on Sunday, State Minister Metin Gurdere said Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan had left Damascus for Armenia. ``Armenia
should also watch its step,'' he said, according to Anatolia.
	   Turkey and Armenia do not have diplomatic relations. Armenia
accuses Turkey of the genocide of an estimated 1.5 million
Armenians between 1915 and 1923. Turkey denies genocide, saying the
deaths were caused by civil war.

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Switzerland's Oscar Camenzind
broke away in the final lap to win a wet and windswept men's road
race Sunday at the World Cycling Championships, the last major
event of a season overshadowed by doping scandals.
	   Peter Van Petegem of Belgium took silver ahead of third-placed
Italian Michele Bartoli in the 258- kilometer (162-mile) race.
	   American Lance Armstrong, in his first World Championships since
undergoing successful cancer treatment, finished fourth to add to
his fourth in Thursday's time trial.
	   An Armstrong win would have given the glamour men's race a
storybook finish and the sport of cycling a much-needed morale
boost.
	   ``If I had never been sick and was 100 percent, right now I
might be more disappointed,'' Armstrong said of his second near
miss of the week.
	   ``Looking back over the last 18 months to two years, I really
can't be disappointed.''
	   Armstrong was in contention well into the last 17.2-kilometer
(10.7-mile) circuit in a group with Camenzind and his Swiss
teammate Niki Aebersold, Dutchman Michael Boogerd Bartoli and Van
Petegem.
	   With less than a lap to go Camenzind broke clear chased by
Bartoli and Van Petegem.
	   At the bottom of the short, steep Cauberg hill, Camenzind had a
seven-second lead over Bartoli and Van Petegem with Armstrong about
27 seconds back.
	   Entering the final flat section, Camenzind, a 27-year-old from
Steinen, Switzerland, had stretched his advantage and cruised
across the line, punching the air, 23 seconds ahead of Van Petegem
in a winning time of 6 hours, 1 minute, 30 seconds.
	   ``It may have been a risk to go off so early but if I had waited
until the final climb the others might have reacted with me,''
Camenzind said. ``I tried and there was no reaction and then I held
all the cards.''
	   Camenzind said the weather helped him.
	   ``If you had asked me two days ago, I thought there would be
about 50 guys in the sprint. But with the wind, the rain and the
tough course it was different.'' Camenzind said.
	   Armstrong won a sprint for fourth, 68 seconds behind. Aebersold
was fifth with Boogerd, who suffered a puncture in the final lap,
sixth.
	   ``If it it was another 50 meters, I might not have made it
because my calves were cramping,'' Armstrong said.
	   Armstrong won the world road race title in 1993. But this time
last year he was slowly returning to riding after chemotherapy and
surgery had put the cancer into remission.
	   Spain's Abraham Olano, who won Thursday's time trial and was the
1995 road champion did not start Sunday, complaining of a knee
problem.
	   The last three Tour de France winners _ Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis _ also did not participate. Last year's
road champion, Laurent Brochard and the top-ranked cyclist
according to UCI ratings, Laurent Jalabert, also did not compete
due to the fallout of the Tour de France doping scandal.
	   In the week's other major races, the Netherlands' Leontien van
Moorsel took gold in the women's time trial and silver in the elite
women's road race to cap her comeback from weight problems. Diana
Ziliute of Lithuania won the women's road race.
	   While there were no positive drug tests immediately reported at
the 10-race championships, the subject of doping hung like a dark
cloud over the event.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) began the week by setting
up the Council for the Fight Against Doping, a task force made up
of UCI officials, riders and representatives of the professional
teams.
	   But at the same meeting, the UCI agreed to cut the bans of three
Swiss riders who admitted taking performance enhancing drugs. The
UCI's combative President, Hein Verbruggen, insisted throughout the
week that cycling does more than any other sport to fight doping.
	   The new anti-doping task force met for the first time Wednesday
and said its initial budget of 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.4
million) would be spent on increased anti-doping and blood tests,
medical coverage and contributions to research.
	   On Saturday, the Spanish watch maker Festina, sponsor of the
disgraced professional team that was kicked off this year's Tour de
France for its doping policy, said it would continue its
involvement in the sport and pledged to help clean up cycling.
	   Festina pledged 4 million French Francs (dlrs 725,000) to create
a fund to combat doping.
	   As cycling's season of shame approaches its end, authorities are
looking to next February's doping summit organized by the
International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, which may
introduce new anti-doping measures throughout sport in time for
next year's World Championships in Verona, Italy.

Arab League praises Yemen, Eritrea for resorting to tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League praised the leaders of Yemen
and Eritrea Sunday, saying they spared the Middle East ``the agony
of war'' when they resorted to international arbitration to resolve
a dispute over Red Sea islands.
	   An international arbitration panel in The Hague granted Yemen
Friday control of three Red Sea islands, a decision that Eritrea
said it accepts.
	   The 22-member Arab League called the arbitration ```a civilized
choice... that spared the region the agony of war.''
	   ``It is a real victory for peace,'' the statement added.
	   Yemen and Eritrea both claimed the three islands, one of which,
the Greater Hanish, was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in
December 1995. Yemen retained control of the other two, Lesser
Hanish and Zuqar.
	   The tribunal awarded all three major islands to Yemen and
stipulated that the decision should be complied with within 90
days.
	   The islands sit across one of the world's major shipping lanes,
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the
southern entrance to the Red Sea.

Netanyahu's Cabinet said set to balk at withdrawal plan

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Only days before a peace summit in Washington,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet is reportedly balking
at a U.S.-authored plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
	   The ministers are poised to oppose an American initiative for
Israeli troops to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, an
Israeli newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Such a declaration just prior to talks in Washington between
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could dampen hopes for breaking a
19-month-old Israeli-Palestinian deadlock.
	   Netanyahu's Cabinet, which is dominated by hard-liners who
oppose land-for-peace deals with the Palestinians, is scheduled to
meet Tuesday to discuss the deal, a day before the prime minister
leaves for Washington.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that the Cabinet will the
proposal to withdraw now from 13 percent of the West Bank and in
the future from an additional 1 percent.
	   In addition, the Cabinet will inform Netanyahu that they will
only authorize implementing a deal after the Palestinians fulfill a
series of demands, including disarming militants and annulling
sections of the PLO charter, the report said.
	   The prime minister has come under heavy pressure from far-right
members of his coalition government who have threatened to topple
him if he goes ahead with another pullback.
	   In recent days, Netanyahu has been taking steps seen as meant to
placate hard-liners in his camp. On Friday, he named hawkish former
general Ariel Sharon as his foreign minister.
	   On Sunday, the prime minister attended the funeral for a
19-year-old Israeli soldier stabbed to death by a Palestinian just
outside a West Bank settlement.
	   There, he denounced Palestinian radio and television for
broadcasting ``words of hate and incitement and encouragement for
murderous acts.''
	   Both Israeli and Palestinian security forces said the killer of
19-year-old Cpl. Michal Adato, 19, was mentally unstable and acted
alone.
	   In another nod to the right wing, Netanyahu on Sunday personally
greeted members of a Zionist Christian group that came to his
office and offered prayers he would steadfastly reject a peace
accord with the Palestinians.
	   Afterward, the group went to Har Homa, the site of a
controversial planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab
east Jerusalem, to offer more prayers for a halt to the peace
process. Talks broke down in March 1997 after the groundbreaking at
Har Homa.
	   In other developments Sunday:
	   _Several hundred Palestinians burned Israeli and American flags
and pictures of Sharon at an anti-peace rally in the West Bank city
of Nablus.
	   _In the Gaza Strip, an argument between Israeli and Palestinians
policemen over security arrangements there ended in a scuffle with
one Israeli policeman slightly hurt.
	   _The army said three firebombs were thrown at Israeli troop
positions at the Jewish enclave of Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts
of the West Bank town of Bethlehem. No one was hurt.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of Muslims demonstrators joined
hands and marched in Turkish towns and cities Sunday to protest a
ban on Islamic-style head scarves in schools and public offices.
Police shot and killed one person and wounded two others in an
argument over a traffic jam caused by the protests.
	   The Anatolia news agency said the shooting took place in Elazig
when a group of soccer fans on their way to a match got stuck in a
traffic jam caused by the demonstration.
	   It said police opened fire, killing a 25-year-old man and
wounding two others. The governor's office said in a statement
authorities would investigate.
	   Marches took place Sunday in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and at
least eight smaller towns and cities, including the eastern city of
Elazig.
	   It was the largest demonstration against the ban since
universities last month refused to register women who failed to
submit ID photographs with bare heads.
	   Protesters, mostly women in scarves or black Islamic chadors,
carried banners reading ``We Want Our Right To Education Back,''
and ``Respect Belief, Free Thought.''

U.S. commerce secretary delays Mideast trip because of U.S. budget

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley has
postponed a trip to the Middle East because of the delay in
approval of the new federal budget, the U.S. Embassy said Sunday.
	   Daley was to leave Washington on Sunday for visits to Egypt,
Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories.
	   In Egypt, he was to be the keynote speaker at a trade and
development conference Wednesday aimed at drawing foreign
investment for some 40 Egyptian energy, transportation, chemical
and water projects.
	   A statement issued by the embassy quoted Daley as saying
Congress had been expected to complete action on next year's U.S.
government budget by Sunday.
	   ``Unfortunately, a budget agreement has not been reached,''
Daley said. ``President Clinton has asked me to stay in Washington
this week to assist in reaching an agreement with Congress.''
	   The statement said Daley hoped to rescheduled the visit ``before
the end of this year.''

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijani voters seeking stability and
long-elusive prosperity for their oil-rich nation cast ballots
Sunday in a presidential election the authoritarian incumbent
looked certain to win.
	   Opposition groups boycotted the vote in this former Soviet
republic once plagued by war and political chaos, and claimed
President Geidar Aliev's government was delaying results so it
could tamper with the outcome.
	   More than 66 percent of Azerbaijan's eligible voters had cast
ballots by 5 p.m. (1200 GMT), two hours before polls closed, the
Interfax news agency reported. That easily surpassed the required
25 percent minimum turnout to make the elections valid.
	   Voting proceeded peacefully. International observers said they
had noticed no major violations but a few minor technical problems,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200 observers were
monitoring the vote.
	   The stability that has taken hold in this country of 7.5 million
once plagued by war and political chaos appeared to be working in
favor of Aliev, who led Azerbaijan in the Soviet era and retook
power in a bloodless 1993 coup.
	   ``I voted for Aliev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov. ``Before
he became the president we had instability. It was impossible to do
business and a lot of people carried guns. But now we are moving
towards a market economy.''
	   But the main opposition leaders accused Aliev of stacking the
ballot in his favor and were already crying foul Sunday over the
expected outcome.
	   They criticized an announcement by the election commission that
voting results would not be known for four days, calling the delay
a chance for the government to commit voter fraud.
	   The five other presidential contenders are close to the
government and are widely believed to be running only to give the
election the appearance of competitiveness.
	   ``Whoever wins, whether it be Aliev or someone else, will be
illegitimate,'' said Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition group
Musavat and former speaker of Azerbaijan's parliament.
	   If no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, a second
round must be held. In the last elections, after the 1993 coup,
Aliev won with 98 percent support.
	   Aliev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, but chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices
have meant that Azerbaijan has yet to enjoy an economic windfall
that Aliev has been predicting for years.
	   Unemployment remains high and monthly salaries rarely exceed
170,000 manat (dlrs 43). Also, the country's bitter dispute with
Armenia over the Armenian-controlled enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh
within Azerbaijan remains unresolved.
	   Still, Aliev casts himself as the only candidate capable of
continuing the country's development and market reforms.
	   In preparation for the vote, Aliev has also tried to rework his
authoritarian image by introducing Western-style election laws,
abolishing media censorship and agreeing to permit limited
anti-government rallies.
	   ``I believe in my victory and I will be a worthy president,''
Aliev said after casting his vote Sunday. ``My main task has been
the settlement of the (Nagorno) Karabakh problem, and the
strengthening of independence and the economy.''
	   Not everyone agreed. Aliev ``has not done anything to return our
territory,'' said Isaak Gamidov, a refugee from the Lachinsky
district in Nagorno-Karabakh. ``I don't care that we are very poor
because the main thing now is to return our land, which is occupied
by the enemy.
	   On Friday, police blocked an opposition rally attended by about
10,000 people in central Baku and beat several people demonstrating
against the elections.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Far from the pressures of Washington and
talk of impeachment, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shook hands
with bystanders Sunday, announced new American aid grants and posed
for pictures with former street children.
	   The only people she wouldn't talk to were journalists.
	   ``She takes no questions these days,'' a member of Mrs.
Clinton's staff told a reporter who tried to approach the first
lady as she gazed at medieval icons in the crypt at St. Alexander
Nevski cathedral.
	   Sofia is the first stop on a two-country tour that began Sunday.
She travels to Prague on Monday to meet with Czech leaders and
speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav Havel and Nobel
laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   Mrs. Clinton praised Bulgarians for their tolerance and their
progress in establishing democratic principles since the fall of
Communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria is one of the few former communist states to have
addressed issues involving its minorities _ 800,000 Turks and
300,000 Gypsies, or Roma _ peacefully and democratically.
Non-governmental organizations aimed at promoting ethnic tolerance
and cooperation between communities have flourished.
	   ``It is a great pleasure for me to be in a country well known
for its tolerance and among few that I have seen during this
transition that have been so open to non-governmental
organizations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
	   ``In comparison to many other transition countries, Bulgaria
sets quite an example which is respectful and appreciated in the
NGO community,'' she told activists of Bulgarian NGOs gathered at a
Jewish center in downtown Sofia.
	   Participants told the first lady about activities ranging from
monitoring elections and training judges to helping the disabled,
environmental conservation and protecting women from violence.
	   ``Non-governmental organizations and citizens' participation are
a critical building box to any sustainable democracy,'' Mrs.
Clinton said.
	   Before that meeting she delivered a donation of two vans to the
Sofia Faith, Hope and Love Center for former street children and
announced a dlrs 50,000 donation from the U.S. embassy to the home
that will be used for its repair.
	   She posed for a photo with the home's 20 children and treated
them to boxes of chocolates bearing President Bill Clinton's
signature.
	   A popular figure abroad, she shook hands with some 50 local
people and was cheered by foreign tourists as she walked to St.
Sofia church, the oldest in Bulgaria's capital.
	   Addressing a women's conference earlier, she announced a dlrs 15
million grant to bolster civil society in southeastern Europe, to
be channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development
as part of its democracy networking program.
	   Mrs. Clinton also announced a new USAID program that will
provide dlrs 300,000 in traininig and internships for women
business leaders and entrepreneurs from central and southeastern
Europe.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' Mrs. Clinton told the opening session
of the two-day ``Women in the 21st Century conference.''
	   The conference is focusing on the role of women in social issues
confronting southeastern Europe, much of which is still recovering
from a half-century of Communist rule.
	   ``Democratic progress depends on the progress of women,'' Mrs.
Clinton told the delegates. ``Economic progress depends on progress
of women. A vibrant civil society depends upon the full
contribution of women.''
	   The U.S. first lady was headed later for a reception and dinner
with President Petar Stoyanov and his wife.
	   Before leaving Monday, she is to appear with women entrepreneurs
at a forum on small business development and speak to students at
the American College in Sofia.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   The skies were partly cloudy over the U.S. Virgin Islands and
the east sections of Puerto Rico during the night. The winds were
from the east at 5 to 10 mph.
	   The upper level trough that affected our area Saturday afternoon
continued over the central sections of the Hispaniola this morning.
This system will be moving slowly east today and thus could cause
the development of showers and thunderstorms over our area once
again this afternoon. However, low-level moisture has decreased
considerably over the eastern Caribbean and this will limit the
shower activity. Local factors will play the main role in
determining the area coverage and location of the showers that do
develop.
	   Drier conditions can be expected on Monday before a tropical
wave, now located about 500 miles east of the islands, approaches
our area Tuesday night and Wednesday. A cold front located over the
northwest Atlantic just off the east coast of the United States
will be moving east through Wednesday. Although this system is not
expected to move across our area, abundant moisture ahead of it
could combine with the approaching tropical wave, causing
widespread cloudiness and showers over our area Wednesday and
Wednesday night.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Residents of Russia's third-largest city voted for
mayor Sunday after the winner of the last election was convicted of
embezzling government money for a local shipbuilding plant.
	   Voters in Nizhny Novgorod were choosing between Yuri Lebedev,
chairman of a local religious organization, and former mayor Dmitry
Bednyakov, in a runoff after the first round of voting last month
produced no winner.
	   Nizhny Novgorod is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   Its previous mayor, prominent entrepreneur Andrei Klimentyev,
was elected in March but election officials invalidated his victory
after President Boris Yeltsin expressed concern about the balloting
results.
	   Klimentyev was convicted in May of forging documents, embezzling
part of a government loan to a shipbuilding plant and appropriating
a large share of the plant's stock. He was sentenced to six years
in prison.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Britain's number one Tim Henman ousted
fourth-seed Andre Agassi in the final of the Swiss Indoors on
Sunday to collect his second title of the season and the fourth of
his career.
	   After successfully defending his Tashkent title last week,
Henman went on to defeat the American veteran 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in
two hours, 16 minutes, to collect his first career back-to-back
titles and extend his winning streak to 12 victories.
	   The victory avenged his loss to Agassi 10 weeks ago, when the
American beat him 6-4, 6-4 in the finals of the Mercedes Cup in Los
Angeles, the pair's only other head-to-head.
	   Currently eighth in the ``Road to Hannover'' standings, the
victory solidifies Henman's chances of a berth at the ATP Tour
World Championship next month.

Holbrooke pushes talks as U.S. bombers take positions

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes, a senior U.S. envoy accelerated talks
Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, after reporting ``no
change'' in the Yugoslav leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic met throughout Sunday for the
sixth time in seven days, signaling U.S. determination to search
for a peaceful way out of the Kosovo deadlock.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include a withdrawal of special troops, an
immediate cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and
beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Washington is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and
a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and getting
them ready for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic
of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands for
an end to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke said NATO would meet Monday ``to authorize action'' if
his mediation effort fails.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 after the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the
troubled province.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
and most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   After the previous, late-night session with Milosevic, an
exhausted-looking Holbrooke insisted ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. The U.S. envoy called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands _ including a
cease-fire, talks on Kosovo's future and allowing refugees to
return home _ from the U.S. insistence on verification.
	   Holbrooke told reporters early Sunday that his mission ``will
continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully
verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on the monitoring force. Washington is
pressing for such a force because Milosevic is known for breaking
promises.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated the Yugoslav president was
ready to comply with other conditions.
	   On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines
suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in
sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni
Telegraf bannered: `` NATO Threat Removed?''
	   But latest reports on military preparations suggested time was
running out.
	   On Sunday, six U.S. B-52 bombers, each capable of carrying up to
20 cruise missiles, arrived at Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in
Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west of London.
	   ``This is a warning,'' Col. Wendell Griffin, the detachment
commander, said. ``We are glad to be here and we are very prepared.
But we are on standby, and we will be ready and able to fly
missions eight or nine hours from now.''
	   Meanwhile, 10 A-10 attack aircraft, which were used successfully
against Iraqi armor in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, arrived at the
Aviano air base in northern Italy from their base in Spangdahlem,
Germany.
	   The A-10s carry 30 milimeter cannons designed to fight armored
forces.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
time the first snows fall.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
an international women's conference that the world ``must speak
with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian crisis and
violation of humanity'' in Kosovo.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians, central to the
Kosovo crisis, have played only a peripheral role in the intense
negotiations carried out by American troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke.
	   That will change if diplomacy moves beyond the issue of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands to end
the crackdown in the province and on to the next phase: serious
negotiations on the future of Kosovo and the ethnic Albanians'
aspirations for independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, have not given up the goal of independence from
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But independence for Kosovo has been rejected by the United
States and its allies, who fear it could lead to regional
instability. The Western countries want substantial autonomy for
Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation.
	   The ethnic Albanians say they will not be satisfied with any
formula that threatens the goal of independence.
	   Members of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating committee met among
themselves here Sunday, but were tight-lipped about the details.
	   Part of the problem is that Kosovo, where hundreds of ethnic
Albanians have died and more than 275,000 have been driven from
their homes, lacks a leader supported by everyone.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, a quiet man who advocates nonviolence, is
perhaps the best known of the ethnic Albanian leaders. But he is
essentially powerless.
	   Albanian sources say he agreed to take part in political talks
without the consent of other Albanian political parties, and, more
importantly, without the backing of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA, a disorganized military force that waged a seven-month
hit-and-run struggle against the Serbian military and police, is
key to any real settlement here.
	   But its very nature, scattered around the country with no
single, unified command structure, makes it difficult to deal with.
	   Holbrooke made two trips to Pristina, capital of the province,
during his latest round of talks in Yugoslavia, but Albanian
political sources say it seemed to be more to project the
appearance of high-powered diplomatic shuttling than to conduct
serious negotiations with the ethnic Albanians.
	   Talks in Pristina have concentrated on the compliance and
security aspects of any deal made in Belgrade with Milosevic.
Security is the key to the return of the refugees, many of whom are
living outdoors.
	   Despite his pacifist background, Rugova and his followers have
been beating the drums for NATO intervention.
	   ``We believe that an urgent NATO intervention against Serb
targets can save the people in Kosovo from a mass ethnic cleansing
and lead to softening of the humanitarian situation in Kosovo,''
Rugova's spokesman, Xhemail Mustafa, said Sunday.
	   Christopher Hill, the American ambassador to Macedonia and one
of the top U.S. negotiators in the region, has been trying to sell
an interim plan for the future of Kosovo. That plan would return
some of the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989, create an
independent police force in Kosovo and an independent parliament
and government for the province.
	   The idea is to bring the police closer to the municipality, said
Veton Surroi, a leading Albanian political figure. Where Serbs are
in a majority, the community would have Serbian police. And where
Albanians are the majority, there would be Albanian police.
	   In all, the police force would number about 2,500, or one for
every 800-900 people, close to European standards and far from the
more than 11,000 in the province now.
	   This new police force would be supervised by outsiders, perhaps
something like the U.N.'s International Police Task Force in
Bosnia, combined with a withdrawal of the Yugoslav military to a
point 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border and some kind of
effective outside military monitoring force.
	   The big problem is who will run the police and what kind of
military force will monitor the situation on the ground.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under the towering marble figures of the
Jews who founded Christianity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed
the first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
	   From now on, the pope said, Catholics should commemorate all the
Holocaust's murdered Jews when they annually mark the day Stein
died _ Aug. 9.
	   ``In the martyr Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square on a cool, overcast morning.
	   ``The value of her testimony is to render ever stronger the
bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he
said.
	   It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation:
The Roman Catholic Church putting all its ceremony, pomp and
grandeur into a tribute to a woman of Jewish heritage. Relatives of
Holocaust victims _ Stein's family _ sharing a dais with the leader
of Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Stein is thought to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
Apostles, whose statues looked down on Sunday's ceremony.
Incomplete records and the prevalence of conversions, forced and
otherwise, make it impossible to say for certain.
	   She was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Germany on Oct.
12, 1891 _ Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.
	   An atheist, she joined the Roman Catholic church in 1922, later
becoming a Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz, its way of punishing the Dutch
bishops for speaking out against him.
	   Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, the pope said.
She turned it down.
	   ```Why should I be excluded?''' he quoted her as saying.
	   ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers and sisters, my life
is, in a certain way, destroyed.''
	   Stein was in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the
Nazis came to arrest her.
	   Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, also among
the converts deported. At Auschwitz, they are thought to have been
taken almost directly from the trains to the gas chambers.
	   ``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said
the pontiff, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2 hour
ceremony.
	   ``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, we
also cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked at the
elimination of a people, costing the lives of millions of Jewish
brothers and sisters,'' he declared.
	   Absent, however, were any indications that the pontiff planned a
fuller accounting of the church's actions during the Holocaust, as
Jewish groups have asked.
	   Stein's family had urged that the pope use her canonization for
that, as had the family of a Catholic girl saved by a miracle the
church credits to Stein.
	   The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of
Kensington, California, wrote the pope in August, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reported. They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill
to the Jewish people'' but said the past is ``still waiting to be
fully acknowledged.''
	   In March, the church issued a long-awaited report on its actions
during the Holocaust. The document expressed remorse that some
Catholics did not do more, but praised the conduct of the wartime
pope, Pius XII, whom some accuse of failing to do enough against
the Nazis.
	   Improving relations with Jews has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More people have been
canonized during John Paul's nearly 20-year-old papacy than in any
other.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Far from the pressures of Washington and
talk of impeachment, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shook hands
with bystanders Sunday, announced new American aid grants and posed
for pictures with former street children.
	   The only people she wouldn't talk to were journalists.
	   ``She takes no questions these days,'' a member of Mrs.
Clinton's staff told a reporter who tried to approach the first
lady as she gazed at medieval icons in the crypt at St. Alexander
Nevski cathedral.
	   Sunday was the Clintons' 23rd wedding anniversary. The couple
marked the occasion early, with a dinner of specialties from their
favorite Arkansas haunts Friday on the eve of her departure from
Washington.
	   Sofia, where she arrived Sunday, is the first stop on Mrs.
Clinton's four-day womens' rights mission to Eastern Europe. She
travels to Prague on Monday to meet with Czech leaders and speak at
a conference organized by President Vaclav Havel and Nobel laureate
Elie Wiesel.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A prominent St. Petersburg businessman was in
critical condition Sunday after sustaining burns from a bomb
explosion, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Dmitry Filipov, president of the St. Petersburg Fuel Company,
underwent surgery Saturday night soon after a powerful bomb ripped
through his home, the Interfax news agency said. His bodyguards
were also injured.
	   The report provided no further details.
	   Filipov served on St. Petersburg's city council from 1990-1993
and ran for regional governor in 1996. He has been president of or
served on the boards of several companies in recent years, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Far from the pressures of Washington and
talk of impeachment, U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shook
hands with bystanders Sunday, announced new American aid grants and
posed for pictures with former street children.
	   The only people she wouldn't talk to were journalists.
	   ``She takes no questions these days,'' a member of Mrs.
Clinton's staff told a reporter who tried to approach the first
lady as she gazed at medieval icons in the crypt at St. Alexander
Nevski cathedral.
	   Sofia is the first stop on a two-country tour that began Sunday,
which also happens to be her 23rd wedding anniversary to U.S.
President Bill Clinton. He remained in Washington.
	   She travels to Prague on Monday to meet with Czech leaders and
to speak at a conference organized by President Vaclav Havel and
Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   Mrs. Clinton praised Bulgarians for their tolerance and their
progress in establishing democratic principles since the fall of
Communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria is one of the few former communist states to have
addressed issues involving its minorities _ 800,000 Turks and
300,000 Gypsies, or Roma _ peacefully and democratically.
Nongovernmental organizations aimed at promoting ethnic tolerance
and cooperation between communities have flourished.
	   ``It is a great pleasure for me to be in a country well known
for its tolerance and among few that I have seen during this
transition that have been so open to nongovernmental
organizations,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
	   Representatives from nongovermental organizations met with Mrs.
Clinton at a Jewish center in downtown Sofia.
	   They told the first lady about activities ranging from
monitoring elections and training judges to helping the disabled,
environmental conservation and protecting women from violence.
	   Before that meeting she delivered a donation of two vans to the
Sofia Faith, Hope and Love Center for former street children and
announced a dlrs 50,000 donation from the U.S. embassy to repair
the home.
	   She posed for a photo with the home's 20 children and treated
them to boxes of chocolates bearing her husband's signature.
	   Addressing a women's conference earlier, she announced a dlrs 15
million grant to bolster civil society in southeastern Europe, to
be channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development
as part of its democracy networking program.
	   Mrs. Clinton also announced a new USAID program that will
provide dlrs 300,000 in training and internships for women business
leaders and entrepreneurs from central and southeastern Europe.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' Mrs. Clinton told the opening session
of the two-day ``Women in the 21st Century conference.''
	   The conference is focusing on the role of women in social issues
confronting southeastern Europe, much of which is still recovering
from a half-century of Communist rule.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Thousands of Muslims demonstrators joined
hands and marched in Turkish towns and cities Sunday to protest a
ban on Islamic-style head scarves in schools and public offices.
Police shot and killed one person and wounded two others in an
argument over a traffic jam caused by the protests.
	   The Anatolia news agency said the shooting took place in Elazig
when a group of soccer fans on their way to a match got stuck in a
traffic jam caused by the demonstration.
	   It said police opened fire, killing a 25-year-old fan and
wounding two other men. The governor's office said in a statement
authorities would investigate.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A British woman critically injured
during an armed robbery at a hotel bar on Oct. 1 was airlifted to a
hospital in Great Yarmouth, England, on Saturday.
	   Medical officials at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital said that
although the victim remained in critical condition, she had
improved enough to withstand the 20-hour flight home by air
ambulance.
	   Paula Bridges, 41, of Suffolk, was shot in the heart during the
robbery at the Palm Garden Hotel where she was a guest along with
her family. Accounts of the robbery differed on whether the robbers
fired at people in the bar or whether Bridges was hit by a
ricocheting bullet.
	   In an effort to curb crimes involving firearms, the Barbados
government recently increased the penalty for illegal possession of
guns from two years in prison to 20 years.

Camenzind wins world road race, Armstrong fourth again.

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Lance Armstrong fell just short
of giving the World Cycling Championships and this scandal-hit
season a storybook finish.
	   In his first world's since overcoming cancer, the 27-year-old
from Austin, Texas, ended fourth in Sunday's glamor event, the
men's elite road race.
	   Cycling was plunged into crisis this summer by a series of
arrests and investigations into doping in the Tour de France.
	   An Armstrong victory would have provided the most upbeat
possible end to the sport's most troubled season.
	   Instead it was Switzerland's Oscar Camenzind who broke away to
win the wet and windswept race ahead of second-placed Peter Van
Petegem of Belgium and Italian Michele Bartoli, who took bronze in
the 258- kilometer (162-mile) event.
	   Armstrong's fourth place duplicated his finish in Thursday's
time trial, but he left the championships with his head held high.
	   ``If I had never been sick and was 100 percent, right now I
might be more disappointed,'' Armstrong said. ``Looking back over
the last 18 months to two years, I really can't be disappointed.''
	   Armstrong was in contention well into the last 17.2-kilometer
(10.7-mile) lap, but Camenzind made his decisive break up the final
steep climb, leaving Van Petegem, Bartoli and Armstrong behind.
	   The 27-year-old from Steinen, Switzerland, kept up the pace in
the final flat and cruised across the line, punching the air, 23
seconds clear.
	   Camenzind said the weather helped him.
	   ``If you had asked me two days ago, I thought there would be
about 50 guys in the sprint. But with the wind, the rain and the
tough course it was different.'' he said.
	   Armstrong won the world road race title in 1993. But this time
last year he was slowly returning to riding after chemotherapy and
surgery had put his testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs
and brain, into remission.
	   Spain's Abraham Olano, Thursday's time trial winner and the 1995
road champion did not start Sunday. Also not riding were the last
three Tour de France winners _ Marco Pantani, Jan Ullrich and
Bjarne Riis. Five of the world's top ten cyclists did not compete.
	   In the week's other major races, the Netherlands' Leontien van
Moorsel took gold in the women's time trial and silver in the elite
women's road race to cap her comeback from weight problems. Diana
Ziliute of Lithuania won the women's road race.
	   While there were no positive drug tests immediately reported at
the 10-race championships, the subject of doping hung like a dark
cloud over the event.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) began the week by setting
up the Council for the Fight Against Doping, a task force made up
of UCI officials, riders and representatives of the professional
teams.
	   But the UCI also agreed to cut the bans of three Swiss riders
who admitted taking performance enhancing drugs while UCI President
Hein Verbruggen insisted that cycling does more than any other
sport to fight doping.
	   The new anti-doping task force met for the first time Wednesday
and said its initial budget of 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.4
million) would be spent on increased anti-doping and blood tests,
medical coverage and contributions to research.
	   On Saturday, the Spanish watch maker Festina, sponsor of the
disgraced professional team that was kicked off this year's Tour de
France for its doping policy, said it would continue its
sponsorship and create a 4 million French Francs (dlrs 725,000)
fund to combat doping.
	   As cycling's season of shame approaches its end, authorities are
looking to next February's doping summit organized by the
International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, which may
introduce new anti-doping measures throughout sport in time for
next year's World Championships in Verona, Italy.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes, a senior U.S. envoy accelerated talks
Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, after reporting ``no
change'' in the Yugoslav leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton's national security
adviser told Cable News Network on Sunday that Milosevic ``is not
in compliance as of this point.''
	   The adviser, Sandy Berger, said that if Milosevic remains
defiant, NATO will act as early as Monday to authorize the alliance
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to launch military strikes.
	   ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's court,'' Berger said. ``He
can come into compliance or he can face military action by NATO''
at ``any time.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic met throughout Sunday
for the sixth time in seven days, signaling U.S. determination to
search for a peaceful way out of the Kosovo deadlock.

Shooting ends Lesotho ruling party rally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with attempted bombing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A gunshot and an attempted bombing
plunged a ruling-party rally into chaos Sunday, scattering
thousands of government supporters and sending Lesotho's premier
fleeing to safety.
	   Angry supporters of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
reportedly beat to death one person and injured four others when
they found them planting a bomb at the rally, the South African
Press Association reported.
	   Police arrested the surviving suspects, police commissioner
Bolutu Makoaba said.
	   An earlier gunshot injured a rally participant and sent Premier
Pakalitha Mosisili fleeing to safety.
	   The shot scattered about 5,000 party supporters, while some
members rushed to protect Mosisili and his deputy, Kelibone Maope.
	   The LCD called the shooting attack an assassination attempt by
opposition parties who have sporadically blockaded the capital of
Maseru since early August.
	   An opposition leader denied the allegation, saying the remarks
were a smear campaign. ``This is absolute trash,'' said alliance
spokesman Vincent Malebo. ``We are not assassins.''
	   A shooting suspect was arrested and questioned, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Tensions in Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom surrounded by
South Africa, have been running high since the May elections, which
opposition groups claim were rigged.
	   After an army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa and
nearby Botswana on Sept. 22 sent about 1,000 troops into the
country to restore calm. South Africa expected to establish order
quickly and leave, but scores were killed and its soldiers remain
in Lesotho.
	   The opposition alliance also held a rally Sunday, under heavy
security from South African troops in armored vehicles.
	   ``Our rally will proceed in spite of intimidation,'' Malebo
said. ``We want to prove our popularity.''
	   The government and the opposition are to meet Wednesday with
representatives of the Southern African Development Community, a
14-nation coalition, to discuss a peaceful resolution of their
disputes.

Milan puts a new spin on old favorites
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - The Milan collections for the Spring-Summer
1999 are like a movie remake _ they give a modern spin to past
favorites.
	   Running the gamut from hippie to high society, the designers cut
a contemporary edge on old styles and produce them in futuristic,
techno fabrics.
	   Sportswear, too, is a big theme of next season's warm-weather
clothes, the last fashion statement of the century.
	   ``This has been a very good round,'' Vogue fashion editor Andre
Leon Talley said of the nine-day preview showings, which closed
with Armani on Saturday.
	   More than design, the current ``moda Milanese'' is all about
fabric technology. Plastic, rubber and even steel are used to
create stretch, polished or frayed effects. High tech lasers punch
out leather, create a hologram effect, or trace psychedelic
patterns.
	   Although some embroidery is done by sophisticated technology,
most of the millions of beads and sequins which made up the
season's evening wear, as well as a number of daytime items, was
sewn on with prosaic needle and thread.
	   Everything is fringed from the hem of a skirt to the top of a
lace-up boot.
	   The silhouette is generally more romantic than raunchy, with
designer's loosening their grips on the female contours.
See-through fabric still prevails, but there are fewer plunging
necklines and dipping backs than in past seasons. Cutouts replace
slits.
	   The basic wardrobe includes a tube dress, a long skirt, and a
stretch top. Little shrug sweaters are the latest outer layer,
while jackets continue to fade.
	   Trousers are sometimes cropped, usually loose, and often have
extra large and long cuffs.
	   There are few belts in these collections, with the favorite
waistline either elasticized or low- waisted and standing away from
the body.
	   Some designers still like their footwear high, but the preferred
heel is a walkable two-inches. Most sandals are thonged, slippers
are the favorite flat, and beaded Indian moccasins the latest
revival footwear.
	   In the accessory department, fashionable varieties of the money
belt prevail, from a little purse hanging from the waist, to a
snugly bag, to a ``fanny'' pack worn around the hips.
	   Summer promises to be a thin year for the cosmetic lines, with
models wearing almost no make-up except for an occasional
eye-shadow. Hair styles are either demurely pinned-up or sternly
straight.
	   The latest rage in Italian drinks is ``limoncello,'' a brightly
colored spirit derived from the lemon, and it is also the favorite
new color for next summer, along with turquoise, raspberry, melon
and grape green. Otherwise the Milanese palette is predictably
gray, black and white.
	   Following is an alphabetical list of some of the best designer
offerings:
	   Armani: ultra soft jacket and dreamy sequined evening wear
	   Dolce and Gabbana: wonderful rubberized gowns
	   Fendi: the craziest oversized cuff of the season
	   Ferre: extravagant ball gowns and mean black leather
	   Gucci: beaded jeans to die for
	   Jil Sander: the perfect simple dress
	   Krizia: techno fabrics in glaring ``poison yellow''
	   Missoni: knitwear in the best Mediterranean palette
	   Prada: THE fanny pack
	   Versace: sexy stilettos, a new (for Versace) demure gown

Ex-communists break isolation, get chance to govern German state

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ The former East German communists were
invited Sunday to join a state government for the first time,
breaking a taboo upheld by Germany's mainstream parties since the
fall of the Berlin Wall.
	   The Social Democrats in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, who came
out on top in Sept. 27 state elections but need a partner to gain a
parliamentary majority, offered the ex-communists coalition talks
after rejecting a possible alliance with the Christian Democrats.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism got the chance
because voters swept the Christian Democrats from power in the
economically struggling eastern state, along with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in national elections the same day.
	   Governor-elect Harald Ringstorff, who sounded out both the PDS
and the Christian Democrats, said after a party meeting he wanted
to negotiate a ``stable agreement'' with the ex-communists.
	   The Christian Democrats, still recovering from the left's
victory in the federal election, condemned the move. Party state
chairwoman Angela Merkel called it ``a grave mistake for the future
of our country.''
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's designated successor as party
chairman, said the Social Democrats had ``lost all restraint'' in
dealing with a party he views as anti-democratic.
	   Ringstorff left open whether the PDS would wind up sharing power
or remain in opposition and tacitly support the Social Democrats.
Coalition talks open Tuesday.
	   The PDS is propping up a Social Democratic minority government
in another eastern state, Saxony-Anhalt, but it has never
officially been part of a ruling state coalition.
	   Sunday's offer underlined the growing influence of the PDS in
eastern Germany since support collapsed for Kohl, who merged East
Germany with the west in 1990 after the Berlin Wall fell.
	   Shunned by mainstream politicians in Bonn as a remnant of the
anti-democratic East German regime, the almost exclusively
eastern-based party already often cooperates in local government.
	   Many easterners feel the party better represents their interests
in a political system dominated by westerners.
	   The Social Democrats have ruled out working with with the PDS at
the federal level, but party chairman Oskar Lafontaine recently
backed cooperation in state politics as a way to make the
ex-communists more responsible.
	   Even Schaeuble says the traditionally anti-communist Christian
Democrats must open up to former members of the communist party
that once ruled East Germany.
	   ``We have to accept that there were different life paths when
the country was divided'' during the Cold War, he was quoted over
the weekend as telling Focus magazine.
	   Kohl's party lost heavily in eastern Germany on Sept. 27. Most
of the nation's support swung to the Social Democrats, but the PDS
also gained, increasing its voter share to 5.1 percent from 4.4
percent in 1994.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, a senior U.S. envoy
accelerated talks Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, after
reporting ``no change'' in the leader's tough stand on the crisis
in the Kosovo province.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, told CNN on Sunday that Milosevic ``is not
in compliance as of this point.''
	   Berger said that if Milosevic remains defiant, NATO will act as
early as Monday to authorize the alliance commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, to launch military strikes.
	   ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's court,'' Berger said. ``He
can come into compliance or he can face military action by NATO''
at ``any time.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 after the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the
troubled province.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic met throughout Sunday
for the sixth time in seven days, signaling U.S. determination to
search for a peaceful way out of the Kosovo deadlock.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include withdrawing special troops, calling an
immediate cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and
beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Washington is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and
a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and getting
them ready for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic
of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands for
an end to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke said NATO would meet Monday ``to authorize action'' if
his mediation effort fails.
	   After the previous, late-night session with Milosevic, an
exhausted-looking Holbrooke insisted ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. The U.S. envoy called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for a ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands _ including a
cease-fire, talks on Kosovo's future and allowing refugees to
return home _ from the U.S. insistence on verification.
	   Holbrooke told reporters early Sunday that his mission ``will
continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully
verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on the monitoring force. Washington is
pressing for such a force because Milosevic is known for breaking
promises.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated the Yugoslav president was
ready to comply with other conditions.
	   On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines
suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in
sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni
Telegraf bannered: '' NATO Threat Removed?''
	   But the latest reports on military preparations suggested time
was running out.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
time the first snows fall.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
an international women's conference that the world ``must speak
with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian crisis and
violation of humanity'' in Kosovo.

Russia calls NATO representative to Moscow for talks on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Russia called its representative to
NATO and its ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow for emergency
consultations on potential NATO airstrikes on the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, officials said Sunday.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told a news
conference. He said Yeltsin, who is on a visit to Uzbekistan, is
being constantly updated on the situation in Kosovo.
	   Russia fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, a Russian
ally. NATO, based in Belgium, is threatening to intervene if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic doesn't let up on a crackdown
against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo that has killed
hundreds in recent months and left quarter of a million homeless.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Sunday that Russia
will try to preserve peace in Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said that
if NATO uses force to try to resolve the Kosovo crisis, Russia may
revise its relationship with the western alliance.
	   And a top Russian military official said that Russia was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.

Congolese rebels advance on eastern air base

	   ELILA BRIDGE, Congo (AP) _ A day after shooting down a jetliner,
Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday through
government defense lines, showing the confidence of a victor in a
week-old battle for a strategic air base.
	   Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the
Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of
artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four
kilometers (two miles) away.
	   Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government forces,
surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed to
respond to Sunday's attacks. Some troops reportedly retreated
through a single road corridor leading out of the town.
	   On Saturday, the rebels said they shot down a Congolese Boeing
727 which was attempting to land at Kindu air base with 40 troops
and ammunition. In Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which
owned the aircraft, said the victims were civilians fleeing
fighting in Kindu.
	   It was not possible to confirm independently either claim.
	   Kalunga said the airport, although still under government
control, was in effect unoperational because of the rebel
surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby.
	   War-weary, physically exhausted and sweaty, hundreds of rebel
troops and Rwandan soldiers marched through dense tropical forest
went to reinforce their comrades at Kindu.
	   After a week of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters had made
little progress and failed to capture the town outright.
	   The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt
against President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400
tribes.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.
	   The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. There are
unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan are
involved in defending Kindu.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ former allies who installed
him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion _ of
sponsoring the new fighting.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are
supporting Kabila. The assistance was essential in routing an early
rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts of
Kinshasa in mid-August.
	   The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and are
poised to overrun the rest of the town.
	   Under a scorching sun, the column of rebel reinforcements
heading to Kindu sneaked through abandoned roadside hamlets.
	   The silence of their march was interrupted only by the singing
of crickets and the clanging of the bullet belts hanging around the
soldiers' necks.
	   Soldiers walked by empty huts made of mud and palm leaves. Some
rested in the shade of the umbrella-shaped acacia trees.
	   The soldiers stopped for the night at the bridge over the
chocolate-colored Elila River, which guards the path to Kindu.
	   There was no immediate comment on the latest developments from
the government in Kinshasa, which claimed earlier in the week it
was in control of the tarmac bridge.

Romania says NATO can use its airspace in emergency and unforeseen
</HEADLINE>
cases
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania decided Sunday to allow NATO
to use its airspace in emergency situations if the alliance
launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   President Emil Constantinescu convened the country's Supreme
Defense Council to consider a NATO request made Friday to allow
alliance aircraft to use Romanian airspace.
	   Later, a statement from the presidential office said ``We agree
to NATO access in emergency and unpredictable situations.''
	   Following a four-hour meeting, the Supreme Defense Council
added, however, that Romania's army would not participate in
military action against its neighbor if NATO launches airstrikes to
force President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to international
demands on Kosovo.
	   ``Romania cannot afford direct participation in fighting actions
if these actions take place,'' the statement said, adding Romania
supports a peaceful solution to the situation in the Serbian
province.
	   The council also decided to reinforce the army, signaling it was
worried that the deteriorating crisis in Kosovo ``might generate
risks and threats to Romania's national security.''
	   Romania is anxious to join NATO, but Yugoslav officials have
warned neighboring countries against being drawn into the crisis
over international demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   Torn between its desire to join the alliance and its friendship
with Serbia, Romanian leaders have voiced concern that the conflict
could easily spill over into Romania.
	   Romania has its own Hungarian minority and is afraid that if
Kosovo's Albanians are given too much autonomy it could spark
similar demands from the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians.
	   Constantinescu said he had conferred on the Kosovo issue by
telephone with the president of neighboring Bulgaria, Petar
Stoyanov.
	   Romania reiterated it would send medics and backup equipment in
the region in case of a NATO air strike.
	   Romania shares a 425 kilometer- (265 mile-) border with
Yugoslavia.

Henman beats Agassi for Swiss Indoors title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes, detail, background, CHANGES

 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Britain's number one Tim Henman
produced some of the best tennis of his career Sunday to oust
fourth-seed Andre Agassi in the final of the Swiss Indoors and
collect his second title of the season.
	   After successfully defending his Tashkent title last week,
Henman went on to defeat the American veteran 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in
two hours, 16 minutes to earn his first career back-to-back titles
and extend his winning streak to 12 victories.
	   ``I played some of the best tennis of my career, the kind I only
dreamed about,'' said Henman, seeded sixth. ``The level was just so
high and I was very consistent.
	   ``And to win in a final with a player of the highest pedigree
like Agassi you have to put out some great tennis to win.''
	   The victory avenged his loss to Agassi 10 weeks ago, when the
American beat out Henman for the title in Los Angeles in the pair's
only other head-to-head.
	   ``He just rose above today and played deserving of the victory
and I didn't,'' said Agassi, who reached the final without dropping
a set. ``He made it happen. I was really impressed.
	   ``Initially I wouldn't have categorized him with the best
players in the world but today he showed he's perhaps one of the
strongest players on this surface. He kicked my butt.''
	   Currently eighth in the ``Road to Hannover'' standings, the
victory solidifies Henman's chances of a berth at the ATP Tour
World Championship next month.
	   ``I hope this was an indication of things to come,'' said
Henman, who has four career titles. ``I know I can still improve
and I believe I can go on to win more and bigger tournaments.''
	   With both players attacking the net and looking solid, it was
Agassi who created the first break opportunity.
	   But leading 0-30 at 3-3 on Henman's serve, Agassi blew his
chance to jump ahead, squandering three break points, with a steely
Henman scoring the next five.
	   Leading 5-4, Henman broke Agassi, the American unable to save a
second break point, with a wide shot costing him the set.
	   Another wide-shot cost Agassi his opening serve in the second,
giving Henman a 2-0 lead. But the Briton squandered his advantage
on his next service game, double-faulting twice to put Agassi back
on serve.
	   But a determined Henman, refusing to let the tables turn,
immediately broke back then held to take the set.
	   As Henman began to struggle with his serve in the third set,
Agassi began to get back into the match, breaking to go 4-2, then
holding to take the set and keep his hopes alive.
	   The pair traded breaks twice in the fourth set before the
British number one took Agassi's serve at 5-4 to seal the title.
	   ``I was up a break in the fourth and should have been able to
hang on and turn the match around,'' said Agassi, who has a 57-13
win-loss record this season. ``In hindsight I should have been
pleased that I got back into the match. But I could have shot
myself if I'd had a gun, I was so angry with myself.''
	   Agassi, who won four titles this season, is currently fifth in
the ``Road to Hannover'' standings. While a victory in the final
would have virtually guaranteed him a berth at the World
Championships, reaching the final has further cemented his foothold
in the top-eight standings.
	   Reaching the final will also aid his climb back up the ATP
rankings.
	   The American, who finished last year 122 in the world _ his
lowest ATP ranking since turning pro in 1985 _ is currently eighth
in the standings.
	   Going from No. 141 in November 1997, to his current ranking of
No. 8, the 28-year-old American still has a chance to leapfrog
compatriot Pete Sampras to to finish the year as No. 1.
	   ``It's possible,'' admitted Agassi. ``But first I need to be
able to win.''

Eyes on Lima race as Peruvians vote in municipal elections Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls close at 2100 GMT, exit polls expected shortly after.
Official results were expected late Sunday or Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Peruvians voted in municipal elections across
the country Sunday, with eyes fixed on the mayoral race in Lima,
where the popular mayor tested the political waters.
	   Sunday's election results could have an influence on whether
Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade decides to challenge President Alberto
Fujimori if the president seeks re-election in 2000.
	   Andrade, who made his name by cleaning up the once garbage
strewn and street vendor congested streets of Lima's center, was
leading in pre-election polls by a comfortable margin. He was
elected mayor of Lima in 1995.
	   Andrade's chief opponent in the municipal elections, Juan Carlos
Hurtado Miller, served as minister of economy under Fujimori in the
early 1990s. Hurtado is running on the ticket of a political
movement that is believed to be a front for Fujimori.
	   During Hurtado's tenure as economy minister, the government
instituted severe austerity measures credited with ending
hyperinflation and generating economic growth.
	   Voting got off to a slow start Sunday and voters grew impatient
in the long lines outside various voting stations in Lima. The
delays were attributed to irregularities including the absence of
election personnel and voting materials.
	   Army troops stood guard at voting booths across the country, but
the early hours of voting proceeded without incident.
	   Through the 1980s and early 1990s extreme-left Shining Path
guerrillas carried out terror campaigns to block voting, killing
hundreds of mayors and candidates. Violence has dropped off sharply
since the capture of the group's major leaders in 1992 and 1993.
	   Only one mayor was assassinated during this year's campaign in
comparison to 410 mayors and candidates in the 1989 municipal
elections.
	   In addition to the much watched Lima race, voters elected 1,811
other mayors and city councils.
	   About 13.4 million Peruvians are registered to vote. Voting is
mandatory. Those who didn't vote face fines of dlrs 35.

Kenyans sweep men's, women's titles; Osoro runs third fastest time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Kenyans swept the men's and women's titles at
Chicago Marathon on Sunday, with Ondoro Osoro winning in the
third-fastest time ever and Joyce Chepchumba capturing the women's
division.
	   Osoro, running in his first marathon, overtook defending
champion Khalid Khannouchi in the last 1 1-2 kilometers (mile). He
won in 2 hours, 6 minutes and 54 seconds, 49 seconds off the world
record set last month in Berlin.
	   Osoro's time set a Chicago Marathon record, topping the 2:07:10
Khannouchi ran last year.
	   Chepchumba, winner of the 1997 London Marathon, won in 2:23:57,
a personal best. Chepchumba made up 21 seconds between the 34th and
35th kilometers (21st and 22nd miles) to pass Colleen DeReuck, the
leader for most of the race. DeReuck finished well behind.
	   Khannouchi, a Moroccan who lives in suburban New York, took the
lead in the 34th kilometers (21st mile) and looked as if he was on
his way to his second Chicago Marathon title. But Osoro kept
gaining, finally overtaking him as they passed Soldier Field, about
a kilometer (less than a mile) from the finish line.
	   ``When we were approaching 6 miles (9 1-2 kilometers) to go, one
of the guys started to move,'' Osoro said. ``I had to stay behind
and see how he ran. I had to keep going and I had to catch him.''

Fitzgerald drubs Borg with drop shots and high altitude
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ John Fitzgerald used drop shots
and Pretoria's high altitude to his advantage at the MTN Champions
Sunday as he defeated Bjorn Borg 7-5, 6-3 to capture his first
singles title on the seniors tour.
	   The Australian, better known for his doubles prowess, said he
was delighted just to share a court with Borg.
	   ``He still has such a presence and he's done so much for the
tour as well,'' Fitzgerald said.
	   Earlier in the tournament, Fitzgerald ousted top seed Henri
Leconte of France in the first round and 1996 champion Yannick Noah
of France in the semifinals.
	   ``The altitude and the fast surface suits him,'' Borg said of
Fitzgerald. ``He's been here 10 times, so he must like to play
here.''
	   Borg has failed to win a title in his four visits to South
Africa.
	   Fitzgerald then teamed with South African Kevin Curren to win
the doubles title, defeating the Swedish pair of Borg and Mats
Wilander 7-5, 7-5.

 &UR; Romania says NATO can use its airspace in emergency and unforeseen
cases
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with decision &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania decided Sunday to allow NATO
to use its airspace in emergency situations if the alliance
launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   President Emil Constantinescu convened the country's Supreme
Defense Council to consider a NATO request made Friday to allow
alliance aircraft to use Romanian airspace.
	   Later, a statement from the presidential office said ``We agree
to NATO access in emergency and unpredictable situations.''
	   Following a four-hour meeting, the Supreme Defense Council
added, however, that Romania's army would not participate in
military action against its neighbor if NATO launches airstrikes to
force President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to international
demands on Kosovo.
	   ``Romania cannot afford direct participation in fighting actions
if these actions take place,'' the statement said, adding Romania
supports a peaceful solution to the situation in the Serbian
province.
	   The council also decided to reinforce the army, signaling it was
worried that the deteriorating crisis in Kosovo ``might generate
risks and threats to Romania's national security.''
	   Romania is anxious to join NATO, but Yugoslav officials have
warned neighboring countries against being drawn into the crisis
over international demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   Torn between its desire to join the alliance and its friendship
with Serbia, Romanian leaders have voiced concern that the conflict
could easily spill over into Romania.
	   Romania has its own Hungarian minority and is afraid that if
Kosovo's Albanians are given too much autonomy it could spark
similar demands from the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians.
	   Constantinescu said he had conferred on the Kosovo issue by
telephone with the president of neighboring Bulgaria, Petar
Stoyanov.
	   Romania reiterated it would send medics and backup equipment in
the region in case of a NATO air strike.
	   Romania shares a 425 kilometer- (265 mile-) border with
Yugoslavia.

	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods missed a 4-foot putt at
the last as the favored Americans were upset by Spain in the
Dunhill Cup semifinal Sunday. Yet the Spaniards succumbed in the
final to South Africa, who won the 1 million pound (dlrs 1.67
million) championship for the second year in a row.
	   Woods squandered a 4-stroke lead after 10 holes to lose to
Spain's Santiago Luna as the Americans slumped 2-1 in the semifinal
after they looked on course for an easy win.
	   But Luna couldn't ride his luck in the final, losing to South
Africa's Retief Goosen by one. Then David Frost and Ernie Els, who
teamed up with Goosen in last year's triumph, won their matches
against Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal for a 3-0
triumph.
	   For Goosen, who scored a level par 72, it was his 10th win in a
row in Dunhill Cup play while Frost's 4-over 76 was enough for a
2-stroke victory over Jimenez.
	   The South Africa victory became a sweep when Olazabal produced
something rare at the 17th. Forced to chip out of the Road Hole
Bunker away from the flag, he then pitched back into it again and
wound up with a double bogey six on the way to a round of 77 and a
2-stroke loss to Els.
	   Woods' blunder at the last with a playoff in his grasp
effectively clinched a semifinal victory for the Spaniards with
Olazabal three shots clear of Mark O'Meara in the last game of the
three. John Daly had already beaten Jimenez by one stroke in
another nail-biting finish but the Americans lost 2-1.
	   It was the day the Old Course hit back at Woods after the
American, with rounds of 66-70-66 on the first three days, seemed
to have mastered the home of golf with his long shots off the tee
and his precise approaches to the green.
	   By the time he reached the 11th, he had only bogeyed two holes
throughout the tournament and he stood four ahead of Luna with
victory seemingly a formality.
	   He bogeyed 11 and 12, Luna birdied 12 and Woods' lead had
slipped to one. When the Spaniard birdied 14, the two were level
and the American missed a 6-foot putt at 17 to fall behind going to
the last.
	   Putting for an eagle from just off the green, Woods left his
ball only four feet from the hole. Luna then handed the American a
great chance of a playoff when his eagle putt from an almost
identical position only just made the top of the green and rolled
back into the depression known as the Valley of Sin.
	   Luna's follow up putt ended three feet from the hole and Woods
needed to hold his to force a playoff. But he slid it wide and
three feet past and Luna holed his to clinch an upset victory.
	   ``I had a chance but pulled a couple of putts at the last two
holes,'' Woods said. ``I just didn't hit them the way I liked and
it wasn't good enough to take it into extra holes.
	   ``I had the chance with my putt at the last but I pulled it and
gave him the match. It was a matter of picking the line and
trusting it but I pulled the putt.''
	   Although Daly won, he almost threw his match away too.
	   Daly, who was 6-up at the turn but level going to the last,
carded 73 to beat Jimenez by two for a personal Dunhill Cup record
of 8-1 having played in the United States' 1993 triumph.
	   ``The most important thing was that I won and gave us a
chance,'' said Daly, who double bogeyed the 17th after taking a
penalty drop by the greenside wall, and drove to the back of the
green at the 354-yard last to wind up with a birdie three.
	   ``I drove the green to 20 feet for my eagle at the ninth. That
put me six ahead and I got real conservative from there. I've done
that my last two games and that's not my style. You get defensive
when you're six shots up.''

Arab League praises Yemen, Eritrea for resorting to tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League praised the leaders of Yemen
and Eritrea Sunday, saying they spared the Middle East ``the agony
of war'' when they resorted to international arbitration to resolve
a dispute over Red Sea islands.
	   An international arbitration panel in The Hague on Friday
granted Yemen control of three Red Sea islands, a decision that
Eritrea said it accepts.
	   The 22-member Arab League called the arbitration ``a civilized
choice... that spared the region the agony of war.''
	   ``It is a real victory for peace,'' the statement added.
	   Yemen and Eritrea both claimed the three islands, one of which,
the Greater Hanish, was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in
December 1995. Yemen retained control of the other two, Lesser
Hanish and Zuqar.
	   The tribunal awarded all three islands to Yemen and stipulated
that the decision should be complied with within 90 days.
	   The islands sit across one of the world's major shipping lanes,
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the
southern entrance to the Red Sea.

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, on his
first trip out of Russia since this spring, canceled a welcoming
ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because he wasn't feeling well,
his spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled during another public
ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, the capital of this Central
Asian nation, and had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam
Karimov. But the two later held a one-on-one summit as scheduled.
	   The trip is Yeltsin's first high-profile foray since an economic
crisis swamped his country in August. The 67-year-old president,
whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years in
power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight
and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home
outside Moscow.
	   His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when he attended a
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
	   During his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin
is expected to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two
former Soviet republics, whose economies have suffered residual
effects of the crisis that hit Russia after it devalued its
currency in August and defaulted on some of its debt.
	   On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay wreaths at a
monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, and salute
an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled.
	   ``This week was extremely tense. (Yeltsin) was affected by a
difficult flight and the end of a difficult week,'' Yeltsin's chief
spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told a news conference. ``He has a
cold. He was coughing when we spoke.''
	   It was sunny and about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) in Tashkent
on Sunday.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin's schedule Monday may also change
depending on how he feels.
	   Yeltsin and Karimov later met at a government residence outside
Tashkent and signed several agreements on fighting smuggling and
other crime and expanding cultural ties. The two sides are expected
to sign economic agreements Monday.
	   Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak
President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on
economic, science and technical cooperation and on combating drug
trafficking.
	   Last week, Yeltsin said he also planned to discuss the situation
in Afghanistan with his Uzbek and Kazak counterparts. Russia and
the two republics fear an influx of refugees and weapons from
Afghanistan, and possibly a spillover of fighting that has wracked
the country.
	   Yeltsin was accompanied by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov,
officials from the Federal Border Guard Service, the State Customs
Committee, the Defense Ministry, and the Russian Academy of
Sciences.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A British woman critically injured
during an armed robbery at a hotel bar on Oct. 1 has been airlifted
to a hospital in Great Yarmouth, England.
	   Medical officials at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital said Saturday
that although the victim remained in critical condition, she had
improved enough to withstand the 20-hour flight home by air
ambulance.
	   Paula Bridges, 41, of Suffolk, was shot in the heart during the
robbery at the Palm Garden Hotel where she was staying with her
family. Accounts of the robbery differed on whether the robbers
fired at people in the bar or whether Bridges was hit by a
ricocheting bullet.
	   In an effort to curb crimes involving firearms, the Barbados
government recently increased the penalty for illegal possession of
guns from two years in prison to 20 years.

Brazil's Rodrigo Pessoa wins individual show jumping at worlds

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Brazil's Rodrigo Pessoa took home the last gold
medal awarded at the World Equestrian Games Sunday, defeating three
other riders in the final show jumping test.
	   Pessoa qualified for Sunday's four-way final in first position
and went on to win the event with a total score of 4 penalty
points. He rides the 11-year-old German-bred gelding Gandini
Lianos.
	   Frenchman Thierry Pomel, 42, scored 5 points to clinch the
silver on the selle Francais gelding Thor des Chaines. The
defending champion, Germany's Franke Sloothaak, 40, earned the
bronze on stallion San Patrignano Joly with a score of 8.
	   At 26, Pessoa was among the youngest riders competing. He is the
son of 64-year-old veteran Nelson Pessoa, who also competed in this
edition of the worlds.
	   ``I learned everything from my father so I tried to do
everything he taught me,'' Pessoa said. ``He has never won a gold
at the worlds so this medal is for both of us.''
	   Pessoa made his equestrian career on the European circuit,
winning the World Cup show-jumping title this season.
	   Switzerland's Willi Melliger, 45, the 1996 Olympic silver
medalist, was fourth with 12 penalty points.
	   Melliger's horse, a grey Holsteiner gelding, Calvaro V, won the
Best Horse award for making the fewest faults.
	   In the final test, each competitor takes a turn riding his three
rivals' horses and the person who accumulates the least penalties
wins. Penalties are awarded for refusing, knocking down or touching
an obstacle, and for falling.
	   The top American, Alison Firestone, did not qualify for Sunday's
final, finishing a disappointing 14th in Saturday's round of
jumping.
	   After dominating the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Germany again
dominated the worlds here, winning 10 medals, including five golds.
It collected golds in the show-jumping, the individual and team
dressage, and the women's and team vaulting.
	   New Zealand won both the team and individual three-day event,
with the individual gold going to 1990 champion Blyth Tait.
	   The sole U.S. gold went to Devon Maitozo in the men's vaulting.
	   Switzerland's Werner Ulrich won the individual driving and the
Netherlands won the team driving event.
	   The next edition of the worlds are scheduled for Jerez, Spain in
2002.

Deadline rules deprived Carter of 1978 Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who
seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won the
coveted honor in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rules for
nominations.
	   That prize was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David
peace accords. However, the five-member Norwegian awards committee
also wanted to honor Carter for brokering the pact, only to be
foiled by their own rules.
	   ``The Nobel committee wanted to give the prize to all three,''
said Geir Lundestad, the current committee's nonvoting secretary,
said on Sunday. ``But Carter had not been nominated when the
deadline ran out.''
	   Nominations postmarked by Feb. 1 are accepted for that year's
prize. The committee can add it own nominations at its first
meeting of the year, usually in early March.
	   The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978,
about five weeks before that year's peace prize was annouCkuld not give him
the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in the 1978 awards
citation ``the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy
Carter.''
	   Lundestad said the committee, which works in deep secrecy in its
five or six meetings a year, tried to find a loophole in the rules,
which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation.
	   The Nobel Prizes were endowed by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish
industrialist whose 355 inventions included dynamite. In his 1895
will, Nobel endowed the prizes, and said the peace prize should be
picked by a Norwegian committee and the rest by Swedish
institutions.
	   Lundestad said the committee turned to the Swedish Nobel
Foundation for advice on Carter because it was a question of
principle.
	   Stig Ramel, a Swede who was then director of the Nobel
Foundation, advised against breaking the rules, Lundestad said by
telephone.
	   Normally, the committee refuses to discuss past candidates in
keeping with a strict policy of secrecy in which selection details
are sealed for 50 years. Lundestad made an exception because Ramel
revealed the Carter dilemma in his 1994 memoirs.
	   Carter has repeatedly been nominated for the Nobel prize for his
consistent and wide-ranging peace efforts. He is also among the 139
candidates for the prize being announced in Oslo on Friday.
	   However, early speculation leans more toward someone involved in
the Northern Ireland peace process, Czech President Vaclav Havel to
mark the 30th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of his country, or
a human rights activist to mark the 50th anniversary of the U.N.
Human Rights Charter.
	   While the committee wanted to honor Carter and could not, with
hindsight some regretted the prize for other reasons.
	   Four years after Begin won the prize, the Israeli prime minister
ordered an invasion of southern Lebanon in which thousands of
civilians died. Kare Kristiansen, who served on the peace prize
committee from 1991 to 1994, once said that, had the committee
waited, Begin probably would not have won.

Iran denies German businessman sentenced to death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iranian official saying case referred to the
supreme court &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran denied Sunday that an appeals court
upheld a death sentence a day earlier for a German businessman
convicted of having sex with a Muslim woman.
	   No new ruling has been issued for the 56-year-old Helmut Hofer,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted as saying
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   Hofer's lawyer and several newspapers reported Saturday that the
death sentence against Hofer was upheld by the appeals court. The
lawyer showed a copy of the verdict to The Associated Press.
	   The denial seems to be an attempt by the Iranian government to
mollify Germany, which reacted angrily to news of the verdict.
	   It could reflect, too, infighting within the fractured Iranian
government, where hard-line factions and moderates centered around
President Mohammad Khatami are vying for influence. Hard-liners, in
particular, control the powerful judiciary.
	   The Iranian ambassador in Bonn was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry to hear a protest over the verdict. German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said the court ruling ``inevitably throws a
new shadow on both sides' wish to improve relations.''
	   On Sunday, Iran criticized Germany for turning Hofer's case into
a political issue that could threaten relations.
	   ``As far as Iran is concerned, Hofer's case is trivial and is a
judicial issue where political considerations do not play a role,''
a commentary on state-run Tehran radio said Sunday.
	   There were conflicting accounts of the appeal Sunday.
	   Mohammadi said that Hofer's case has already been presented to
the supreme court. Another court routinely examined the case for
possible errors before forwarding it, he said.
	   A spokesman for the judiciary, Fotovat Nasiri-Savadkuhi, told
the Iranian news agency that ``the decision of the supreme court to
endorse or reject the death sentence would be the last and final
judicial decision of this case.''

Miyake kicks off summer shows with exhibition

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Art or fashion? Issey Miyake's exhibition opening
Sunday at the Cartier Foundation for Modern Art was a glorious
combination of both.
	   Clothes shown as puppets on strings were literally jumping for
joy.
	   As an appropriate introduction to a mad nine days of nearly 100
international luxury ready-to-wear shows for summer 1999, Miyake's
exhibition couldn't be beat for class and futuristic appeal.
	   He steers fashion, art and the cyberworld into the next
millennium with his latest techniques.
	   In the opening room called ``Jumping,'' viewers get a great look
at Miyake's styles of the last 10 years, as the jumping wire-puppet
mobiles show his permanent-pleated clothes in fantastic
Japanese-lantern shapes.
	   Suspended from the ceiling, they unfold, then collapse and fold
flat for practicality.
	   This is the line called Pleats Please, made so popular by Miyake
in the past five years, in lower prices for top fashion, around the
dlrs 150 or a bit more per item.
	   ``I would like to make the next generation move in their
fashions, to make people feel free,'' said Miyake as he roamed
around the Exhibition called ``Making Things,'' on until January
17.
	   Miyake loves to collaborate with other artists, who use his
methods and clothes for symbiotic inspiration.
	   There's a squiggly dragon-shaped spot on the Cartier Fondation
floor where last week Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang literally
exploded and burnt a Miyake outfit.
	   He then transferred the gunpowdered patterns onto fabric, in
Pleats Please clothes, hung on the glass walls of the museum.
	   Several other artists' works were on display, including a big
wall hanging quilt made by fusing and ``blowing up'' Miyake designs
as a three-by-eight-meter (12-by-24 foot) pneumatic work inflated
by an air blower.
	   ``His energy and open-mindedness to new ideas are a fabulous
inspiration,'' said artist Tim Hawkinson, 37, of California. ``But
I hated cutting up the Pleats Please outfits.''
	   ``Just before'' is a huge roll of black material; you can see
the dresses coming out from it. ``Shops or customers can gear their
lengths, decolletes, and so on to each shape, cutting as you go, so
to speak,'' said Jun Kanai, of Miyake, New York.
	   With ``A Piece of Cloth'' dresses - whole wardrobes may be cut
from tubes of material, which can be customized by stores or
customers.
	   Miyake, 60, who studied at the Chambre Syndicale fashion school
in Paris and worked briefly at Givenchy, is very aware of women as
wearers of clothes, however high-tech and arty his productions may
seem.
	   ``Yes, I'd like women of the future to participate in the making
of their outfits,'' he said.
	   ``There are no secrets to my methods. Everybody can join in.
It's interactive, if you wish. But remember,'' he said with a wink,
``a computer gives no ideas.''
	   Meanwhile Jose Levy's show in the Louvre Carrousel area was a
quiet, restful moment of seaside blues and grays.
	   Levy, 35, has often showed menswear, and is now launching
himself into light, summery clothes based on nostalgia.
	   Suits in light beiges and blues, some lovely little poplin kilts
and tri-toned knits in sea-haze pinks, grays and blues were out of
an impressionist painting. Along with easy shorts, they could look
just at home at seaside Deauville or Honfleur.
	   These are girlish and mild clothes, nothing too long, nothing
too shocking.
	   More exciting - but perhaps less wearable - numbers will blast
out during the week, as shown by the likes of Alexander McQueen at
Givenchy or Jean-Paul Gaultier.
	   The fashion mood is good here, whatever the downbeat worldwide
stock markets are showing,'' said Didier Grumbach, new head of the
ready-to-wear and couture's Chambre Syndicale.

Holbrooke pushes talks as U.S. bombers take positions

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, a senior U.S. envoy
accelerated talks Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, after
reporting ``no change'' in the leader's tough stand on the crisis
in the Kosovo province.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic met into the night
Sunday for the sixth time in seven days, signaling U.S.
determination to search for a peaceful way out of the Kosovo
deadlock.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 after the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the
troubled province.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   The major obstacle to solving the crisis appears to be
Holbrooke's demand that Milosevic agree to an expanded
international monitoring mission to verify compliance with demands
of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include a withdrawal of special troops, an
immediate cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and
beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, told CNN on Sunday that Milosevic ``is not
in compliance as of this point.''
	   Berger said that if Milosevic remains defiant, NATO will act as
early as Monday to authorize the alliance commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, to launch military strikes.
	   ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's court,'' Berger said. ``He
can come into compliance or he can face military action by NATO''
at ``any time.''
	   Washington backed up those words with actions. Six U.S. B-52
bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and a contingent of A-10
anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

Swisscom: asset-value cuts over dlrs 700,000 in Asia, Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's telephone company
Swisscom said Sunday it has adjusted its books to reflect 942
million Swiss francs (dlrs 725 million) in shrunken values of
investments in Asia and Eastern Europe.
	   Spokesman Werner Nuber said the company had long since informed
Swiss authorities of the downward adjustments to the value of its
assets over three years, reported earlier Sunday by the weekly
SonntagsBlick.
	   The main investments affected include those in the European
Unisource alliance, which it has shared with AT and T, Dutch and
Swedish partners; Malaysia's Mutiara Telecom; and India's Aircel
Digilink, the company said.
	   But Swisscom said it still regards its investments in the
turbulent markets as having long-term promise despite problems from
1995 through 1997.
	   The government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of Switzerland's postal service, has begun
selling shares to the public, with an initial offering of about 30
percent of the firm's share capital earlier this month.
	   Nuber refused to characterize the writeoffs as losses and
rejected comparisons with UBS, Switzerland's and Europe's largest
bank.
	   Last month UBS said market turmoil would cause it an after-tax
loss of up to 1 billion francs (then dlrs 720 million) in the third
quarter of 1998.

Henman beats Agassi for title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes, detail, background, CHANGES
throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Britain's Tim Henman overcame a
third-set stumble to beat fourth-seed Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-3, 3-6,
6-4 on Sunday, winning the Swiss Indoors for his second title of
the season and the fourth of his career.
	   After successfully defending his Tashkent title last week,
Henman needed two hours, 16 minutes Sunday for his 12th straight
victory and his first consecutive titles on the ATP Tour.
	   ``I played some of the best tennis of my career, the kind I only
dreamed about,'' the sixth-seeded Henman said. ``The level was just
so high and I was very consistent.
	   ``And to win in a final with a player of the highest pedigree
like Agassi you have to put out some great tennis to win.''
	   The victory avenged his loss to Agassi 10 weeks ago, when the
American beat out Henman for the title in Los Angeles at the
Mercedes Cup in the pair's only other head-to-head meeting.
	   ``He just rose above today and played deserving of the victory
and I didn't,'' said Agassi, who reached the final without dropping
a set. ``He made it happen. I was really impressed.
	   ``Initially I wouldn't have categorized him with the best
players in the world, but today he showed he's perhaps one of the
strongest players on this surface. He kicked my butt.''
	   Eighth in ATP Tour World Championship standings, the victory
solidified Henman's chances of a berth at the season-ending
tournament in Hannover, Germany, next month.
	   ``I hope this was an indication of things to come,'' Henman
said. ``I know I can still improve and I believe I can go on to win
more and bigger tournaments.''
	   With both players attacking the net and looking solid, it was
Agassi who created the first break opportunity.
	   But leading 0-30 at 3-3 on Henman's serve, Agassi blew his
chance to jump ahead, squandering three break points and allowing
Henman to win the next five.
	   Leading 5-4, Henman broke Agassi, the American unable to save a
second break point, with a wide shot costing him the set.
	   Another wide shot cost Agassi his opening serve in the second,
giving Henman a 2-0 lead. But the Briton squandered his advantage
on his next service game, double-faulting twice to put Agassi back
on serve.
	   But a determined Henman, immediately broke back, then held to
take the set.
	   As Henman began to struggle with his serve in the third set,
Agassi began to get back into the match, breaking to go 4-2, then
holding to take the set and keep his hopes alive.
	   The pair traded breaks twice in the fourth set before the No.
1-ranked Briton took Agassi's serve at 5-4 to seal the title.
	   ``I was up a break in the fourth and should have been able to
hang on and turn the match around,'' said Agassi, whose match
record fell to 57-13 this season. ``In hindsight I should have been
pleased that I got back into the match. But I could have shot
myself if I'd had a gun, I was so angry with myself.''
	   Agassi, who won four titles this season, is currently fifth in
the ATP Tour World Championahip standings.
	   While a victory in the final would have virtually guaranteed him
a berth at the World Championship, reaching the final has further
cemented him among the top eight that will get invited to Hannover
	   Reaching the final will also aid his climb back up the ATP Tour
rankings.
	   The American, who finished 122nd last year _ his lowest since
turning pro in 1985 _ has risen to eighth.
	   Going from No. 141 in November 1997 to No. 8, the 28-year-old
American still has a chance to pass compatriot Pete Sampras to to
finish the year as No. 1.
	   ``It's possible,'' admitted Agassi. ``But first I need to be
able to win.''

18 killed in fresh violence in northeastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Heavily armed tribal militants attacked a
village in India's remote Tripura state killing eight people and
injuring five others, police said Sunday.
	   The attackers were members of the National Liberation Front of
Tripura, one of several separatist groups fighting for an
independent homeland in India's troubled northeast.
	   All the victims were from the Bengali speaking minority and
included a 100 year old man and a three year old child. The
militants also set on fire several homes in the attack on
Trishabari village Saturday night, police said.
	   The killings were the latest in continuing violence in
northeastern India in which 23 people have been killed since
Saturday.
	   In Sonitpur in the neighboring Assam state, 1,100 kilometers
(950 miles) east of New Delhi, militants from the Bodo tribe
entered a market a shot at a group of people standing in front of a
shop. Six people died in the spot and eight more were injured.
	   In Darrang in Assam, militants shot dead four people Saturday,
even as police were counting the dead in inter-tribal fighting that
left 14 people dead a day before. All the victims in Saturday's
killings were Bengali speaking minority.
	   The area is 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) east of the India
capital New Delhi.
	   Police were still investigating the death of five forest guards
who were killed by a mob of tribals on Saturday.

	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Mariano Puerta and Franco Squillari set
up the first all-Argentine final on the ATP Tour in 16 years by
upsetting Spaniards in semifinals Sunday at the dlrs 340,000
Palermo clay-court event.
	   Puerta ousted top seeded Alex Corretja 7-5, 6-2, while Squillari
got past Galo Blanco 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2) in rain-interrupted
matches.
	   Because of the poor weather, the final was set to be played
under the lights Sunday evening.
	   The Puerta-Squillari encounter is the first time two Argentines
meet in an ATP final since Jose Luis Clerc and Guillermo Vilas
faced off at Gstaad, Switzlerand in 1982.

Athens mayor rides to re-election on conservative surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Athens' populist mayor stormed to
re-election Sunday and other conservatives scored gains against the
powerful Socialist party in municipal elections considered a key
referendum on the government's policies, exit polls showed.
	   Although the hundreds of mayoral and district races will not
change the Socialists' grip on parliament, the outcome is widely
interpreted as a test for Premier Costas Simitis two years before
general elections.
	   The government has faced strong backlash from labor groups and
civil servants over its economic austerity measures designed to
earn the European Union's poorest country a spot in the bloc's
single currency group by 2001.
	   ``There is a clear political message. It is a message of protest
against the government,'' said Aris Spiliotopoulos, spokesman for
the main opposition conservative party, New Democracy.
	   Exit polls carried by Greek media showed New Democracy-backed
candidates leading in mayoral races in the port of Piraeus and the
northern city of Salonica. But because no candidate reached an
outright majority, they will join hundreds of other races decided
in run-off elections next Sunday.
	   In Athens, Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos appeared to be the
runaway winner for a second four-year term with at least 53 percent
of the vote, exit polls said. The challenger backed by the
Socialists ran a distant second.
	   The victory keeps Avramopoulos, a former diplomat, in city hall
as Athens prepares for the 2004 Olympics. But many political
analysts also see the mayor's job as a possible stepping stone for
Avramopoulos to enter national politics and challenge the
Socialists.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas insisted Athens was a
``special case'' given Avramopoulos' cross-party appeal. ``The
government will continue its work,'' he said.
	   Avramopoulos, who has taken care to avoid party squabbles, also
drew considerable support form Socialist and leftist voters, the
exit polls showed.
	   In the more than 50 races for regional governor seats, the
Socialists appeared to maintain their dominance but lost some
ground to conservatives, who have led Greece for only three of the
past 17 years. Final results in all the races, including about 900
mayoral contests, were not expected until Monday.
	   Millions of Greeks returned to their places of birth to vote
because of complicated red tape involved in registering their new
residences. More than half of Greece's 10.2 million people live in
the greater Athens area. Voting in Greece is mandatory.
	   Even Avramopoulos couldn't vote for himself. He traveled to the
tiny mountain village of Elliniko, about 150 kilometers (95 miles)
southwest of Athens, to cast his ballot.
	   At least a dozen villages staged protests against a government
program to merge their local communities into larger and more
powerful municipalities.
	   Voting was postponed until Wednesday in one tiny community on
the island of Crete, where many inhabitants have a fierce regional
identity. At one village in northern Greece, locals blocked the
roads with tractors in an attempt to stop election officials from
setting up ballot boxes.

	   ELILA BRIDGE, Congo (AP) _ A day after shooting down a jetliner,
Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday through
government defense lines, showing the confidence of a victor in a
week-old battle for a strategic air base.
	   Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the
Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of
artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four
kilometers (two miles) away.
	   Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government forces,
surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed to
respond to Sunday's attacks. Some troops reportedly retreated
through a single road corridor leading out of the town.
	   On Saturday, the rebels said they shot down a Congolese Boeing
727 which was attempting to land at Kindu air base.
	   The rebels said the plane carried 40 troops and ammunition,
information they learned by monitoring the government's radio
communications in Kindu. The rebels also said the plane was used in
recent days to ferry troops and ammunition to Kindu.
	   In Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which owned the
aircraft, said the victims were civilians fleeing fighting in
Kindu.

Treasury chief calls for improved regulation of world financial
</HEADLINE>
markets.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Treasury chief Gordon Brown said Sunday that he
would use a meeting with his European counterparts on Monday to
call for improved regulation of the world's financial markets.
	   Brown said he would urge European Union finance ministers to
immediately create a ''global financial regulator'' to exercise
greater control over the actions of international speculators and
hedge funds.
	   ''Investors and savers and indeed, consumers have a right to
know that their money is being properly protected and not being
gambled,'' Brown told David Frost during a BBC television
interview. ''And we are intent on creating these rules, not just
for Britain, but right round the world.''
	   He said he would also urge Europe to help fund and reform the
International Monetary Fund, a 182-nation lending institution, so
it can ''do the job of preventing crises, instead of just having to
deal with them once they happen.''
	   President Clinton has also called for a boost to the IMF's
lending power, and the White House is currently negotiating with
Congress over legislation to provide dlrs 18 billion to help the
IMF replenish strained accounts.
	   The world financial crisis erupted in Thailand 15 months ago. A
collapse of currencies and stock markets triggered by a flight of
foreign investment money has pushed several Asian nations into
steep recessions and leveled the Russian economy. The crisis is now
threatening to strike Brazil and other nations in Latin America.

U.S. first lady begins East Europe women's rights trip in Sofia

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new quotes from first lady, bystanders &QL; 
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Far from the pressures of Washington and
talk of her husband's impeachment, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced new American aid grants and posed for pictures
with former street children while in Bulgaria on a trip to promote
women's rights.
	   Although Sunday was the Clintons' 23rd wedding anniversary, the
couple marked the occasion apart, having celebrated on Friday with
a dinner on the eve of Mrs. Clinton's departure.
	   The first lady, on a four-day mission to Eastern Europe,
addressed the opening session of a conference entitled ``Women in
the 21st Century'' focusing on the role of women in social issues
confronting southeastern Europe, much of which is still recovering
from a half-century of Communist rule.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' she said.
	   ``Democratic progress depends on the progress of women,'' Mrs.
Clinton told delegates at the two-day conference. ``Economic
progress depends on progress of women. A vibrant civil society
depends upon the full contribution of women.''
	   She announced a dlrs 15 million grant to bolster civil society
in southeastern Europe, to be channeled through the U.S. Agency for
International Development, and said a new program would provide
dlrs 300,000 in training and internships for women business leaders
and entrepreneurs.
	   Later, at a meeting with activists at a Jewish center in
downtown Sofia, Mrs. Clinton praised Bulgarians for their tolerance
and their progress in establishing democratic principles since the
fall of Communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria is one of the few former communist states to have
addressed issues involving its minorities, in particular, the
800,000 Turks and 300,000 Gypsies, or Roma, who live in the
country.
	   ``It is a great pleasure for me to be in a country well known
for its tolerance,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``In comparison to many
other transition countries, Bulgaria sets quite an example.''
	   Earlier, she delivered two vans donated by the U.S. Embassy to a
center for former street children, and announced a dlrs 50,000
donation for repairs to the center.
	   Mrs. Clinton posed for a photo with the home's 20 children and
treated them to boxes of chocolates bearing President Clinton's
signature.
	   A popular figure abroad, she shook hands with some 50 local
people and was cheered by foreign tourists as she walked to St.
Sofia church, the oldest in Bulgaria's capital.
	   ``She is a nice strong lady because she stands by her husband
and defends him,'' said Ivan Ivanov, 28, one of the bystanders who
turned out for a glimpse of the first lady.
	   ``She is a very strong woman as she could overcome all those
problems with her husband,'' Kamelia Grozdanova, 24, said,
referring to the Monica Lewinsky affair and the impeachment storm
it has generated. ``She is the only one who can judge him, not the
people. These are personal matters.''
	   The first lady was headed later for a reception and dinner with
President Petar Stoyanov and his wife. She told the gathering that
she hoped to return to Bulgaria some day, ``hopefully with my
husband...''
	   She travels to Prague, Czech Republic, on Monday to meet with
Czech leaders and speak at a conference organized by President
Vaclav Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.

German coalition talks bog down on energy tax, nuclear power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with session over, income tax cut set but
deadlock on energy taxes and nuclear power. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
bogged down Sunday over plans to raise energy taxes and scrap
nuclear power, two of the toughest topics in talks on forming a new
center-left government.
	   The issues are vital to the environmentalist Greens, junior
partner in the negotiations. But Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder, who campaigned as a friend of business, has made clear
he is giving priority to jobs and economic growth.
	   Party leaders announced details of plans to cut Germany's high
income taxes, seen as crucial to spurring the economy and bringing
down double-digit unemployment. But they failed to reach common
ground on nuclear power.
	   Greens co-chair Juergen Trittin said he still expects Schroeder
to be sworn in as chancellor as planned on Oct. 27.
	   ``Of course there are differences in the approach to getting out
of atomic power,'' said the Social Democrats' chairman, Oskar
Lafontaine. ``You can't solve all of this in an hour.''
	   Both party platforms call for shutting down Germany's 19 nuclear
power plants, a prospect that already has utilities threatening to
sue the government for billions of marks.
	   Schroeder says he wants to try to reach an agreement with the
nuclear industry to begin decommissioning nuclear plants. But
Greens leaders are looking for a firm and swift timetable.
	   Lafontaine denied that the coalition talks were falling behind
schedule. Both parties' energy policy experts would now seek to
bridge the gap on nuclear power, he said.
	   Trittin said the two parties also remained at odds on how much
to raise energy prices. He refused to give details.
	   Negotiators have reportedly agreed on a modest rise in gasoline
prices of 6 pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter, but proposals to tax
other energy sources such as heating oil and electricity apparently
remained in dispute.
	   The incoming government wants to raise energy taxes to finance a
cut in contributions to lavish welfare-state benefits _ a burden
shared by companies and employees. The charges make German labor
among the world's most expensive.
	   German industry organizations lashed out at the emerging tax
plans over the weekend. Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the Federation of
German Industry, said they amounted to a ``massive increase in the
burden on business'' and would lead to layoffs.
	   Making good on a campaign promise aimed at middle-class voters,
both party leaders said Sunday income taxes would be lowered
starting Jan. 1. To offset the cuts, dozens of loopholes for
businesses and the well-off are to be closed.
	   The four-year plan will bring some 10 billion marks (dlrs 6.1
billion) of tax relief in 2002, Lafontaine said.
	   Under the plan, the top individual tax bracket will drop from
currently 53 percent to 48.5 percent in three stages, while the
lowest tax bracket will fall more sharply, from 25.9 percent to
19.9 percent. Corporate earnings taxes also are to be cut.

mayoral contests, were not expected until Monday.
	   Millions of Greeks returned to their places of birth to vote
because of complicated red tape involved in registering their new
residences. More than half of Greece's 10.2 million people live in
the greater Athens area. Voting in Greece is mandatory.
	   Avramopoulos couldn't even vote for himself. He traveled to the
tiny mountain village of Elliniko, about 150 kilometers (95 miles)
southwest of Athens, to cast his ballot.
	   At least a dozen villages staged protests against a government
program to merge their local communities into larger and more
powerful municipalities.
	   Voting was postponed until Wednesday in one tiny community on
the island of Crete, where many inhabitants have a fierce regional
identity. At one village in northern Greece, locals blocked the
roads with tractors in an attempt to stop election officials from
setting up ballot boxes.

Ethnic Albanians, central to Kosovo crisis, playing peripheral

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians, central to the
Kosovo crisis, have played only a peripheral role so far in the
negotiations being carried out by U.S. troubleshooter Richard
Holbrooke.
	   That will change if diplomacy moves beyond the issue of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's compliance with U.N. demands and on
to the next phase: serious negotiations on the future of Kosovo and
the ethnic Albanians' aspirations for independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, have not given up the goal of independence from
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   But independence for Kosovo has been rejected by the United
States and its allies. The Western countries want substantial
autonomy for Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation.
	   The ethnic Albanians say they will not be satisfied with any
formula that threatens the goal of independence.
	   Members of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating committee met among
themselves here Sunday, but were tight-lipped about the details.
	   Part of the problem is that Kosovo, where hundreds of ethnic
Albanians have died and tens of thousands have been driven from
their homes, lacks a leader supported by everyone.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, a quiet man who advocates non-violence, is
perhaps the best known of the ethnic Albanian leaders. But he is
essentially powerless.
	   Albanian sources say he agreed to take part in political talks
without the consent of other Albanian political parties, and, more
importantly, without the backing of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA, a disorganized military force which waged a seven-month
hit-and-run struggle against the Serbian military and police, is
key to any real settlement here.
	   But its very nature, scattered around the country with no
single, unified command structure, makes it difficult to deal with.
	   Holbrooke made two trips to Pristina, capital of the province,
during his latest round of talks in Yugoslavia, but Albanian
political sources say it seemed to be more to project the
appearance of high-powered diplomatic shuttling than to conduct
serious negotiations with the ethnic Albanians.
	   Talks in Pristina have concentrated on the compliance and
security aspects of any deal made in Belgrade with Milosevic.
Security is the key to the return of the more than 275,000
refugees, many of whom are still living outdoors.
	   Despite his pacifist background, Rugova and his followers have
been calling for NATO intervention.
	   ``We believe that an urgent NATO intervention against Serb
targets can save the people in Kosovo from a mass ethnic cleansing
and lead to softening of the humanitarian situation in Kosovo,''
Rugova's spokesman, Xhemail Mustafa, said Sunday.
	   Christopher Hill, the American ambassador to Macedonia and one
of the top U.S. negotiators in the region, has been trying to sell
an interim plan for the future of Kosovo. That plan would return
some of the autonomy taken away by Serbia in 1989, create an
independent police force in Kosovo and an independent parliament
and government for the province.
	   The idea is to bring the police closer to the municipality, said
Veton Surroi, a leading Albanian political figure. Where Serbs are
in a majority, the community would have Serbian police. And where
Albanians are the majority, there would be Albanian police.
	   The big problem is who, how many and who will run the police and
what kind of military force would monitor the situation on the
ground.

U.S. first lady begins East Europe women's rights trip in Sofia

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Far from the pressures of Washington and
talk of her husband's impeachment, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton announced new American aid grants and posed for pictures
with former street children while in Bulgaria on a trip to promote
women's rights.
	   Although Sunday was the Clintons' 23rd wedding anniversary, the
couple marked the occasion apart, having celebrated on Friday with
a dinner on the eve of Mrs. Clinton's departure.
	   The first lady, on a four-day mission to Eastern Europe,
addressed the opening session of a conference entitled ``Women in
the 21st Century'' focusing on the role of women in social issues
confronting southeastern Europe, much of which is still recovering
from a half-century of Communist rule.
	   ``The American people, the American government and the president
of the United States will stand with you as you press ahead to meet
the challenges before you,'' she said.
	   ``Democratic progress depends on the progress of women,'' Mrs.
Clinton told delegates at the two-day conference. ``Economic
progress depends on progress of women. A vibrant civil society
depends upon the full contribution of women.''
	   She announced a dlrs 15 million grant to bolster civil society
in southeastern Europe, to be channeled through the U.S. Agency for
International Development, and said a new program would provide
dlrs 300,000 in training and internships for women business leaders
and entrepreneurs.
	   Later, at a meeting with activists at a Jewish center in
downtown Sofia, Mrs. Clinton praised Bulgarians for their tolerance
and their progress in establishing democratic principles since the
fall of Communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria is one of the few former communist states to have
addressed issues involving its minorities, in particular, the
800,000 Turks and 300,000 Gypsies, or Roma, who live in the
country.
	   ``It is a great pleasure for me to be in a country well known
for its tolerance,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``In comparison to many
other transition countries, Bulgaria sets quite an example.''
	   Earlier, she delivered two vans donated by the U.S. Embassy to a
center for former street children, and announced a dlrs 50,000
donation for repairs to the center.
	   Mrs. Clinton posed for a photo with the home's 20 children and
treated them to boxes of chocolates bearing President Clinton's
signature.
	   The first lady was headed later for a reception and dinner with
President Petar Stoyanov and his wife.
	   She travels to Prague, Czech Republic, on Monday to meet with
Czech leaders and speak at a conference organized by President
Vaclav Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.

Swisscom: asset-value cuts over dlrs 700 million in Asia, Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS figure in overline to million. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's telephone company
Swisscom said Sunday it has adjusted its books to reflect 942
million Swiss francs (dlrs 725 million) in shrunken values of
investments in Asia and Eastern Europe.
	   Spokesman Werner Nuber said the company had long since informed
Swiss authorities of the downward adjustments to the value of its
assets over three years, reported earlier Sunday by the weekly
SonntagsBlick.
	   The main investments affected include those in the European
Unisource alliance, which it has shared with AT and T, Dutch and
Swedish partners; Malaysia's Mutiara Telecom; and India's Aircel
Digilink, the company said.
	   But Swisscom said it still regards its investments in the
turbulent markets as having long-term promise despite problems from
1995 through 1997.
	   The government-controlled Swisscom, formerly the
telecommunications arm of Switzerland's postal service, has begun
selling shares to the public, with an initial offering of about 30
percent of the firm's share capital earlier this month.
	   Nuber refused to characterize the writeoffs as losses and
rejected comparisons with UBS, Switzerland's and Europe's largest
bank.
	   Last month UBS said market turmoil would cause it an after-tax
loss of up to 1 billion francs (then dlrs 720 million) in the third
quarter of 1998.

	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ What France's men couldn't
do its women could, winning the epee team title Sunday at the world
fencing championships.
	   Italy's women, who had settled for silver and bronze in the
individual foil event, joined forces to take gold in the team foil
competition.
	   Led by Laura Flessel, who won the individual epee title on
Friday, France's women clinched the title with a sound 45-38
victory over Cuba for the gold.
	   Ukraine beat out Hungary 45-41 to take the bronze.
	   France reached the gold-medal duel edging Hungary 45-43 in the
semifinals, while Cuba had trounced the Ukraine 45-32.
	   Two-time individual foil world champion Giovanna Trillini, who
went home with the silver earlier this week, led a strong Italian
squad which included individual bronze medallist Valentina Vezzali.
	   The Italians triumphed over Romania 45-35 for the crown, while
Poland thumped Russia 45-30 for the bronze.
	   Italy slashed its way into the final with a blistering 45-26
victory over Poland in the smeifinals while Romania reached the
gold-medal showdown by defeating Russia 45-31.

French far rightist rejects German charges on Holocaust remark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ French far-right leader Jean-Maire Le Pen
suggested an interview published Sunday that he will not attend an
eventual trial in Germany for calling Nazi gas chambers ``detail in
the history of World War II.''
	   Le Pen told the newsweekly Der Spiegel he does not believe he
will get a fair trial, claiming he was the victim of ``a
manipulation by the media, the judicial system and politicians.''
	   The European Parliament on Tuesday stripped Le Pen's immunity
from prosecution so a German court can try him for his remarks last
year at a news conference in Munich.
	   ``In general, I don't run away from anyone,'' Le Pen said in the
interview. ``But I also have little desire to follow orders
dictated from abroad.''
	   Munich prosecutors want to charge Le Pen under German laws
making it a criminal offense to trivialize the Holocaust. He could
face a maximum of five years in jail if convicted.
	   Under German law, European Parliament members cannot be
prosecuted unless the assembly lifts their immunity.
	   Le Pen has already been convicted and fined in France for
referring to the gas chambers as a ``detail in history.''
	   ``I have never denied or belittled the existence of the gas
chambers,'' he told Der Spiegel. ``But if you wrote the history of
World War II on a thousand pages, the gas chambers would get a few
lines at best.''

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Retrief Goosen won for the 10th
straight time, one short of Greg Norman's record, and South Africa
swept Spain 3-0 on Sunday to become only the second nation to
succesfully defend its Dunhill Cup title.
	   Playing on a blustery Old Course, Goosen two-putted for birdie
at 18 for an even-par 72, good enough to beat Santiago Luna's 73,
and then waited for David Frost to defeat Miguel Angel Jimenez
(76-78).
	   Ernie Els completed the sweep with a 75-77 victory over Jose
Maria Olazabal, who gave his match away at the 17th.
	   Forced to chip out of the Road Hole Bunker away from the flag,
he then pitched back into it again and wound up with a double bogey
six.
	   ``This is the man right there,'' Els said of Goosen. ``He was
our trump card all week and to play a level par round this
afternoon in those conditions was quite phenomenal.
	   ``When the weather is like this back home we don't play golf. We
go indoors.
	   ``We were all very surprised when Spain got through to the
final,'' Els said. ``We had been working out how we were going to
play the Americans. I think we were a little bit at ease to play
the Spaniards.''
	   Goosen repeated his feat of last year, when he won five straight
times to pace his country to the crown over Sweden, and made South
Africa the first nation to repeat since the inaugural years of 1985
and 1986 when Australia won consecutive titles.
	   ``I am already looking forward to next year and standing here
again with the trophy,'' Goosen said. ``It's tiring in conditions
like that, but we've gone through it before and knew what to
expect.
	   ``We're going to feel it tonight, for sure.''
	   Spain likely will feel it more.
	   It appeared to have the momentum after Luna took advantage of a
collapsing Tiger Woods to lead Spain to a 2-1 victory in the
morning semifinals over the United States.
	   Luna stunned Woods 71-72, thanks to the American blowing a
four-stroke lead over the final eight holes, including missing a
1-meter (4-foot) putt on 18.
	   Woods' blunder at 18 with a playoff in his grasp effectively
clinched a semifinal victory for the Spaniards with Olazabal three
shots clear of Mark O'Meara in the last match of the three.
	   John Daly had already beaten Jimenez by two strokes (73-75) in
another nail-biting finish and Olazabal finished off O'Meara 72-76.
	   It was the day the Old Course hit back at Woods after the
American, with rounds of 66-70-66 on the first three days, seemed
to have mastered the home of golf with his long shots off the tee
and his precise approaches to the green.
	   ``I had a chance but pulled a couple of putts at the last two
holes,'' Woods said. ``I just didn't hit them the way I liked and
it wasn't good enough to take it into extra holes.
	   ``I had the chance with my putt at the last but I pulled it and
gave him the match. It was a matter of picking the line and
trusting it but I pulled the putt.''
	   South Africa, meanwhile, reached the semifinals with a 2-1
victory over Australia.
	   Frost easily beat Craig Parry by six strokes (72-78) and Goosen
won his ninth straight with a 71-74 victory over Stuart Appleby.
	   Only Steve Elkington won for Australia, 72-73 over Els.

Italy's Eni, Amoco Egypt and EGPC sign dlrs 700 million gas deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Italy's Eni SpA and Amoco Egypt signed a
contract Sunday to sell 480 million cubic feet (14.4 million cubic
meters) of natural gas per day to the state-run Egyptian General
Petroleum Corp. by the year 2003.
	   The 20-year contract covers the largest volume of Egyptian gas
brought to the market and is the first sales agreement for the
Temsah offshore field in the Mediterranean. A five-year,
negotiation-free extension is also available.
	   As part of the agreement, Eni SpA and Amoco Egypt will spend
dlrs 700 million during the next four years to develop Temsah's 3.9
trillion cubic feet (117 million cubic meters) of proven reserves.
	   ``It's a big commitment by EGPC,'' Eni's Chief Operating
Officer, Luciano Sgubini said at the signing ceremony Sunday.
	   ``Without this agreement, we would never spend the money to
develop this field,'' he said.
	   Under the agreement, which is aimed at expanding domestic
consumption of natural gas to preserve the country's crude oil
reserves, EGPC will purchase the gas at rates derived from the
price of the benchmark Gulf of Suez Mix, which is linked to the
price of Brent crude.
	   Sgubini said the concession holders will begin delivering gas to
EGPC by the second half of 1999, starting at a rate of 35 million
cubic feet (1.05 million cubic meters) per day and working up to
480 million cubic feet (14.4 million cubic meters) per day by 2003.
	   The International Egyptian Oil Co., Eni's Egyptian affiliate,
and Amoco Egypt each hold a 25 percent stake in Temsah, while EGPC
holds the remaining 50 percent. IEOC is the concession's operator,
and Petrobel _ a joint venture between IEOC and EGPC _ will develop
the field.

One killed by Indian shelling in disputed Kashmir Valley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Indian troops launched artillery
at a small town in the Pakistani controlled Himalayan region of
Kashmir, killing one person and destroying scores of shops and
buildings, police said Sunday.
	   The Indian cross-border attack on Saturday forced some 3,000
people to leave the border town of Loiaat in Neelum valley, 105
kilometers (65 miles) from Muzaffarabad _ the capital of the
Pakistani-held Kashmir, they said.
	   Witnesses said Pakistani troops retaliated.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Indian government in New
Delhi.
	   The attack destroyed shops, several hotels, a mosque and a
government building.
	   Pakistani and Indian troops regularly trade fire on the border
of Kashmir _ the remote region over which the countries have
repeatedly fought since they won independence from Britain in 1947.
Each country holds part of the disputed valley and claims the rest.

Holbrooke pushes talks as U.S. bombers take positions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with journalists seeing smoke, hearing
sporadic gunfire near ethnic Albanian village &QL; 
 &UR; KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes, a senior U.S. envoy accelerated talks
Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, after reporting ``no
change'' in the Yugoslav leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic met into the night
Sunday for the sixth time in seven days, signaling U.S.
determination to search for a peaceful way out of the Kosovo
deadlock.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include a withdrawal of special troops, an
immediate cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and
beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton's national security
adviser told Cable News Network on Sunday that Milosevic ``is not
in compliance as of this point.''
	   The adviser, Sandy Berger, said that if Milosevic remains
defiant, NATO will act as early as Monday to authorize the alliance
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to launch military strikes.
	   ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's court,'' Berger said. ``He
can come into compliance or he can face military action by NATO''
at ``any time.''
	   Washington backed up those words with actions. Six U.S. B-52
bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and a contingent of A-10
anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and getting
them ready for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic
of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands for
an end to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke said NATO would meet Monday ``to authorize action'' if
his mediation effort fails.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 after the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the
troubled province.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
and most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   In Kosovo, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj about 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a kilometer (half mile) from the village.
	   After the previous, late-night session with Milosevic, an
exhausted-looking Holbrooke insisted ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. The U.S. envoy called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands _ including a
cease-fire, talks on Kosovo's future and allowing refugees to
return home _ from the U.S. insistence on verification.
	   Holbrooke told reporters early Sunday that his mission ``will
continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully
verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on the monitoring force. Washington is
pressing for such a force because Milosevic is known for breaking
promises.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated the Yugoslav president was
ready to comply with other conditions.
	   On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines
suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in
sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni
Telegraf bannered: `` NATO Threat Removed?''
	   But latest reports on military preparations suggested time was
running out.
	   On Sunday, six U.S. B-52 bombers, each capable of carrying up to
20 cruise missiles, arrived at Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in
Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west of London.
	   ``This is a warning,'' Col. Wendell Griffin, the detachment
commander, said. ``We are glad to be here and we are very prepared.
But we are on standby, and we will be ready and able to fly
missions eight or nine hours from now.''
	   Meanwhile, 10 A-10 attack aircraft, which were used successfully
against Iraqi armor in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, arrived at the
Aviano air base in northern Italy from their base in Spangdahlem,
Germany.
	   The A-10s carry 30 milimeter cannons designed to fight armored
forces.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
time the first snows fall.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
an international women's conference that the world ``must speak
with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian crisis and
violation of humanity'' in Kosovo.

Russia awaits belated fourth-quarter crisis budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government has promised to release a
belated emergency fourth-quarter budget this week, but has yet to
come up with an overall plan to tackle its 2-month-old economic
crisis.
	   With Russians facing rising prices, empty shelves and the worst
grain harvest in decades, a Russian agricultural delegation is
heading to the United States this week for negotiations on grain
imports. The prime minister has turned to the European Union for
food and medicine.
	   The government said last week it would drop or lower import
duties on basic foods such as meat, butter and grain in an attempt
to restore stocks that have shrunk since mid-August. Russia's
economic malaise burst into crisis when the government defaulted on
some of its debts and devalued the ruble, sending the prices of
imports soaring.
	   There have not been serious shortages of staple foods, but
inadequate supplies of medicines have been reported.
	   Two weeks into the fourth quarter, the government is at last
expected to release a budget for the quarter on Wednesday or
Thursday. It has promised an overall anti-crisis plan later this
month.
	   It remains unclear, however, whether the budget will include a
delayed installment of a loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Thursday week that the
budget had already factored in the money, even after he returned
empty-handed from a trip to Washington to request release of the
loan.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British woman critically injured during an armed
robbery at a Barbados hotel bar on Oct. 1 returned home to England
on Sunday.
	   Paula Bridges, 41, of Suffolk, remained unconscious throughout
the 20-hour flight, and was listed in ''stable but critical''
condition upon arrival at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth on
England's east coast, said Rosemary Smalley, clinical operations
manager at the hospital.
	   Bridges was shot in the heart during the robbery at the Palm
Garden Hotel where she was staying with her family. Accounts of the
robbery differed on whether the robbers fired at people in the bar
or whether Bridges was hit by a ricocheting bullet.
	   The bullet penetrated Bridges' heart, and she underwent
emergency surgery. Medical officials at the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital in Barbados decided Saturday that although Bridges
remained in critical condition, she had improved enough to survive
the flight home. A team of Barbados medical staff accompanied her.
	   Smalley said doctors in England were evaluating Bridges'
condition, and it was too early to say whether she would require
additional surgery.
	   In an effort to curb crimes involving firearms, the Barbados
government recently increased the penalty for illegal possession of
guns from two years in prison to 20 years.

Thousands evacuated from Haifa hills as fire ravages homes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Interior Minister saying fire was likely
accidental

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Thousands of Israelis were evacuated from their
homes in the northern city of Haifa Sunday as one of the worst
forest fires in Israel's history ravaged a neighborhood, destroying
several homes and large tracts of forest.
	   The fire, fed by strong winds and hot, dry weather conditions,
burned some 20 homes in the exclusive Deniya neighborhood perched
atop the Carmel mountain range above the Mediterranean Sea. Israel
radio reported that some 5,000 dunams (1,250 acres) of surrounding
forest was also lost.
	   Air force helicopters, airplanes and soldiers were called to
help fight the blaze that fire officials said started overnight in
a nearby picnic area. Local residents said they were awakened by
the smell of smoke as police called on thousands of them to
evacuate the area.
	   Interior Minister Eli Suissa said the fires were likely started
accidentally by weekend picnickers who left coals burning from
their barbecues in the forest.
	   But officials suspect arson in a scattering of smaller blazes in
nearby Wadi Ara, where police and Israeli Arabs recently clashed
over a land dispute.
	   Israel radio said the fire in Haifa was one of the worst in
Israel's 50-year history.

Thousands evacuated from Haifa hills as fire ravages homes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Thousands of Israelis were evacuated from their
homes in the northern city of Haifa on Sunday as one of the worst
forest fires in Israel's history ravaged a neighborhood, destroying
several homes and large tracts of forest.
	   The fire, fed by strong winds and hot, dry weather conditions,
burned some 20 homes in the exclusive Deniya neighborhood perched
atop the Carmel mountain range above the Mediterranean Sea. Israel
radio reported that some 1,250 acres (505 hectares) of surrounding
forest was also lost.
	   Air force helicopters, airplanes and soldiers were called to
help fight the blaze that fire officials said started overnight in
a nearby picnic area. Local residents said they were awakened by
the smell of smoke as police called on thousands of them to
evacuate the area.
	   Interior Minister Eli Suissa said the fires were likely started
accidentally by weekend picnickers who left coals burning from
their barbecues in the forest.
	   But officials suspect arson in a scattering of smaller blazes in
nearby Wadi Ara, where police and Israeli Arabs recently clashed
over a land dispute.
	   Israel radio said the fire in Haifa was one of the worst in
Israel's 50-year history.

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijani voters seeking stability and
long-elusive prosperity for their oil-rich nation cast ballots
Sunday in a presidential election the authoritarian incumbent
looked certain to win.
	   Opposition groups boycotted the vote in this former Soviet
republic once plagued by war and political chaos, and claimed
President Geidar Aliev's government was delaying results so it
could tamper with the outcome.
	   More than 72 percent of Azerbaijan's eligible voters cast
ballots on the mild, sunny day, the election commission reported.
That easily surpassed the required 25 percent minimum turnout to
make the elections valid.
	   Voting proceeded peacefully. International observers said they
had noticed no major violations but a few minor technical problems,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200 observers were
monitoring the vote.
	   The stability that has taken hold in this country of 7.5 million
once plagued by war and political chaos appeared to be working in
favor of Aliev, who led Azerbaijan in the Soviet era and retook
power in a bloodless 1993 coup.
	   ``I voted for Aliev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov. ``Before
he became the president we had instability. It was impossible to do
business and a lot of people carried guns. But now we are moving
towards a market economy.''
	   But the main opposition leaders accused Aliev of stacking the
ballot in his favor and were already crying foul Sunday over the
expected outcome.
	   They criticized an announcement by the election commission that
voting results would not be known for four days, calling the delay
a chance for the government to commit voter fraud.
	   The five other presidential contenders are close to the
government and are widely believed to be running only to give the
election the appearance of competitiveness.
	   ``Whoever wins, whether it be Aliev or someone else, will be
illegitimate,'' said Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition group
Musavat and former speaker of Azerbaijan's parliament.
	   If no candidate wins at least two-thirds of the vote, a second
round must be held. In the last elections, after the 1993 coup,
Aliev won with 98 percent support.

Puerta wins first all-Argentine final since 1982

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Puerta win in final. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Mariano Puerta defeated Franco Squillari
6-3, 6-2 Sunday for the title at the dlrs 340,000 Palermo
clay-court event in the first all-Argentine final on the ATP Tour
in 16 years.
	   Puerta, who was not seeded, captured his first career ATP title
with a strong baseline game and by taking advantage of Squillari's
poor serving.
	   Squillari lost five service games and had seven double faults,
including on match point, during the 62-minute encounter.
	   The two reached the final by upsetting Spaniards in
rain-interrupted semifinals.
	   Puerta ousted top seeded Alex Corretja 7-5, 6-2, while Squillari
got past Galo Blanco 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2) earlier Sunday.
	   Two Argentines had not met in an ATP final since Jose Luis Clerc
defeated Guillermo Vilas at Gstaad, Switzerland, in 1982.

Athens mayor rides to re-election on conservative surge

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Athens' populist mayor stormed to
re-election Sunday and other conservatives scored gains against the
powerful Socialist party in municipal elections considered a key
referendum on the government's policies, according to exit polls.
	   Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos appeared to be the runaway
winner for a second four-year term with at least 53 percent of the
vote, exit polls said. The challenger backed by the Socialists ran
a distant second.
	   Although the hundreds of mayoral and district races will not
change the Socialists' grip on parliament, the outcome is widely
interpreted as a test for Premier Costas Simitis two years before
general elections.
	   The government has faced strong backlash from labor groups and
civil servants over its economic austerity measures designed to
earn the European Union's poorest country a spot in the bloc's
single currency group by 2001.
	   ``There is a clear political message. It is a message of protest
against the government,'' said Aris Spiliotopoulos, spokesman for
the main opposition conservative party, New Democracy.
	   Exit polls carried by Greek media showed New Democracy-backed
candidates leading in mayoral races in the port of Piraeus and the
northern city of Salonica. But because no candidate reached an
outright majority, they will join hundreds of other races decided
in run-off elections next Sunday.
	   Avramopoulos' victory keeps the former diplomat in city hall as
Athens prepares for the 2004 Olympics. But many political analysts
also see the mayor's job as a possible stepping stone to national
politics, where Avramopoulos could challenge the Socialists.
	   Avranopoulos' supporters converged on city hall, waving banners
and chanting his name. Avranopoulos has cautiously stayed clear of
Greece's many political feuds while trying to portray an image as a
crusader against Athens' chronic urban ills: smog, traffic and
neglected neighbors.
	   One commentator on the private Mega television channel called
him a ``phenomenon that knows no parties.''
	   ``We want to bring civilization to politics,'' Avramopoulos
said.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas insisted Athens was a
``special case,'' given Avramopoulos' cross-party appeal.
	   Avramopoulos also drew considerable support from Socialist and
leftist voters, the exit polls showed.
	   In the more than 50 races for regional governor seats, the
Socialists appeared to maintain their dominance, but lost some
ground to conservatives, who have led Greece for only three of the
past 17 years. Final results in all the races, including about 900
mayoral contests, were not expected until Monday.
	   Millions of Greeks returned to their places of birth to vote
because of complicated red tape involved in registering their new
residences. More than half of Greece's 10.2 million people live in
the greater Athens area. Voting in Greece is mandatory.
	   Avramopoulos couldn't even vote for himself. He traveled to the
tiny mountain village of Elliniko, about 150 kilometers (95 miles)
southwest of Athens, to cast his ballot.
	   At least a dozen villages staged protests against a government
program to merge their local communities into larger and more
powerful municipalities.
	   Voting was postponed until Wednesday in one tiny community on
the island of Crete, where many inhabitants have a fierce regional
identity. At one village in northern Greece, locals blocked the
roads with tractors in an attempt to stop election officials from
setting up ballot boxes.

Balkan leaders meet as NATO prepares for airstrikes against

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders are gathering in this
Turkish seaside resort to make a last-ditch effort to convince
regional neighbor Yugoslavia to accept international demands on
Kosovo and avert NATO airstrikes.
	   Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic and Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic were to attend the two-day summit, starting Monday. But
it could be difficult for the leaders to find a peaceful solution
for the province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   In preliminary meetings, diplomats said Yugoslavia had refused
to even accept a mention of Kosovo in a joint declaration to be
issued at the end of the meeting. Other nations were forced to
draft a separate resolution on Kosovo, where an ethnic Albanian
majority is seeking independence.
	   Turkey has been trying to prevent other regional disagreements
from marring the meeting, designed to bring the nations closer
together. The summit involves prime ministers of Bulgaria, Greece,
Macedonia, Romania, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Albania is sending its
foreign minister, while Bosnia and Croatia are sending observers.
	   ``These meetings should help us find what joins us rather than
what separates us,'' Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Theodoros
Theodorou said. The first Balkan summit was held last year on the
Greek island of Crete.
	   But it could be difficult to keep deep-rooted differences and
ambitions among some Balkan neighbors, especially enemies Turkey
and Greece, from hindering efforts to find consensus on Kosovo.
	   ``I don't think that anybody can come forward with some serious
suggestion which can be implemented so fast,'' said Husein Zivalj,
Bosnia's deputy foreign minister.
	   Turkey is facing its own regional crisis with Syria over
Damascus's alleged sheltering of Turkish Kurdish guerrillas. Ankara
has threatened to use force against Syria, which denies sheltering
the insurgents.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz will be meeting with Greek
Premier Costas Simitis on Monday, giving the two leaders their
first opportunity in nearly a year to discuss such divisive issues
as the divided island of Cyprus.

Havel opens prestigious conference in Prague
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ More than 50 prominent thinkers,
politicians and religious activists from around the world gathered
Sunday to open a conference on the state of human civilization at
the end of the millennium.
	   U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is to address the
conference on Tuesday.
	   President Vaclav Havel opened the conference, speaking to a
gathering of prominent personalities including former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Polish Premier Hanna
Suchocka and the chief rabbi of Israel, Meir Lau.
	   ``Nobody hopes that this Forum will influence the course of the
world,'' Havel said. ``But it is our obligation to do all we can to
spell out all the dangers of our civilization ... and to seek ways
how to avert those dangers.''
	   Havel, known for his efforts to make Prague the center of
intellectual activity in the post-Communist world, spoke in the
medieval Vladislav Hall of the Prague Castle, where Czech kings
were crowned and where presidents are elected.
	   ``Prague always was the crossroads of various geopolitical
interests,'' Havel said. ``So why couldn't this town now, when we
are free, be the crossroads of ideas.''
	   The conference, sponsored by Japan's Nippon Foundation is the
second of the kind held in Prague. Three more conferences will be
held here until 2001.

Russia calls NATO representative to Moscow for talks on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign minister ruling out Russian military
response to NATO strikes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister on Sunday
ruled out the use of Russian force in response to threatened NATO
airstrikes on the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   Russia has called its representative to NATO and its ambassador
to Belgium, where NATO is based, back to Moscow for emergency
consultations on potential airstrikes, President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman said Sunday.
	   Russia fiercely opposes NATO strikes on Yugoslavia, a Russian
ally. NATO is preparing to intervene if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic doesn't let up on a crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo that has killed hundreds in recent months and
left a quarter of a million homeless.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who is accompanying
Yeltsin on a visit to Uzbekistan, said a Russian military response
to NATO strikes is ``out of the question,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Still, he reiterated his criticism of airstrikes, saying, ``That
is very dangerous because we could enter a phase of international
chaos.''
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, Yeltsin's spokesman, told a news conference. He said
Yeltsin is being constantly updated on the situation in Kosovo.
	   On Saturday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said that
if NATO uses force to try to resolve the Kosovo crisis, Russia may
revise its relationship with the western alliance.
	   And a top Russian military official said that Russia was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.

More than 100 dead of malaria in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANA`A, Yemen (AP) _ An outbreak of malaria has left more than
100 people, mostly children, dead and has infected another 1,600
people in southern and western Yemen, health officials said Sunday.
	   During the past two weeks, the province of ad-Dali, 250
kilometers (155 miles) south of the capital Sana`a, has recorded
1,500 cases of malaria, while the town of Rima, 150 kilometers (93
miles) west of Sana`a, has recorded 100, health officials said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   More than 100 people already have died of malaria in those two
areas, health officials said.
	   Malaria is spread by mosquitoes that breed in pools of stagnant
water.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country of 17 million in the southern
part of the Arabian Peninsula, spends only 400 riyals (dlrs 3)
annually per person for health care.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In gray and sometimes drizzly weather,
Poles on Sunday took the final step of Western-style government
reforms by electing new regional and local councils to assume
powers held by the central government during the communist era.
	   During 14 hours of balloting that began at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT),
voters chose from 260,000 candidates to fill 63,767 seats on
provincial, district and various city and neighborhood councils.
Official results were expected Wednesday.
	   Few people were voting Sunday morning, partly due to the autumn
drizzle, but those at a some Warsaw polling stations said they
wanted to show support for Poland's political and economic reforms.
	   ``I believe it can still be better in Poland, although we
already can live a good life after all those years of communism,''
said Barbara Witkowska, a retired accountant who voted in downtown
Warsaw.
	   But officials predicted a turnout of less than 50 percent of the
28.6 million eligible voters, with many people unhappy over
economic hardships such as high unemployment brought by Poland's
post-communist reforms. Being asked to vote a ninth time _ in
either referendums or elections _ since communist rule fell, many
people were expected to ignore the local government balloting.
	   After casting his ballot in Warsaw's Wilanow district, President
Aleksander Kwasniewski said any turnout figure above 40 percent
would represent success, while a lower turnout would show the
nation still had to grow as a democracy.
	   The turnout picked up in some areas in the afternoon as the rain
stopped and people came home from church in the mostly Catholic
nation.
	   ``This is one of the most important days for Poland during the
last few years ... the day when substantial power is passed to the
people,'' said Marian Krzaklewski, chairman of the rightist
Solidarity party, who voted in the Baltic port city of Gdansk.
	   Under the reforms, the number of provinces dropped from 49 to 16
while hundreds of regional, city and town councils city were being
created to take over some of the decision-making power on issues
such as education, roads, housing, water supplies, environment
protection and various services.
	   The new system creates democratic structures at the grassroots
level of government in line with standards of the European Union,
which Poland hopes to join early next century.
	   But Sunday's election was considered more a popularity contest
for Poland's main political parties, as voters confused by the
variety of councils they were choosing were expected to follow
party recommendations.
	   In a backlash against the Solidarity-led rightist central
government, leftist parties with roots in the communist era were
expected to do well.
	   Many Poles are dissatisfied with the broad social and economic
reforms launched by Solidarity after 1989, which introduced
unemployment and raised living costs.
	   Despite the lack of personal freedoms during more than four
decades of communist rule, people were guaranteed jobs and health
care, education and other services were provided by the state.
	   A strong showing by leftist parties would be ironic, as the most
poorly developed regions _ where people would be expected to seek
strong local representation _ are those neglected by communist
rulers of the past.

Russia beats Finland, qualifies for women's World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Russia came from behind with goals by
Irina Grigoryeva and Tatyana Yegorova to beat Finland 2-1 Sunday
and qualified for the womens' World Cup soccer finals next year in
the United States.
	   Russia took the two-match series on a 4-2 aggregate after
winning at home 2-1.
	   Finland's dream of qualifying held for six minutes after Terhi
Uusi-Luomalahti netted a penalty in the 25th minute. A 1-0 win
would have sufficed for the Finnish women, as they had scored an
away goal in the first leg.
	   But after 31 minutes Grigoryeva scored on a deflected shot.
Yegorova notched the winner in the 79th after a corner.
	   Russia was the better side, with a coherent team play and safer
passing, and the players also showed better individual skills.
Marina Burakova marshalled the defense, and was the best on the
team, along with the two goalscorers.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will
leave for Turkey on Monday in the latest bid by Egypt to calm the
mounting crisis between Syria and Turkey.
	   Moussa is expected to relay a message from Syrian President
Hafez Assad to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Egypt's Al-Ahram
newspaper reported Sunday. Its contents were not disclosed.
	   Moussa will later fly to Damascus to relay to Assad the Turkish
response, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   Tunisian Foreign Minister Said Bin Mustafa arrived in Damascus
Sunday and also is expected to meet with Assad Monday to discuss
the crisis.
	   Turkey has demanded that Syria end its support for Kurdish
rebels, expel a Kurdish leader and close Kurdish rebel camps in
Syrian-controlled Lebanon. If Syria does not abide by the demands,
Turkey has threatened to attack its southern neighbor.
	   Syria has denied sheltering the rebels.

NATO asks Hungary for permission to use airspace &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes, a senior U.S. envoy accelerated talks
Sunday with President Slobodan Milosevic, after reporting ``no
change'' in the Yugoslav leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic met well into the
night Sunday, signaling U.S. determination to search for a peaceful
way out of the Kosovo deadlock. The two conferred for more than
seven hours in the afternoon and them resumed late Sunday after
about a 2 1/2-hour break.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include a withdrawal of special troops, an
immediate cease-fire, allowing refugees to return home and
beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton's national security
adviser told Cable News Network on Sunday that Milosevic ``is not
in compliance as of this point.''
	   The adviser, Sandy Berger, said that if Milosevic remains
defiant, NATO will act as early as Monday to authorize the alliance
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to launch military strikes.
	   ``The ball now is in Mr. Milosevic's court,'' Berger said. ``He
can come into compliance or he can face military action by NATO''
at ``any time.''
	   Washington backed up those words with actions. Six U.S. B-52
bombers arrived Sunday in Britain and a contingent of A-10
anti-tank planes flew from Germany to Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said his government was
considering a similar request from the alliance.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and getting
them ready for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic
of Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands for
an end to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke said NATO would meet Monday ``to authorize action'' if
his mediation effort fails.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 after the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army stepped up attacks on Serb police and troops in the
troubled province.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
But its 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
and most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   In Kosovo, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj about 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a kilometer (half mile) from the village.
	   After the previous, late-night session with Milosevic, an
exhausted-looking Holbrooke insisted ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. The U.S. envoy called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands _ including a
cease-fire, talks on Kosovo's future and allowing refugees to
return home _ from the U.S. insistence on verification.
	   Holbrooke told reporters early Sunday that his mission ``will
continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully
verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on the monitoring force. Washington is
pressing for such a force because Milosevic is known for breaking
promises.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated the Yugoslav president was
ready to comply with other conditions.
	   On Sunday, Belgrade's newspapers ran optimistic headlines
suggesting that tensions had eased and that an agreement may be in
sight. Ekspres Politika headlined: ``Sobering Up,'' and Dnevni
Telegraf bannered: `` NATO Threat Removed?''
	   But latest reports on military preparations suggested time was
running out.
	   On Sunday, six U.S. B-52 bombers, each capable of carrying up to
20 cruise missiles, arrived at Fairford, a Royal Air Force base in
Gloucestershire, 75 miles (120 kms) west of London.
	   ``This is a warning,'' Col. Wendell Griffin, the detachment
commander, said. ``We are glad to be here and we are very prepared.
But we are on standby, and we will be ready and able to fly
missions eight or nine hours from now.''
	   Meanwhile, 10 A-10 attack aircraft, which were used successfully
against Iraqi armor in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, arrived at the
Aviano air base in northern Italy from their base in Spangdahlem,
Germany.
	   The A-10s carry 30 milimeter cannons designed to fight armored
forces.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
time the first snows fall.
	   In Sofia, Bulgaria, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
an international women's conference that the world ``must speak
with one voice to end what is both a humanitarian crisis and
violation of humanity'' in Kosovo.

Kenyans sweep Chicago Marathon in record day

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ For someone who had never run a marathon before,
Ondoro Osoro seems to have the hang of it.
	   On a day when Kenyans ruled the Chicago Marathon, the former
cross-country runner won in 2 hours, 6 minutes and 54 seconds, the
third-fastest time in history. His time Sunday was 49 seconds off
the world record, set by Ronaldo Da Costa at last month's Berlin
Marathon.
	   Joyce Chepchumba, winner of the 1997 London Marathon, completed
the Kenyan sweep, winning the women's race with a personal best of
2:23:57.
	   ``It was my first marathon and I think I'm very happy,'' Osoro
said, his smile as bright as the medal hanging around his neck. ``I
must be a lucky man today, running for the first time and running
very well.''
	   Osoro made a late surge, overtaking defending champion Khalid
Khannouchi of Morocco in the last 1 1-2 kilometers (mile). Osoro,
who missed almost two years while recuperating from a 1995 car
accident, raised his arms as he crossed the finish line, and race
director Carey Pinkowski grabbed him in a bear hug.
	   He set records for debut and North American marathons, and broke
the course record of 2:07:10, set last year by Khannouchi, who also
won in his first marathon.
	   Khannouchi, who now lives in the United States, finished second
at 2:07:19. Gert Thys of South Africa was third at 2:07:43, and
Joseph Kahugu, another Kenyan, was fourth at 2:07:57. It was the
first race in which four runners broke 2:08.
	   ``I got cramps the last two miles (3 kilometers),'' said
Khannouchi, who had a sore ankle the past two weeks and finished
the race limping. ``I was almost going to drop off the last two
miles (3 kilometers), but I just made it all the way.''
	   Chepchumba wasn't a factor early, as South Africans Colleen de
Reuck and Elana Meyer ran 1-2. De Reuck pulled away from Meyer at
the 23rd kilometer (14th mile), and by the 34th kilometer (21st
mile), she had a 21-second lead on Chepchumba.
	   But when de Reuck's leg started hurting, Chepchumba quickly
caught up to her and flew by just before the 35th-kilometer
(22nd-mile) mark.
	   ``I kept looking back, thinking she could come back. I thought
she could come back because I was tired,'' Chepchumba said. ``When
I entered the bridge (about a mile from the finish), I didn't see
anybody, so I thought I could make it.''
	   De Reuck finished second at 2:27:04, and Meyer was third at
2:27:20.
	   Osoro, who started road racing full-time only last year, didn't
even want to come to the Chicago Marathon. When his agent first
asked him, he said no because he wouldn't get any appearance fees.
But after thinking about it some more, he agreed.
	   ``I don't run because I need money. I like running. So I said
`OK, I will try and run my best,''' said Osoro, whose victory
earned him dlrs 105,000. ``My coming was good.''
	   Khannouchi took the lead at the 34th kilometer (21st mile),
moving inside and past Kahugu as they rounded a corner. He built a
solid lead, and seemed to be headed for his second title.
	   But Osoro was always behind him, hanging back just a bit.
	   ``When you're running, you never know if the person in front of
you has energy,'' said Osoro, who trailed by five seconds at the
40th kilometer (25th mile). ``You have to try and catch him, so
that's what I did. I tried to catch him.''
	   With about a kilometer (less than a mile) to go, Osoro made his
move. He went past Khannouchi with a burst of speed as they passed
Soldier Field, and opened a comfortable lead with another sprint.
	   ``I wanted to run so fast that when it came time to sprint, I
was already gone because he's a very good sprinter,'' Osoro said.
``I continued to push because I knew he's very fast in finishing.''
	   Now that he's won, Osoro won't hesitate about running in 1999.
	   ``I'd like to come next year,'' he said. ``Maybe they'll invite
me again.''

Russia beats Finland, qualifies for women's World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Goals by Irina Grigoryeva and Tatyana
Yegorova rallied Russia to a 2-1 victory over Finland Sunday,
sending it to its first Women's World Cup.
	   Russia's victory gave it a 4-2 aggregate for the two legs and
made it the sixth and final European team to qualify, the 12th
overall for the 16-team field.
	   Finland, trying to overcome a 2-1 loss in the first leg, took
the early lead in the 25th minute when Terhi Uusi-Luomalahti
converted a penalty.
	   A 1-0 victory would have sent Finland to the United States, but
Grigoryeva tied it six minutes later on a deflected shot and
Yegorova notched the winner in the 79th after a corner.
	   Russia was the better side, with a coherent team play and safer
passing, and the players also showed better individual skills.
Marina Burakova marshalled the defense, and was the best on the
team, along with the two goalscorers.

Violence scaring majority of fans away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX DUFF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The Brazilian passion known as
soccer to the rest of the world might be even more popular if it
weren't for the violence that surrounds the club matches.
	   In a poll by Ibope, commissioned by and published Sunday in the
sports daily Lance!, 61 percent of 3,000 soccer fans surveyed said
they stayed away from matches because of hooliganism.
	   ``The problem (of hooliganism) is much the same as in England.
There is a very active minority of fans involved,'' said Col.
Silvio Roberto Villar, who heads policing of Sao Paulo soccer
stadiums, in an interview with radio station CBN on Sunday.
	   ``Ideally, supporters should not to wear their teams' colors
when leaving stadiums in case they are attacked. It's an absurd
situation but that is the state of things.''
	   Since the early 1990s, fan clubs of club teams _ known
throughout South America as ``Barras Bravas'' _ have clashed
sporadically in Brazil, causing the deaths of two teen-agers in the
last three years.
	   Last season, a youth was killed in a street fight following a
game between Rio teams Flamengo and Vasco da Gama.
	   In Sao Paulo, a 16-year-old died during a 1995 stadium riot
involving fans of Sao Paulo FC and Palmeiras, prompting a judge to
ban fan club members from city stadiums.
	   Since then, security cameras have been installed in Rio's famed
Maracana Stadium to clamp down on violence and meeting rooms for
fan clubs have been shut.
	   The Ibope survey found the other major reason keeping fans away
from games is high ticket prices, cited by 16 percent as a problem.
Fourteen percent said ``poorly organized'' leagues were the chief
reason they missed matches.
	   The survey's margin of error was given as 1.8 percent.
	   Attendances at Brazilian soccer matches have fallen over the
last two years although no exact figures were available.

Indian communists urge protests against government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Indian communists on Sunday called for
nationwide protests against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party,
saying its economic policies were causing price increases.
	   At a rally ending a seven-day congress of the Communist Party of
India (Marxist), party leaders urged Indians to join in planned
nationwide strikes, said Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal
state. West Bengal, whose capital city is Calcutta, is ruled by the
Communist Party.
	   The party says the BJP is mismanaging the economy, causing price
increases.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under towering marble figures of the Jews
who founded Christianity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed the
first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
	   From now on, the pope said, Catholics should commemorate all the
Holocaust's murdered Jews each year when they mark the day Stein
died _ Aug. 9.
	   ``In the martyr Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square.
	   ``The value of her testimony is to render ever stronger the
bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he
said, calling Stein an ``eminent daughter of Israel and a faithful
daughter of the church.''
	   It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation:
The Roman Catholic Church putting all its ceremony, pomp and
grandeur into a tribute to a woman of Jewish heritage. Relatives of
Holocaust victims _ Stein's family _ sharing a dais with the leader
of Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Stein is believed to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
early days of the church, said the Rev. Simion Hernandez, who
oversaw the process toward canonization. Incomplete records and the
prevalence of conversions, voluntary and forced, make it impossible
to say for certain.
	   She was born into an Orthodox Jewish German family on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1891. An atheist, she
joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later became a
Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for
speaking out against it.
	   Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, the pope said,
but turned it down.
	   ``Why should I be excluded?'' he quoted her as saying.
	   ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers and sisters, my life
is, in a certain way, destroyed.''
	   Stein was in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the
Nazis came to arrest her.
	   Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, also was
among the converts deported. At Auschwitz, they are thought to have
been taken almost directly from the trains to the gas chambers.
	   ``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said
John Paul, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2-hour
ceremony.
	   ``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, we
also cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked at the
elimination of a people, costing the lives of millions of Jewish
brothers and sisters,'' he declared, using the Hebrew word for the
Holocaust.
	   In Jerusalem, the Simon Wiesenthal Center protested Stein's
canonization.
	   ``She could in no way symbolize the Jewish martyrs of the
Holocaust because she chose to leave Judaism,'' said one center
official, Ephraim Zuroff.
	   In naming Stein a saint, the church credits her with interceding
almost a half-century after her death to save a toddler's life.
	   More than a decade ago, at 2 1/2, Teresia Benedicta McCarthy of
Brockton, Mass., swallowed an overdose of Tylenol and suffered such
severe liver damage that she was put on a priority list for a
transplant. Then, overnight, she recovered.
	   Benedicta's doctor called the recovery miraculous, and the
church agreed _ saying the only explanation were the prayers that
the McCarthys and their friends offered to Stein.
	   Benedicta's family had urged that the church mark her
canonization with a fuller accounting of the church's actions in
the Holocaust, as had Stein's relatives.
	   The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of
Kensington, Calif., wrote the pope in August, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reported.
	   They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill to the Jewish people''
but said the past is ``still waiting to be fully acknowledged.''
	   In March, the Vatican issued a long-awaited statement of regret
that Catholics did not say and do more to stop Nazi persecution of
Jews, but praised the conduct of wartime pope Pius XII, whom some
accuse of failing to do enough.
	   Improving relations with Jews has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More people have been
canonized during his papacy, which reaches its 20th anniversary on
Friday, than in any other.

Taliban returns bodies of three slain Iranian diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia returned the
bodies of three slain Iranian diplomats to Iran on Sunday, Iranian
television reported.
	   The move is likely aimed at defusing growing tensions between
Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern
border with Afghanistan, and the Taliban.
	   The Taliban has said that renegade militiamen killed eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the militia captured the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran has demanded that the Taliban return the bodies of the
Iranians and hand over the culprits for trial in Tehran.
	   The bodies of the other six Iranians already have been returned.
	   ``An airplane carrying the bodies of three Iranian diplomats
murdered by the Taliban in Mazar-e Sharif landed in Mashhad
airport, northeastern Iran tonight,'' the television reported.
	   The report was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. and
received in Cairo.
	   On Thursday, Iran said its border forces fought a three-hour
battle with Taliban fighters, inflicting heavy casualties. The
Taliban denied that any fighting took place and claimed that Iran
has been firing artillery into Afghanistan.
	   On Friday, the Taliban released five Iranians captured during
the militia's sweep of the western part of the country. Iranian
radio said the Iranians claimed that they were tortured.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing its northern-based opposition, which includes
the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also are
Shiite Muslims.

Patriots rout Chiefs; Eagles win Bad Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED with late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robert Edwards became the first player since the
1970 merger of the American Football League into the National
Football League to score touchdowns in his first five pro games,
and Drew Bledsoe threw three TD passes in New England's 40-10
victory over Kansas City on Sunday.
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, the Patriots (4-1) scored on seven
consecutive possessions after punting on their first one. The
Chiefs (4-2) helped them score with a fumble, a roughing-the-passer
penalty and two fourth-down failures.
	   Kansas City began the game with the NFL's second-best pass
defense, allowing 129.6 yards per game, and second best overall
defense, giving up an average of 240. By halftime, Bledsoe had
thrown for 174 yards and the offense had 246, and the Patriots
extended the lead to 37-0 in the third quarter.
 &UR; Eagles 17, Redskins 12 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, the Eagles won the first matchup of 0-5 teams
in NFC East history as Rodney Peete ran for a touchdown and threw
for another in a victory that gave Washington its worst start in 37
years.
	   Washington benched Trent Green, brought back Gus Frerotte and
got a sack from Dana Stubblefield. None of it was enough to beat
the Eagles, who breathed some life into what had been a hopeless
season and just might have saved coach Ray Rhodes' job.
	   Green had a miserable day, falling down for a ``sack'' at
midfield on a drive that eventually led to the Eagles' first
touchdown. Frerotte, benched in the season opening loss to the
Giants, didn't fare much better, although he did direct a late
touchdown drive that made it a 5-point game with 2:46 remaining.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 20 &QC; 
	   At Cincinnati, Neil O'Donnell rescued the Bengals' 93-yard drive
with a long fourth-down completion, then surprised a relaxed
Pittsburgh defense with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Carl Pickens in
the closing seconds.
	   The Steelers (3-2) seemed to have the victory in hand when Norm
Johnson kicked a 40-yard field goal for a 20-18 lead with 1:56
left. A holding penalty on the kickoff left the Bengals (2-3) at
their 7-yard line with no timeouts left.
	   Six plays later, O'Donnell threw a desperation pass on fourth
down that Pickens caught for a 50-yard gain.
	   After Corey Dillon's run got the clock moving, the Bengals lined
up and motioned for a clock-stopping spike. But O'Donnell instead
lobbed the decisive pass to Pickens, who once again beat Dewayne
Washington with 14 seconds to go.
 &UR; Cowboys 27, Panthers 20 &QC; 
	   At Irving, Texas, Jason Garrett threw two touchdown passes and
Deion Sanders made a critical interception with two minutes left,
but Dallas' victory wasn't secure until Steve Beuerlein's last pass
sailed out of the end zone as time ran out.
	   Beuerlein, making his first appearance of the season because
Kerry Collins decided he didn't want to play, completed 22 of 31
passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns against the dazzled
Dallas defense.
	   Sanders intercepted Beuerlein's pass with 1:55 to play, but
Carolina got the ball back with 51 seconds left for a last-ditch
drive to the Dallas 37, where Beuerlein let fly on a desperate
heave that overshot his three receivers with the clock showing
0:00.
	   The Cowboys (4-2) never previously beat the Panthers, whose
winless streak this season stands at five.
 &UR; 49ers 31, Saints 0 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Steve Young had his fifth straight 300-yard
passing game and became the 20th player in NFL history to throw for
30,000 yards in San Francisco's rout of New Orleans.
	   Chris Doleman's four sacks moved him into fifth place on the
career list, and the 49ers (4-1) won by their second largest margin
against the Saints (3-2).
	   Young, who left after one series in the fourth quarter,
completed 21 of 40 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns. He is
now tied with Joe Montana for most consecutive 300-yard passing
games.
	   The Saints (3-2) showed no signs of the scrappy play that helped
them open with three straight victories and take the New England
Patriots to the wire last week.
 &UR; Oilers 12, Ravens 8 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Eddie George ran for 123 yards and quarterback
Steve McNair had a 40-yard touchdown run in as Tennessee overcame
141 yards in penalties to outlast Baltimore.
	   The Oilers (2-3) were penalized 13 times, but they managed to
win as the Ravens (2-3) went 0-for-13 on third down and mustered a
mere 36 yards on the ground.
	   Ravens running back Priest Holmes, who ran for 173 yards in his
debut against Cincinnati two weeks earlier, finished with 29 yards
on 14 carries.
 &UR; Bills 31, Colts 24 &QC; 
	   At Indianapolis, Doug Flutie passed for two touchdowns and set
up two short scoring runs by Antowain Smith for Buffalo.
	   The 35-year-old Flutie, back in the NFL after eight years in the
Canadian Football League, entered the game in the first quarter
after Rob Johnson was sacked and left with sore ribs.
	   Flutie, who had passed for only 158 yards as a backup this
season, his first in the NFL since 1989, was 23-for-28 for 213
yards with no sacks or interceptions. Peyton Manning, the top pick
in this year's draft, was 20-for-41 for 235 yards, but was
intercepted twice. He has thrown an NFL-high 14 interceptions for
the Colts (1-5) this season.
	   The Bills (2-3) erased a 9-0 Indianapolis lead.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. bombers moved into position for
possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and a U.S. envoy accelerated
talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday after reporting
no change in the leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic talked into the night Sunday,
meeting for the sixth time in seven days of talks that signaled
U.S. determination to solve the standoff peacefully.
	   Holbrooke said early Sunday that he would ``continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance
system as an alternative to the other choice'' _ meaning the use of
force.
	   But he also said NATO would meet Monday to authorize action if
his efforts fails.
	   In Washington, national security adviser Sandy Berger told CNN
that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this point.''
	   ``He can come into compliance or he can face military action by
NATO'' at any time, Berger said.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile (half kilometer) from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing
for that because Milosevic has broken promises in the past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. government,
however, believes it does not need a new U.N. resolution for the
attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters.

Yugoslav defense minister protests NATO threats, Yugoslav army

commanders meet with their NATO counterparts

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Joining the chorus of Yugoslav
officials protesting NATO threats of intervention, Yugoslavia's
defense minister said Sunday there was ``no real justification'' to
bomb his country.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace. Bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
said Pavle Bulatovic, the defense minister and aide to the
country's president, Slobodan Milosevic, referring to the looming
NATO action as a way to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   ``It should be in nobody's interest to make Balkan a powder keg
again,'' Bulatovic said, alluding to the region's turbulent
history.
	   His comments came amid intense negotiations in Belgrade between
top US envoy, Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic on a peaceful
solution for Kosovo, a province within Serbia and the Yugoslav
federation.
	   Speaking at a ceremony in Yugoslav army barracks in northern
Serbia where several hundred young recruits were starting their
obligatory one-year service in the Yugoslav army, Bulatovic said
``the threats are not justified.''
	   Also on Sunday, unspecified NATO officers who are in Belgrade
with Holbrooke, met with a team of top Yugoslav army officers, a
spokesman for the US negotiating team said, but declined to
identify them or to elaborate.

Congolese rebels advance on eastern air base

<TEXT>
	   ELILA BRIDGE, Congo (AP) _ A day after shooting down a jetliner
carrying 40 people, rebels clashed with government troops near a
strategic airstrip in eastern Congo on Sunday.
	   Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African nation
subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into
government-held buildings and the airfield, two miles (three
kilometers) away.
	   On Saturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over
the Kindu airport. Rescue workers said there were no survivors from
the downed plane, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Sunday.
	   Rebels said the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition.
In the capital, Kinshasa, the private Congolese Airlines, which
owned the aircraft, said the victims were civilians fleeing
fighting in Kindu.
	   It was not possible to confirm either claim independently.
	   Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said surface-to-air
missiles in the arsenal of his Congolese Democratic Coalition had
prevented the government from landing aircraft at the airport.
	   Kabangu Kalunga said 3,500 rebel troops and their Rwandan allies
had closed in on government forces from three directions after a
week of fighting. He said government troops did not launch a
counterattack to Sunday's barrage, and some reportedly retreated on
the one road leading out of town.
	   The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu, which the
government has used as a staging area for a counteroffensive
against rebel positions in the east.
	   Rebels, who began their insurgency more than two months ago,
accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, failing to carry out
promised democratic reforms, and stirring up hatred among Congo's
400 tribes.
	   Early in the conflict, rebels pushed far into the west, to the
outskirts of Congo's capital. Then Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
intervened to help Kabila and drove the rebels back to their bases
in eastern Congo.
	   The conflict has drawn in many of Congo's neighbors. There are
unconfirmed reports that troops from Chad and the Sudan are
involved in defending Kindu.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ former allies who installed
him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion _ of
sponsoring the rebels.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.

Duval runs away with Michelob Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK KURZ Jr. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (AP) _ David Duval shot a final-round
3-under-par 68 Sunday, good enough for a three-shot victory in the
Michelob Championship _ his seventh victory in 364 days.
	   Once known as Mr. Runner-up because of his seven second-place
finishes before a breakthrough playoff victory here last year,
Duval improved on his Sunday scoring average of 69.5, which already
ranked him fifth on U.S. tour.
	   With a 16-under 268, he also became the first successful
defender on the 6,853-yard (6,168-meter) River Course at Kingsmill
since Calvin Peete in 1983, and he still has titles to defend at
Walt Disney World and in the Tour championship later this month.
	   ``If this is some type of dream, I certainly don't want to wake
up anytime soon,'' said Duval, who won dlrs 342,000 to boost his
earnings for the season to dlrs 2,464,408, extending his American
PGA Tour record. It's also nearly dlrs 700,000 more than Vijay
Singh, his closest rival who has played 24 events to Duval's 21.
	   New Zealand's Phil Tataurangi finished alone in second after a
closing 69, the best finish of his career. The dlrs 205,200 in
prize money also moved him from No. 165 to No. 86 on the money
list, meaning he'll retain his American tour card for 1999.
	   ``I dare say he played a better round of golf than me today with
all that riding on his shoulders,'' Duval said of his 26-year-old
playing partner.
	   But the story, once again, was clearly Duval, the first player
to win seven times in one year since Tom Watson in 1979-80.
	   ``Every time I looked at the leaderboard after making birdies,
he's making birdies, too,'' said Payne Stewart, who shot 69 and
finished five back in a tie for fourth with Australian Bradley
Hughes.
	   ``You can talk all you want to about Tiger Woods, but David's
winning golf tournaments,'' Stewart said, listing Duval, Woods and
Justin Leonard as the young stars of the future. ``(Duval's)
learned how to win.''
	   Playing in the final threesome with 19-year tour veteran Gary
Hallberg and Tataurangi, Duval started with a one-shot lead and
never lost it, even after stumbling with an early bogey on the
par-3 fifth hole.
	   He quickly made up for that with five birdies in the next eight
holes.
	   By then, with Stewart and fellow American Barry Cheesman also
attacking par on the back nine, the only questions were who would
finish second, and if Duval would break Scott Hoch's 19-under 265
tournament record, set in 1996.
	   He didn't, but did just about everything else right.
	   Cheesman shot a 66 to jump into third place, and Billy Mayfair
made five birdies on six holes beginning at No. 12 to claim a share
of sixth with John Huston, Hallberg and Frank Lickliter. Hallberg,
one shot off the lead at the start, did not make a birdie all day
and shot a 3-over 74.

Sudan approves formation of political associations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The Sudanese government on Sunday
approved a bill that allows the formation of ``political
associations'' that can compete in elections.
	   Sudan's constitution, which was approved earlier this year, does
not clearly mention the right to form political parties, which were
banned after a 1989 coup, but does speak about the right to
organize political associations.
	   A government statement said that the new law would be effective
Jan. 1. and that the associations would be able to compete in
elections.
	   The associations must commit themselves to ``the provisions of
the constitution,'' which keep Islamic law in place, the statement
said.
	   The political associations will be barred from receiving funding
from abroad, the statement added.
	   Anyone convicted of crimes against the state would be banned
from a leadership role in the associations, it said.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under towering marble figures of the Jews
who founded Christianity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed the
first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
	   From now on, the pope said, Catholics should commemorate all the
Holocaust's murdered Jews each year when they mark her saint's day.
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square.
	   ``The value of her testimony is to render ever stronger the
bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and Jews,'' he
said, calling Stein an ``eminent daughter of Israel and a faithful
daughter of the church.''
	   It was a day filled with remarkable gestures of reconciliation:
The Roman Catholic Church putting all its ceremony, pomp and
grandeur into a tribute to a woman of Jewish heritage. Relatives of
Holocaust victims _ Stein's family _ sharing a dais with the leader
of Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Stein is believed to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
early days of the church, said the Rev. Simion Fernandez, who
oversaw the process toward canonization. Incomplete records and the
prevalence of conversions, voluntary and forced, make it impossible
to say for certain.
	   She was born into an Orthodox Jewish German family on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1891. An atheist, she
joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later became a
Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for
speaking out against it.
	   Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, the pope said,
but turned it down.
	   ``Why should I be excluded?'' he quoted her as saying.
	   ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers and sisters, my life
is, in a certain way, destroyed.''
	   Stein was in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the
Nazis came to arrest her.
	   Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, also was
among the converts deported. They died there on Aug. 9.
	   ``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said
John Paul, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2-hour
ceremony.
	   ``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, from
year to year we also cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked
at the elimination of a people, costing the lives of millions of
Jewish brothers and sisters,'' he declared, using the Hebrew word
for the Holocaust.
	   In Jerusalem, the Simon Wiesenthal Center protested Stein's
canonization.
	   ``She could in no way symbolize the Jewish martyrs of the
Holocaust because she chose to leave Judaism,'' said one center
official, Ephraim Zuroff.
	   In naming Stein a saint, the church credits her with interceding
almost a half-century after her death to save a toddler's life.
	   More than a decade ago, at 2 1/2, Teresia Benedicta McCarthy of
Brockton, Mass., swallowed an overdose of Tylenol and suffered such
severe liver damage that she was put on a priority list for a
transplant. Then, overnight, she recovered.
	   Benedicta's doctor called the recovery miraculous, and the
church agreed _ saying the only explanation were the prayers that
the McCarthys and their friends offered to Stein.
	   Benedicta's family had urged that the church mark her
canonization with a fuller accounting of the church's actions in
the Holocaust, as had Stein's relatives.
	   The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of
Kensington, Calif., wrote the pope in August, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reported.
	   They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill to the Jewish people''
but said the past is ``still waiting to be fully acknowledged.''
	   In March, the Vatican issued a long-awaited statement of regret
that Catholics did not say and do more to stop Nazi persecution of
Jews, but praised the conduct of wartime pope Pius XII, whom some
accuse of failing to do enough.
	   Improving relations with Jews has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More people have been
canonized during his papacy, which reaches its 20th anniversary on
Friday, than in any other.

Jones denies bribery allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former Australian batsman Dean Jones
has denied allegations made by former Pakistan player Sarfraz Nawaz
that he was forced to retire from cricket because he was involved
in illegal betting.
	   Jones was responding to claims made by Sarfraz in sworn
testimony to the Pakistan High Court's inquiry into match fixing in
Lahore.
	   When asked what other countries had done to players involved in
betting, Sarfraz told the inquiry, ``In other cricket playing
countries, if the players are found to be involved in match-fixing
and betting, they are made to retire or face the consequences.
Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh were banned for six months and Dean
Jones was made to retire.''
	   Jones told Monday's Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, ``That's
absolute nonsense. And any inquiry to the Australian Cricket Board
will also give you the same answer.''
	   Lillee and Marsh placed a winning bet at 500-1 on England to win
the Headingley Test against Australia in 1981. But neither player
was banned, nor received any disciplinary action.
	   Jones said apart from rejecting an offer of U.S. dlrs 50,000 in
Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1992, his involvement with illegal bookmakers
was ``absolute zilch.''
	   He was considering whether he could take legal action against
Sarfraz.
	   Graham Halbish, the Australian Cricket Board chief executive at
the time of the 1994 match-fixing allegations, said there was never
any suggestion Jones was involved in betting other than the offer
he rejected in Sri Lanka.
	   ``There was never any discussion at the board about Dean other
than the instance he made public himself,'' Halbish told the
newspaper.
	   Jones played 52 test matches, scoring 3,631 runs at 46.55. Jones
traveled to South Africa in 1994 with the touring Australians and
played most of the limited overs games but suddenly retired from
international cricket while on tour when dropped before the tests.
	   His forthright opinions then virtually ensured he would never
return to any Australian team when he criticized teammates,
officials and the Australian Cricket Board. Jones retired from all
cricket earlier this year.

United prevails over Columbus 2-0

 &UR; EDS: NEW with Sunday's DC-Crew game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Tony Sanneh and Marco Etcheverry scored as
D.C. United won its 13th consecutive Major League Soccer playoff
game, 2-0 over the Columbus Crew in the opener of the Eastern
Conference finals Sunday.
	   United, looking for its third straight MLS title, can clinch the
best-of-3 series Oct. 11 at Columbus.
	   The Crew, swept by United in the conference finals last year,
has lost all eight games it has played at RFK Stadium.
	   Sanneh didn't start because of a strained groin that forced him
to miss almost half of the season. Coach Bruce Arena inserted
Sanneh for forward A.J. Wood in the 63rd minute and he responded
with a goal five minutes later.
	   Defender Jeff Agoos blasted a shot from just outside the penalty
area that Sanneh, lurking six yards out, was able to nick with his
heel and redirect it past Crew goalkeeper Juergen Sommer.
	   Etcheverry put the game away in the 78th minute on a great
individual effort.
	   Etcheverry dribbled around Jeff Cunningham and then chipped a
ball from 20 yards out that just cleared defender Thomas Dooley and
caught Sommer off his line.
	   United keeper Tom Presthus made three saves for his second
shutout in three playoff starts.
	   Presthus, United's backup most of the season, has allowed just
one goal in his last 558 minutes of action in all competitions.
	   The Crew, which scored six goals in a two-game sweep over the
New York-New Jersey MetroStars in the conference semifinals, were
shutout for just the second time since July.
	   United improved to 16-2 at RFK against league opponents this
season. D.C. is 8-0 in playoff action at home.
	   MLS' chances of dream matchup between D.C. United and Los
Angeles in the MLS Cup final took a blow on Saturday night when
Jesse March knocked in a rebound with four minutes remaining to
give the Chicago Fire a 1-0 victory over the Galaxy.
	   That series goes to Chicago, where the first-year Fire can win
the best-of-3 series Friday night.
	   ``This game was for high stakes and our guys played their hearts
out,'' Fire coach Bob Bradley said. ``Sometimes that wins.''
	   The Fire were awarded a free kick just outside the penalty area
after Steve Jolley fouled Chris Armas. Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman
blocked Lubos Kubik's free kick, but the Galaxy defenders failed to
respond and Marsch sprinted to poke in the rebound from 10 yards.

Taliban returns bodies of three slain Iranian diplomats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban militia returned the
bodies of three slain Iranian diplomats to Iran on Sunday, Iranian
television reported.
	   The move is likely aimed at defusing growing tensions between
Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern
border with Afghanistan, and the Taliban.
	   The Taliban has said that renegade militiamen killed eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the militia captured the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran has demanded the Taliban return the bodies of the Iranians
and send the killers for trial in Tehran.
	   The bodies of the other six Iranians already have been returned.
	   ``An airplane carrying the bodies of three Iranian diplomats
murdered by the Taliban in Mazar-e Sharif landed in Mashhad
airport, northeastern Iran tonight,'' the television reported.
	   The report was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. and
received in Cairo.
	   On Thursday, Iran said its border forces fought a three-hour
battle with Taliban fighters, inflicting heavy casualties. The
Taliban denied that any fighting took place and claimed that Iran
has been firing artillery into Afghanistan.
	   On Friday, the Taliban released five Iranians captured during
the militia's sweep of the western part of the country. Iranian
radio said the Iranians claimed that they were tortured.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing its northern-based opposition, which includes
the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also are
Shiite Muslims.

Alou spurns Dodgers for Expos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Felipe Alou has rejected an offer to become the
manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers and accepted another to remain
with the Montreal Expos.
	   ``I'm glad to say I'll stay at home,'' Alou said Sunday after
agreeing to a three-year contract to remain manager of the Expos.
``But I have to be honest _ I thought I was gone.''
	   In fact, Alou was booked on a flight to Los Angeles when the
Expos called.
	   ``But some Expos people requested that I wait because they had
something to offer me,'' Alou said.
	   General manager Jim Beattie and Mark Routtenberg, a member of
the Expos' ownership group, met with Alou at his Florida home on
Friday and convinced him to stay.
	   ``The Dodgers were coming in on the next plane from Santo
Domingo to finalize the agreement,'' Alou said. ``But the Expos
made an awesome offer.
	   ``There was about a 10-minute difference. Otherwise, I'd be on a
flight to L.A.''
	   Alou's contract is believed to be worth about dlrs 2 million per
year. Los Angeles was reported to have offered the 63-year-old
manager a three-year contract worth a total of dlrs 3.5 million to
dlrs 4 million.
	   The contract includes escape clauses that will allow him to go
to another team if the U.S. Major League Baseball club is sold and
moves to another city.

Patriots rout Chiefs; Eagles win Bad Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS Ravens third-down stats in 20th graf; WILL be UPDATED
with late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robert Edwards became the first player since the
1970 merger of the American Football League into the National
Football League to score touchdowns in his first five pro games,
and Drew Bledsoe threw three TD passes in New England's 40-10
victory over Kansas City on Sunday.
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, the Patriots (4-1) scored on seven
consecutive possessions after punting on their first one. The
Chiefs (4-2) helped them score with a fumble, a roughing-the-passer
penalty and two fourth-down failures.
	   Kansas City began the game with the NFL's second-best pass
defense, allowing 129.6 yards per game, and second best overall
defense, giving up an average of 240. By halftime, Bledsoe had
thrown for 174 yards and the offense had 246, and the Patriots
extended the lead to 37-0 in the third quarter.
 &UR; Eagles 17, Redskins 12 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, the Eagles won the first matchup of 0-5 teams
in NFC East history as Rodney Peete ran for a touchdown and threw
for another in a victory that gave Washington its worst start in 37
years.
	   Washington benched Trent Green, brought back Gus Frerotte and
got a sack from Dana Stubblefield. None of it was enough to beat
the Eagles, who breathed some life into what had been a hopeless
season and just might have saved coach Ray Rhodes' job.
	   Green had a miserable day, falling down for a ``sack'' at
midfield on a drive that eventually led to the Eagles' first
touchdown. Frerotte, benched in the season opening loss to the
Giants, didn't fare much better, although he did direct a late
touchdown drive that made it a 5-point game with 2:46 remaining.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 20 &QC; 
	   At Cincinnati, Neil O'Donnell rescued the Bengals' 93-yard drive
with a long fourth-down completion, then surprised a relaxed
Pittsburgh defense with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Carl Pickens in
the closing seconds.
	   The Steelers (3-2) seemed to have the victory in hand when Norm
Johnson kicked a 40-yard field goal for a 20-18 lead with 1:56
left. A holding penalty on the kickoff left the Bengals (2-3) at
their 7-yard line with no timeouts left.
	   Six plays later, O'Donnell threw a desperation pass on fourth
down that Pickens caught for a 50-yard gain.
	   After Corey Dillon's run got the clock moving, the Bengals lined
up and motioned for a clock-stopping spike. But O'Donnell instead
lobbed the decisive pass to Pickens, who once again beat Dewayne
Washington with 14 seconds to go.
 &UR; Cowboys 27, Panthers 20 &QC; 
	   At Irving, Texas, Jason Garrett threw two touchdown passes and
Deion Sanders made a critical interception with two minutes left,
but Dallas' victory wasn't secure until Steve Beuerlein's last pass
sailed out of the end zone as time ran out.
	   Beuerlein, making his first appearance of the season because
Kerry Collins decided he didn't want to play, completed 22 of 31
passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns against the dazzled
Dallas defense.
	   Sanders intercepted Beuerlein's pass with 1:55 to play, but
Carolina got the ball back with 51 seconds left for a last-ditch
drive to the Dallas 37, where Beuerlein let fly on a desperate
heave that overshot his three receivers with the clock showing
0:00.
	   The Cowboys (4-2) never previously beat the Panthers, whose
winless streak this season stands at five.
 &UR; 49ers 31, Saints 0 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Steve Young had his fifth straight 300-yard
passing game and became the 20th player in NFL history to throw for
30,000 yards in San Francisco's rout of New Orleans.
	   Chris Doleman's four sacks moved him into fifth place on the
career list, and the 49ers (4-1) won by their second largest margin
against the Saints (3-2).
	   Young, who left after one series in the fourth quarter,
completed 21 of 40 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns. He is
now tied with Joe Montana for most consecutive 300-yard passing
games.
	   The Saints (3-2) showed no signs of the scrappy play that helped
them open with three straight victories and take the New England
Patriots to the wire last week.
 &UR; Oilers 12, Ravens 8 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Eddie George ran for 123 yards and quarterback
Steve McNair had a 40-yard touchdown run in as Tennessee overcame
141 yards in penalties to outlast Baltimore.
	   The Oilers (2-3) were penalized 13 times, but they managed to
win as the Ravens (2-3) went 1-for-15 on third down and mustered a
mere 36 yards on the ground.
	   Ravens running back Priest Holmes, who ran for 173 yards in his
debut against Cincinnati two weeks earlier, finished with 29 yards
on 14 carries.
 &UR; Bills 31, Colts 24 &QC; 
	   At Indianapolis, Doug Flutie passed for two touchdowns and set
up two short scoring runs by Antowain Smith for Buffalo.
	   The 35-year-old Flutie, back in the NFL after eight years in the
Canadian Football League, entered the game in the first quarter
after Rob Johnson was sacked and left with sore ribs.
	   Flutie, who had passed for only 158 yards as a backup this
season, his first in the NFL since 1989, was 23-for-28 for 213
yards with no sacks or interceptions. Peyton Manning, the top pick
in this year's draft, was 20-for-41 for 235 yards, but was
intercepted twice. He has thrown an NFL-high 14 interceptions for
the Colts (1-5) this season.
	   The Bills (2-3) erased a 9-0 Indianapolis lead.

	   OPELIKA, Alabama (AP) _ Kelly Robbins closed with a 2-under-par
70 Sunday and won the LPGA Tournament of Champions, her first
victory since the opening event of the season.
	   Robbins finished with a 12-under 276 total, four shots better
than runner-up and fellow American Juli Inkster and the same lead
she held over the field starting the final round.
	   Inkster had four birdies on the back nine in a 69 as matched her
best finish of the year. Sherri Steinhauer started the final round
in second place, but her 71 was her worst round of the tournament
and left her at 281.
	   The anticipated showdown between player of the year contenders
Annika Sorenstam of Sweden and South Korean Se Ri Pak didn't pan
out.
	   Sorenstam, the defending champion, had a 70 and finished at 283.
A double-bogey on No. 12 effectively took her out of the running
for her fifth victory of the year. Sorenstam avoided media
interviews and autograph seekers alike coming off the 18th green.
	   Pak, the leader at seven under after two days, double-bogeyed
No. 1 to go two over. She finished with a 72 and was at even par
for the tournament. Pak, who has also won four tournaments this
year, including two majors, had a string of 103 holes without a
bogey snapped in the second round. She had 12 bogeys over the final
two rounds.
	   Robbins, 29, earned dlrs 122,000 for winning the tournament at
the 6,300-yard (5,670-meter), Grand National and passed the dlrs 3
million for her career. She has eight victories on the U.S. LPGA
tour, including the HealthSouth Inaugural in January. Robbins had
only five top 10 finishes in her last 22 events coming in and had
missed three of the last four cuts.
	   Inkster was two strokes behind Steinhauer after 12 holes, but
birdied No. 18 to pass her for second.
	   Cindy Figg-Currier had 69 to finish fifth at 284.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. bombers moved into position for
possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and a U.S. envoy accelerated
talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday after reporting
no change in the leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic talked into the night Sunday,
meeting for the sixth time in seven days of talks that signaled
U.S. determination to solve the standoff peacefully.
	   Holbrooke said early Sunday that he would ``continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance
system as an alternative to the other choice'' _ meaning the use of
force.
	   But he also said NATO would meet Monday to authorize action if
his efforts fails.
	   In Washington, national security adviser Sandy Berger told CNN
that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this point.''
	   ``He can come into compliance or he can face military action by
NATO'' at any time, Berger said.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile (half kilometer) from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing
for that because Milosevic has broken promises in the past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. government,
however, believes it does not need a new U.N. resolution for the
attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters.

Luyendyk wins IRL Vegas race; Sweden's Brack wins IRL season title

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Dutchman Arie Luyendyk, so frustrated with his
season last month that he was talking of retirement, held back
local favorite Sam Schmidt in the final laps Sunday to take his
first victory of the Indy Racing League season in the Las Vegas
500K.
	   Sweden's Kenny Brack was also a big winner, driving cautiously
to win a dlrs 1 million bonus for winning the points title in the
final race of the season for the IRL, the 3-year-old upstart
competitor to the CART Indy-car series.
	   Luyendyk, who finished dead last after running only five laps in
last month's Lone Star 500, led following the final caution flag of
the race with five laps to go, then held off Schmidt to win for the
first time since the True Value 500 last year.
	   Schmidt, a Las Vegas resident, finished second, 0.926 second
back, while Buddy Lazier was third, 7.530 seconds back. John Paul
Jr., second with five laps to go, finished fourth after getting
grazed by Schmidt in the final restart.
	   Luyendyk started from the seventh row but moved into the lead
midway through the race, which was marked by 10 yellow flags.
	   Brack, meanwhile, finished 10th but that was more than good
enough to wrap up the series points title.
	   The Swede led Americans Davey Hamilton and Tony Stewart in the
season points standings coming into the final race, and it took
only a few laps for him to find out his main challengers weren't
going to pass him by.
	   Stewart, who started on the outside of the first row, dropped to
12th after the first lap with handling problems and was never a
factor. Neither was Hamilton, who ran in the middle of the pack
before being knocked out after 124 laps.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. bombers moved into position
Sunday for possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, and a U.S. envoy
accelerated talks with Slobodan Milosevic after reporting no change
in the Yugoslav president's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic began meeting at midday Sunday
and were still reported talking into the early hours Monday after
only a 2 1-2 hour break.
	   Holbrooke said early Sunday that he would ``continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance

	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to

the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could plunge the
entire region into conflict.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace, bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
Bulatovic told recruits at an army barracks in northern Yugoslavia.
``It would be in nobody's interest to make the Balkans a powder keg
again.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing

Jamaica wins but fails to advance at Red Stripe Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica scored a bitter-sweet five-run
victory over Barbados in the Red Stripe Bowl cricket match at
Sabina Park Sunday, failing to advance to the semi-finals because
of the superior run-rate of the Bajans.
	   Barbados, the Leeward Islands and Jamaica all finished on six
points, but Jamaica lost out on one of the two semi-final places
from Zone Two after failing to bowl out Barbados for under 197
runs.
	   Chasing Jamaica's score of 209 for nine made in 50 overs,
Barbados scored 204 for nine in 49 overs. Because they failed to
complete their 50 overs before 1 p.m., match officials subtracted
one over from the Barbados innings.
	   Barbados were coasting at 105 for two in the 24th over with
captain Philo Wallace in full flight when he was controversially
given run out by umpire Roy Malcolm.
	   Wallace seemed to have made his ground attempting a second run,
but Malcolm ruled that he fell just short. Wallace made 59 with
typical aggression, clouting one six and eight fours off 73
deliveries.
	   A fourth wicket stand of 29 between the experienced Roland
Holder and Courtney Browne steadied the Bajan innings but when
Holder was fifth out, bowled by legspinner Bryan Murphy for 27, the
Barbadian innings went into decline, setting the stage for an
exciting finish.
	   However, aggressive batting from the Barbados lower order saw
their team past the 197 target and a place in the semi-finals where
they will play either Guyana or Trinidad and Tobago.
	   Earlier, the Jamaican batting once again failed to deliver the
goods after captain James Adams won the toss and decided to bat
first. Only in-form Wavell Hinds, who made 47, looked comfortable
against the Bajan attack and it took a late-order flourish from
Nehemiah Perry (31) and Murphy who finished unbeaten on 36 to see
them to a respectable total.

Jamaica wins but fails to advance at Red Stripe Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica scored a bitter-sweet five-run
victory over Barbados in the Red Stripe Bowl cricket match at
Sabina Park Sunday, failing to advance to the semi-finals because
of the superior run-rate of the Bajans.
	   Barbados, the Leeward Islands and Jamaica all finished on six
points, but Jamaica lost out on one of the two semi-final places
from Zone Two after failing to bowl out Barbados for under 197
runs.
	   Chasing Jamaica's score of 209 for nine made in 50 overs,
Barbados scored 204 for nine in 49 overs. Because they failed to
complete their 50 overs before 1 p.m., match officials subtracted
one over from the Barbados innings.
	   Barbados were coasting at 105 for two in the 24th over with
captain Philo Wallace in full flight when he was controversially
given run out by umpire Roy Malcolm.
	   Wallace seemed to have made his ground attempting a second run,
but Malcolm ruled that he fell just short. Wallace made 59 with
typical aggression, clouting one six and eight fours off 73
deliveries.
	   A fourth wicket stand of 29 between the experienced Roland
Holder and Courtney Browne steadied the Bajan innings but when
Holder was fifth out, bowled by legspinner Bryan Murphy for 27, the
Barbadian innings went into decline, setting the stage for an
exciting finish.
	   However, aggressive batting from the Barbados lower order saw
their team past the 197 target and a place in the semi-finals where
they will play either Guyana or Trinidad and Tobago.
	   Earlier, the Jamaican batting once again failed to deliver the
goods after captain James Adams won the toss and decided to bat
first. Only in-form Wavell Hinds, who made 47, looked comfortable
against the Bajan attack and it took a late-order flourish from
Nehemiah Perry (31) and Murphy who finished unbeaten on 36 to see
them to a respectable total.

U.S. bombers prepare for airstrikes amid marathon Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with talks con
in the Yugoslav president's stand on Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic began meeting at midday Sunday
and were still reported talking into the early hours Monday after
only a 2 1/2 hour break.
	   Holbrooke said early Sunday that he would ``continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance
system as an alternative to the other choice'' _ meaning the use of
force.
	   But he also said NATO would meet on Monday to authorize action
if his efforts fails.
	   In Washington, national security adviser Sandy Berger told CNN
that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this point.''
	   ``He can come into compliance or he can face military action by
NATO'' at any time, Berger said.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile (half kilometer) from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could plunge the
entire region into conflict.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace, bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
Bulatovic told recruits at an army barracks in northern Yugoslavia.
``It would be in nobody's interest to make the Balkans a powder keg
again.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing
for that because Milosevic has broken promises in the past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. government,
however, believes it does not need a new U.N. resolution for the
attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters.

International Film Festival, Jimmy Carter, John Denver and a U.S.
couple with matching kidneys. Some items have already moved

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Martin Walser, whose novels explore
the conscience of Germans rebuilding the nation after World War II,
was awarded the prestigious Peace Prize at the Frankfurt
International Book Fair on Sunday.
	   In a ceremony at St. Paul's Church that included President Roman
Herzog, the 71-year-old German author was praised as one of the
country's most important literary figures.
	   Walser's novels and essays ``explained to the world and to
Germans their own country and brought them closer together,'' said
the German Book Trade Association awards committee, which awarded
the prize worth 25,000 marks (dlrs 15,300).
	   Walser was an early critic of the Cold War division of Germany.
One of his best known works, the spy novel ``Dorle and Wolf,''
decries the nation's east-west barrier and the political scare
campaigns on both sides of the border.
	    &UR; ___
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ An Italian film set in the Second World War has
taken the top prize at the Vancouver International Film Festival.
	   Life is Beautiful, a tragic-comedy by Italian director Roberto
Benigni, won the Air Canada People's Choice Award for most popular
film Saturday night.
	   Beningni plays Guido, a Jewish father sent to a concentration
camp who convinces his son everything is just a game in order to
protect him.
	   The film also won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes earlier this
year, and took home almost every prize at the Donatello Awards,
Italy's version of the Academy Awards.
	   Vancouver director Sturla Gunnarsson won the Federal Express
Award for most popular Canadian film for Such a Long Journey. The
film, based on the novel by author Rohinton Mistry, stars Roshan
Seth as a bank clerk whose life unravels after he agrees to do a
favour for a mysterious old friend.
	    &UR; ___
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who
seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won the
coveted honor in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rules for
nominations.
	   That prize was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David
peace accords.
	   Nominations postmarked by Feb. 1 are accepted for that year's
prize. The committee can add its own nominations at its first
meeting of the year, usually in early March.
	   The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978,
about five weeks before that year's peace prize was announced on
Oct. 27.
	   It turned out that Begin and Sadat had been nominated by the
deadline, while Carter was not. Even though it could not give him
the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in the 1978 awards
citation ``the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy
Carter.''
	   News reports of the incident have apparently not appeared until
now.
	   Carter is among the 139 candidates for this year's prize, which
will be announced in Oslo on Friday.
	    &UR; ___
	   ASPEN, Colorado (AP) _ The first anniversary of John Denver's
death will be commemorated with a charity concert and other events
remembering the pop singer who was big in the 1970s.
	   Several former bandmates sold out ``A Musical Tribute to John
Denver'' Sunday benefiting a charity for the disabled. Another
Sunday event benefits the Hunger Project, Planet 2000 and other
groups Denver supported.
	   Various Aspen-area churches held memorials over the weekend.
	   Denver died Oct. 12, 1997, when the small plane he was piloting
crashed into the ocean near Pacific Grove, California, where a
memorial gathering was slated for Sunday, and a candlelight vigil
the following night.
	   The singer-songwriter is best known for the song ``Rocky
Mountain High.''
	    &UR; ___
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Judy and Jesse Paluck celebrated their fifth
wedding anniversary dressed in hospital gowns and surgical
stockings, barely able to muster the strength to hold hands.
	   For the Palucks, the setting and the gift Judy offered _ a
kidney _ couldn't have been more romantic: It proved they were a
perfect match.
	   ``I think we were meant for each other and were meant to go
through this,'' Mrs. Paluck, 29, said Friday, a day after donating
a kidney to her 32-year-old husband. ``That it happened so close to
our anniversary is a sign.''
	   Doctors said the prognosis is good for Paluck, whose kidney was
damaged by lupus, a disease that affects the body's immune system.
	   Experts say the fact the surgery took place at all is unusual
given the difficulties involved in matching tissues and blood
types. In 1997, fewer than 3 percent of all kidney transplants in
the United States were spouse-to-spouse.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. bombers moved into position for
possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and a U.S. envoy accelerated
talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday after reporting
no change in the leader's tough stand on Kosovo. Richard Holbrooke
and Milosevic talked into the night Sunday, meeting for the sixth
time in seven days of talks that signaled U.S. determination to
solve the standoff peacefully. Holbrooke said early Sunday that he
would ``continue an intense effort to find a peaceful, acceptable,
fully verifiable compliance system as an alternative to the other
choice'' _ meaning the use of force. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders are gathering in this
Turkish seaside resort to make a last-ditch effort to persuade
regional neighbor Yugoslavia to accept international demands on
Kosovo and avert NATO airstrikes. Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic
and Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic were to attend the two-day
summit, starting Monday. But it could be difficult for the leaders
to find a peaceful solution for the province in Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia. (TURKEY-BALKAN SUMMIT)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is lashing out at
neighboring Asian countries for sympathizing with dissident leader
Anwar Ibrahim, whose detention sparked yet another protest
Saturday. ``We should not interfere in the internal political
affairs of other countries, especially the friendly nations,''
tourism minister Sabbaruddin Chik said Saturday in the latest such
criticism. His comments came a day after Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi blasted Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines for showing
solidarity for the ousted deputy prime minister, who was arrested
as he mounted a political challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year-rule. (MALAYSIA)
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Under towering marble figures of the Jews
who founded Christianity, Pope John Paul II on Sunday decreed the
first Jewish-born saint of the modern era: Edith Stein, a nun
killed in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. From now on, the pope
said, Catholics should commemorate all the Holocaust's murdered
Jews each year when they mark her saint's day. ``In the martyr,
Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many differences meet and
are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the name Stein chose in
the church, told the thousands filling St. Peter's Square.
(VATICAN-SAINT OF AUSCHWITZ)
	   ELILA BRIDGE, Congo (AP) _ A day after shooting down a jetliner
carrying 40 people, rebels clashed with government troops near a
strategic airstrip in eastern Congo on Sunday. Fighting for the
town of Kindu in this vast West African nation subsided after
rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held buildings
and the airfield, 2 miles (3 kilometers) away. On Saturday, the
rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport.
Rescue workers said there were no survivors from the downed plane,
the British Broadcasting Corp. reported Sunday. (CONGO)

Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke ended early
Monday, diplomatic sources said.
	   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Holbrooke
left the presidential offices for the American embassy about 1:30

officials in Washington.

Colbert wins The Transamerica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE M. PETERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAPA, California (AP) _ Jim Colbert finally got his victory.
	   Winless since he underwent successful prostate cancer surgery in
July 1997, Colbert shot a 5-under-par 67 Sunday to win the The
Transamerica by one stroke over Senior PGA Tour rookie David
Lundstrom.
	   ``It's by far the most meaningful golf tournament I ever won,''
Colbert said.
	   Colbert, 57, also moved ahead of Lee Trevino and became the
leading money winner in the history of the senior tour.
	   His 19th win as a senior was his first since the Raley's Gold
Rush Classic in October 1996.
	   ``When I got close today, I said, `We're going to get this
done,''' he said.
	   The first prize of dlrs 150,000 brought his 1998 earnings to
dlrs 1,007,041, the fourth time in his career he has earned over
dlrs 1 million, and gave him a senior total of dlrs 8,133,838.
Trevino, who did not play in The Transamerica, has dlrs 8,017,077.
	   Lundstrom, who was fighting for a spot on the senior tour next
year, shot a 69 Sunday and finished at 10-under 206.
	   Jay Sigel double-bogeyed No. 3, but regained his composure to
come within a shot of Colbert after 17. But a bogey on 18 gave him
a 70 and left him tied with four others a stroke behind Lundstrom.
	   Sigel, the two-time U.S. Amateur champion, has 12 top-10
finishes this year, including a victory at the Bell Atlantic
Classic.
	   Also at nine under was the comeback player of the day, Bruce
Summerhays.
	   Summerhays whiffed on one hole then hit into the water on
another for a 76 in Friday's first round. He made up for it Sunday
with nine birdies in a 64.
	   Summerhays, sixth on the money list, has 12 top-10 finishes this
year, including a win at the State Farm Senior Classic. He started
the final round at Silverado Country Club with a 1-under 143, but
steadily climbed. His worst error was a bogey on No. 17.
	   ``It was a great finish,'' Summerhays said. ``Today, everything
went well.''
	   The leaders going into the final round were Sigel, Lundstrom and
Hugh Baiocchi, all at 7-under 137.
	   Lundstrom, who figures he needs three more good finishes before
he is comfortable about next year, said he probably didn't deserve
the second-place finish Sunday because his game was a bit
off-balance.
	   ``I'm a little disappointed I didn't play better,'' he said.
``But I'm happy with the score.''
	   Dave Eichelberger, who recovered from three bogeys over the
first four holes for a four-stroke victory here last year, shot a
70 Sunday to finish at 217. Miller Barber, who opened with a 79,
shot his age, 67, in the final round and finished at even par.

Summerhays.
	   Summerhays whiffed on one hole then hit into the water on
another for a 76 in Friday's first round. He made up for it Sunday
with nine birdies in a 64.
	   Summerhays, sixth on the money list, has 12 top-10 finishes this
year, including a win at the State Farm Senior Classic. He started
the final round at Silverado Country Club with a 1-under 143, but
steadily climbed. His worst error was a bogey on No. 17.
	   ``It was a great finish,'' Summerhays said. ``Today, everything
went well.''
	   The leaders going into the final round were Sigel, Lundstrom and
Hugh Baiocchi, all at 7-under 137.
	   Lundstrom, who figures he needs three more good finishes before
he is comfortable about next year, said he probably didn't deserve
the second-place finish Sunday because his game was a bit
off-balance.
	   ``I'm a little disappointed I didn't play better,'' he said.
``But I'm happy with the score.''
	   Dave Eichelberger, who recovered from three bogeys over the
first four holes for a four-stroke victory here last year, shot a
70 Sunday to finish at 217. Miller Barber, who opened with a 79,
shot his age, 67, in the final round and finished at even par.

Engine fire on Singapore airliner forces plane to return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) - A fire in the outer starboard
engine of a Singapore Airlines Boeing 747 airliner forced it to
return to Auckland Sunday, where it touched down without incident,
radio and television reports said.
	   People on the ground reported seeing at least five spurts of
flame from the rear of the engine as the plane began climbing from
the runway at mid-afternoon, with more than 300 passengers and crew
aboard.
	   The plane, which had been headed for Singapore, spent about an
hour dumping a full fuel load out to sea before returning to the
airport to land in a full emergency service alert, the reports
said.
	   Singapore Airlines said passengers from the flight were booked
into hotels overnight and were given seats on different flights
Monday morning.
	   Maintenance crews had so far not found the cause of the flames.
A replacement engine was being fitted to the plane.
	   Emergency service crews said the big plane was not in danger
once the faulty engine had been closed down by pilots, as it can
remain safely airborne on three engines.

Iraq inspectors idled, but UN jumping on inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite a standstill in U.N. weapons
inspections in Iraq the past two months, there has been a frenzy of
activity at U.N. headquarters.
	   There were fiery news conferences by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz last week, front-page reports that Baghdad had loaded
deadly VX gas into a missile, even a threatened lawsuit by a former
U.N. arms inspector, miffed at a comment his onetime boss made on
television.
	   The next two weeks could be just as busy.
	   Chemical weapons experts are expected Oct. 22-23 for a meeting
to confirm or dispute reports that a French laboratory had found VX
traces in Iraqi missile warheads.
	   Confirmation would be a major blow to Iraq's efforts to have
8-year-old sanctions lifted, calling into question Baghdad's claims
that it was never able to make enough of the deadly nerve gas or
stabilize it sufficiently to use as a weapon.
	   Beginning Tuesday, the Security Council meets to consider the
latest six-month reports from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency _ the two U.N. bodies charged
after the Gulf war with making sure Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction. They must make that certification before the
council lifts sanctions.
	   Under normal circumstances, the council would use the reports as
the basis for a major review of the measures that have paralyzed
Iraq's economy.
	   But the review was scrubbed last month to punish Iraq for
stopping cooperation with U.N. inspectors _ a move that has ground
searches of suspected weapons sites to a halt.
	   The council, however, agreed to conduct a so-called
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's overall compliance with U.N.
resolutions in a bid to persuade Baghdad to reverse its Aug. 5
decision.
	   Aziz was in town last week to try to negotiate how that review
would be carried out. Between meetings, he blasted U.N. inspectors
as ``proteges'' of Washington _ a frequent Iraqi claim.
	   While Aziz and Secretary-General Kofi Annan failed to agree on
rescinding the Aug. 5 decision, the Iraqi deputy prime minister
indicated his willingness to keep working toward an agreement on a
review, which could build support for easing sanctions.
	   The council has been reluctant to discuss details of the review,
or even comment publicly on Annan's two-page proposal that was
circulated this week.
	   The strategy, it seems, is to force Iraq to rescind the decision
based solely on the council's pledge to carry out a review soon _
without saying exactly how it would proceed.
	   Some council members have, however, indicated concern with
Annan's proposal, which appears to take into account many of
Baghdad's concerns.
	   The most problematic element appears to be its suggestion that
inspectors provide evidence to back up claims that Iraq hasn't yet
complied with U.N. resolutions. Previously, the onus on providing
such evidence has rested with Iraq.
	   Iraq has long called for a reversal _ a move the deputy U.S.
ambassador Peter Burleigh said was tantamount to ``turning arms
control procedures on their head.''
	   Annan negotiated an end to the previous impasse with inspectors,
and was encouraged by the council to get involved in the current
one. He, along with council members Russia, France and China, has
advocated trying to finish the task of disarming Iraq so that
sanctions can be lifted.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. bombers moved into position for
possible NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and a U.S. envoy's latest
talks with President Slobodan Milosevic ended early Monday with no
apparent change in the leader's tough stand on Kosovo.
	   Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic held discussions until 1:30 a.m.
Monday in talks that signaled U.S. determination to search for a
way to end the violence.
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Holbrooke left for the U.S. Embassy to telephone Washington and it
was unclear whether talks would resume later in the day.
	   Holbrooke said early Sunday that he would ``continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance
system as an alternative to the other choice'' _ meaning the use of
force.
	   But he also said NATO would meet on Monday to authorize action
if his efforts fails.
	   In Washington, national security adviser Sandy Berger told CNN
that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this point.''
	   ``He can come into compliance or he can face military action by
NATO'' at any time, Berger said.
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile (half kilometer) from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could plunge the
entire region into conflict.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace, bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
Bulatovic told recruits at an army barracks in northern Yugoslavia.
``It would be in nobody's interest to make the Balkans a powder keg
again.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious'' and said he was looking for ``peaceful, acceptable''
alternative to the use of force.
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic
has refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing
for that because Milosevic has broken promises in the past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The U.S. government,
however, believes it does not need a new U.N. resolution for the
attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters.

Cycling authorities put nightmare season behind them.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ With the last major event of a
year plagued by doping scandals over, cycling authorities are
already working hard to clean up their sport's tarnished image
ahead of next season.
	   Cycling was plunged into crisis this summer by a series of
arrests and investigations during the sport's most prestigious race
_ the Tour de France _ into systematic doping of riders.
	   The affair was the main topic of conversation at the World
Cycling Championships, which finished Sunday in this southern Dutch
town, but there were no positive tests immediately reported.
	   In the final event, Switzerland's Oscar Camenzind won the wet
and windswept men's road race ahead of Peter Van Petegem of Belgium
and Italian Michele Bartoli, who took bronze in the 258- kilometer
(162-mile) event.
	   Lance Armstrong, riding in his first world's since overcoming
cancer, finished fourth, just failing to give the championships and
this scandal-hit season a storybook finish.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) began the week by setting
up an anti-doping task force made up of UCI officials, riders and
representatives of the professional teams.
	   The group's initial budget of 2 million Swiss francs (dlrs 1.4
million) will be spent on increased anti-doping and blood tests,
medical coverage and contributions to research.
	   But while UCI President Hein Verbruggen repeatedly insisted that
cycling does more than any other sport to fight doping, the union
cut the bans of three Swiss riders who admitted taking performance
enhancing drugs.
	   On Saturday, the Spanish watch maker Festina, sponsor of the
disgraced professional team that was kicked off this year's Tour de
France for its doping policy, said it would create a 4 million
French Francs (dlrs 725,000) fund to combat doping while staying on
as a team sponsor.
	   The UCI is also looking to next February's doping summit
organized by the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne,
Switzerland, to introduce new anti-doping measures throughout
sport.
	   Armstrong's fourth place Sunday was his second of the week _ he
also missed a medal by one place in Thursday's time trial which was
won by Spain's Abraham Olano.
	   Armstrong wasn't too upset.
	   ``If I had never been sick and was 100 percent, right now I
might be more disappointed,'' he said. ``Looking back over the last
18 months to two years, I really can't be disappointed.''
	   Armstrong won the 1993 world road race title but this time last
year he was slowly returning to riding after chemotherapy and
surgery had put his testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs
and brain, into remission.
	   In the last lap he didn't have the strength to stick with
27-year-old Camenzind from Steinen, Switzerland, who finished 23
seconds clear of Van Petegem. Bartoli was a further second back and
Armstrong finished more than a minute after the winner.
	   The last three Tour de France winners _ Marco Pantani, Jan
Ullrich and Bjarne Riis were missing from Sunday's race along with
world number one Laurent Jalabert.
	   In the week's other major races, the Netherlands' Leontien van
Moorsel took gold in the women's time trial and silver in the elite
women's road race to cap her comeback from weight problems. Diana
Ziliute of Lithuania won the women's road race.

Agassi frustrated as Henman plays match of his life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Tim Henman finished off the best week
of his career with the match of his life in the final of the Swiss
Indoors championship, which left Andre Agassi wanting to kill
himself.
	   Henman, the Enlish gentleman with the schoolboy good looks,
showed a ruthless killer instinct, dumping the American former
world No. 1 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 to claim his second title in as many
weeks.
	   ``To win here against somebody of Agassi's stature is great,''
said Henman, who'd successfully defended his title in Tashkent last
week. ``Especially when the field was so incredibly tough.
	   ``And to respond when I'd lost the last set and was a break
down, It's so satisfying. ''
	   For Agassi's part, it was another frustrating end to a promising
week, after having lost in the final of the Grand Slam Cup last
week to Chile's Marcelo Rios.
	   Despite having climbed from 144 in the world rankings to his
current number eight in less than a year, Agassi has been
frustrated by his inability to finish off tournaments.
	   Agassi's appearance in the Swiss final was his ninth this
season, having claimed four titles while letting five slip away.
	   '' I could have shot myself if I'd had a gun, I was so angry
with myself,'' said Agassi, 28. ``I came back a set and was up a
break and I should have been able to hang on and turn the match
around.
	   ``I need to come up with the big points against the big players
if I want to move up to the level I want,'' said Agassi, who has a
57-13 win-loss record this season.
	   While reaching the final has further solidified his foothold in
the top-eight standings for a berth in the ATP Tour World
Championships, it will also aid in his effort to climb back up the
world rankings.
	   The American, who finished last year 122 in the world _ his
lowest ATP ranking since turning pro in 1985 _ still has a chance
to oust compatriot Pete Sampras from the No. 1 spot in the year-end
rankings.
	   ``This tournament was definitely a step in the right direction
for me,'' said Agassi. ``It's possible for me to finish No. 1 but I
need to be able to win.
	   ``But I'd prefer to concentrate on getting to my next final and
becoming a player who can win titles and Grand Slams,'' Agassi
insisted. ``I'd rather have a Grand Slam win, than become No. 1 at
the end of the year but be unable to win anything after that.''

Yankees 5, Indians 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The Yankees came to town distracted, in
disarray and near disaster. They're heading home in control and in
reach of their next goal _ a trip to the World Series.
	   David Wells pitched well enough to win, Chili Davis drove in
three runs and Mariano Rivera got out of a hairy eighth inning
Sunday as the Yankees defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 to take a
3-2 lead in the AL championship series.
	   New York saved its record-setting season with two wins this
weekend at Jacobs Field, where its season ended last year. Now, the
Yankees are one victory away from the season's final destination
and the only place their fans will allow their magical year to
finish.
	   ``I'm very proud of this team,'' New York manager Joe Torre
said. ``Every time they've been faced with a challenge they've
responded.''
	   And for all his griping about the urgency to flee the Bronx and
build a new ballpark, even New York owner George Steinbrenner will
be happy to see the old neighborhood again.
	   Now the Indians, whose lineup looked more like the Triple-A
Buffalo Bisons than the defending AL champs, face the awesome task
of trying to win twice in Yankee Stadium.
	   The Yankees, who won 62 home games during the regular season,
will start David Cone on Tuesday in Game 6 against Charles Nagy.
	   ``We've got to win two,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said.
``It's going to be tough. As I've said a thousand times before, you
don't win 114 games by being lucky. These guys are good.''
	   Rivera, who gave up the eighth-inning homer to Sandy Alomar here
last year in Game 4 that swung the series to Cleveland, this time
got his team to the ninth.
	   After Wells was pulled with one out in the eighth and New York
leading 5-3, Jeff Nelson came on and hit Travis Fryman. Manny
Ramirez singled and Torre summoned Rivera, who was also brought in
with one out in the eighth last year before yielding Alomar's
homer.
	   This time was different, though. Rivera got Mark Whiten to hit
into an inning-ending double play that brought the Yankees charging
out of the dugout.
	   With the Yankees trailing in the series Saturday, Wells, who
easily handled the Indians in Game 1, asked New York manager if he
could pitch Game 4. An amused Torre said no, and Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez took care of the Indians Saturday.
	   Wells, who entered the game 6-1 in the postseason in his career
and 3-0 vs. Cleveland, figured to be a lot for the Indians to
handle. And their task got tougher when Alomar and David Justice
were scratched from the lineup because of injuries and Indians
manager Mike Hargrove was forced start three rookies.
	   Wells struggled early, allowing two runs in the first. But once
the left-hander settled in, he gave up just Jim Thome's homer in
the sixth and finished with a personal postseason record 11
strikeouts.
	   ``He fought it, he battled,'' Torre said. ``I'm even more proud
of him than the shutouts or even the perfect game for that matter
because of when he did it.''
	   Wells said he was bothered by some fans who taunted him while he
warmed up in the bullpen before the game. Later, he said some of
them made references to his late mother.
	   ``To all those idiots out there,'' he said afterward. ``This
one's for you.''
	   Hargrove elected to start Chad Ogea, who won two World Series
games for the Indians last year, over Jaret Wright. Wright had been
rocked by Boston in his first playoff start and again in Game 1 at
New York.
	   But Ogea didn't fare much better, failing to get out of the
second inning after giving up four runs and four hits in 1 1-3
innings with three walks and two hit batters. Wright came in and
allowed one run and two hits in six innings but walked seven.
	   There was a whole ballgame crammed into a 40-minute first
inning. The Yankees spent 22 minutes scoring three runs against
Ogea on two hit batters, two grounders off Cleveland infielder's
gloves and an RBI groundout.
	   With Chuck Knoblauch at first and one out, Ogea got Paul O'Neill
to hit a bouncer toward the middle. Ogea instinctively reached for
the ball and deflected it into left field past shortstop Omar
Vizquel, who was covering as Knoblauch broke on the pitch.
	   Had Ogea not touched it, Vizquel would have likely turned a
double play and the Indians would have been out of the inning.
Instead, after Bernie Williams walked, Davis hit a bouncer that
tipped off first baseman Richie Sexson's glove and into right for a
two-run single.
	   ``Those are the breaks of the game,'' Hargrove said. ``Those
things happen. ... But that's as gut-wrenching as anything because
that was a fairly routine ball.''
	   After Ogea hit Tino Martinez, Tim Raines brought in New York's
third run with a groundout and the Indians' first-inning playoff
troubles continued. They've now been outscored 15-3 in the first
this postseason.
	   Wells cooled off after his pregame warmup watching his
teammates, and the Indians scored two runs in the bottom of the
inning. Kenny Lofton led off with a homer just inside the pole in
right and after two singles, two steals and a wild pitch, Ramirez's
sacrifice fly brought Cleveland within 3-2.
	   The Yankees came back with a run in the second to chase Ogea on
O'Neill's RBI single, and Davis' two-out homer in the fourth made
it 5-3.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robert Edwards became the first player since the
1970 merger of the American Football League into the National
Football League to score touchdowns in his first five pro games,
and Drew Bledsoe threw three TD passes in New England's 40-10
victory over Kansas City on Sunday.
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, the Patriots (4-1) scored on seven
consecutive possessions after punting on their first one. The
Chiefs (4-2) helped them score with a fumble, a roughing-the-passer
penalty and two fourth-down failures.
	   Kansas City began the game with the NFL's second-best pass
defense, allowing 129.6 yards per game, and second best overall
defense, giving up an average of 240. By halftime, Bledsoe had
thrown for 174 yards and the offense had 246, and the Patriots
extended the lead to 37-0 in the third quarter.
 &UR; Eagles 17, Redskins 12 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, the Eagles won the first matchup of 0-5 teams
in NFC East history as Rodney Peete ran for a touchdown and threw
for another in a victory that gave Washington its worst start in 37
years.
	   Washington benched Trent Green, brought back Gus Frerotte and
got a sack from Dana Stubblefield. None of it was enough to beat
the Eagles, who breathed some life into what had been a hopeless
season and just might have saved coach Ray Rhodes' job.
	   Green had a miserable day, falling down for a ``sack'' at
midfield on a drive that eventually led to the Eagles' first
touchdown. Frerotte, benched in the season opening loss to the
Giants, didn't fare much better, although he did direct a late
touchdown drive that made it a 5-point game with 2:46 remaining.
 &UR; Bengals 25, Steelers 20 &QC; 
	   At Cincinnati, Neil O'Donnell rescued the Bengals' 93-yard drive
with a long fourth-down completion, then surprised a relaxed
Pittsburgh defense with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Carl Pickens in
the closing seconds.
	   The Steelers (3-2) seemed to have the victory in hand when Norm
Johnson kicked a 40-yard field goal for a 20-18 lead with 1:56
left. A holding penalty on the kickoff left the Bengals (2-3) at
their 7-yard line with no timeouts left.
	   Six plays later, O'Donnell threw a desperation pass on fourth
down that Pickens caught for a 50-yard gain.
	   After Corey Dillon's run got the clock moving, the Bengals lined
up and motioned for a clock-stopping spike. But O'Donnell instead
lobbed the decisive pass to Pickens, who once again beat Dewayne
Washington with 14 seconds to go.
 &UR; Cowboys 27, Panthers 20 &QC; 
	   At Irving, Texas, Jason Garrett threw two touchdown passes and
Deion Sanders made a critical interception with two minutes left,
but Dallas' victory wasn't secure until Steve Beuerlein's last pass
sailed out of the end zone as time ran out.
	   Beuerlein, making his first appearance of the season because
Kerry Collins decided he didn't want to play, completed 22 of 31
passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns against the dazzled
Dallas defense.
	   Sanders intercepted Beuerlein's pass with 1:55 to play, but
Carolina got the ball back with 51 seconds left for a last-ditch
drive to the Dallas 37, where Beuerlein let fly on a desperate
heave that overshot his three receivers with the clock showing
0:00.
	   The Cowboys (4-2) never previously beat the Panthers, whose
winless streak this season stands at five.
 &UR; 49ers 31, Saints 0 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Steve Young had his fifth straight 300-yard
passing game and became the 20th player in NFL history to throw for
30,000 yards in San Francisco's rout of New Orleans.
	   Chris Doleman's four sacks moved him into fifth place on the
career list, and the 49ers (4-1) won by their second largest margin
against the Saints (3-2).
	   Young, who left after one series in the fourth quarter,
completed 21 of 40 passes for 309 yards and three touchdowns. He is
now tied with Joe Montana for most consecutive 300-yard passing
games.
	   The Saints (3-2) showed no signs of the scrappy play that helped
them open with three straight victories and take the New England
Patriots to the wire last week.
 &UR; Oilers 12, Ravens 8 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Eddie George ran for 123 yards and quarterback
Steve McNair had a 40-yard touchdown run in as Tennessee overcame
141 yards in penalties to outlast Baltimore.
	   The Oilers (2-3) were penalized 13 times, but they managed to
win as the Ravens (2-3) went 1-for-15 on third down and mustered a
mere 36 yards on the ground.
	   Ravens running back Priest Holmes, who ran for 173 yards in his
debut against Cincinnati two weeks earlier, finished with 29 yards
on 14 carries.
 &UR; Bills 31, Colts 24 &QC; 
	   At Indianapolis, Doug Flutie passed for two touchdowns and set
up two short scoring runs by Antowain Smith for Buffalo.
	   The 35-year-old Flutie, back in the NFL after eight years in the
Canadian Football League, entered the game in the first quarter
after Rob Johnson was sacked and left with sore ribs.
	   Flutie, who had passed for only 158 yards as a backup this
season, his first in the NFL since 1989, was 23-for-28 for 213
yards with no sacks or interceptions. Peyton Manning, the top pick
in this year's draft, was 20-for-41 for 235 yards, but was
intercepted twice. He has thrown an NFL-high 14 interceptions for
the Colts (1-5) this season.
	   The Bills (2-3) erased a 9-0 Indianapolis lead.
	   In Seattle, John Elway returned to Denver's lineup and threw two
touchdown passes against Seattle.
	   Elway got a lot of help from Terrell Davis, who became the
Broncos' career leader in rushing touchdowns with 44 to give Denver
a 21-10 lead on the third play of the fourth quarter with a 2-yard
run.
	   Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, had his third career 200-yard
rushing game. He carried 30 times for 208 yards, while Elway was
13-for-27 for 185 yards and two TDs, with two interceptions, one of
which was returned for a touchdown by Darrin Smith.
	   The defending Super Bowl champion Broncos (6-0) beat the
Seahawks (3-3) for the fifth straight time and for the 10th time in
12 meetings. Seattle lost its third consecutive game.
 &UR; Rams 30, Jets 1 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, St. Louis forced five turnovers by the New York
Jets to snap an eight-game losing streak at home.
	   Amp Lee, playing a prominent role at running back due to
injuries, ran for two touchdowns, and St. Louis played error-free
ball.
	   Jets quarterback Glenn Foley, who missed the previous two games
with a rib-cage injury, had a miserable day. Foley was 5-for-15 for
76 yards and two interceptions, each of which led to a St. Louis
touchdown, before coach Bill Parcells yanked him in favor of Vinny
Testaverde with 3:13 to go in the third quarter and the Jets (2-3)
trailing 23-3.
 &UR; Raiders 7, Chargers 6 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California (AP) _ After 58 minutes of offensive
ineptitude by both teams, third-string quarterback Wade Wilson gave
Oakland an unlikely victory over San Diego.
	   After the Raiders went the entire second half without making a
first down, Wilson threw a 68-yard scoring pass to a wide-open
James Jett with 1:28 left.
	   Wilson, who replaced Donald Hollas early in the fourth period,
was 0-for-6 until completing his bomb to Jett.
	   The game included 27 punts and five interceptions. Oakland's Leo
Araguz had 16 punts, one short of the NFL record.
 &UR; Cardinals 20, Bears 7 &QC; 
	   In Tempe, Arizona, Linebacker Ronald McKinnon had three
interceptions and returned a blocked punt 31 yards, and little-used
Mario Bates scored two touchdowns for St. Louis.
	   McKinnon, who also caused a fumble, had one interception in the
first quarter, another at the end of the second and the last in the
third.
	   Then he topped himself in the fourth quarter when Chicago's
Ricky Bell blocked a punt by Scott Player. McKinnon grabbed it out
of the air, shook off a tackler at the sideline, and cut back to
midfield to gain a Cardinals first down.
	   He got his first carry as a Cardinal in the first quarter and
scored on a pair of 2-yard runs in the second quarter.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Declaring a martyr of Auschwitz the first
Jewish-born saint of the modern era, Pope John Paul II said
Catholics should mark her saint's day as an annual commemoration of
all the Holocaust's murdered Jews.
	   The pope called Edith Stein an ``eminent daughter of Israel and
a faithful daughter of the church.''
	   ``In the martyr, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, so many
differences meet and are resolved in peace,'' John Paul, using the
name Stein chose in the church, told the thousands filling St.
Peter's Square for Sunday's canonization.
	   It was a ceremony filled with remarkable gestures of
reconciliation: The Roman Catholic Church exerting all its
ceremony, pomp and grandeur in a tribute to a woman of Jewish
heritage. Relatives of Holocaust victims _ Stein's family _ sharing
a dais with the leader of Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Stein is believed to be the first Jewish-born saint since the
early days of the church, said the Rev. Simion Fernandez, who
oversaw the process toward canonization. Incomplete records and the
prevalence of conversions, voluntary and forced, make it impossible
to say for certain.
	   She was born into an Orthodox Jewish German family on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1891. An atheist, she
joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1922 and later became a
Carmelite nun.
	   In 1942, Adolf Hitler's regime ordered all the converts in the
Netherlands shipped to Auschwitz to punish the Dutch bishops for
speaking out against it.
	   Stein was offered a chance to escape deportation, the pope said,
but turned it down.
	   ``Why should I be excluded?'' he quoted her as saying.
	   ``If I cannot share the fate of my brothers and sisters, my life
is, in a certain way, destroyed.''
	   Stein was in a chapel praying with nuns of her order when the
Nazis came to arrest her.
	   Her sister, who had followed her into Catholicism, was among the
converts deported. They were killed at Auschwitz on Aug. 9.
	   ``We remember all of them today with profound respect,'' said
John Paul, whose voice stayed strong throughout the 2 1/2-hour
ceremony.
	   ``From now on, in celebrating the memory of our new saint, from
year to year we also cannot forget the Shoah, which slowly worked
at the elimination of a people, costing the lives of millions of
Jewish brothers and sisters,'' he declared, using the Hebrew word
for the Holocaust.
	   In Jerusalem, the Simon Wiesenthal Center protested Stein's
canonization.
	   ``She could in no way symbolize the Jewish martyrs of the
Holocaust because she chose to leave Judaism,'' said one center
official, Ephraim Zuroff.
	   In naming Stein a saint, the church credits her with interceding
almost a half-century after her death to save a toddler's life.
	   More than a decade ago, at 2 1/2, Teresia Benedicta McCarthy of
Brockton, Massachusetts, swallowed an overdose of Tylenol and
suffered such severe liver damage that she was put on a priority
list for a transplant. Overnight, she recovered.
	   Benedicta's doctor called the recovery miraculous, and the
church agreed _ saying the only explanation was the prayers that
the McCarthys and their friends offered to Stein.
	   Both Stein's and Benedicta's families, independently, had urged
that the church mark Stein's sainthood with a fuller accounting of
its actions before and during the Holocaust.
	   The family of Stein's grandnephew, Michael Biberstein of
Kensington, California, wrote the pope in August, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reported.
	   They praised John Paul for his ``goodwill to the Jewish people''
but said the past is ``still waiting to be fully acknowledged.''
	   In March, the Vatican issued a long-awaited statement of regret
that Catholics did not say and do more to stop Nazi persecution of
Jews, but praised the conduct of wartime pope Pius XII, whom some
accuse of failing to do enough.
	   Improving relations with Jews has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy, as has been the creation of saints. More people have been
canonized during his papacy, which reaches its 20th anniversary on
Friday, than in any other.

<TEXT>
	   MAOXIAN, China (AP) _ Kong Yifu felt lucky to get a job in a
county lumber yard last year. Wrestling pine logs onto trucks was
hard work, but it paid better than farming in mountainous western
China.
	   Soon, Kong will lose that job, joining thousands of unintended
economic casualties of an attempt to restore the dwindling forests
of Sichuan province.
	   Logging was banned Sept. 1 across swaths of western Sichuan as
part of stepped-up conservation efforts across China spurred by
breakneck development's damage to the environment. After a summer
of devastating floods made worse by logging that left bare
hillsides unable to catch rain, Chinese leaders could no longer
ignore the environmental costs.
	   Kong and his 170 coworkers at the Maoxian Daqiao Lumber
Inspection Station are supposed to get new jobs at hotels and other
state-run businesses, county officials told reporters. But in an
illustration that information isn't always shared by the top in
China, the workers haven't heard about the plan.
	   ``I'll go back to farming,'' sighed Kong, who is 33 but whose
weathered face looks a decade older.
	   The logging ban will wipe out more than 45,000 timber jobs,
according to the Sichuan government. It is keeping those workers
employed for now by paying them to replant forests they once cut.
But it has offered nothing to truckers and other businesses that
could be devastated by the loss of a major local industry.
	   Job losses will hit especially hard at a time when
restructurings of other Chinese state-run industries have put
millions out of work. Pressure to create jobs could make it hard
for Sichuan to stick to its ban.
	   Timber companies in Sichuan have been required since 1981 to
plant one sapling for each tree cut.
	   Few did. Forests receded as demand grew for paper, disposable
chopsticks, furniture, building materials and other wood products.
	   Land covered by forest in Sichuan has shrunk from more than 40
percent in some areas in the 1940s to a province average of 20
percent today, forestry officials say. Land affected by erosion has
nearly doubled, and the province loses 600 million tons of soil a
year.
	   Even those numbers understate the problem, said Liang Congjie,
president of Friends of Nature, a non-governmental ecology group in
Beijing. He said Sichuan has as little as 1 percent of its original
trees, noting orchards and other planted land are officially
counted as forest.
	   Plans call for replanting 140,000 hectares (350,000 acres), and
logging is banned on 4.6 million hectares (11 million acres).
Violators can be sentenced to up to five years in a labor camp.
	   To pay salaries for former forestry workers and pensions for
industry retirees, the central and provincial governments have
promised a total of 1.2 billion yuan (dlrs 150 million) annually
until 2010.
	   Similar tree-planting projects are under way or planned in
provinces scattered throughout China. In Ningxia in the northwest,
a grant from Germany is paying to plant 8,550 hectares (21,500
acres) of trees.
	   In Sichuan, officials acknowledge that towns dependent on
logging will suffer traumatic changes. But they talk optimistically
about developing orchards, tourism, manufacturing and cement
production.
	   ``This project will be good for future generations,'' Deputy
Gov. Zhang Zhongwei told reporters in Chengdu, the provincial
capital.
	   An end to logging makes financial sense to the Sichuan
government. Its timber industry has lost money for years, surviving
on treasury-draining subsidies.
	   The Western Sichuan Logging Co. in Lixian lost 11 million yuan
(dlrs 1.3 million) last year, said its president, Qian Lishun. The
company was renamed the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau this year
and put in charge of conservation.
	   In the 1950s, its 2,000 lumberjacks cut 10.5 million cubic feet
(300,000 cubic meters) of wood annually, Qian said. That fell last
year to 105,000 cubic feet (3,000 cubic meters) as trees grew
scarce. The workforce was slashed to 425, and the company delayed
paying wages and bills.
	   Like his father before him, Li Jingui spent 21 years cutting
trees in the rugged mountains of Sichuan. Now he is paid to replant
them, making the equivalent of 370 yuan (dlrs 45) a month, compared
to as little as 200 yuan (dlrs 24) in his final days cutting trees
for the company.
	   On a recent morning in Bipeng Gorge, north of Chengdu, the
41-year-old Li and his fellow former lumberjacks sat out an autumn
rain in a shelter beside a gully full of felled logs. Outside,
three men used a cable strung up the hillside to drag down logs cut
before the ban. Not far away, mountain goats grazed among stumps.
	   ``I favor this policy, because once we stop cutting ... the land
will be preserved. We will have fewer landslides,'' Li said,
echoing official policy.
	   Those who lack connections to the state timber industry and its
promise of a new job are much more ambivalent.
	   A young craftsman making a sofa in a workshop beside the Min
River in Dujiangyan, a town of drab concrete buildings north of
Chengdu, said the cost of materials already is rising.
	   ``Next year, there might not be any wood,'' said the man, who
would not give his name for fear of offending authorities.
	   Asked how he would earn a living, he looked at the saw in his
hand and said, ``I don't know.''
	   The winding road to Bipeng Gorge offers a sobering glimpse of
the economic future envisioned for the area by the government.
Smoke pours from cement factories. Hills along the Min River have
been dynamited into rubble for raw materials.
	   The government plans to build more cement plants, but at the
same time wants to promote the area's natural beauty for tourism.
	   Developing other industries will be difficult in isolated
valleys reached by narrow, winding roads frequently damaged by
landslides.
	   Tourism companies have visited to plan nature outings, said Peng
Huangshi, chief engineer for the provincial Department of Forest
Industries. But there are no commitments yet of private investment.
	   ``If anyone wants to invest, we warmly welcome them,'' Peng
said.

	   MAOXIAN, China (AP) _ On a dusty, forbiddingly steep slope 1,000
feet (300 meters) above the Min River, Yu Haiqing presides over
what must be China's most expensive apple trees.
	   Yu is director of forestry for Maoxian County, and the trees are
an attempt to remake the ecology and economy of this remote gorge
in the western Chinese province of Sichuan.
	   Apple trees were planted in 1994, along with tomatoes, peppers
and knee-high cypress saplings. Some 800 laborers spent nine months
building dozens of narrow terraced fields along the slope, held
back by low stone walls. A winding road leads to the valley floor.
	   The project was financed by a Japanese government grant of 50
million yen (dlrs 500,000) and a matching amount from China's
central government.
	   Elsewhere in Sichuan, Chinese leaders have launched ambitious
plans to restore heavily logged forests. But in Maoxian, they are
trying to bend nature to their will, using terracing techniques
that for thousands of years have turned mountains into farmland in
southwestern China.
	   Across the gorge from Yu's plot, villages clinging to a nearly
vertical hillside raise corn and vegetables on terraced fields.
Intensive farming has stripped away the thin soil in places,
leaving barren, stony scars hundreds of feet long.
	   ``We are using forestation for soil and water conservation and
to prevent landslides. We also hope it will trap water in the
soil,'' Yu said, standing among rows of shoulder-high trees, their
limbs laden with apples.
	   The orchards are to employ about 100 people, creating jobs in a
region that will be hit hard by a Sept. 1 ban on logging throughout
much of the western portion of Sichuan.
	   The terraces cover 175 hectares (435 acres), with apples and
other crops on 100 hectares (250 acres).
	   The project's dlrs 1 million cost works out to dlrs 4,000 an
acre (half hectare) of planted land _ a staggering sum by Chinese
standards. By area, Yu said, the cost is 10 times that of any other
conservation project in Sichuan.
	   But because the startup money was a gift, Yu has to worry only
about operating costs. Running the orchards should cost 500,000
yuan (dlrs 60,500) a year, while revenues could reach 2 million
yuan (dlrs 245,000), he said.
	   Yu said that while apple trees usually take 20 to 30 years to
produce their first fruit, Maoxian's special miniature variety
already are yielding marketable apples.
	   ``We want to do it next year over there, and there, and there,''
he said, pointing across the gorge.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ When fighting started eight months
ago, she stopped going to the cafes. Stayed home every night with
her parents. Too sad, too depressed. Now, with NATO threatening
airstrikes against the Serbs, Jehona is out every night. Drinking
with her friends. Nervous but excited, too. At last: It might be
the end.
	   Cafes form the social heart of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo
province. Like everything else, they are segregated: Serbs have
their cafes, Albanians have theirs. And these days, the Albanian
cafes are packed with young people like Jehona, not celebrating
exactly but more blowing off steam, soothing their nerves and
waiting for something to happen.
	   ``Everyone is going out,'' says Jehona, 25, her brown eyes
shining as she lights a cigarette and waits for her beer. ``It's
crazy! Maybe they're drinking to forget, or going out to see
friends. Everyone is waiting for D-Day. Maybe tonight is the last
night.''
	   ``If I die, so what? I had a beautiful 22 years living in this
repression,'' says her friend Ilir, laughing.
	   They hope NATO will pressure President Slobodan Milosevic into
giving independence to Kosovo, a southern province in the Serbian
republic that dominates Yugoslavia. They also hope that if NATO
drops bombs, Serbs won't attack them in the streets. Talk around
town says that Serbs will seek revenge on Albanians the instant
NATO acts.
	    &UR; ___
	   Serb cafe owner Predrag Ilic unfolds a large black leather
wallet, takes out a pistol and lays it on the glossy, chrome-rimmed
bar. Next, he reaches behind the bar and pulls out a grenade, lays
it next to the gun.
	   Sure, he has Albanian neighbors. Plenty of Serbs in Pristina do.
They can't help it. More Serbs live here than anywhere else in
Kosovo, 60,000 out of the population of 200,000. The two groups
exist on top of each other in the congested, hilly streets. But the
mingling stops there.
	   Separate bars. Separate stores. Separate schools. Albanians and
Serbs even have separate taxi services.
	   What would happen if an Albanian, even one of his neighbors,
stepped into Ilic's cafe?
	   He draws a finger across his neck.
	   ``Albanians like me,'' he says. ``But I want to kill them all.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Walk up the stairs at a certain elementary school in the heart
of town, and you hit an orange brick wall. It divides the Albanian
children on the first floor from the Serb children on the second.
	   Not every school has a wall, but every school is divided. Serbs
on one floor, Albanians on another. Separate entrances. Separate
curricula.
	   Serb children learn the Cyrillic alphabet in classrooms
decorated with portraits of Serb authors and Serb war heroes.
Albanians have the same, but from their culture.
	   Speaking separate languages, worshipping separate gods _ Serbs
are Orthodox Christian, Albanians are predominately Muslim _ the
two sides have virtually nothing in common. They do share one
thing: Each side believes Kosovo province is their ancestral land.
	   ``It's not a healthy environment in the least, but somehow we
have to live together _ together, but apart,'' says a 46-year-old
Serb math teacher who asked to remain anonymous for fear of getting
in trouble with school authorities. She remembers when it wasn't
like this.
	   She used to teach the children together, Serbs and Albanians in
the same room. She used to drink coffee with the Albanian teachers
in the break room, sometimes even have them over for dinner.
	   That was before 1989, when Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population, started
talking about independence.
	   The separate societies moved apart, and the anger between the
two sides grew hotter and hotter until it exploded into war. Ethnic
Albanian rebels started attacking Serb police, claiming land and
blocking roads. Serb forces rolled into the province on Feb. 28,
driving out the rebels and burning down ethnic Albanian villages.
	   And now NATO threats, designed to force Milosevic to give the
Albanians back their autonomy. It is all too much.
	   ``We were mixed before,'' she says, shaking her head. ``But
after all this, I don't know if we could be together again.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ As U.S. bombers moved into position
for possible NATO airstrikes, special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
met until early Monday with Slobodan Milosevic with no breakthrough
reported in marathon efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke and the Yugoslav president talked for more than
straight 10 hours, ending about 1:30 a.m. (2330 gmt). U.S. sources
said on condition of anonymity, adding it was too early to say
whether talks would resume later Monday.
	   A diplomat familiar with the talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, described the meeting as ``extremely difficult.'' It
ended hours before a planned NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium,
during which the alliance is expected to issue an ``activation
order'' for air action unless diplomacy produces a breakthrough.
	   There was no immediate word on whether the sides were any closer
to a deal. It was the seventh time in as many days the two sides
had met in search of a peaceful way out of the deadlock.
	   Holbrooke said early Sunday that he would ``continue an intense
effort to find a peaceful, acceptable, fully verifiable compliance
system as an alternative to the other choice'' _ meaning the use of
force.
	   But he also said NATO would meet Monday to authorize action if
his mediation effort fails.
	   In Washington, national security adviser Sandy Berger told CNN
that Milosevic ``is not in compliance as of this point.''
	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels claimed the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   On Sunday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., warned that Americans be
killed in the bombing raids. ``There will be significant jeopardy
there because the Serbians have a very good defense system,'' the
former Navy pilot said on ``Fox News Sunday.''
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could plunge the
entire region into conflict.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace, bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
Bulatovic told recruits at an army barracks in northern Yugoslavia.
``It would be in nobody's interest to make the Balkans a powder keg
again.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious.''
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources said on condition of anonymity that Milosevic had
refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing for
the force because they say Milosevic has broken promises in the
past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The Clinton
administration, however, believes it does not need a new U.N.
resolution for the attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where the Russian leader was visiting.
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who is accompanying
Yeltsin, said a Russian military response to NATO strikes is ``out
of the question,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Lasting benefits of Chinese logging elusive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Reforesting China &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE McDONALD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   283, China (AP) _ If logging brought any lasting benefit to this
corner of western China, none trickled down to Xiong Shouyi.
	   After three decades as a lumberjack, the crewcut 55-year-old is
retired in a former logging camp known simply as ``283.'' Nestled
in a mountain valley 3,100 meters (10,200 feet) high, the cluster
of weather-beaten buildings is surrounded by spectacular scenery
but has no electricity or telephone.
	   This is where Xiong and thousands of other timber workers
cleared valleys and hillsides of trees _ a process that China is
now trying to undo by replanting thousands of acres (hectares) of
forest.
	   ``If you say it was our fault, I would say we just did what our
leaders asked us to do,'' said Xiong, sitting in a doorway cleaning
wild mushrooms on a sunny autumn morning. Behind him, his wife
cooked on a wood stove.
	   Many residents of the valley are members of China's ethnic
Tibetan minority. Their houses are in Tibetan style, with stone
walls and ornately painted doors and windowsills. Tibetan Buddhist
religious monuments and prayer flags line the road.
	   Farming of cash crops is expanding to fill the economic gap left
by the end of logging. With improved transportation, the valley
supplies corn, tomatoes and vegetables to markets as far away as
the Sichuan provincial capital, Chengdu, nearly 300 kilometers (185
miles) to the south.
	   Before he retired, Xiong briefly planted saplings for the
reforestation effort.
	   ``For me, the new policy is reasonable. Overlogging is not good.
We need to preserve the land,'' he said.
	   But Xiong is skeptical of the view, embraced lately by Chinese
leaders, that timber-cutting worsened flooding this summer on the
Yangtze River by stripping hillsides of vegetation that traps
rainfall.
	   ``Yes, I heard about that, but didn't see the flooding. We don't
have television here,'' he said. ``How can that all be our fault?
We're here, and they're so far away.''

In Saudi Arabia, the men who would be king
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Saudi Times &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The hospitalization of Saudi Arabia's elderly King Fahd four
times this year has intensified talk within the kingdom about who
will rule in the 21st century.
	   Crown Prince Abdullah was named successor years ago and took
over briefly in 1995 after Fahd suffered a stroke. So the main
questions are whether Fahd _ who is at least 75 _ will bow out soon
and who will follow Abdullah, who's also in his 70s.
	   Speculation focuses on three men:
	   _Prince Sultan, 70, the influential defense minister.
	   _Prince Bandar bin Abdul-Aziz, 71, who was born to a slave
mother.
	   _Prince Abdul-Aziz bin Fahd, 26, the king's youngest, and
reputedly favorite, son.
	   The monarch is chosen by royal family consensus, not an easy job
in a family with some 3,500 princes.
	   On the basis of age, which has generally been the determining
factor in the past, the throne could go to the devout and little
known Bandar.
	   Sultan may have the edge, however. He has been the unofficial
second-in-line since Abdullah was named crown prince in 1982, and
many people believe he already has been secretly picked.
	   ``The royal family chose Prince Sultan years ago ... based on
his age and suitability,'' said Waheed Hashem, associate professor
of political science at King Abdul-Aziz University in Jiddah.
	   As for Abdul-Aziz, a recent surge in his influence has fueled
rumors that he will be picked, a prospect that heartens some Saudis
who argue the country needs younger leadership and should stop
choosing elderly kings.
	   Sultan is one of the important princes, full brothers of Fahd,
who are known as the ``Sudeiri Seven'' from their mother's maiden
name.
	   But academics and businessmen say Sultan's use of his position
to build his fortune has made him unpopular. And Abdullah, a
half-brother to Fahd, was seen to be trying to clip the Sudeiris'
power when he recommended that Abdul-Aziz be named to the Cabinet
in May.
	   A London-based opposition leader, Saad al-Faqih, sees
Abdul-Aziz's appointment as a sign of a deal over the royal
succession.
	   ``Abdullah has agreed with Fahd that he will put his favorite
son as crown prince if Fahd agrees to hand over power while he's
alive, like he did after his stroke,'' al-Faqih said in a telephone
interview.

	   The Americans and Europeans are demanding that Milosevic halt
the crackdown he launched Feb. 28 against the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   The major obstacle appears to be Holbrooke's demand that
Milosevic agree to an expanded international monitoring mission to
verify compliance with demands of the U.N. Security Council.
	   Those demands include an immediate cease-fire, a withdrawal of
special troops in the province, allowing refugees to return home
and beginning talks with ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
About 90 percent of its 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, and
most of them want independence or substantial self-rule.
	   Meanwhile, journalists heard sporadic gunfire Sunday and saw
white and gray smoke rising from about six houses in the ethnic
Albanian village of Makrmalj, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels say the activity was part of a Serb
police operation. Police prevented the journalists from getting
closer than about a half-mile from the village.
	   The Pentagon is continuing military preparations if Holbrooke's
mission fails. Six U.S. B-52 bombers arrived in Britain on Sunday
and a contingent of A-10 anti-tank planes flew from Germany to
Italy.
	   In Bucharest, the Romanian government agreed to allow NATO to
use its airspace in ``emergency and unpredictable situations'' if
the alliance launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, warned
neighboring countries Sunday that a NATO attack could plunge the
entire region into conflict.
	   ``Bombs cannot bring peace, bombs can only bring conflicts, war
and instability, not only in Kosovo but in a wider Balkan region,''
Bulatovic told recruits at an army barracks in northern Yugoslavia.
``It would be in nobody's interest to make the Balkans a powder keg
again.''
	   The positioning of more U.S. planes within range and preparing
them for attacks were clearly designed to convince Milosevic of
Washington's resolve to force compliance with U.N. demands.
	   After a late-night session with Milosevic, an exhausted-looking
Holbrooke insisted early Sunday ``nothing has changed'' in the
Yugoslav leader's stand. Holbrooke called the situation ``very
serious.''
	   A statement from Milosevic's office, issued after the talks and
distributed by the government's Tanjug news agency, said all U.N.
conditions have been met for a political settlement.
	   But Milosevic seemed to be separating U.N. demands from the U.S.
insistence on verification.
	   Serb sources said on condition of anonymity that Milosevic had
refused to budge on a monitoring force. Washington is pressing for
the force because they say Milosevic has broken promises in the
past.
	   A source close to Milosevic indicated that he was ready to
comply with other conditions.
	   International efforts to end the seven-month crisis have
accelerated following allegations that Serb police massacred scores
of ethnic Albanian refugees. Concern is mounting that winter will
bring a humanitarian disaster if thousands remain homeless by the
first snowfall.
	   The United Nations has condemned recent massacres of ethnic
Albanians, but has not endorsed airstrikes. The Clinton
administration, however, believes it does not need a new U.N.
resolution for the attacks.
	   Russia, which fiercely opposes NATO airstrikes, called its NATO
representative and ambassador to Belgium back to Moscow on Sunday
for emergency consultations on the potential attacks.
	   ``Everything should be done to prevent bombing,'' Dmitry
Yakushkin, President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, told reporters in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where the Russian leader was visiting.
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who is accompanying
Yeltsin, said a Russian military response to NATO strikes is ``out
of the question,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Kirkpatrick: IMF loans policy should be more flexible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund
should re-examine its loan policy and adopt a more flexible
approach, academic and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
Jean Kirkpatrick said Monday.
	   ``I think it is clear that for some time the IMF has operated
too much on a singular model for some very diverse societies and
economies,'' Kirkpatrick said.
	   Kirkpatrick said the IMF, which operates on a centralist French
model, must be encouraged to adapt its own rules rather than demand
that societies adapt to its plans.
	   ``And I think it is past time that there be more flexibility in
the (organizational) side too, in order to provide maximum help and
maximum flexibility of that help,'' she said.
	   Speaking at the 45th World Food Production Conference,
Kirkpatrick said feeding the world was the most fundamental problem
on Earth today.
	   Despite food crises in parts of the world, governments had not
failed in this task, ``but on the other hand neither have we
succeeded,'' she said.
	   She said countries experiencing food problems should not look to
developed countries for a solution. She noted that many countries
affected by famine in the past 20 years have had repressive
governments or civil war which had disrupted agricultural
production.
	   Developed countries could offer both food and their experience
in areas like crop production, but the solutions to famine also
required a political will within countries which could not be
dictated by developed powers, Kirkpatrick said.

Balkan leaders meet as NATO prepares for airstrikes against

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders gathered in Antalya, a
Turkish seaside resort, for a last minute effort to persuade
Yugoslavia to accept international demands on Kosovo and avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Although Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic and Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic were said to be bearing ``new ideas,'' it seems
unlikely the heads of government attending Monday's two-day Balkan
summit will be able to convince them to accept a key United Nations
demand that could avert a NATO decision to authorize military
action.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has so far
refused to bow to pressure from U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke to allow an international monitoring force in Kosovo.
	   NATO meets Monday to decide on the use of force, and Balkan
leaders here _ including alliance members Greece and Turkey _ want
to attempt their own 11th-hour effort to find a peaceful solution.
	   ``Regional countries should not interfere in the internal
affairs of countries but promote peace and understanding,''
Jonavonic said after a Sunday meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem before the start of the summit.
	   His statement reflected the difficulties that diplomats close to
the summit said they encountered with Yugoslavia in preliminary
meetings. They say Yugoslavia has so far refused to even accept a
mention of Kosovo in a joint declaration to be issued at the end of
the meeting, forcing other countries to draft a separate resolution
on the crisis in the Albanian-dominated Serbian province.
	   Reflecting the ability of Balkan nations to disagree even on
issues where they have agreement was Albania's unhappiness with the
draft condemning Yugoslav aggression in the province.
	   After holding his own meeting with Cem, Albanian Foreign
Minister Pascal Milo said he hoped on Monday ``Milosevic will be
convinced to act and start a dialogue on the status of Kosovo. NATO
forces are preparing airstrikes.''
	   Albania was angry because attending countries were not prepared
to fully back a call for military action against Yugoslavia and
were reticent to include harsh language in the statement.
	   Turkey, which is hosting the annual summit, has been trying to
prevent regional disagreements from marring a meeting designed to
bring the region closer together rather than to further tear it
apart.
	   ``These meetings should help us find what joins us rather than
what separates us,'' said Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman
Theodoros Theodorou.
	   It was the spirit of trying to forge agreement that inspired the
first summit last year on the Greek island of Crete. This summit
brings together the prime ministers of Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia,
Romania, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Albania is sending its foreign
minister, while Bosnia and Croatia are sending observers.
	   Some observers pointed to the fact that deep-rooted differences
and ambitions among some Balkan neighbors were also at fault for a
failure to quickly pound out a regional consensus on issues as
critical as Kosovo.
	   ``Because of the fact that Turkey is trying to play a balance
game with Greece in the context of the Kosovo situation on the eve
of the NATO strikes, I don't think that anybody can come forward
with some serious suggestion which can be implemented so fast. I
don't think that there is enough time and chance for something like
that,'' said Bosnia's Deputy Foreign Minister Husein Zivalj.
	   Turkey is also facing its own regional crisis with Syria over
Damascus's alleged sheltering of Turkish Kurdish guerrillas. Ankara
last week threatened to use force against Syria, which denies
sheltering the insurgents.
	   But the summit will give traditional rivals Greece and Turkey a
rare chance to talk about their own longstanding differences, which
have twice led them to the brink of war in the past 11 years.
	   Turkish prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz will be meeting with Greek
Premier Costas Simitis on Monday, giving the two leaders their
first chance in nearly a year to discuss such divisive issues as
Cyprus and the European Union.
	   With participants such as Bulgaria and Romania pounding on the
European Union's door, Greece will be hard put to explain its own
objections to Turkey's desire to join the body.

Hyundai chief likely to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Il
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary
chairman of the Hyundai business group, plans to visit North Korea
later this month and meet leader Kim Jong Il, an aide said Monday.
	   Kim Yun-kyu, a senior Hyundai executive, made the statement
after a weekend visit to North Korea, where he discussed Hyundai's
plans for sightseeing tours of a scenic northern mountain.
	   ``There is a high probability that honorary chairman Chung will
visit North Korea within this month and have a meeting with leader
Kim Jong Il,'' Kim told reporters.
	   The aide said all important pending issues concerning the tours
were settled during his visit to North Korea. He declined to
disclose what the pending problems were.
	   The aide said Hyundai can expect to start the tours later this
month. The tours have been delayed since September because of
financial, safety and other problems.
	   The Hyundai chief, Chung, visited his native North Korea in June
with a gift of 500 cattle and agreed to set up the tours as a joint
venture with the communist nation.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships to Diamond
Mountain on the North's east coast.
	   The project would mark the first major joint venture between the
two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new source of badly
needed foreign currency.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s. Their border is sealed with 2 million troops deployed
on both sides.

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ With opposition groups boycotting the
vote, Azerbaijan's authoritarian leader looked certain to be
re-elected president by voters seeking stability and long-elusive
prosperity for their oil-rich nation.
	   Voters on Sunday chose between President Geidar Aliev and five
candidates close to the government, who are widely believed to be
running only to make the election seem competitive.
	   Opposition groups criticized an announcement by an election
commission that results would not be known for four days, saying
Aliev's government was delaying results so it could tamper with the
outcome.
	   More than 72 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, the
election commission reported, easily surpassing the 25 percent
minimum turnout required to make the election valid.
	   Voting was peaceful in this former Soviet republic of 7.5
million once plagued by war and political chaos. International
observers said they had noticed only a few minor technical
problems, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. More than 200
observers were monitoring the vote.
	   The stability that has taken hold in recent years appeared to be
working in favor of Aliev, who led the nation during the Soviet era
and retook power in a bloodless 1993 coup.
	   ``I voted for Aliev,'' said shop owner Shakhi Mamedov. ``Before
he became the president we had instability. It was impossible to do
business and a lot of people carried guns. But now we are moving
towards a market economy.''
	   The main opposition leaders accused Aliev of stacking the ballot
in his favor and were already crying foul Sunday over the expected
outcome.
	   ``Whoever wins, whether it be Aliev or someone else, will be
illegitimate,'' said Isa Gambar, leader of the opposition group
Musavat and a former parliament speaker.
	   If no candidate wins at least two-thirds of the vote, a second
round must be held. In the last elections, after the 1993 coup,
Aliev won with 98 percent support.
	   Aliev has overseen the development of Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea
oil fields, but chronic corruption and sagging world oil prices
have meant that the nation has yet to enjoy the economic windfall
Aliev has been predicting for years.
	   Unemployment remains high and monthly salaries rarely exceed
170,000 manat (dlrs 43). The country's bitter dispute with Armenia
over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved.
	   Still, Aliev has cast himself as the only candidate capable of
continuing the country's development and market reforms.
	   He has tried to rework his authoritarian image by introducing
Western-style election laws, abolishing media censorship and
agreeing to permit limited anti-government rallies.
	   ``I believe in my victory and I will be a worthy president,''
Aliev said after voting Sunday. ``My main task has been the
settlement of the (Nagorno)-Karabakh problem, and the strengthening
of independence and the economy.''
	   Not everyone agreed. Aliev ``has not done anything to return our
territory,'' said Isaak Gamidov, a refugee from Nagorno-Karabakh.
``I don't care that we are very poor because the main thing now is
to return our land, which is occupied by the enemy.''
	   On Friday, police blocked an opposition rally attended by about
10,000 people in central Baku and beat several people demonstrating
against the elections.

Mexican governor backs down in dispute with ruling party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) _ The second political rebellion this year
against Mexico's ruling party leadership ended when a defiant
governor said he wouldn't break ties to the once-monolithic party.
But infighting is likely to continue.
	   Gov. Mario Villanueva on Saturday dropped his demand for the
resignation of an official of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
	   But he is prepared to forge ahead with his larger goal _ to seek
a return to the era 70 years ago when Mexico was run by regional
political bosses in the style of the fiefdom he has built in the
southern state of Quintana Roo.
	   ``The PRI has to return to its origins,'' he said in an
interview conducted last week shortly before he threatened to break
all contact with the national leadership.
	   Villanueva is one of a trio of state governors _ some of whom
have been accused in the past of drug ties and other misdeeds _ who
claim the so-called ``technocrats,'' reformers who have dominated
the government this decade, are out of touch with the Mexican
people.
	   ``Society is demanding flesh-and-blood people ... who they can
believe in, because of their profile, because of their
personality,'' Villanueva said.
	   For most of its 69 years, PRI was run by the country's president
_ invariably a party member _ in autocratic style.
	   But reforms supported by President Ernesto Zedillo in recent
years have led to cleaner elections and opposition gains. It has
also led to more openness within the party, and opened the door to
dissent.
	   Paradoxically, that new openness has helped those who want to
revert to the past. Villanueva conceded that a confrontation with
the PRI leadership, like the one he started Thursday, would have
been unthinkable years ago.
	   This week's rift started when national party leaders allegedly
went over Villanueva's head to name a state party official.
Villanueva said he was breaking off relations with the party until
national Secretary-General Carlos Rojas resigned.
	   In a statement Rojas accusing the governor of ``old-style
authoritarianism that we are determined to get rid of.''
	   Villanueva's brief rebellion follows a similar attack in
February by Gov. Manuel Bartlett of Puebla, who predicted ``a war,
a terrible fight'' against national leaders who he said wanted to
turn over power to the opposition.
	   Villanueva said he has joined with Bartlett and a third southern
governor, Roberto Madrazo Pintado of Tabasco, in a bid to get one
of the later two nominated as the PRI's presidential candidate in
the 2000 elections.
	   Bartlett has been mentioned in testimony before U.S. courts
trying suspects in the 1985 torture-murder of U.S. drug agent
Enrique Camarena. Madrazo Pintado is under a congressional
investigation based on evidence he spent tens of millions of
dollars in excess of a dlrs 1.1 million legal limit in his 1994
Tabasco state election.
	   Press reports have said that Villanueva may protect drug
traffickers, a charge he denies and attributes to a political
campaign against him by opposition parties and, he implies, some
members of his own party.
	   ``In Mexico, when they wanted to damage someone in the past,
they accused him of corruption, now they accuse him of drug
trafficking.''

Stocks sharply higher, dollar lower in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei morning close, midday dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks jumped during morning trading
Monday boosted by Friday's gain on Wall Street and hopes for early
government action to address the nation's ailing banks. The U.S.
dollar moved lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average jumped 570.54 points, or 4.43
percent, to 13,450.51 at the end of the morning session. On Friday,
the index had tumbled 146.09 points, or 1.12 percent, closing at
12,879.97 _ its lowest finish since December 1985.
	   The dollar bought 116.11 yen in midday trading, down 1.09 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late Friday level in
New York of 116.95 yen.
	   In line with Friday's rally in blue chips on Wall Street,
Japanese high-technology and financial issues led the way on the
Tokyo stock market, traders said.
	   The market also benefited from expectations that the government
will soon expand a pool of public funds to assist ailing Japanese
banks, they said.
	   ``The impact from the rise in New York stocks is more than
expected,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager at the equity division of
Tokyo Securities.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 167.61, or 2.17 percent,
to 7,899.52, a gain of 114.83 for the week and just shy of 7,908.25
where it began the year.
	   In Tokyo, optimism about prospects for the Japanese government's
bank recapitalization plans supported financial shares, traders
said.
	   Japanese media reported over the weekend that the ruling and
opposition parties have agreed to expand the pool of public funds
to boost the capitalization of weak banks to 67 trillion yen (dlrs
577 billion).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 36.29 points, or 3.69 percent, to 1,018.79. On
Friday, the TOPIX fell 19.00 points, or 1.93 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved lower on
selling from Japanese institutional investors and possibly by hedge
funds in a thin local market, traders said.
	   Last week, the dollar dropped nearly 14 percent, falling as low
as 111.45 on Thursday before recovering somewhat.
	   The selling was fueled largely by hedge funds moving to dump
dollars in uncertain markets amid hopes for greater efforts by
Japan to mend its weak economy and the gloomier outlook for the
U.S. economy.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Japanese Finance Ministry's
international bureau, said Monday that volatility like that which

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Just in time, Andres Galarraga and the Atlanta
Braves solved San Diego's pitching.
	   With the Braves facing elimination and trailing in the seventh
inning, Atlanta rallied for six runs, capped by Galarraga's
459-foot (138-meter) grand slam, and beat the Padres 8-3 Sunday in
Game 4 to avoid an unthinkable sweep in the National League
championship series.
	   After postseason hero Jim Leyritz hit a solo homer in the sixth
that put the Padres ahead 3-2, Javy Lopez tied it with a leadoff
home run in the seventh.
	   The Braves went on to load the bases with two outs before
Galarraga, who had no RBIs and just one single in his 12 previous
at-bats this series, unloaded. The Big Cat stood at home plate and
watched his ball sail into the seats in left-center, hushing the
crowd of 65,042 that had come to celebrate.
	   Ozzie Guillen, who started at shortstop because Atlanta manager
Bobby Cox thought he could get something going, was on third base
and turned to watch Galarraga's shot sail away. He threw his hands
in the air as he headed for home.
	   Padres pitching proved to be mortal after all, from starter and
loser Joey Hamilton to relievers Randy Myers and Dan Miceli, who
allowed Galarraga's slam. Atlanta, batting just .200 in the first
three games of the series, finished with 12 hits.
	   Even the Padres knew it wouldn't be that easy to sweep the
Braves. Now, after a good effort from Denny Neagle, Atlanta will
come back Monday night with the first of its Big Three pitchers.
	   John Smoltz will start for the Braves and the Padres will
counter with Andy Ashby. Both pitchers got no-decisions in Game 1,
a 3-2, 10-inning win for the Padres Wednesday night in Atlanta.
	   No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in playoff
history. If the Braves can get past Monday night and take the
series back to Atlanta, its other two Cy Young pitchers, Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux, will be ready to go.
	   Galarraga hit 44 homers this year, but only two in September and
none in October until Sunday. His shot came on a 1-0 pitch off
Miceli, who had come up big in clutch situations earlier in the
playoffs.
	   Leyritz's one-out homer off Neagle put the Padres ahead. But
Lopez, who hadn't driven in a run in the previous three games, hit
Hamilton's first pitch of the seventh over the right-field fence.
	   The Braves chased Hamilton one batter later on Andruw Jones's
infield single.
	   Left-hander Myers came on and got the first two outs, but then
allowed an RBI single to Guillen, an infield single to Keith
Lockhart and walked Chipper Jones to load the bases and bring on
Miceli.
	   Coincidentally, the Padres acquired Myers in a waiver deal with
Toronto on Aug. 6 in part to keep the Braves from getting him.
Padres relievers had allowed just one run on eight hits in seven
innings this series.
	   Atlanta's Dennis Martinez, 43, got the final out in the sixth
with a runner on second to get the win.
	   It was only the second time the Padres gave up more than two
runs in eight playoff games this year.
	   Leyritz hit his fourth homer this postseason, and pumped his
fists as he rounded first. He has seven homers in 43 career
postseason at-bats, and has seven RBIs in 16 at-bats in this year's
playoffs.
	   San Diego went ahead 2-0 in the third on Tony Gwynn's two-out
double and Leyritz's RBI single.
	   Lockhart, who was with the Padres part of the 1994 season,
tripled leading off the fourth and scored on Chipper Jones' single
to left.
	   The Braves tied it at 2 on Ryan Klesko's two-out single to left,
his first RBI of the series.
	   Hamilton was making his first start of the playoffs after
throwing 3 1-3 shutout innings of relief in two appearances in the
division series.
	   Neagle hadn't started since Sept. 17. In his last appearance, he
won in relief of Glavine against the New York Mets on Sept. 26, the
second-to-last day of the season.

Long-serving foreign minister endorsed for Commonwealth job

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The New Zealand government has
formally endorsed long-serving Foreign Minister Don McKinnon as a
candidate for secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said Monday.
	   McKinnon's endorsement comes a day before a 500-member
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting opens in Wellington.
	   McKinnon, New Zealand's foreign minister for eight years,
indicated Monday he has the support of 30 of the Commonwealth's 50
member nations.
	   The post, currently held by Chief Emeka Anyaoku of Nigeria, will
be filled during a meeting of the 50 Commonwealth Heads of
Government in South Africa in November 1999.
	   Shipley said she had written to them all seeking support for
McKinnon's candidacy.
	   Anyaoku has praised McKinnon and has said it was time for
someone from the Asia-Pacific region to head the organization.
	   The Pacific Island member states of the South Pacific Forum in
August pledged to back McKinnon if he put his name forward.
	   The forum's backing followed public endorsement from Papua New
Guinea and Kiribati, after McKinnon played a pivotal role in
negotiating a ceasefire on the war-torn Papua-New Guinea island of
Bougainville, where secessionists had been fighting for
independence for nine years.
	   McKinnon, 60, has led a special Commonwealth taskforce on the
plight of small states, and also serves as deputy chairman of the
Commonwealth's Monitoring Action Group, pressuring wayward states
like Gambia, Sierre Leone and Nigeria to return to democratic
government.
	   McKinnon used a recent trip to seven Caribbean nations to gauge
support there and said earlier he would decide after that trip
whether or not to seek the job.
	   McKinnon will be up against Farooq Sobhan, former permanent head
of the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry, and possibly still-to-be named
candidates from India and Malaysia.

Pirates attack weekend pleasure cruisers in Port Moresby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ About 150 people on a
pleasure boat cruising Port Moresby's harbor at the weekend were
attacked and robbed by armed pirates, police said Monday.
	   Five men armed with guns and knives came alongside and boarded
the MV Ma Foroe about midnight on Saturday, after circling the
vessel in a dinghy, Port Moresby police chief John Wakon said.
	   Wakon said passengers aboard the boat reported seeing torch
signals exchanged between the people on the dinghy and someone on
the pleasure boat, indicating either a passenger or a member of the
crew could have been working with the attackers, .
	   ``It (the attack) must have been planned,'' Wakon said.
	   Wakon said the attackers threatened and punched passengers and
hit them with bottles while taking their money and personal
valuables. No-one was seriously injured.
	   Police are interviewing the passengers and crew, Wakon said.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Just in time, Andres Galarraga and the Atlanta
Braves solved San Diego's pitching.
	   Facing elimination and trailing in the seventh inning, the
Braves rallied for six runs, capped by Galarraga's 459-foot
(140-meter) grand slam, and beat the Padres 8-3 Sunday in Game 4 to
avoid an unthinkable sweep in the NL championship series.
	   ``I knew the team really needed it to stay alive,'' Galarraga
said. ``They were not throwing me too many good pitches to hit.
That was probably the best pitch I got to hit all series.''
	   The slam ``was really big,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``He's
struggled a little bit, but if he gets hot, watch out.''
	   Even the Padres knew it wouldn't be that easy to sweep the
Braves, who led the league with 106 wins and reached the postseason
for the seventh straight time.
	   Now, after a good effort from Denny Neagle, Atlanta will come
back Monday night with the first of its Big Three pitchers. John
Smoltz will start against Andy Ashby in a rematch of Game 1, won by
the Padres 3-2 in 10 innings.
	   ``We thought we had it,'' said Padres postseason hero Jim
Leyritz. ``But we still feel good. It would have been nice to
sweep, but we're talking the Atlanta Braves and it's not easy to
sweep them.''
	   No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in playoff
history. If the Braves can get past Monday night and take the
series back to Atlanta, their other two Cy Young pitchers, Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux, will be ready to go.
	   ``We did keep it alive,'' Cox said. ``Hopefully, back home it
will be better for us.''
	   After Leyritz hit a solo homer in the sixth that put the Padres
ahead 3-2, Javy Lopez tied it with a leadoff home run in the
seventh.
	   The Braves went on to load the bases with two outs before
Galarraga, who had no RBIs and just one single in his 12 previous
at-bats this series, unloaded. The Big Cat stood at home plate and
watched the ball sail into the seats in left-center, hushing the
crowd of 65,042 that had come to celebrate.
	   ``You go 0-for-2, 0-for-3, you start swinging at bad pitches. I
decided to be more patient and I think it worked today,'' Galarraga
said.
	   Ozzie Guillen, who started because Cox thought he could provide
an offensive spark, was on third base after his go-ahead single. He
turned to watch Galarraga's shot and threw his hands in the air as
he headed for home.

	   Lockhart, who was with the Padres part of the 1994 season,
tripled leading off the fourth and scored on Chipper Jones' single.
	   The Braves tied it at 2 on Ryan Klesko's two-out single, his
first RBI of the series.
	   Hamilton was making his first start of the playoffs after
throwing 3 1-3 shutout innings of relief in two appearances in the
division series.
	   Neagle hadn't started since Sept. 17. In his last appearance, he
won in relief of Glavine against the New York Mets on Sept. 26, the
second-to-last day of the season.
