Albright Hopes Limited on Mideast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright makes her
third trip in a month to the Middle East this week, she would like to invite
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to a
summit with President Clinton. But Albright does not think either the Israeli or
Palestinian leader has a reasonable expectation that an agreement could be
hammered out with Clinton's hands-on intervention at a summit, a senior U.S.
official familiar with her thinking said Saturday. She also realizes that a
summit cannot be delayed until the two leaders are nearly in accord, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Gunmen holding Fiji's deposed government hostage released
their four remaining female captives Sunday, including three ministers in the
ousted Cabinet. The four women were among 31 hostages being held at the
parliamentary complex in the capital, Suva. They were freed around 2:30 a.m.
Sunday. Under heavy police escort, they were taken first to see family members,
then to see a team of trauma specialists who gave them medical checkups and
counseling, officials said.

Vieques Protesters Claim Victory

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters claimed victory Saturday after the
U.S. Navy did not begin a planned bombing exercise on Vieques island -- the
largest since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong occupation of the target
range. ''This is one more triumph in the fight against the Navy,'' activist
Hector Pesquera said at a meeting of protesters Saturday near the Navy facility,
Camp Garcia. About 200 protesters had said they would invade the range if
bombing began. But by this evening, the exercise, which the Navy had earlier
said would begin ''approximately Saturday'' had failed to materialize.

Green Party Adopts Platform

   DENVER (AP) -- The Green Party adopted a platform Saturday focusing on
political reform, human rights, the environment and corporate responsibility as
members prepared to nominate consumer advocate Ralph Nader for president. While
delegates to the national convention of the Association of State Green Parties
debated their platform, Nader said his 50-state tour had given him ''the
distinct feeling that America wants a change, a change from the dominance of the
two major political parties.''

crucial information in starting a small business, or you want to track your
Social Security benefits, you can do it all in one place, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week,'' he said. The site, http://www.firstgov.gov, should be operating

Undecided May Control Japan Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Only one hurdle stands between Japan's ruling coalition and
victory in Sunday's lower house elections: a legion of undecided voters. Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori's Liberal Democrats are in a position of strength ahead of
the vote. Polls show them with firm chances of holding onto power, and the
opposition has failed to present a credible challenge. The only question mark
left as polls opened Sunday morning was a large chunk of voters who have not yet
decided whom to cast ballots for.

Year 2000 celebration for the Archdiocese of Chicago. Heavy rainstorms kept
attendance lower than expected for the open-air event. The event brought
together the largest assembly of Catholics in Chicago since Pope John Paul II

<HEADLINE> Union spokesman: Con Ed walkout 'imminent'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Minutes before a midnight strike deadline for
thousands of Consolidated Edison employees, Con Edison and it
largest union agreed to stop the clock and continue negotiations
into Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a breakthrough in negotiations and the parties
have agreed to stop the clock and continue negotiating for two more
hours until 2 a.m. to see if they can get the job done,'' said
Steve Mangione, a spokesman for the 10,000 workers in Local 1-2 of
the Utility Workers of America. ''The union feels that with this
breathrough they can get to a contract and avert a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for Con Edison, said ''Both parties
have agreed to stop the clock and continue negotiating. Local 1-2
members are currently operating the system with qualified
management and supervisors standing by at appropriate key
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison and its largest union continued negotiating with the
looming possibility of summer strike that would affect an estimated
3.3 million metropolitan customers.
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point was a company proposal over sick time,
although there were differences over job security, pension and
medical benefits issues, Mangione said.
</P>
<P>
   Faber would not discuss specifics in the negotiations, saying
only that ''talks are continuing.'' The utility had a team of
managers and supervisors ready to step in if there was a strike,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The utility has repeatedly said that its customers will not be
affected by any walkout. Con Ed serves 3 million customers in New
York City and another 330,000 in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents 9,000 workers at Con Ed and 1,000 workers
at three other utilities. Mangione predicted that the utility would
have a difficult time maintaining services if there's a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they think people trained overnight can do that, they're
just fooling the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union did reach a tentative two-year deal with another
utility, NRG Energy. They also reached tentative agreements with
Orion Power and Keyspan Energy, which had returned to the
bargaining table after talks broke off twice this week. Terms were
not immediately disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb In Spain Injures 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETXO, Spain (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in a wealthy residential
zone of this small Basque town early Sunday, injuring four people,
emergency services said.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous phone caller told the regional newspaper Gara that
the Basque separatist group ETA claimed responsibility for the
blast in Getxo, 12 miles east of Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency services in the northern Basque region had received a
phone tip that the bomb would go off in 15 minutes on a street in
the wealthy Las Arenas district. Police were able to close off the
street and alert residents before the bomb exploded just after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martin, spokesman for the regional government, said the
blast shattered windows and dug a big crater in the street. The car
bomb, a white Mercedes with French license plates, burst into
flames and set two nearby vehicles on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were treated for minor glass cuts and a fourth was
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- the initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom -- has
killed some 800 people during a 30-year campaign for independence
of the Basque region of northern Spain. ETA is blamed for five
killings since ending a 14-month cease-fire late last year.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 9, Rangers 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Fred McGriff had four hits, including a
home run, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays scored four times in the
eighth inning to beat the Texas Rangers 9-7 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff went 4-for-4 in his first four-hit game this season as
Tampa Bay won its second straight and improved to 14-8 since May
31.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White (3-4) allowed two runs in 1 1-3 innings for the win.
Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 15
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made three errors and at 33-39 fell six games below
.500 for the first time since April 30.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 5 in the eighth, Mike DiFelice hit a
two-run homer off Tim Crabtree (1-5). The Devil Rays added two more
runs off Crabtree, who gave up four runs on four hits in 1-3 of an
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro hit a two-run homer off White in the ninth to
make it 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting singles in his first three at-bats, McGriff pulled
a 3-2 pitch from Francisco Cordero into the right-field bleachers
in the top of the seventh inning to give Tampa Bay a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez answered for Texas in the bottom of the inning
with his third home run of the year to tie the game at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton hit his second home run in as many nights,
improving to 11-for-58 in his last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Glynn made his second start of the year for the Rangers and
gave up four runs, two earned, nine hits in 5 2-3 innings. Texas
recalled Glynn from Triple-A Oklahoma Friday to replace lefty
Darren Oliver, who went on the DL June 21 because of weakness in
his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Bryan Rekar gave up four runs on seven hits in four
innings before being replaced by Doug Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored twice in the fourth to take a 4-3 lead on Clayton's
RBI groundout, and Green's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay scored one run in each of the first three innings
while Texas got solo home runs from Clayton and Frank Catalanotto.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With his 12th home run, Clayton is two shy of his career
high of 14, set lasts eason. Four of his 12 home runs this season
have come against Tampa Bay. ... Glynn left the game because of a
blister on his right index finger. ... Palmeiro's homer stopped a
streak of 14 straight games without an extra-base hit. ... The
48,256 in attendance marked the second-largest regular season crowd
in the seven-year history of The Ballpark in Arlington. An
opening-day crowd of 49,332 on April 3, is the largest regular
season crowd.

<HEADLINE> New Canadian Party Votes for Leader  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- A new party trying to unify Canada's
conservatives was unable to decide on a leader Saturday, leaving
two Alberta politicians to take part in a run-off vote.
</P>
<P>
   Former Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day and Preston Manning,
founder of the Reform Party, which formed the core of the Canadian
Alliance when it was created three months ago, were the top two
finishers in results announced Saturday night after voting by
Alliance members this week.
</P>
<P>
   The two will now face each other in a July 8 runoff vote. The
winner becomes the official opposition leader in Parliament, a post
Manning has held since 1997, and will be a major contender for the
prime minister's office after the next federal election, expected
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance leaders depict their party as a home for Canadians
seeking change after seven years of Liberal Party rule under Prime
Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 116,000 votes counted out of a total eligible
pool of 200,000, Day had 43.94 percent to 35.86 percent for
Manning. Tom Long, an Ontario political strategist whose campaign
was marred by buying memberships for hundreds of people without
their knowledge, was third with 18.61 percent, and British Columbia
politician Dr. Keith Martin barely cleared 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Day, a charismatic former preacher known for strong conservative
views opposing abortion and favoring capital punishment, was
considered an alternative to Manning, who led the Reform Party
throughout its 13-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Day never mentioned the runoff in his victory speech, sounding
instead like a winner seeking to draw together supporters of the
other candidates to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Canadian Alliance freedom train has left the station and
is rolling across the nation,'' he said to rousing cheers at a
convention-like party gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, meanwhile, said he would work to gain support for the
run-off from tens of thousands of Alliance members he said didn't
vote in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need each and every one of you,'' he said to those who
didn't vote. ''If we stick together, the end result will be a
principled alternative to the federal Liberal government in
Ottawa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance touts itself as the advocate of true representative
democracy -- illustrated by its one-member, one-vote system to
choose a leader instead of a convention -- and it stands for
fundamental conservative principles, including decentralized
federal powers, low taxes, reduced debt.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over how it would deal with volatile social issues
such as abortion showed the root of divisiveness in Canada's
political right, similar to the ideological rifts among U.S.
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the leadership vote showed the Alliance made some
gains in regions where it has previously been unable to generate
much support, particularly Ontario, the nation's most populous
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance's chances of defeating the Liberals depend on its
ability to grow in Ontario, along with Quebec and other eastern
regions.
</P>
<P>
   When it formed in March, almost all the Alliance's 70,000
members were from the Reform Party, which began as a Western
protest movement and never won a Parliament seat east of Manitoba
in its 13-year history. Just over 200,000 members were registered
to vote in the leadership race, with more than 60,000 in Ontario,
second only to the slightly larger figure from Alberta, the home
base of the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Manning engineered creation of the Alliance as a way to forge a
nationwide conservative movement by attracting disillusioned
supporters of the Conservative Party, which last governed under
Brian Mulroney in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A series of glitches and irregularities marred the voting, which
began Wednesday in remote areas and Quebec province with telephone
balloting. Some members complained they never received the security
code and information needed to cast a telephone vote, while others
in eastern Quebec's Gaspe region said they received membership
cards even though they never joined the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Alliance announced that 1,400 names had been
removed from the membership roll in Gaspe.

<HEADLINE> Police Seek Aussie Fire Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PASSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILDERS, Australia (AP) -- Grief turned to anger Saturday for
some of the survivors of a hostel fire that killed 15 backpackers,
after police said they were searching for a man who may have
deliberately set the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Paul Long, 37, was known to have frequented the Palace
hostel and was seen there Friday night, shortly before fire swept
through the building, Chief Supt. Ken Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have issued a bulletin to police forces around the country
to see if we can find him,'' Benjamin said. ''We strongly believe
he was at the hostel before the fire started and that he can help
us with our inquiries.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin would not say whether Long was the man who was ejected
from the hostel a week ago and had made threats to several women
there in the days leading up to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's the case, that someone deliberately set fire to the
place, then they should be strung up,'' said Keith O'Brien, a
22-year-old backpacker from Wigan, England, who survived the
inferno.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of those who died were just kids,'' O'Brien said, his
eyes red with tears. ''This didn't have to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said it was too early to say what caused the fire, but
that the blaze was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic teams on Saturday starting probing the ruins of the
hostel on the main street of Childers, a town of 1,500 located 195
miles north of the Queensland state capital of Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   Police removed the first body from the ground floor Saturday,
but said they would not enter the second floor until Sunday because
fire officials said it was not safe.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze broke out at about 12:30 a.m. Friday in the back of
the ground floor of the 100-year-old former pub that had been
transformed into a hostel 18 months ago, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included seven people from the United Kingdom, four
from Australia, two from the Netherlands and one each from South
Korea and Japan. Dental records would be needed to help identify
some of the bodies, police said. Police said Sunday that one victim
previously identified as Dutch was actually Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy residents of the hostel escaped the blaze. Dozens
suffered minor injuries, most as they attempted to escape from the
upper level by jumping onto nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, the operators of the hostel, Christian Atkinson
and John Dobe, who also lived at the hostel, issued a statement
saying they were shattered by the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who have been with us at the Palace, some for many
months, some for a very short time, have become our friends and
very much a part of our lives,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the guests were fruit-pickers at regional farms who had
come to the area to make some extra money on their travels around
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A picnic bench in front of the hostel has become a shrine to the
dead backpackers, where about 20 survivors gathered Saturday with a
Roman Catholic priest for an impromptu memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors were taking sanctuary Saturday in Childers' local
cultural center, where they could send e-mails to their families
overseas and counselors offered support.
</P>
<P>
   A non-denominational church service was planned for Sunday.
Government representatives from some of the countries whose
citizens died in the fire were expected to attend, as well as
Australian Prime Minister John Howard.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Seek Martial Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's military commander wants
to impose martial law in the Maluku islands, where Christians and
Muslims are waging a bloody sectarian street war, a news report
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please do it,'' Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto said when reporters
asked if martial law should be imposed across the island group,
where more than 40 people have been killed in recent fighting, The
Jakarta Post newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid, who has promised to respect human
rights, has so far resisted calls for martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Martial law was often enforced during the 32-year authoritarian
rule of ex-President Suharto to stamp out ethnic and other unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Unchecked and heavy-handed military action against civilians led
to accusations of widespread human rights abuse against Suharto,
who was forced to quit two years ago and is now under house arrest
facing corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wednesday, at least 41 Christians, Muslims and security
forces personnel have been killed in Maluku's battle-scarred main
city, Ambon.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people were killed June 19, when Muslim fighters
attacked a mainly Christian village on Halmahera island in North
Maluku province. Unconfirmed reports by church workers say about
180 Christians were killed there.
</P>
<P>
   Though the military says far fewer than that died, the attack
was one of the bloodiest single incidents since sectarian violence
erupted in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people of both faiths have been killed in the
conflict in the Malukus, also known as the Moluccas or Spice
Islands during the Dutch colonial era.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian troops there are often caught in the middle of savage
gang wars where combatants use military-style weapons or homemade
guns along with spears and swords.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse some soldiers of taking sides and others of being
too scared to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders say their forces are often outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has ordered more troops to the region, about 1,500 miles
northeast of Jakarta. On Friday he imposed a ban on outside travel
to the Malukus amid reports that Islamic vigilantes from elsewhere
in Indonesia were behind much of the latest violence.
</P>
<P>
   One group, calling itself the Laksar Jihad or Holy War Force,
has admitted taking part in the fighting to avenge past attacks by
Christians on Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said Widodo had discussed the possibility of declaring
a state of emergency in the Maluku islands with Vice President
Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted Widodo as saying that in the meantime the military
would conduct door-to-door searches for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said soldiers ''will take stern measures in anticipating
further developments.''

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Gunmen holding Fiji's deposed government
hostage released their four remaining female captives Sunday,
including three ministers in the ousted Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed talks between the gunmen and the army -- which has
assumed executive power in this South Pacific island nation -- broke
down once again Sunday, with military commander Commodore Frank
Bainimarama leaving the talks shortly after entering them.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji reported the latest impasse revolved around the
naming of a new president. The rebels insist a president be named
immediately so that he could appoint the gunmen's representatives
to an interim government, thus enabling the rebels to enforce their
demands once the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   The four women -- among 31 hostages being held at the
parliamentary complex in the capital, Suva -- were freed before dawn
Sunday, taken by police to see their families, then for medical
checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thankful to the lord for making this day possible,'' said
Lavenia Wainiqolo Padarath, one of the freed hostages, outside a
church service she attended Sunday with her family. ''That's what
we Fijians are all about. We come to church, we pray and we forgive
... We forgive those who have made us captives.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it felt to see her family again, Padarath, the deposed
minister for women, culture and social welfare minister, replied:
''Wonderful -- it's all I live for.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Fiji quoted rebel spokesman Jo Nata as saying the rebels
released the four as a goodwill gesture. Fiji's schools are about
to open again after being closed during the government crisis, and
the rebels wanted the women to be back with their children, the
station quoted Nata as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Among the released hostages was Adi Koila Mara. Koila, the
transport and tourism minister in the government of ousted Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, is also the daughter of former
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Two of the other women released
are also former ministers, and the fourth is a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven other former lawmakers, including Chaudhry,
remained captive inside Fiji's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have been held there since May 19, when rebels led
by businessman George Speight stormed the parliament compound.
Chaudhry was the first ethnic Indian prime minister of this Pacific
island nation, and the ethnic Fijian rebels say they staged their
coup because the government was trampling on the rights of the
indigenous majority.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the coup attempt, some indigenous Fijians
launched attacks on ethnic Indians, looting homes and businesses.
Fiji's military quickly took over and declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Col Filipo Tarakinikini described the
women's release as a ''positive step for the humanitarian side.''
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that Speight was refusing to release the other
hostages until he was sure all his demands would be met.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the hostages no one will talk to them,'' Tarakinikini
said. ''The only thing that will ensure that they can bridge the
gap from where they are to the implementation of their aspirations
is to hold onto the hostages until they feel secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have been negotiating with the rebels on
details of an interim civilian government that would presumably
lead Fiji to new elections within two years. On Friday, the sides
announced they had reached an accord, but the deal collapsed
Saturday after the rebels refused to release their captives.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to sign the accord had dashed the hopes of the
hostages' relatives, who have been waiting more than a month for
their loved ones to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This must be the third time that we were given this high hope
that there will be an accord signed and that our family members
would be released,'' Virmaty Chaudhry, wife of the deposed prime
minister, told Fiji TV.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff has pitted Fiji's poor indigenous majority against
its relatively affluent Indian minority, sent the economy into a
tailspin and raised concern that the South Pacific nation has
descended into racism and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The military already has promised Speight the removal of
Chaudhry's government and changes in the constitution to strip
Indians of the political power they shared with the Fijian
majority. Those conditions are expected to be part of any accord
between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, the nation's cash crop, is at the core of Fiji's
troubles. Indian farmers built the industry by operating
plantations on land that is communally owned by indigenous Fijians
and leased at low rates set by English colonial law. Those leases
are due to be renewed, and the refusal by Chaudhry's government to
accept demands for higher rents on the land enraged many Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Many Fijians of Indian descent, who make up about 44 percent of
the islands' 812,000 people, are fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the country's break with democracy, Australia, New
Zealand and the United States have threatened economic sanctions.
The refusal by Australian trade unions to handle cargo to and from
Fiji has paralyzed much of the country's exports.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Claim Victory  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters claimed victory after the
U.S. Navy did not begin a planned bombing exercise on Vieques
island -- the largest since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong
occupation of the target range.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one more triumph in the fight against the Navy,''
activist Hector Pesquera said at a meeting of about 200 protesters
Saturday near the Navy facility, Camp Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had earlier said it would begin its exercise
''approximately Saturday'' -- but by Saturday evening it had failed
to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters were trying to slip onto the range
Saturday night, Pesquera said, but he would not say how many. The
protesters earlier had been planning to invade the range after
bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon would not say when the exercises
would begin. He said the Navy typically gives two hours' notice to
warn area fishermen. But Gordon said this week that the Navy is not
obligated to do so or say exactly when exercises will begin -- an
apparent attempt to ward off protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters still have vowed to block the exercises. Inside the
camp, police and military guards could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Carlos Zenon compared the tense situation to a
''psychological war,'' but said the protesters would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared for tonight or whenever it happens,'' Zenon
said. ''If the Navy comes to the range, we are going to interrupt
the exercises -- it's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   Five warships plan to fire up to 600 rounds at the range and
aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs -- including
500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs -- during two to five days of
exercises, according to plans filed by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since the publication last week of the
Navy's plans for the exercise, the biggest since an April 1999
bombing accident killed a civilian on the range. That accident led
to an occupation of the range before federal officials evicted the
protesters last month. Since then, more than 200 demonstrators have
been arrested for trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say five decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, contaminated water supplies, stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs
instead of live munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the
island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected
next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Turn Out for Election  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Despite months of political violence and
threats against the opposition, Zimbabweans crowded polling booths
Saturday in the country's most competitive election since
independence two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The huge turnout in the parliamentary poll could favor the
opposition movement that's seeking to oust President Robert
Mugabe's ruling party. The opposition reported scattered instances
of intimidation, but overall the voting appeared to go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Voting resumed Sunday with long lines at stations forming hours
before polls opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violence has not worked,'' said Masipula Sithole, a
political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe. ''If
anything at all it has backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   The election pits the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union
Patriotic Front against the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change, and is the most serious challenge to the ruling party since
it led the nation to independence from white-minority rule in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's 5.1 million registered voters were filling 120 of
parliament's 150 seats. Mugabe appoints the remaining 30 members,
giving him and his party a built-in advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The president has two years remaining in his term and was not on
the ballot. But his aggressive campaigning, his relentless
criticism of the white minority and his support for black militants
occupying white-owned farms set the confrontational tone of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The first results were expected Monday, and the opposition would
need 76 seats to oust the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the election, ruling party militants
traveled the countryside, attacking opposition supporters and
threatening retribution against anyone voting against their party.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 people were killed in violence that human rights
groups and opposition activists said was designed to intimidate
people into not voting.
</P>
<P>
   The MDC said the intimidation continued Saturday, with several
incidents reported in the first several hours of voting.
</P>
<P>
   When polling booths opened at 7 a.m., however, voters were
already lined up across the capital, Harare. In the Mbare suburb, a
line of more than 1,000 voters twisted its way around a community
hall used as a voting station.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Macheke, a town frequently attacked by anti-MDC
militants, nearly 100 people waited quietly in line at a school
where only about 300 people had voted in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to change the government,'' Maie Jiti said. ''We've
had enough of corruption, nepotism. There is not democracy. The
economy is in shambles. The health sector is in shambles, as well
as education.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, ruling party militants rampaged through the
commercial farm Jiti owns with her husband, Golden.
</P>
<P>
   The militants beat many of her 180 workers, confiscated
opposition T-shirts and told them they had installed cameras in the
voting booths to ensure they made the right choice. They forced her
family, who were known MDC supporters, to abandon the farm for
nearly three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Later the militants forced her workers to attend ruling party
rallies and demanded she provide the trucks and tractors to
transport them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people are not coming to vote because they are being
beaten. Some of them are hospitalized. They are scared,'' said
Jiti, 36, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people in Macheke, 60 miles east of Harare, said the
turnout was greater than at any previous election in Zimbabwe's
history. Only 29 percent of the nationwide electorate turned out
for the 1995 parliamentary vote.
</P>
<P>
   Though many voters showed up, few were willing to talk about the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The MDC reported that ruling party militants blocked approaches
to at least two polling stations with barricades, and a bus was
attacked by militants near Guruve, 90 miles north of Harare. Ten
passengers were hurt, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, MDC polling agents were attacked and fled in Mberengwa, in
the southwest, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, vehicles and people on foot were turned away amid
threats, and voters' lists were incomplete, the opposition added.
</P>
<P>
   No corroboration from independent election monitors was
immediately available, and voting in several places visited by
reporters appeared to take place without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party reported Saturday that one of its
candidates in the southern town of Masvingo, Zachariah Rioga, 53,
was in a coma after being assaulted by ruling party militants
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sithole, the political analyst, said voters were willing to
brave the violence and threats, and saw the ballot as a ''do-or-die
election.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People are asking themselves, 'Until when do we succumb to
intimidation and brutality?''' he said. ''They realize that if they
don't act this time, they will continue being brutalized and being
ill-treated forever.''

<HEADLINE> Twins 11, Angels 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jacque Jones hit a go-ahead, two-run
homer and Marcus Jensen had five RBIs as the Minnesota Twins beat
Anaheim 11-5 Saturday night, their first win in seven games against
the Angels this season.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota won for only the fourth time in 14 games and ended
Anaheim's three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Milton (7-2), who no-hit the Angels last Sept. 11, improved
to 3-0 against Anaheim by allowing four runs and nine hits in seven
innings. He gave up consecutive homers to Garret Anderson, Troy
Glaus and Scott Spiezio in the second.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second time this season three straight Angels had
homered. Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Anderson did it May 28 at Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' 11th homer off Kent Bottenfield (4-6) gave the Twins a
5-4 lead. Corey Koskie made it 6-4 the next inning with his third
homer. Jensen, 2-for-3 with two walks, broke it open with a two-run
double in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Jensen, whose two-run double keyed a
three-run rally in the second, hit his second double off
left-handed reliever Mike Holtz. Jensen, whose five RBIs doubled
his season total, had been 0-for-18 batting right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Milton, whose hitless streak of 12 2-3 innings against the
Angels ended with Benji Gil's one-out double in the first, also saw
his streak of 21 1-3 straight scoreless innings against the Angels
end in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 3-0 lead in the second on Denny Hocking's RBI
double and Jensen's two-run ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson, Glaus and Spiezio homered in the second,
Anderson's RBI single in the third gave the Angels a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield made his first start in 16 days after being
sidelined with shoulder tendinitis. He threw 92 pitches in five
innings, gave up six runs, seven hits, walked four and struck out
four.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins' last three runs came on RBI singles by Koskie and
Jones and Jensen's RBI grounder in the ninth
</P>
<P>
Notes: Glaus left for a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning,
suffering from lower back spasms. ... Koskie has hit in 11 straight
games, going 15-for-34. ... Spiezio made his second start of the
season at third base. The first was May 4 at Baltimore. ...
Anderson, who has 51 RBIs, joined Mo Vaughn (57), Darin Erstad (54)
and Glaus (51) to give the Angels four players with 50-plus RBIs
before the All-Star break for the first time. ... Gil matched his
career high with three hits.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Griffin, an organist and pianist who played
for the albums of several music stars including Bob Dylan and
Aretha Franklin, died at his home June 14. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was apparently a heart attack, said his wife, Mary
Beth. Griffin also had diabetes and was awaiting a liver transplant
when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin played for thousands of recording sessions and was a
keyboardist on albums by Dylan and Franklin as well as Steely Dan,
Don McLean, the Isley Brothers, the Shirelles and all the albums
that Burt Bacharach and Hal David made with Dionne Warwick. His
piano is also heard in ''Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who was famous for his gospel-charged style, learned to
play by sitting in the first pew of Paradise Baptist Church in
Harlem and watching the hands of the pianist. When the piano player
died, he became her replacement.
</P>
<P>
   He later studied classical music and was an occasional
accompanist at the Apollo Theater, where saxophone player King
Curtis heard him and offered him his first professional tour and
recording dates.
Lewis Arnold Pike:
</P>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Lewis Arnold Pike, a pioneer in
using television as an educational tool, died May 31 of pneumonia.
He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The nutritionist began producing instructional programs for
children in the 1950s. His longest-running and best-known show,
''Viewpoint on Nutrition,'' was created in 1970 and ran until he
retired in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pike was a self-described ''98-pound weakling'' until he was
introduced to Physical Culture, a magazine produced by Bernarr
Macfadden, a weightlifter and food faddist prominent in the 1920s
and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Pike bulked up and eventually would become West Coast editor of
that magazine. He wrote about nutritional and fitness practices of
movie stars like Esther Williams and Red Skelton.
</P>
<P>
   An appearance on the game show ''Truth or Consequences'' led
Pike to study broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   He produced several educational shows in Los Angeles in the
1950s, including ''Playcrafters Club,'' ''Campus Farmers,'' ''How
Does It Work,'' ''Learning,'' ''Who Knows This?'' and ''American
Quiz.''
Robert Blair Ridder:
</P>
<P>
   MENDOTA HEIGHTS, Minn. (AP) -- Robert Blair Ridder, a former
media executive and one of the original owners of the Minnesota
North Stars hockey team, died at his home Saturday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Ridder media family, Ridder was former president
of WCCO Radio and Television in Minneapolis and former manager of
the U.S. Olympic Ice Hockey Team. He managed radio stations in
Minneapolis and Duluth and had a hand in several publications and
groups in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Ridder worked on several newspapers including the Duluth Herald
and News-Tribune, the Grand Forks Herald, and the St. Paul Dispatch
and Pioneer Press. He was assistant secretary and director of
Ridder Publications Inc., and served as vice president and director
of Northwest Publications Inc., the Dispatch Realty Co., the
Aberdeen News Co. and the Grand Forks Herald.
</P>
<P>
   But his true passion was hockey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 and 1956, he managed the U.S. Olympic Ice Hockey Team.
In 1966, Ridder was part of an eight-member syndicate of prominent
Twin Cities men who paid $2 million to start the Minnesota North
Stars, a National Hockey League expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Ridder was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1976
and into the International Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998.

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Gunmen holding Fiji's deposed government hostage released
their four remaining female captives Sunday, including three ministers in the

Palestinian leader has a reasonable expectation that an agreement could be
hammered out with Clinton's hands-on intervention at a summit, a senior U.S.

summit cannot be delayed until the two leaders are nearly in accord, said the

Car Bomb In Spain Injures 4
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GETXO, Spain (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in a wealthy residential zone of
this small Basque town early Sunday, injuring four people, emergency services
said. An anonymous phone caller told the regional newspaper Gara that the Basque
separatist group ETA claimed responsibility for the blast in Getxo, 12 miles
east of Bilbao. Emergency services in the northern Basque region had received a
phone tip that the bomb would go off in 15 minutes on a street in the wealthy
Las Arenas district. Police were able to close off the street and alert
residents before the bomb exploded just after midnight.

   DENVER (AP) -- The Green Party adopted a platform Saturday focusing on
political reform, human rights, the environment and corporate responsibility as
members prepared to nominate consumer advocate Ralph Nader for president. While
delegates to the national convention of the Association of State Green Parties
debated their platform, Nader said his 50-state tour had given him ''the
distinct feeling that America wants a change, a change from the dominance of the
two major political parties.''

<HEADLINE> Deadline pushed back as Con Ed talks continue into morning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Minutes before a midnight strike deadline for
thousands of Consolidated Edison employees, Con Edison and it
largest union agreed to stop the clock and continue negotiations
into Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As of 2:20 a.m., the independent mediator appointed by both
sides, Martin F. Scheinman, announced that ''both sides continue to
make headway on difficult issues,'' according to Steve Mangione, a
spokesman for the 10,000 workers in Local 1-2 of the Utility
Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman announced that both sides had ''made a lot of progress
and that the parties are confident that they can come to a
conclusion, but it's going to take a little more time,'' Mangione
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Mangione said ''There's been a breakthrough in
negotiations and the parties have agreed to stop the clock and
continue negotiating ... The union feels that with this breathrough
they can get to a contract and avert a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for Con Edison, said ''Both parties
have agreed to stop the clock and continue negotiating. Local 1-2
members are currently operating the system with qualified
management and supervisors standing by at appropriate key
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison and its largest union continued negotiating with the
looming possibility of summer strike that would affect an estimated
3.3 million metropolitan customers.
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point was a company proposal over sick time,
although there were differences over job security, pension and
medical benefits issues, Mangione said.
</P>
<P>
   Faber would not discuss specifics in the negotiations, saying
only that ''talks are continuing.'' The utility had a team of
managers and supervisors ready to step in if there was a strike,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The utility has repeatedly said that its customers will not be
affected by any walkout. Con Ed serves 3 million customers in New
York City and another 330,000 in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents 9,000 workers at Con Ed and 1,000 workers
at three other utilities. Mangione predicted that the utility would
have a difficult time maintaining services if there's a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they think people trained overnight can do that, they're
just fooling the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union did reach a tentative two-year deal with another
utility, NRG Energy. They also reached tentative agreements with
Orion Power and Keyspan Energy, which had returned to the
bargaining table after talks broke off twice this week. Terms were
not immediately disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Group Avoids Solomon Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOHNSON HONIMAE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- One of the two battling factions
in the Solomon Islands boycotted cease-fire talks Sunday, foiling
hopes for a quick resolution to the armed standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The talks began on an Australian navy ship moored off the
capital, Honiara, attended by regional premiers from the two
islands at the center of the Solomons' violent ethnic dispute,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaitan rebels, who control the capital, refused to join the
talks, citing recent fighting with Isatabu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomons, a nation of 450,000 people located 1,600 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia, was plunged into a political crisis
on June 5, when Malaita rebels raided a police armory and took
control of Honiara, on the main island of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels briefly held Prime Minister Bartholemew Ulafa'alu at
gunpoint, then pressured him to resign. A meeting of parliament was
scheduled for June 28 to pick a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were angry that over the past 18 months, indigenous
people of Guadalcanal have expelled around 20,000 migrants back to
the nearby island of Malaita. Violence in recent months has killed
as many as 60 people.
</P>
<P>
   An armed rebel group from Guadalcanal, whose people are known as
Isatabus, control most regions outside Honiara. The two sides have
refused to disarm until the new government is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had promised to attend Sunday's talks, but ahead of
their start, spokesmen for the Malaitan rebels announced a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   One spokesman, Andrew Nori, said Saturday that fresh violence in
the past week in an area east of Honiara meant the talks should be
postponed. Another spokesman, Andrew Fuiga, said the Malaitan
fighters now wanted to wait until the new government is installed
before entering cease-fire negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that the talks should only take place when a new
government is in place,'' Fuiga said. ''The new government should
be responsible for facilitating any cease-fire talks.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear of the Isatabu rebels showed up for the talks
Sunday. Francis Saemala, a member of the delegation led by
Malaita's regional premier David Oeta, said Sunday's talks now
aimed to ''pave the way'' for cease-fire talks. While the premiers
hold influence in their regions, they do not control the armed
factions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 10 legislators from the ousted government said they
would boycott Wednesday's parliament meeting to elect a new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said that in a statement that the forced
resignation of Ulafa'alu was illegal, and urged all legislators not
to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did not believe assurances from the Malaitan
rebels that legislators would be allowed to vote free from
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are strongly against any notion that any ethnic group or
illegal militia should hold the rest of the country at ransom,''
they said.

<HEADLINE> Con Edison and union reach tentative agreement, averting strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Four hours after a midnight strike deadline for
thousands of workers, Consolidated Edison and its largest union
reached a tentative agreement on Sunday, averting any work
stoppage, both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would have affected an estimated 3.3 million
metropolitan customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a long and difficult process of collective bargaining,
Local 1-2 is pleased to announce a tentative agreement with Con
Edison,'' said Steve Mangione, a spokesman for workers in Local 1-2
of the Utility Workers of America. The agreement was reached at
about 4 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the deal a ''win-win situation'' for the union's
10,000 utility workers and residential and commercial customers in
New York City and Westchester County because it averted a work
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The union achieved across-the-board improvements and gains,
for example in pension and medical benefits and wages. The contract
contains job security provisions and, most importantly, the union
was able to beat back what became the major stumbling block, which
was reductions in sick time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison spokeswoman Joy Faber said ''We are pleased to have
reached a tentative settlement that is fair to the men and women of
Con Edison who provide such an important service to our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the deal were not immediately disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the 12:01 strike deadline, Con Edison and the
union agreed to stop the clock and continue negotiations into the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both sides were very committed to getting this done. We
realized what was at stake and wanted to be sure consumers
continued to receive safe and reliable service,'' Mangione said.
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point was a company proposal over sick time,
although there were differences over job security, pension and
medical benefits issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Faber would not discuss specifics in the negotiations. The

<HEADLINE> Protesters cry victory over Vieques bomb exercises  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) - Protesters claimed victory after the
U.S. Navy did not begin a planned bombing exercise on Vieques
island - the largest since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong
occupation of the target range.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one more triumph in the fight against the Navy,''
activist Hector Pesquera said at a meeting of about 200 protesters
Saturday near the Navy facility, Camp Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had earlier said it would begin its exercise
''approximately Saturday'' - but by Saturday evening it had failed
to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters invaded the range late Saturday night, but the
Navy said all 41 were arrested by dawn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon would not say when the exercises
would begin. He said the Navy typically gives two hours' notice to
warn area fishermen. But Gordon said this week that the Navy is not
obligated to do so or say exactly when exercises will begin - an
apparent attempt to ward off protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters still have vowed to block the exercises. Inside the
camp, police and military guards could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Carlos Zenon compared the tense situation to a
''psychological war,'' but said the protesters would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared for tonight or whenever it happens,'' Zenon
said. ''If the Navy comes to the range, we are going to interrupt
the exercises - it's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   Five warships plan to fire up to 600 rounds at the range and
aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs - including
500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs - during two to five days of
exercises, according to plans filed by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since the publication last week of the
Navy's plans for the exercise, the biggest since an April 1999
bombing accident killed a civilian on the range. That accident led
to an occupation of the range before federal officials evicted the
protesters last month. Since then, more than 200 demonstrators have
been arrested for trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say five decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, contaminated water supplies, stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has ordered the Navy to use dummy bombs
instead of live munitions and to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if the
island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum expected
next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions again.

<HEADLINE> Teens Being Tested for Cholesterol  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Bennett ''Beano'' Zylber makes no
apologies for his sweet tooth. He likes candy, particularly gummy
bears, and eats with barely a thought of the consequences. And why
not? He's only 14.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beano was at Brookline High School recently, getting his
finger pricked and his cholesterol level tested. It wasn't his
idea, Beano said, crediting his mother, but doctors say it's a good
one. Teens might have youth on their side, but genetics and diet
could be against them when it comes to heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Hemphill, who conducted the privately funded screening
for the Boston Heart Foundation, said a predisposition to heart
disease can be detected early. At-risk young people, she said, are
like the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''You may be ship-shape now, but the iceberg is out there,'' she
said. ''The earlier you make small course adjustments, the better
off you are.''
</P>
<P>
   A genetic tendency toward heart disease can be detected at
birth, in blood taken from umbilical cords, said Dr. Timothy
Bricker, of Texas Children's Hospital and a spokesman for the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies also show that teens are not too young to suffer
the physical effects of dangerously high cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies of American soldiers killed during the Korean and
Vietnam wars showed arterial blockage in veterans as young as 18. A
1997 study of the autopsies of young people showed fatty deposits
in the major arteries of those with high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors think it's not necessary to test teens other than
those with a family history of heart disease. Cholesterol levels
can fluctuate wildly during puberty, which means high or low
results could change with adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker, however, thinks it's important to screen children early
for heart disease -- the nation's No. 1 killer -- and to teach them
''heart healthy'' habits before they reach adolescence. The
problem, he said, is that other teen risks grab the attention of
public health officials.
</P>
<P>
   One teen participating in the recent screening, Tracey Martin,
15, decided to get tested because her family has a history of heart
problems. The screening had her thinking about her diet, something
she said teen girls already hear too much about. But she said the
low-cholesterol diet emphasizes health, not slenderness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's natural for girls to want to be thin and
healthy,'' she said. ''There's nothing wrong with being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the screening were doctor visits for teens found to
be at risk. Early prevention can have huge cost benefits, Hemphill
said. Even teens with genetic leanings toward heart disease can
lower their risk with a good diet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they will is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're immortal,'' Hemphill said, describing the typical teen
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Cooper, 15, admitted he eats whatever he wants, though tries
to avoid eating at McDonald's more than once a day.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he'd be willing to change his habits if he was
convinced they were unhealthy. He rejected the notion that teens
are too high on life to listen to advice on poor eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Teens will listen to adults, he said, ''If they yell at us
enough.''

<HEADLINE> For release Monday, June 26, and thereafter  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Connecticut municipalities are taking pioneering, if
hesitant, steps into the new world of free-market electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Cheshire and West Hartford have signed up to become municipal
aggregators, and Ansonia has signed a first-of-its-kind agreement
with an energy supplier for its municipal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Cheshire and West Hartford said they do not know if
they will do anything with their aggregators' licenses, which allow
them to act as bulk purchasers of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We became an aggregator because there was no cost involved,
and this opens the options for us,'' said Steve Saulis, the
director of plant and facilities services for West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no vendors banging down our doors, saying 'We have
an offer.' I'd like to see one or two,'' Saulis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheshire also pursued the aggregators license as an option, said
Jerry Sitko, the town's economic development coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to draw attention to ourselves that we were willing
to discuss that possibility with providers, to give us some kind of
exposure,'' Sitko said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the town would probably prefer to join with the
Connecticut Conference of Municipalities to get into a bulk-buying
agreement with other towns to provide power to schools and
municipal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 other communities also have expressed an interest in
getting power through CCM, said Andy Merola, who is working on
deregulation issues for the group. The organization has been
shopping around and expects to have a long-term, offer for cheaper
power by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now the markets for energy are pretty high,'' Merola
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ansonia leaders have signed an agreement with Select Energy, an
unregulated, wholly owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, to
provide an energy management service.
</P>
<P>
   The town had spent about $1 million annually on electricity and
natural gas, buying power through more than 30 separate accounts,
said Linda Gentile, director of administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Select Energy will coordinate the accounts.
The company also has secured a better price for natural gas for
Ansonia, saving taxpayers about $25,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders want to expand the program to cover charities and
churches, and to include electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''As pricing on electricity becomes more attractive and more
competitive, we are certainly looking forward to recognizing some
significant savings in that area as well,'' Gentile said.

<HEADLINE> Finger Lakes community cleans up from fly invasion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAPLES, N.Y. (AP) - Their chemical sprays and sticky tapes, even
plain old swatters, have brought the flies that plagued this
community last week down to the level found in a stable.
</P>
<P>
   Now residents are scooping up mounds of dead flies from closets,
tool sheds and porches, scrubbing walls and sweeping floors.
</P>
<P>
   Naples, a town of 2,830 located 40 miles south of Rochester, is
known for its rural charm, vineyards and annual Grape Festival. But
last week it garnered attention from news organizations as far away
as Japan when a health hazard was declared due to an invasion of
flies. The insects apparently emanated from 200 tons of manure
farmer Mark Adam spread on a 20-acre field.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Kaufman, a Cornell University veterinary entomologist,
said this type of ''giant fly explosion'' gets reported only a few
times a summer across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very likely through the worst part,'' he said. ''Once
these adult flies are gone, the problem should be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams maintains his practices were sound, and environmental
leaders in the area confirmed they did nothing to harm the
watershed. But the events have led Adams to investigate a manure
alternative: composting and selling it as dried fertilizer. ''It's
becoming apparent to me that to be community-friendly, we have to
come up with a different way of handling manure,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tough Campaign Coming in Romania  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- The results of this month's local
elections in Romania herald a bitter fight for the leadership of
this troubled country when voters choose a new president and
parliament in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most surveys show President Emil Constantinescu stands little
chance of defeating his expected opponent, former president Ion
Iliescu, in balloting expected to be held concurrently with voting
for a new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been announced. If no presidential candidate wins
more than 50 percent, a runoff will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the June 18 local elections, however, show problems
for both Constantinescu's center-right Democratic Convention and
the left-wing Iliescu, who took power after the 1989 overthrow and
execution of longtime Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   In the local balloting, Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy,
known as PDSR, won 36.71 percent of the votes cast in the mayoral
contests. That put Iliescu's party well ahead of the
government-allied Democratic Party of Foreign Minister Petre Roman,
which finished second with 12.68 percent of the mayoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Iliescu's party also ran a strong race in Bucharest, which is
not one of its strongholds. The party won a majority of city
council seats and captured all six district mayoral posts in the
Bucharest area.
</P>
<P>
   In Bucharest, Iliescu's mayoral candidate, Sorin Oprescu, lost
to the Democratic Party's Traian Basescu -- but only by a little
over one percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be a wake-up call to the governing coalition,''
said one Western diplomat on condition of anonymity. ''PDSR ran
strong in Bucharest, which is not its territory, and it did very
well nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the PDSR's share of mayoral votes -- 36.71 percent -- was
below the 45.57 percent which Iliescu won in 1996 when he lost the
presidency to Constantinescu. Iliescu has in the past run ahead of
the rest of his party.
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts suspect he may not be able to break out
of the 40-49 percent of his core constituency -- rural voters,
disaffected workers laid off from factories and others who have not
profited from the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the presidential race may be whether Constantinescu
can make it into the second round and pick up support from voters
who prefer other candidates, but who fear an Iliescu victory might
impede Romania's integration into the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Constantinescu survives the first round, he would be
facing a monumental task to appeal to voters for a second chance
after presiding over a three-year recession which has seen living
standards steadily decline.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Romanians turned to Constantinescu, rejecting
Iliescu in what was widely seen at the time as severing the links
to the communist past.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many Romanians see Iliescu as the man who can restore the
social safety net and bring back a life which, though not
materially rich in the standards of the West, was stable and
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Public disillusionment with democratic-style politics has sunk
so low that in November, one survey showed Romanians consider
Constantinescu to be the worst leader in Romanian history after
Ceausescu.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,795 Romanians conducted in May by
Metromedia-Transylvania for the Public Opinion Barometer found that
30 percent of the respondents were undecided in their choice for
president. Eleven percent said they would not vote at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who expressed a preference, 51 percent supported
Iliescu and 19 percent Constantinescu. Asked which politician they
trust the most, 51 percent replied they didn't trust any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rest, 44 percent said they trusted Iliescu the most while
14 percent said they had confidence in Constantinescu.

<HEADLINE> Focus on Skakel's tears as probable cause hearing continues  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - As he sits flanked by his defense lawyers
in a small Stamford courtroom, Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel looks
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   He is listening to a man describe how Skakel confessed to
killing Martha Moxley more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And he is crying, tears visible on his cheeks, his face red and
puffy.
</P>
<P>
   Is he crying out of guilt because he committed the crime? Or is
he crying because he is afraid a jury will someday believe this
account from a man he knew for a brief time when they were both
troubled boys attending a rehab center in the woods of Maine?
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's emotionalism during a pretrial hearing last week was
one of the most talked-about aspects of the hearing, which will
determine whether there is enough evidence for Skakel to stand
trial in the murder of Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will also decide whether Skakel, a nephew of Ethel
and the late Robert F. Kennedy, will stand trial as a juvenile or
an adult in the killings. Both he and Moxley, his neighbor in the
posh town of Greenwich, were 15 when Moxley was found bludgeoned
and stabbed to death with a golf club on her family's estate in
October 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's emotion was analyzed by lawyers on both sides, Moxley's
family and the dozens of reporters who covered the hearing. But his
tears, like all of the evidence heard during the hearing, could
have a completely different impact on a jury than on the juvenile
judge who is presiding at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judges aren't usually swayed by emotion. The judge is looking
at the legal aspects of the case, and in a jury situation, there is
a visceral element to their analysis,'' said Eugene Riccio, a
Bridgeport defense attorney who represented Kenneth Littleton, a
tutor who was once considered a suspect in the case but later
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel cried twice during the first two days of the hearing last
week - once when a former classmate at the Elan School described
how he confessed to killing Moxley - and again when another Elan
student claiming to have heard a Skakel confession described
beatings, humiliation and other tactics used during therapy
sessions at Elan.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, said his tears were triggered
by bad memories of Elan and by anger over his former classmates'
claims that he confessed to killing Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not something that was controlled, planned or
premeditated or in any way contrived,'' Sherman said. ''He showed
some emotion. He's a human being. In my mind, that's in the good
column.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's brother, John, saw Skakel's emotion as fear that he
will eventually be convicted in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't tears of joy. I think the reality is starting to
tumble down around him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tieger, a jury consultant who has worked for the defense in
the Jack Kevorkian assisted suicide case and the Richard Crafts
wood-chipper murder case, said if Skakel cries when the case goes
to trial, each juror will probably perceive it in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ''People see what they want to see,'' Tieger said. ''If you're
inclined to want to see that behavior (crying) as evidence of
guilt, then you're going to try to make those pieces fit, and
conversely, if you're inclined to believe he is innocent, you're
going to say , 'See that. He's just upset.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers on both sides of the aisle believe Judge Maureen
Dennis will find ''reasonable cause,'' or enough evidence to hold
Skakel for trial because the threshold for such a finding is
considered low.
</P>
<P>
   But how the witnesses will play to a jury is another question.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the state's key witnesses so far have extensive baggage
that Sherman has already attempted to use to discredit their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   John Higgins, a former Elan student, said Skakel confessed to
him one night 20 years ago during an erratic, sob-filled
conversation. But Higgins admitted he lied to investigators when
they initially questioned him about the alleged confession. He also
admitted he asked about a $50,000 reward mentioned in People
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, another former Elan student, said Skakel told
him he drove Moxley's skull in with a golf club and declared: ''I'm
gonna get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy.'' Coleman went on to
describe his own life - filled with alcoholism, drug addiction, a
criminal record, homelessness, and living under a bridge at times.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer was practically gleeful after grilling the two
men on cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ''How the witnesses played out spoke for itself,'' Sherman said.
''I'm not at all unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers differ on whether jurors will discount their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''They evaluate whatever baggage a witness might have. Merely
because someone has had past problems won't affect the
admissibility, but it may affect the weight given to it by a jury.
They could discount it or believe it,'' said John Kelly, a former
state prosecutor who is now a prominent defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven defense attorney Hugh Keefe said the state could have
problems convicting Skakel if it bases much of its case on the
testimony of Higgins and Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prosecutors get convictions every single day in this state
based on the testimony of people who in other circumstances they
would call dirtbags and liars and convicts,'' Keefe said. ''But if
these two particular people are the most the state has ... (the
defense) has a lot to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he plans to call as many as four other Elan
students on Wednesday, when the hearing resumes. He said he also
may call a psychiatrist who treated Skakel to testify about why he
may have made statements about Moxley's murder to the Elan
students.

<HEADLINE> Liberian V.P. Dies Mysteriously  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Liberia's vice president, Enoch
Dogolea, has died after a short illness and the government has
ordered an autopsy to allay speculation of foul play, state radio
said Sunday. Dogolea was 48.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Dogolea died early Saturday after going into a
coma at a private hospital in Abidjan, the commercial capital of
neighboring Ivory Coast, where he was flown after falling sick last
week.
</P>
<P>
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dogolea
suffered a stroke, although this could not be independently
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The state radio station said warlord-turned-President Charles
Taylor ordered an autopsy in order to refute ''speculation'' the
vice president had been either ''poisoned or beaten to death by
presidential guards.'' Dogolea paid a private visit to Taylor's
farm shortly before his death, some officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor dismissed the rumors of foul play as ''the work of
detractors to tarnish his image and cause national instability,''
the station said.
</P>
<P>
   A group representing University of Liberia students from
Dogolea's home region of Nimba County, meanwhile, called for the
autopsy to be conducted by Ivorian authorities. The group also
accused the government of denying Dogolea access to proper medical
care, but did not give details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our call is prompted by widespread speculation about the cause
of Mr. Dogolea's illness,'' the group said in a statement broadcast
on the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Dogolea, who in the 1980s went into exile as an opposition
campaigner against the rule of former President Samuel Doe, later
joined Taylor's fledgling rebel group which fought a brutal
seven-year civil war against several factions. Relative calm was
restored in 1996 and Taylor won elections a year later.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly all of the war, Dogolea served as Taylor's deputy and
became vice-president immediately after the election. It was not
clear who would replace him.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate funeral arrangements were made and it was not
immediately clear whether the body would be flown back to Liberia.
Church music and messages of condolences from sympathizers were
broadcast on state-run radio and flags were lowered to half-staff.

<HEADLINE> Shore residents breathe easier as Senior Week winds down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - It's an annual rite of passage for New
Jersey high school students that has many shore residents cringing.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Week is winding down, with recent graduates swapping
tales of alcohol-fueled debauchery, and residents waiting for the
last of the underage revelers to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an entire binge week,'' Dustin, a college-bound
graduate of North Penn High School, told The Press of Atlantic City
for Sunday's editions. He didn't give his last name, for obvious
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can barely talk,'' he said. ''Too much beer. Too much
weed.''
</P>
<P>
   One high school graduate told the newspaper of friends having
sex underneath Ocean City's Music Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, police are busier keeping an eye on the young
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not all it's cracked up to be,'' said Detective Scott
Adams, who heads Ocean City's noise and alcohol enforcement unit.
''People don't want to admit that. They came down and it was
supposed to be the time of their life, and they didn't have any
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Police issued about 500 summonses to seniors over the last two
weeks, mostly for noise violations, but also for underage drinking,
fighting and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''They get their beer muscles, so they go out and look to get
into a lot of fights,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, a recent high school graduate, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been down for three days and I almost got into four
fights,'' he said. ''A lot of people talk (trash.)''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two men last week who were walking the beach
wearing nothing but towels, which they let slip whenever a group of
girls walked by.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also confiscated 13 cases of beer from an underage
drinking party at one home, 15 from a blast at another, two kegs at
a third, and countless smaller amounts of illicit alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Adams says it's been worse. Police have confiscated entire
U-Haul trailers full of alcohol in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants have mixed feelings about Senior Week. They like the
extra money the youths bring down with them, but rage against the
thefts that also accompany the influx.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Corso, manager of the Tunes on The Dunes music store, said
vacationing students make up most of his clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Others take a dimmer view.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senior Week is shoplifting week,'' said Larry Friedel, who
owns three surf shops in Ocean City. ''They drink a few beers and
see what they can steal.''

<HEADLINE> Navy: Vieques Exercise To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. Navy exercises will begin
Monday on Vieques Island, an official announcement said, and
protesters vowed to invade the range to stop the largest bombing
exercise planned since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong
occupation of the training ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters invaded the range Saturday night after three
Navy ships appeared on the horizon apparently to take part in the
exercises. But the Navy said all 37 were arrested by dawn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1999 killing of a civilian guard on the range united
Puerto Ricans as never before to demand that the Navy end its
six-decade-long bombing of Vieques, a 21-mile-long island off
Puerto Rico's east coast, and led President Clinton to order the
Navy to fire only inert ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   A notice addressing fishermen and mariners warned exercises
would begin Monday. The notice, posted at the ferry terminal Sunday
morning, announced exercises would run through July 2. It was
accompanied by a map outlining ''areas of danger'' on Monday and
Tuesday between 8 a.m. and midnight. The other days the Navy may be
planning exercises further out at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have vowed to block the exercises, which would drop
an estimated 130,000 pounds of inert bombs and shells on the range
that takes up a third of the island.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, protesters claimed to have stopped the Navy when
the bombing did not begin as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Activist Carlos Zenon compared the tense situation to a
''psychological war,'' but said the protesters would not give up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Navy comes to the range, we are going to interrupt the
exercises -- it's now or never,'' Zenon said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Five warships plan to fire up to 600 rounds at the range and
aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs -- including
500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs -- during two to five days of
exercises, according to plans filed by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since the publication last week of the
Navy's plans for the exercise, the biggest since the April 1999
bombing accident killed a civilian on the range. That accident led
to an occupation of the range before federal officials evicted the
protesters last month. Since then, more than 200 demonstrators have
been arrested for trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say six decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, contaminated water supplies, stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire
before deploying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ordered the Navy to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if
the island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum
expected next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions
again.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Offers Fatima Details  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican delivered a surprise revelation
last month in the so-called third secret of Fatima, saying the
vision foretold the shooting of the pope, and not a doomsday
prophecy. Now the Vatican is offering details.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- one of Pope John Paul II's closest
advisers -- planned on Monday to release a text and commentary at a
Vatican news conference intended to put to rest lingering doubts
about the third secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican broke decades of silence on the secret during the
pope's May 13 visit to the Fatima shrine in Portugal. Many have
speculated about the secret since 1917, when three shepherd
children said the Virgin Mary appeared above an olive tree in
Fatima and told them three prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   The first two were made public, and foretold the end of World
War I and the start of World War II, and the rise and fall of
Soviet communism. But the Vatican kept the third secret under
wraps, adding fuel to speculation that it predicted a doomsday
scenario too terrible to make public.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Angelo Sodano said last month in Fatima that the third
vision spoke of ''a bishop clothed in white'' who, while making his
way amid the corpses of martyrs, ''falls to the ground, apparently
dead, under a burst of gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The description recalls the 1981 assassination attempt against
John Paul, who was wounded by a Turkish gunman in St. Peter's
Square, the Vatican said. That shooting happened on May 13 -- the
same day as the first of the Fatima visions in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's account Monday will reportedly include a
reproduction of the handwritten account by the only survivor of the
children -- Sister Lucia de Jesus dos Santos. Now 93, she has been
cloistered in a Carmelite convent in Portugal since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Sodano said the pope credited the Virgin with saving his life
after the shooting. John Paul has known the third secret for years,
but kept it secret. When it was finally disclosed, Vatican
officials explained simply that the time seemed ripe. But the
disclosure produced its share of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all part of Christian mythology,'' Italian philosopher
Emanuele Severino said. ''If the third secret is limited to the
shooting of the pope, it is pretty disappointing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also have asked why the ''bishop clothed in white'' could
not have been Oscar Romero, the Salvadoran archbishop assassinated
in 1980.

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mike Mohler, who took the loss the previous
night when he gave up a go-ahead, two-run homer in the eighth
inning to Detroit's Bobby Higginson, was designated Sunday for
assignment by the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler made two appearances for the Indians, who until Friday
didn't have a left-hander in their bullpen for two weeks. Mohler
retired the side in order on Friday night, but couldn't get out
Higginson, who hit three homers to help the Tigers overcome a

</P>
<P>
   The Indians purchased the contract of lefty Alan Newman to
replace Mohler. Newman went 4-3 with a 3.66 ERA in 15 games at

   Cleveland has 10 days to release Mohler, trade him or send him

<HEADLINE> Bosnia War Crimes Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO,Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- British peacekeepers arrested
a leading Serb war crimes suspect and flew him to the Netherlands
Sunday to stand trial on charges of massacring Muslim and Croat
prisoners during the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Dusko Sikirica, 36, was indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal
in The Hague in July 1995 for crimes against humanity, war crimes
and other offenses. He was flown Sunday afternoon to the
Netherlands and transferred to the Scheveningen detention facility
in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials said he was expected to appear in court by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO statement said he was arrested early Sunday. A statement
by the British defense ministry confirmed the arrest was carried
out by British soldiers at Sikirica's home in the Bosnian Serb town
Prijedor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian Serb interior ministry said armed men drove in four
vehicles to Sikirica's home, broke down the door, shoved the
suspect to the floor, bound and dragged him away. Sikirica's wife
and two children were in the house at the time, but were not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 indictment said more than 3,000 Bosnian Muslims and
Bosnian Croats were held at a former ceramics factory at Keraterm,
where detainees ''were killed, sexually assaulted, tortured, beaten
and otherwise subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, guards systematically machine-gunned inmates in
one room in July 1992, the indictment said. When guards learned
that a few prisoners had escaped the carnage, 20 detainees were
selected and summarily executed, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal prosecution argued that as camp commander, Sikirica
was responsible for all actions taken by his subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is one of the main figures, responsible for war crimes in
Keraterm,'' said Amor Masovic, head of the Muslim Commission for
Missing Persons. ''Justice is slow but attainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal spokesman Paul Risley said three others charged in
connection with the Keraterm camp were already in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Sikirica is among several leading Bosnian Serbs arrested in
recent months by NATO, which has come under criticism for allowing
indicted suspects to remain free years after Bosnian war ended in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Momir Talic and Radoslav Brdjanin, a former Bosnian Serb
deputy prime minister, were arraigned in The Hague in January. On
April 3, Momcilo Krajisnik, a close ally of Bosnian Serb wartime
leader Radovan Karadzic, was arrested by French NATO troops at his
home in eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Less then two months ago, NATO troops arrested Dragan Nikolic, a
Bosnian Serb charged with war crimes allegedly committed when he
commanded a nearby prison camp at Susica during the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two prime suspects, Karadzic and his military
chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

<HEADLINE> Promoter Sues Michael Jackson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Jackson's longtime promoter
is suing the singer for $21.2 million, saying he backed out of a
plan to perform New Year's Eve concerts on both sides of the
international date line.
</P>
<P>
   German-based promoter Marcel Avram filed suit Friday, claiming
Jackson agreed to four performances, including two Dec. 31 in
Honolulu and Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson performed at the first two concerts, but in October
pulled out of the New Year's Eve shows. When Jackson dropped out,
Avram said, he ''was left to explain Michael Jackson's erratic
behavior -- and to pay all of his bills.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jackson representative could not immediately be reached for
comment.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Controversial radio talk-show host Dr. Laura
Schlessinger says efforts by gays and lesbians to have her upcoming
television show axed has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've cried more at times than I would like to admit,''
Schlessinger told Time magazine. ''It's been agonizing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the issue on newsstands Monday, Schlessinger expounded on her
earlier controversial remarks concerning homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not being able to relate normally to a member of the opposite
sex is some kind of error,'' Schlessinger said in the interview.
''We were biologically meant to give birth to more people.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that despite protests over her
Paramount-syndicated show, she has not been asked to tone down her
approach. The show is scheduled to debut Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hired me because I'm outgoing and direct,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> McCourt Childhood Home Opens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland (AP) -- A replica of the slum house where
writer Frank McCourt endured the miserable childhood recounted in
the Pulitzer Prize-winner ''Angela's Ashes'' has been opened as a
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The squalid house is complete with flaking plaster, overflowing
open drain and puddle on the kitchen floor. The exhibition also has
the sound of running water and children playing to help recreate
the atmosphere
</P>
<P>
   McCourt, who has long lived in the United States, infuriated
many in his Irish hometown by depicting it as being full of cold,
cramped houses in rat-filled streets. Many older residents said the
extent of the poverty was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The place is split down the middle between those that are fans
of 'Angela's Ashes' and those who hate it,'' said John King of
Shannon Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took the attitude that no matter what image it presents,
Limerick can still be a winner. Given the global success of the
book and film it seems the most sensible way to get people to come
here.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Veterans Visit Seoul  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Dozens of Philippine veterans in sky
blue shirts photographed each other. Australian ex-soldiers wore
floppy hats and French veterans sported black berets as South
Korean pop music blared across a Seoul plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The international flavor was part of the legacy of the Korean
War: Hundreds of veterans from 16 nations who fought in the
conflict gathered Sunday at the War Memorial Plaza to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the veterans were teen-agers or in their early 20s when
the war started half a century ago. Many had never heard of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did I know that Korea existed? Negative. Completely
negative,'' said Frank Huber, 76, a veteran from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got wounded, all part of growing up,'' said Bill Hall of
Australia. ''No regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 25, 1950, communist North Korea attacked South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Washington immediately appealed to the United Nations to
intervene, and the U.N. Security Council voted to send armed forces
to repel the attack. The United States and a host of other nations
sent troops under the unified command of U.S. Gen. Douglas
MacArthur. Another five sent medical aid.
</P>
<P>
   The troops from 16 nations -- the United States, Canada, France,
Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, South Africa,
Ethiopia, Turkey, Greece, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Colombia -- fought North Korea and its allies, China
and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 18 years old. And I was scared. Frankly, I didn't know
what I was doing,'' said former U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, 67, of New
York City. ''But when you are a soldier, you do what you are told
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Manert Kennedy, 70, of New York, survived the Chosin Reservoir
battle between American and Chinese troops in 1950. He recalled the
suffering of refugees stuck between North and South Korean military
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were collective moans from refugee groups,'' Kennedy
said. ''I saw the bodies of hundreds of men, women and children who
froze to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Others remembered discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was too hot in summer and too cold in winter. And there
were only pieces of cardboard on the ground to sleep on. People
were so poor and neglected,'' Huber said.
</P>
<P>
   One British veteran sobbed while talking of slain fellow
soldiers, and an American shed tears when a South Korean girl in
traditional clothes put a garland around his neck. But the mood was
largely festive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Korea is my second home. I am glad to see it,'' said Zewdle
Wolde-Kinkoj, 65, of Ethiopia, who was wearing a black military
uniform with several medals on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something no veteran should miss. I am ecstatically
happy,'' Prudencio Regis of the Philippines said, laughing with
joy.
</P>
<P>
   The brutality of the Korean War helped desegregate the U.S.
military. Because of a shortage of soldiers, American commanders in
Korea began integrating their units, which had been divided into
black and white soldiers since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rangel, a Democratic congressman from New York and
veteran of the war, said an order from President Harry Truman that
the military be desegregated did not have much effect.
</P>
<P>
   He said the troops only integrated when ''our severe losses
could not allow the replacements to be the color of those who were
killed.''

<HEADLINE> Baumann Qualifies for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Dieter Baumann, the 1992
Olympic gold medalist at 5,000 meters, met the qualifying standard
for the Sydney Games Sunday, two days after his drug suspension was
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann, who tested positive in October and November for the
performance-enhancing drug nandrolone, ran the 5,000 in 13 minutes,
18.78 seconds, at an international track and field meet.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Baumann, whose case had surprised both the German
track establishment and public, then fell into the arms of his wife
and coach Isabell amid popping flashes and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew what I could do and I did it,'' Baumann said of running
a time fast enough to qualify for the games. ''I've said since
February I will start in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie won the race with a year's best of
13:01.07.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the German federation to lift the suspension was
seen as an indication he will be cleared when the International
Amateur Athletic Federation's legal panel releases its final report
this week. But the IAAF, the sport's world governing body, has
cautioned it might challenge the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our doping commission will look at this, and if they believe
there is no basis to clear the athlete, they can recommend to the
council to refer the case to arbitration,'' IAAF spokesman Giorgio
Reineri said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann has steadfastly denied ever knowingly taking drugs,
claiming he was the victim of a plot in which his toothpaste was
spiked with the drug.

<HEADLINE> Is it ''dot-com'' or ''dotcom''? Now you can look it up  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Everybody not living on a desert island or an
ice floe knows what it is, but until now few knew how to spell it.
To the rescue comes a new edition of the Random House Webster's New
College Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dot-com'' is preferred. Or it can be ''dot.com,'' but not
''dotcom'' or ''.com.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also ''antiglare'' (a type of headlight), ''hospitalist''
(a doctor who treats inpatients), ''nutraceutical'' (natural food
with health supplement), ''sky surfing'' (aerial skateboarding),
''slamming'' (change of long-distance service without customer's
permission, ''zettabyte'' (one sextillion bytes).
</P>
<P>
   These are among the hundreds of words appearing for the first
time among 207,000 definitions in the 1999 edition of the widely
used dictionary. The publisher says the entries, updated daily
on-line, reflect the rapid changes of today's civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we're past Y2K, life is a ''24-7'' whirl. An ''energy
bar'' may suffice for breakfast. On the way to the ''megaplex,''
stop off at the ''clicks-and-mortar'' - store with an on-line site.
If really pressed for time, there's always ''home shopping,'' but
real ''fashionistas'' and ''Gen Y'ers'' may prefer ''e-tailing''
for that ''edgy'' (cutting edge) look.
</P>
<P>
   In the homosexual community, ''gaydar'' (short for gay radar,
one gay person's ability to spot another) is a social advantage;
straight ''party animals'' may just want some ''eye candy''
(attractive person of limited merit) to impress their friends. For
the older folks, the occasional ''senior moment'' (brief lapse or
moment of confusion) is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   As always, some slang phrases should automatically be on the
grammar police's least-wanted list - such as ''dead-cat bounce'' (a
temporary recovery in stock prices after a steep decline) and ''my
bad!'' (slang for ''my mistake'').
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary includes hundreds of words that could be
insulting on the basis of ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual
orientation - along with caveats that Random House says are clearer
than in any rival dictionary. It also directs users to an
''informative and useful essay on 'Avoiding Insensitive and
Offensive Language.'''
</P>
<P>
   The term ''politically correct'' first appeared in the 1991
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, whose long winters have led to such past inventions
as the hockey puck and Trivial Pursuit, have been given special
attention in the dictionary for the first time. Their contributions
range from the useful ''humidex'' (a heat-and-humidity discomfort
index) to the incomprehensible ''saltchuck'' (ocean, body of
saltwater in the Pacific Northwest).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're in Canada, there are other problems. You
could be a ''found-in'' (a person arrested in a brothel or illegal
bar), and sentenced to a diet of ''poutine'' (french fries and
cheese curds topped with gravy).
</P>
<P>
   The new dictionary, out next month, is actually the third annual
update of the 1997 edition, said Wendalyn Nichols, editorial
director for Random House References. New words are chosen from
careful monitoring of the media and general usage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very media-heavy,'' she said. ''We just try to stay on
top of current issues. Slang is the sexiest, but we also keep up
with the latest political leaders,'' such as Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, a new entry.
</P>
<P>
   Random House also has a website, Maven's Word of the Day, which
offers just that - a new word each day. It's
http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell how the latest roster of new words weathers
time, as compared to those of previous years. But it's up against a
very tough ''backstory'' (prior circumstance or event).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, says Random House, the list included apartheid,
atom bomb, baby-sit, barf, bazooka, cheeseburger, gobbledygook. In
the 1950s came aerospace, brainstorming, car wash, do-it-yourself,
meter maid.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s brought area code, biohazard, Brownie point, doofus,
disco, glitch, Op-Ed, sexism. The 1970s featured airhead, bean
counter, deadbeat dad, junk food, gentrify.
</P>
<P>
   Words for the 1980s included AIDS, caller ID, channel surf, dis,
trophy wife, wannabe. The 1990s added anatomically correct, bad
hair day, carjacking, soccer mom, step aerobics and World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to - dot-com.

   TORONTO (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox demoted right-hander Brian
Rose to the minors on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, winless in his last six starts, gave up four runs in just
2 1-3 innings in Saturday's 6-4 loss to Toronto. After the game, he
criticized manager Jimy Williams for yanking him early.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't have anything to say, because anything I say
could get me in trouble,'' said Rose, who was close to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he pitched badly, Rose said: ''I don't know. I wasn't
out there long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, 3-5 with a 6.11 ERA, also was reportedly unhappy about
some changes in his delivery, mandated by pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox replaced him on the roster with outfielder Israel
Alcantara, hitting .295 with 22 homers and 53 RBIs at Triple-A
Pawtucket this season.

<HEADLINE> 1 dead, 1 arrested in rooming house stabbing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - A festering feud between two
residents of a rooming house turned deadly Saturday, leaving one
resident dead and another charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Kenneth MacClean, 67, was found dead on a
second-floor fire escape, his face so badly battered that the
superintendent of the French Street rooming house didn't recognize
him.
</P>
<P>
   He also had been stabbed between 36 and 40 times in the neck and
head, Middlesex County Prosecutor Glenn Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged Richard Cully, 44, who lives several doors down
from MacClean, with murder. Cully was being held in the Middlesex
County Adult Correctional Center in North Brunswick in lieu of
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The building superintendent, George Cottrell, said the victim
and the suspect were both heavy drinkers who had fought before.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kenny was a nice guy,'' he said. ''You know, he drinks, then
he yells, but he apologizes the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman would not discuss a motive for the attack.

   Cruz was with the Tigers twice last season, posting a 2-5 record

<HEADLINE> Russia To Scale Back in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A top Russian commander said Sunday that
Moscow is ready to scale back the war in Chechnya, while Chechen
rebels vowed to press on with their guerrilla campaign against
federal troops.
</P>
<P>
   Despite almost daily rebel attacks, Gen. Gennady Troshev claimed
that the war was essentially finished and that Russia could halt
''large-scale'' air and artillery strikes, Russian news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   However, Troshev did not say when the Russian strikes would be
stopped, and there was no indication that federal forces were
curtailing their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed that the war as such on the territory of Chechnya is
over,'' Gen. Gennady Troshev was quoted as saying after meeting
with Russia's civilian administrator in Chechnya, Mufti Akhmad
Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   Troops will continue ''specialized operations'' against isolated
rebel bands, he said, but added: ''We do not conduct large-scale
artillery and aviation raids because there is no such need.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on NTV television, he agreed with a questioner's
suggestion that ''full-scale'' war was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army needs to take a step back,'' he said. Local police
and pro-Moscow Chechen officials could carry on the fight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for them to work. ... We support them, and if
necessary will conduct broader operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have said repeatedly over the past six months
that the war was all but over -- but then launched new offensives.
While officials lately have been stressing the need to start
rebuilding Chechnya's infrastructure and civilian administration,
the air force and artillery have been pummeling suspected rebel
positions in the south and east of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the number of airstrikes has dwindled over the past
several months from around 100 a day to as few as 30 or 40.
</P>
<P>
   Troshev spoke after Russian artillery and planes bombarded
targets in the southern mountains Sunday, aiming at fighters in the
Argun gorge, a key rebel refuge and supply route, and in the
Nozhai-Yurt, Shali, and Kurchaloi regions in eastern Chechnya,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Aidamir Abalayev, commander of a group of Chechen fighters in
the Nozhai-Yurt region in the southeast, said the rebels were ready
to fight on despite heavy losses from Russia's 9-month campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The heat of war has subsided and we have had to start
guerrilla warfare,'' Abalayev said Saturday. ''But we have
recovered from the heavy blows inflicted on us and we are strong
enough to continue fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter saw several dozen exhausted-looking
for fighters in trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Federal positions came under fire 14 times since Saturday, a
press spokesman told the Interfax news agency on Sunday. Sixteen
people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the attacks, he
said. There was no report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were expelled from Chechnya by independence
fighters in a 1994-96 war, but they returned in September, after
Islamic militants seized villages in the neighboring Russian region
of Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment bombings
the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Administrators unsure about when to test students for drugs  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A teacher reports that a 16-year-old student
smells of marijuana. A vice principal disagrees and decides not to
test him for drugs. Two weeks later, the student dies after using
heroin at a party.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative judge's ruling this week that Wayne Hills High
School vice principal Joseph Graceffo violated a state law by
refusing to drug-test Nicholas Lucatorto has worried other school
administrators, who say they will no longer have any discretion in
deciding when to test students.
</P>
<P>
   They are waiting anxiously for Education Commissioner David
Hespe's final ruling on the decision by Administrative Law Judge
Mumtaz Bari-Brown, and say it could cause principals to test
students for drugs at a higher rate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is sort of a strange decision,'' said Joanne Bartoletti,
executive director of the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors
Association, which helped defend Graceffo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sort of puts a chilling effect on the discretionary role
that an administrator should have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe has 45 days to review Bari-Brown's ruling and reach a
decision on this case, the first in the state to punish an
administrator for failing to test a student for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayne school district suspended Graceffo after the January
1999 incident and went to court to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Graceffo declined to test Lucatorto for drugs after a teacher
approached him and said the 16-year-old smelled of marijuana.
Graceffo and a nurse, however, did not smell marijuana on the
student and the nurse thought he smelled of tobacco, said
Graceffo's attorney, Robert Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Graceffo ''did everything he could that day'' to help Lucatorto,
the boy's mother, Deborah Lucatorto, told The Record of Hackensack.
''I don't feel Nick should have been tested that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bari-Brown ruled that Lucatorto should have been tested, but
said that Graceffo properly used discretion when deciding against
testing a student in 1991. She also ordered that Graceffo return to
his job at the high school with a pay cut after a 120-day
suspension that he has already served.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling was contradictory, Schwartz said, because in
one case the judge said the state law required an automatic
drug-test but in the 1991 case said it did not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either it is automatic or it isn't automatic,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also disagreed over whether the state law, first
passed in the 1970s and amended to include testing for alcohol,
mandates a test.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that
the statutory provision was not intended to be mandatory,''
Bari-Brown wrote. ''Accordingly, whenever a staff member reports a
student whom he/she suspects might be under the influence of drugs,
the administrator must implement the drug test.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Hancock, director of the state Department of Education's
Office of Educational Support Services, says the statute requires a
doctor to determine whether a student is under the influence, but
doesn't specify how.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really is a doctor's call,'' Hancock said. ''There's no
current provisions in statute that talks specifically to drug
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wayne school district adopted its own policy, however, that
requires administrators to drug-test students they suspect are
under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne attorney Stephen Fogarty said that the district's
interpretation of the law is correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other districts in New Jersey are going to be asking Wayne for
a copy of their policy,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bari-Brown's decision did not contradict itself
because the law says that a teacher has to give reasons for the
suspicion that a student has used drugs. In the 1991 case, he said,
Graceffo encountered the student and gave no reasons why the
student should be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Both Graceffo and the Wayne district are appealing various parts
of Bari-Brown's ruling. If Hespe upholds it, Graceffo could be back
in school by the fall and, administrators say, principals won't
hesitate to drug-test students.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this decision holds, you'll probably find that principals
will err on the side of caution,'' said Mike Yaples, a spokesman
for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wouldn't matter if the student is working until midnight at
a part-time job and just seems tired. It wouldn't matter if parents
were upset. I'd think you'd find that principals are just going to
say, 'Our hands our tied.' ''

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Elections in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Ignoring forecasts of intimidation and
violence, Zimbabweans voted peacefully and in strong numbers
Sunday, the final day of the country's most closely contested
parliamentary elections since independence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ruling party of President Robert Mugabe and the
country's main opposition group predicted they would win control of
the parliament when results begin to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overwhelming voter turnout that we've experienced in this
country can only mean one thing -- change,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai,
leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe refused to comment on the election at a news conference
following a mini-summit with Zimbabwe's military allies in the
Congo civil war. But his ruling party has insisted it will continue
to dominate the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   With Zimbabwe's economy in shambles and the government riddled
with corruption, the newly formed MDC poses the most serious
challenge to Mugabe's ruling party since it led the country to
independence from white-minority rule 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''These elections are about real freedom, real freedom from
corrupt, inept, arrogant, egoistic leadership that has been running
this country,'' Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai claimed that if his party does not win a majority of
the elected seats, then the vote will have been rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Even a strong victory, however, may not guarantee the MDC
control of the 150-member parliament. Since 30 members are
appointed by Mugabe, Tsvangirai's party would need to win at least
76 of the 120 contested seats to have a majority. Tsvangirai
predicted it would.
</P>
<P>
   A win that large would be a near revolution in a country where
the ruling party controlled all but three of the seats in the
previous parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At least 2.8 million people, or 55 percent of the 5.1 million
registered voters, had cast their ballots by 2 p.m. Sunday in the
two-day election, Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said. However,
many polling stations had not reported their figures and the final
count was expected to be significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has two years left on his term and will not step down
unless the opposition gains a two-thirds majority in parliament and
then changes the constitution to remove him, said John Nkomo,
chairman of the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union
Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
   That overwhelming total, 101 of the 120 contested seats, is
considered to be well beyond the MDC's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The election campaign was marred by months of political
violence, much of it instigated by ruling party militants, leaving
more than 30 people dead. Human rights activists and opposition
officials accused Mugabe's party of using the violence to scare
opposition supporters away from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactic did not seem to work on the country's 5.1 million
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of voting Saturday, lines of hundreds of voters
snaked around some of the country's 4,000 polling stations. Amid
scattered reports of intimidation and voting irregularities, voter
turnout continued to be strong Sunday, though the state elections
directorate said the lines were much shorter and many polling
booths had no lines at all.
</P>
<P>
   Most polling stations closed as scheduled at 7 p.m.; however,
voters still in line would be allowed to vote, said Mariyawanda
Nzuwah head of the elections directorate.
</P>
<P>
   In Goromozi, 12 miles east of the capital, Harare, about a dozen
voters lined up late Sunday morning outside a courthouse to vote
beneath the gaze of a cracked photo of Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are now feeling that it's high time we have a change.
Twenty years is too long for a government to run a country,'' said
Graciano Jeremiah, 29, who works in video production.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters refused to talk with reporters, saying only that
their vote was secret.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition MDC staged a last-minute information campaign
intended to dispel rumors the ruling party had installed cameras in
the voting booths and would exact retribution against opposition
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of violence, however, did depress voter turnout in some
districts, Tsvangirai said, adding that his party would ask to have
those results nullified.
</P>
<P>
   Nzuwah, the head of the elections directorate, denied reports of
violence or unruly behavior.

<HEADLINE> Starry nights: Six-star chef takes prices to new heights in New York </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Alain Ducasse isn't just any star coming to New
York. He's six stars, the only chef in the world with that many,
and he's crossed the Atlantic with Europe's most acclaimed cuisine
- and record-setting prices.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, 65 diners a night will fill the restaurant
Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, off glitzy Central Park South,
paying $160 apiece to feast on his foie gras, savor his sweetbreads
and chew on his Camembert.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in wine, water, coffee, tax and tip, and the tab rises to
$250 a person and up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been crowned the greatest chef of his time,'' said
Daniel Boulud, whose Daniel has sometimes been called New York's
top restaurant. ''Alain is beyond the visionary, the mastermind of
his cuisine. It's his style, his service.''
</P>
<P>
   Never ones to trifle about their truffles, New York's foodies
have been phoning, faxing, e-mailing and begging for reservations
since the March 10 announcement. There have been 2,700 requests, a
backlog of about 8&AMP;frac12; months, even before the first ''delicate jelly
of frogs' legs, poultry pinions and vegetable pearls'' has reached
a diner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quality has a price,'' Ducasse said last week, the morning
after the first of five ''pre-opening'' nights. ''The important
factor is the best quality for the best price. But first of all is
the quality, and obviously you have to apply the price to the
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse, 43, is known to scream to achieve his vision, or to get
so mad he won't talk at all. Every glass and plate is measured for
perfection when it arrives. He sent back wine glasses when he
discovered they were slightly thicker than the others in the lot -
they were made by the craftsman's assistant, not the craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   He scribbles on yellow post-it notes everywhere he goes,
checking in with each restaurant at least twice a day. He talks
about constantly needing to ''evolve,'' both himself and the
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a staff of 55 to coddle each chosen 65 - one sitting
per evening, Monday to Friday only, with lunch served Wednesday and
Thursday. There are no reservation times: The table is yours
whenever you show up.
</P>
<P>
   Women have stools on which to rest their handbags (with drawers
for men to hide diamond rings or other gifts). Christian Le Page
china is hand made in France, silverware created by Beard and
Emmanuel Barge, the pens to sign checks by Cartier, Tiffany, Mont
Blanc, Gucci and Carandache.
</P>
<P>
   Water pitchers are by Baccarat, Saint Louis and Bohemia, artwork
by Arman, sculptures in the fuchsia-and-gold dining room by
Jean-Michel Folon. Each time you sip water or wine, a hand reaches
around and makes sure the glasses of all at the table are level.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Michelin says yes, making his Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo and
Alain Ducasse in Paris two of only 22 restaurants in France and
Monaco to merit three stars - ''exceptional cuisine worth a
journey.'' He is the only chef in the 100-year history of the guide
to operate a pair of three-star restaurants simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, five restaurants get The New York Times' top
rating, four stars: Bouley Bakery, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Le
Cirque 2000 and Lespinasse. The city has thousands of restaurants -
and enough food fetishists to support an off-Broadway show, ''Fully
Committed,'' about a restaurant too hot for people to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is the ultimate, any way you put it. It used to be
France, but it's no longer,'' said Lidia Bastianich, the owner of
Felidia in New York and co-owner of Lidia's restaurant in Kansas
City, Mo. ''I think he might receive criticism he's not used to,
but that's part of what the New York scene is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse was born in Castelsarrazin in Landes, southwestern
France. He started working in restaurants when he was 16 and
trained under Michel Guerard, Roger Verge and Alain Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Ducasse earned two stars at La Terrasse at
Juan-les-Pins, and three years later he was hired by Le Louis XV.
In 1990, at age 33, he became the youngest chef to win three stars,
earning them for a menu based primarily on olive oil and
Mediterranean vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, he took over the restaurant Joel Robuchon ran at
Paris' Hotel Le Parc, renamed it after himself, presented more
traditional, butter-based fare and seven months later earned three
stars there.
</P>
<P>
   While Le Louis XV lost a star in 1997, Michelin restored it the
following year, and both 50-seat restaurants have maintained their
lofty ratings ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He commutes back and forth between Paris and Monte Carlo; is a
consultant to the one-star Bar &AMP; Boeuf in Monte Carlo and to the
Spoon chain in London, Tokyo, Mauritius and Paris; and also owns
two inns in Provence and a cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   He even drops into McDonald's and Burger King on occasion,
saying he eats ''everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse likes the image he's created: whirling dervish. Where he
met his girlfriend of five years, Gwenaelle Guegnon, isn't much of
a surprise: an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't fall into habits,'' he said, ''because habits are
usually bad habits.''
</P>
<P>
   While chefs such as Lutece's Andre Soltner inspected every
single plate that left their kitchens, Ducasse has transformed the
job of a top chef from a cook to a teacher-manager.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Elena, who has worked with him for 12 years, is the
on-site chef de cuisine in New York. Franck Cerutti runs the
kitchen in Monte Carlo and Jean-Francois Piege in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps our talent is getting people together who can run this
machine, this Swiss watch,'' Ducasse said, speaking in French as an
assistant translated. ''Each person has a very important role, from
the person who answers the telephone, to the maitre d'hotel, to the
person who cleans the knives and forks.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Musician Gets Political  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Thomas Mapfumo is a hero of
Zimbabwe's liberation struggle, a popular singer whose music called
people to fight against white rule and later, after independence,
to support the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two decades as President Robert Mugabe's balladeer,
Mapfumo has found a new target to protest -- the government he
helped take power.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after Mugabe led this former British colony to
independence, the government is riddled with corruption and the
economy is in tatters. A huge chunk of Zimbabweans have no jobs and
no hopes of finding any. The lucky ones who do find work watch
helplessly as inflation nearing 70 percent destroys the value of
their meager earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread anger at these crises has left Mugabe's party
struggling to win the country's most competitive parliamentary
elections, which ended Sunday. The first results were to be
announced Monday, and both Mugabe's party and the opposition were
claiming victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country is falling into pieces,'' declares Mapfumo's new
song, ''Mamvemve.''
</P>
<P>
   Mapfumo, 53, says he is simply continuing his lifelong struggle
for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm singing about the problems that the people of this country
are facing,'' he said. ''I always stand for the poor people who
cannot speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of Zimbabwe's biggest stars, Mapfumo remains wildly
popular with fans, who call him a ''political adviser,'' but he
seems to have fallen out of favor with the government. State-run
radio stations, the only kind of radio Zimbabwe has, will not play
his critical songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The present government doesn't like this type of music because
it is educating the people about the situation here,'' said
Mapfumo's brother, William.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Mapfumo sang a very different song.
</P>
<P>
   His Chimurenga, or revolutionary, music gave powerful support to
the bush war that led to independence in 1980. One of his hits --
''Tumira Vana Kuhondo,'' or ''Sending Children to War'' in the
native Shona language -- helped recruit fighters to join the
struggle, said Fred Zindi, an expert on Zimbabwean revolutionary
music at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   After independence, Mugabe used to invite Mapfumo to play at
ruling party rallies and independence celebrations. And lately, the
government's efforts to silence Mapfumo's new Chimurenga music has
only made the songs more popular, Zindi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He sings our feelings. We need change,'' said Tendai Zindoga,
a 26-year-old fan.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent concert in front of hundreds of fans in Chitungwiza,
a poor town 20 miles south of Harare, the crowd cheered as Mapfumo
started his rhythmical hit ''Disaster,'' which criticizes
corruption and warns that ''There is a big disaster in our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so happy about this song. So many dollars are being
wasted ... while the country is crying for foreign currency,'' said
Richard Machago, a 26-year-old banker at the show.
</P>
<P>
   It is this response that had the government worried as the
parliamentary election approached, Zindi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know the influence of music, and they don't want anything
to distract their voters,'' he said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent political violence targeted at opposition
supporters, Mapfumo does not fear performing in public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a fighter,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands 6, Yugoslavia 1  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- In the greatest individual scoring
display in European Championship history, Patrick Kluivert had four
goals Sunday in the Netherlands' 6-1 quarterfinal rout of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was incredible and no one could ever have thought this,''
Kluivert said. ''We were the masters of this match.''
</P>
<P>
   The overpowering show of force -- the most goals by a team in
tournament history -- sent the Netherlands into a semifinal showdown
with Italy in Amsterdam on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since 1984 that a team scored at least
five goals in a European Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert became the tournament's top scorer with six goals,
surpassing Yugoslavia's Savo Milosevic. Milosevic scored his
country's lone goal in injury time to give him five for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before a mass of singing and dancing fans bedecked in orange,
the Dutch took a 2-0 lead at the half on goals by Kluivert in the
24th and 38th minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His other goals came in the 51st and 54th minutes before coach
Frank Rijkaard removed him in the 60th minute. The Dutch continued
the punishment, with goals from Marc Overmars in the 78th and 90th
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a score like that, you have to be able to let others play
too,'' Kluivert said. ''I don't care if I'm top scorer, as long as
I get to the final.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs were missing two players because of suspensions --
Slavisa Jokanovic and Mateja Kezman.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other quarterfinal, World Cup champion France played
Spain in Bruges, Belgium, with the winner to face Portugal next on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Italy will be without star midfielder Antonio Conte when it
plays the Netherlands. He was kicked in the right ankle, resulting
in torn ligaments, during the 2-0 quarterfinal win over Romania. He
will miss the rest of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's other concern is captain Paolo Maldini, who is
questionable with a strained thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has won all four of its games behind the excellent play
of Figo. He was dangerous the entire way in the 2-0 victory over
Turkey on Saturday and might be the top player of Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese clearly face a more demanding opponent in the
semifinal at Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portugal is playing a great tournament, but we still have room
for improvement,'' Figo said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Works on Mideast Peace  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
needs to narrow differences between Israel and the Palestinians on
another Israeli pullback on the West Bank before she can arrange a
July summit mediated by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As Albright prepares to fly to Israel on Tuesday, the
Palestinians are eager to take over another chunk of the land on
which they plan to build a state. Israel, with backing from the
United States, has managed a delay until it has a better idea what
the Palestinians will settle for in an overall settlement of their
half-century conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback, the third in a series under the Oslo accords, was
due last Friday. Israel has not said how much territory it will
relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's diplomatic skills will be tested as she looks for a
compromise in talks with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasser
Arafat. Her aim is to narrow their differences on other key issues
enough to issue summit invitations -- and to assure Arafat there
will be another Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Albright's assessment is that the gap between
Israel and the Palestinians is too wide for a Camp David-style
summit, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   But she would not require as a condition for calling the summit
virtual agreement on the future of Jerusalem, a Palestinian state
and other knotty issues, said the official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aim is to call a summit with some reasonable
expectation of success, and with Clinton prepared to mediate to
close a deal. It is his top foreign policy priority, with less than
seven months left in office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, President Jimmy Carter brought the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and the late Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin to his retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains and shuttled
relentlessly between their cabins, working out a land-for-peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's judgment is that Israel and the Palestinians are
further apart today than Israel and Egypt were 22 years ago, and
that the current situation is far more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Carter's summit, he still had to go to Israel and
Egypt to keep the settlement from breaking down. In 1979, the
treaty was signed in Washington, the first between Israel and an
Arab state.
</P>
<P>
   Sadat insisted on recovering all the land Egypt lost in the 1967
war with Israel and got every inch in exchange for peace terms.
Arafat may have to settle for less.
</P>
<P>
   Albright needs assurances from both Barak and Arafat that they
are ready to make the ''hard decisions'' necessary for a compromise
accord, the U.S. official said. Arafat, particularly, has not yet
accepted the notion that neither side can get 100 percent of what
it wants.
</P>
<P>
   Now in control of about 40 percent of the West Bank and Gaza,
Arafat is demanding virtually all the territory as well as East
Jerusalem, where he would set up his capital. Barak has signaled he
is prepared to yield more of the West Bank and some suburbs of
Jerusalem, while accepting a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap between them remains wide. Also, the issue of
Palestinian refugees demanding at least compensation on the grounds
they were uprooted by the establishment of a Jewish state in 1948
remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Also uncertain is the future of Israeli Jews who live on the
West Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been telling Arafat that with
U.S. help he has a chance to reach some of his goals, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's senior Mideast mediator, Dennis B. Ross, has preceded
her to the region for talks with the two sides. The goal is a
settlement by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was in Poland for a three-day conference of democratic
nations that she helped organize.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Kids Win in Japan  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The 26-year-old daughter of late Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi won her father's seat in parliament in Sunday's
general election for Japan's lower house.
</P>
<P>
   Her victory was only fitting -- the elder Obuchi himself won
political office at age 26, filling a parliament seat left open by
his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory by Yuko Obuchi, and wins by the children of
other recently deceased ruling party heavyweights, demonstrated the
enduring mystique of political dynasties among Japan's electorate.
The country has a long tradition of voting for relatives of
politicians to fill parliamentary seats left vacant by retirement
or death.
</P>
<P>
   Yuko Obuchi had been expected to easily win her father's seat in
Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, ever since she announced she was
in the running shortly after her father died. And she did, cruising
to victory over three rivals, including former Socialist Party
secretary general Tsuruo Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   She dedicated her victory to her father, whose birthday fell on
the day of the election. The elder Obuchi suffered a stroke in
April, was replaced by protege Yoshiro Mori and died on May 14 at
age 62.
</P>
<P>
   ''This victory is the best birthday present for my father,''
Obuchi told supporters in her victory speech. ''I will strive hard
every day to become a full-fledged politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Wataru Takeshita, the younger brother of late
Premier Noboru Takeshita, who died days before the election, won in
an electoral district in western Japan. And Hiroshi Kajiyama, the
son of former Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, who died this
month, clinched a seat in Japan's eastern Ibaraki Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   They added to the nearly one-third of legislators in the more
powerful lower house of parliament who were born into political
families.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Takeshita, a longtime kingmaker in Japanese politics,
was known as an architect of the special interest politics that has
helped keep the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in power for most
of the years since 1955. His younger brother quickly made an
election victory pledge to bring home pork-barrel projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to continue my brother's struggle to build up our
home country,'' said the 53-year-old Takeshita.
</P>
<P>
   But he also vowed a break from the ruling party's
behind-the-scenes decision-making, of which his brother had been
the LDP's master practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to move away from managed politics to more
dialogue with and emphasis on persuading the people,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Me, Myself &AMP; Irene' Tops Weekend  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two Jim Carreys for the price of one proved
irresistible for movie-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' starring Carrey as a cop whose dual
personalities fall for the same woman, debuted as the top weekend
film with $24.2 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chicken Run,'' featuring the voice of Mel Gibson in an
animated adventure of hens on the lam from their poultry farm,
opened in second place with $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   With no other new movies in wide release, the overall box office
slumped for the third straight weekend compared to last year. The
top 12 movies grossed $101.4 million, down 20 percent from the same
weekend a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Studios expect things to heat up next weekend and into the
Fourth of July as three big movies debut. Gibson's Revolutionary
War flick ''The Patriot'' opens Wednesday, followed by George
Clooney in ''The Perfect Storm'' and Robert De Niro in ''The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The box office hasn't had a stellar blockbuster release in the
past few weeks, but the stage is set for a really big weekend this
coming week,'' said Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source, which tracks
movie ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' marked Carrey's return to gross-out
comedy as he reunited with ''Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' creators Peter and
Bobby Farrelly. Carrey plays a mild-mannered Rhode Island policeman
whose obnoxious alter-ego gets loose while escorting a suspect
(Renee Zellweger) to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reuniting Carrey and the Farrelly brothers ''is the closest
thing to a sure thing you can get,'' said Tom Sherak, head of
distribution for 20th Century Fox, which released ''Me, Myself &AMP;
Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody said comedy is king, and they're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in 3,020 theaters, ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' averaged a
healthy $8,013 per cinema, compared with ''Chicken Run's'' average
of $7,025 in 2,491 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chicken Run'' was the first film produced under a long-term
deal between DreamWorks and British clay-animation studio Aardman,
which created the Oscar-winning ''Wallace &AMP; Gromit'' shorts. The
voice cast also includes Miranda Richardson, Julia Sawalha and Jane
Horrocks.
</P>
<P>
   It was DreamWorks' best opening ever for an animated film,
edging the $17.2 million taken in by ''Antz'' over its first
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With $8 million over the weekend, ''Mission: Impossible 2''
pushed its total to $189.3 million. The movie last week surpassed
the $181 million domestic gross of the first ''Mission:
Impossible'' and is poised to become this year's first $200 million
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' $24.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Chicken Run,'' $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Shaft,'' $13.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Big Momma's House,'' $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Gladiator,'' $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Titan A.E.,'' $3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Dinosaur,'' $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Boys and Girls,'' $3.1 million.

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Doron Sheffer, who played for Connecticut in
the 1990s and was drafted by the NBA, retired from basketball
Sunday because he no longer enjoys the game.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old player had two more years remaining on his
contract with his Israeli club team, Maccabi Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be much sadder if I were to continue,'' Sheffer said
at a news conference. ''Feeling as I do ... I would be lying to the
fans first of all, and also lying to Maccabi and above all lying to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer played for UConn from 1993-1996 and was drafted 36th in
the NBA draft in 1996. He did not say what work he now intends to
pursue.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Reaches S. Africa  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A stretch of Cape Town's
previously pristine coastline was coated in thick black sludge
Sunday from a sunken tanker that has also brought the city's
shipping to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama-registered Treasure, carrying 1,300 tons of fuel oil,
sank Friday just six miles offshore. Since then the oil has made
its way steadily toward the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   A huge cleanup operation was underway Sunday, with workers
loading oil-coated kelp into trucks and vacuuming up pools of
sludge.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,200 penguins have been collected from the Robben Island
nature reserve, and taken by boat or helicopter to be cleaned on
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   At a center run by the Southern African National Foundation for
the Conservation of Coastal Birds, dozens of volunteers in plastic
overalls cleaned the oil from the wriggling birds.
</P>
<P>
   The spill could affect up to 10,000 penguins, since it was the
animal's breeding season and some 6,000 chicks on the island were
at risk, said the foundation's chairman Paul Briton. About 150,000
penguins live off South Africa's coast, 19,000 of which are on the
island, previously used by the apartheid government to detain
political prisoners, including former President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Air surveys revealed heavy oil collecting at the mouth of the
Cape Town's harbor. Booms prevented the oil from entering, but also
blocked ships from coming or going.
</P>
<P>
   The oil reached a stretch of coastline on the southern side of
Cape Town. However, the slick has not hit the most popular beaches,
though they were still considered to be under threat.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the tanker's oil is believed to be contained in its
fuel tanks, and plans were underway to pump it into another vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old ship sank after developing a 17-by-10-yard hole
in its hull, which had either rusted or cracked from age or stress.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was too large to be towed to the harbor for repairs,
and authorities ordered it moved further offshore to reduce the
risk of oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But after two hours under tow in heavy seas, the towrope ripped
loose, and the ship drifted eastward and sank. All 29 crew members
were airlifted to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasure was heading from China to Brazil with a load of
iron ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Weekend Argus newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying the
ship was owned by Universal Pearls -- the same Chinese shipping
company that owned the Apollo Sea, which sank off Cape Town's coast
in 1994 and caused extensive environmental damage.

<HEADLINE> Polish City Honors Albright  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   GDANSK, Poland (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
honored Poland as an ''author of the new Europe'' Sunday during a
very personal visit to the famed shipyard city where 20 years ago
she witnessed liberty's first stirrings against a totalitarian
system.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony to receive an honorary doctorate from the
University of Gdansk, Albright recalled ''how deeply moved I was by
the bravery of the Polish people'' during a 1981 stay in Poland to
study how the media was contributing to the fledgling
anti-communist Solidarity movement.
</P>
<P>
   The trip fueled Albright's vision of democracy's role securing
human rights and her admiration of Poles' courageous struggle. It
also marked the start of a friendship with a young Solidarity
activist, Bronislaw Geremek, who is now Poland's foreign minister
and one of the academics who reviewed Albright's achievements for
the honorary title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to become a Pole, because I was so excited by what
was happening,'' she told the university audience. ''I really do
want to recognize and commend those incredible days when the Poles
were so brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Poles claim the Prague-born Albright as a fellow Slav, and two
university officials emphasized her role in helping address and
overcome anti-Slavic stereotypes that enabled Poland's full
acceptance in a reunited Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''In world policy, she granted Poland the place we believe
Poland deserves,'' said Geremek, the Polish foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's three-day visit to Poland is dedicated to promoting
democracy. Her trip continues in Warsaw on Monday and Tuesday with
a conference of more than 100 countries aimed at creating a world
community of democratic nations with a single set of shared values.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's troubled history couldn't provide a more apt backdrop.
Poland adopted the second democratic constitution in the world,
modeled on America's, in 1791, but then was partitioned just four
years later and disappeared from the map for more than a century.
Poland's reemergence as a democratic state in 1918 lasted only
until the Nazi invasion in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the Solidarity trade union toppled communism in 1989
did Poland again adopt a democratic constitution, its third.
</P>
<P>
   ''History has taught us that the struggle for liberty is
never-ending, because threats to liberty will never disappear,''
Albright said. ''Democracy is not the answer to every human
problem. But it is the best system of government humans have
devised.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's Gdansk itinerary followed Poland's transition from
communism to democracy, starting with a wreath-laying ceremony at
the Solidarity Monument, three towering steel crosses topped with
anchors, outside the Gdansk shipyard gates where militia shot and
killed workers in 1970 to quell a protest against rising food
prices.
</P>
<P>
   She ended the day at the nearby port of Gdynia, where the prime
minister's wife christened a former U.S. frigate given to the new
NATO ally by the United States under the under the name Gen.
Kazimierz Pulaski, for the Polish patriot who died fighting in the
American revolution.
</P>
<P>
   She met on board with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, head of the
Solidarity-led government in Warsaw that has fallen on hard times
since its coalition partner dropped out of government earlier this
month to protest Solidarity's failure to win necessary support for
controversial reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Buzek later told reporters that he assured Albright that
Poland's foreign policy remained stable and the minority government
would continue a reform course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government crisis had a personal price for Albright's
old pal, Geremek, who delayed stepping down with other Freedom
Union ministers until after the democracy conference that he and
Albright planned together.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Sentences Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Egyptian court convicted four parliament
members Sunday in a multimillion-dollar corruption scandal, giving
them up to 10 years in a hard-labor prison in the first case of its
kind to go after politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Cairo found a total of 31 people guilty, and handed
out prison sentences of one to 15 years -- which can be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers among the accused were blamed for providing clients --
including legislators -- with loans without proper guarantees. In
1994-95, $370 million poured out of the five banks in question, of
which only $115.6 million was paid back.
</P>
<P>
   Four defendants were tried in absentia after fleeing the
country. One died during the trial. Of the lawmakers convicted,
three received 10 years in prison, and one received one year.
</P>
<P>
   The defense called the verdicts unfair, saying they did not
distinguish between defendants who paid back loans and those who
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Legislator Tawfiq Abdou Ismail, who was chairman of the board at
Daqahliya Bank, was among those sentenced 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The verdict is unjust,'' Ismail told The Associated Press from
behind bars in the courtroom. ''Regrettably the court tried us on
harming (of public property) charges, and there was no harming. The
prosecution was not able to prove it, and the court could not prove
it either.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail said the banks had made too much profit because of ''our
administration and our work.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ismail was arrested in July 1999, it was the first time an
Egyptian legislator had been detained on corruption charges. Within
weeks, two other parliamentarians -- Khaled Mahmoud and Mahmoud
Azzam -- were detained. The fourth, Ibrahim Aglan, fled the country
and was tried in absentia. Aglan received the one-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, political corruption cases rarely progressed far.
Members of the 455-seat People's Assembly read immunity rules
broadly, usually blocking prosecutors from even questioning, let
alone charging, a member.
</P>
<P>
   This time, with public sentiment running high and elections
approaching, leaders may have been reluctant to stand in the way.
Ismail and the others were stripped of their parliamentary immunity
more than a year after being named by prosecutors. They have yet to
lose their seats; elections are scheduled later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Others convicted Sunday included board members from five private
banks -- Daqahliya, el-Nil, Suez Canal, al-Mohandes and Islamic
Faisal.
</P>
<P>
   Amid tight security, the men were brought into the court room
wearing white jail uniforms. As Judge Nasr-Eddine Sadeq read the
verdicts, relatives burst into tears, and some of the defendants
shouted out that they had been treated unfairly in the trial, which
began in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Tatis Close To Rejoining Cardinals  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Third baseman Fernando Tatis, on the disabled
list since April 29 with a torn groin, is closer to rejoining the
St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis will begin a four-day rehab stint with Memphis on Monday,
and will reclaim his job on Friday if all goes well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good news,'' Tatis said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had considered activating Tatis without a rehab,
but he experienced some soreness after hitting under simulated game
conditions twice last week. The biggest reason they didn't activate
him Monday is the Cardinals play a three-game series at Cincinnati
on artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing him on turf just doesn't make sense,'' general manager
Walt Jocketty said. ''He hasn't faced live pitching in two months,
so it's kind of tough to come right back. We've got to kind of ease
him into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis is hitting .375, and he was leading the NL with 28 RBIs
when he was injured on a fielding play.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, short on pitchers for their series finale against
the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday, called up right-hander John
Ambrose from Double-A Arkansas and optioned right-hander Gene
Stechschulte to Triple-A Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The regulars also were a bit worn out, with Mark McGwire getting
a day off. McGwire has homered in five of his last seven games, and
hit No. 550 of his career on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds played first base instead of McGwire on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stechschulte had been with the team only two days, getting the
victory in relief on Friday after replacing the injured Jesse
Orosco. He worked a scoreless inning on Saturday and was sent down
because he was unavailable to pitch on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are several guys unable to pitch or play today,''
manager Tony La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ambrose callup was for one day only. On Monday, the
Cardinals plan to bring up right-hander Mark Thompson, who has been
starting at Memphis and last pitched on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, 25, began the year at Triple-A and was demoted to
Arkansas due to control problems after going 1-1 with a 5.52 ERA in
10 games. He has been the closer at Arkansas, with three saves and
a 2.42 ERA in 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''At Triple-A I had no clue where the ball was going,'' Ambrose
said. ''When I went back to Double-A, I started throwing strikes
and found out that was the key to pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also placed utility player Eduardo Perez on the
disabled list with an injured hamstring. Perez was hurt the day he
was called up, running the bases on a double Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a bummer,'' La Russa said. ''We had some playing time
set up for him, so it's a tough break.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis recalled utility player Larry Sutton, who had been
demoted on Saturday. Jocketty tracked down Sutton, who was batting
.263 in 19 at-bats, before he could leave town.

   A storm system developing over the northerain Plains produced
widespread showers and thunderstorms in the Dakotas, Minnesota,
Nebraska and Iowa. A few light showers also trailed westward into
Montana and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest storms affected northeasterain Nebraska,

</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a separate cluster of thunderstorms poured heavy

</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service radar indicated 4 to 5 inches fell
during the night and moraining in some areas of Oklahoma, and minor
flooding was reported in Kingfisher County.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front pushing across the easterain states kicked off
scattered showers and thunderstorms along the Appalachians from New

</P>
<P>
   During the afterainoon, showers also spread across parts of
Florida and coastal sections of Georgia and the Carolinas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New York lake becomes battleground for weevil versus weed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALTA, N.Y. (AP) - It's time to move out the little troops to
tackle a tenacious water weed that can clog boating paths and ruin
swimming areas.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny weevils that drill into and kill unwanted milfoil will be
introduced into Saratoga Lake this summer as part of a
federally-funded study.
</P>
<P>
   Similar experiments have taken place in Vermont, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Illinois. This will be the first large-scale effort
in New York, said Steven A. LaMere, a lake manager from Crown
Point-based Adirondack Ecologists.
</P>
<P>
   The little beetle-like bugs won't actually destroy Eurasian
milfoil. The hope, said LaMere, is that the weevil's larvae will
burrow into the buoyant upper stem, destroying the plant's tissue
and causing it to sink to the bottom of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a two-year project but it will take four to five years at
a minimum to tell with surety what the weevils will accomplish,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the little weevils - 2 millimeters long, or smaller than
a black fly - will cost $1. A total of 20,000 weevils will be
introduced on the western side of the lake off the town of Malta.
</P>
<P>
   Buoys will be used to keep the weed beds where the weevils will
be ''working'' roped off from use on the 5-mile-long recreational
lake. ''Do not Disturb ... Weevils at Work'' signs will mark the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The weevil species being introduced - Eurhychiopsis lecontei -
is native to North America and is commonly known as the milfoil
weevil.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the herbicide SONAR is also being used
experimentally on 100-acre sites on each end of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Like many inland lakes, Saratoga Lake caretakers used floating
harvesters since the mid-1980s to control the weeds. Over the past
two years, it was clear that method did not keep up with weed
growth.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Picasso Found in Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police in the western city of Izmir said
Sunday they recovered a second painting believed to be a stolen
Picasso -- this time a portrait of the painter's mistress, Dora
Maar.
</P>
<P>
   Izmir police chief Hasan Yucesan said they had information that
other paintings by Pablo Picasso had been smuggled into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover officers arrested two people Saturday after they
tried to sell them the 1938 oil painting, ''Ugly Woman,'' for $30
million, Yucesan said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Izmir police arrested two Syrians and four
Turks who tried to sell a painting said to be Picasso's 1908 ''La
Fermiere,'' or The Farmer's Wife, which was believed to have been
stolen from a Kuwaiti palace.
</P>
<P>
   The painting retrieved Saturday had not been registered as
stolen, though it also appeared to have come from Kuwait, Yucesan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups of smugglers appeared to be operating
independently, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ugly Woman'' was expected to be displayed at Ankara's state
art museum, along with the other recovered painting.

representatives by returning to an interim U.N.-controlled
government running the province.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 83 Serb delegates attending the meeting walked out
to register their opposition to renewed participation in the
interim council. But Father Sava Janjic, a key moderate, said the
majority endorsed the move.
</P>
<P>
   The decision depends on the implementation of a written U.N.
commitment to send anti-terrorist police to Serb areas being
targeted by ethnic Albanian extremists and the admission of more
Serbs into the Albanian-dominated Kosovo police force, Janjic told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cooperation is the only way to improve the lot of the Serbian
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate U.N. confirmation that such a commitment
existed.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' return is a victory for U.S. and other Western
diplomats. Without a Serb voice in the interim government,
international attempts to keep the province multiethnic are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the ethnic tensions, NATO officials said one Serb
was killed and another wounded Sunday when armed men fired on their
car in the ethnically mixed town of Kosovo Polje just west of the
Kosovo capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb concession leaves Serb moderates and hard-liners more
split than ever. The hard-liners have condemned the moderates'
decision, saying it hurts the Serb cause.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Serbs first walked away from the interim government
late last year, accusing it of pro-Albanian bias. Radical Serbs say
that working together with the Albanians on the council only
hastens the ultimate Albanian goal of independence for Kosovo,
which formally remains part of Serbia even though it is run by the
United Nations and NATO-led peacekeepers
</P>
<P>
   A moderate Kosovo Serb delegation headed by Bishop Artemije, the
top Serbian Orthodox cleric in Kosovo, visited the United Nations
in New York and then met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
earlier this month to make a case for urgent international action
to help protect the Serbs remaining in the province.
</P>
<P>
   That visit followed a spate of anti-Serb violence, prompting a
new Serb walkout from the interim council just weeks after moderate
Serbs agreed to end a four-month boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interest shown by the (U.S) state secretary is given as
assurance that there is will in the United States to improve the
security situation'' for the Serbs, Janjic said. ''The only way to
make things better is to make our voice heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Serb violence is attributed to ethnic Albanians seeking
to expel the last remaining Serbs from Kosovo. Ethnic hatred runs
deep following the Serb crackdown on Kosovo Albanians that left
more than 10,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown ended only after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign
that forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a
Kosovo peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Violence against Serbs, however, has led to increased
international sympathy for them and a cooling of support for the
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In comments published Sunday, President Clinton warned ethnic
Albanians that their chances of home rule would be hurt if Serbs
and other minorities in the Yugoslav province continued to come
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Albanian majority must accept that failure to protect
(Kosovo's) minorities will also undermine their expectations for
the future of Kosovo,'' Clinton said in an interview with Greece's
Vima newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, independent media in Serbia reported that the last
two Serb residents in a predominantly ethnic Albanian village in
southern Serbia were missing and feared slain. Bullet casings and
bloodstains were found in the home of Vlado Miletic and his
daughter Persa in the village of Mali Trnovac, the Beta news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   The village lies in a demilitarized zone between Kosovo and the
rest of Serbia. A new ethnic Albanian guerrilla group has emerged
there, demanding that Serbs leave.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest in Hong Kong  </HEADLINE>
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- About 2,000 Hong Kong homeowners on Sunday
protested a state decision to intervene in the housing market,
while hundreds of social workers, students and doctors took to the
streets to denounce other government moves.
</P>
<P>
   The protests followed recent rallies by teachers, civil servants
and lawyers -- highlighting growing discontent in Hong Kong as the
territory enters its fourth year under Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-class homeowners marched to the downtown government
headquarters Sunday to protest housing policy changes meant to
lower notoriously high property costs.
</P>
<P>
   But homeowners -- many of whom are mired in debt after borrowing
to buy properties whose values plunged after a 1997 economic crisis
-- demanded the government leave the market alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Protect the free economy. Reduce government intervention,''
the protesters chanted, some wearing yellow ribbons around their
necks to symbolize suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had pledged to increase the number
of public rental apartments and boost home ownership by selling
cheap government flats.
</P>
<P>
   But homeowners said the plan was cutting the value of their
investments even further.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not asking the government to prop up the market or
protect the market. We're only asking it to stop intervention and
let the market adjust to its own forces,'' said protester David So,
47, a legal assistant who said his two apartments had dropped 60
percent in value.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, about 700 doctors held a sit-in Sunday to protest
proposed health care changes. With some wearing white smocks, the
doctors sat together on the floor and steps in the lobby of Hong
Kong's Hospital Authority, which plans to cut new doctors' salaries
from $10,157 a month to $7,375, and put most doctors under the
supervision of specialists.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 social workers also marched to government
headquarters to protest the planned restructuring of welfare
funding, calling the changes an excuse to cut subsidies for the
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   And about 1,000 students and migrants from mainland China took
to the streets to accuse the government of damaging the territory's
human rights record and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Some migrants are fighting in court for Hong Kong residency,
since the right was granted in a Hong Kong court but then
effectively revoked when Beijing lawmakers declared the ruling
wrong.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's ruling coalition suffered painful

Official results were not due out until Monday, but the Kyodo News Agency and
national broadcaster NHK said Mori's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition
partners had won 271 of the 480 seats in the lower house, or 56 percent. That
would be down sharply from the 65 percent they controlled before the vote.

communist North Korea are poised to repair the legacy of their conflict, but
warned that the specter of war is still vivid even after their June 13-15

reconciliation with the North. In a sign of the newly conciliatory mood, South
Korea canceled a military parade planned for Sunday, as well as reenactments of
pivotal battles. North Korean media did not mention the war anniversary, instead

Sen.: Suspend Federal Gas Taxes

gasoline tax for the summer because of increasing pump prices. A smaller
temporary tax rollback died in the Senate in April when the rise in gas prices
slowed and oil-producing nations agreed to increase their output. In the
Midwest, gas prices top $2 per gallon in some spots. Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon
has suspended the state sales tax on gasoline for 60 days. The Illinois
Legislature will meet in special session this week to discuss repealing or

<HEADLINE> Reno Likely To Reject Gore Counsel  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is likely to
reject a fourth recommendation for an outside investigation of Vice
President Al Gore, the Justice Department official who first sought
an independent counsel said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Different set of facts, different prosecutor, but I think it's
going to be the same result,'' former campaign finance task force
chief Charles LaBella said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBella's successor, Robert Conrad, recommended that Reno
appoint a special counsel to investigate whether Gore lied to
Justice prosecutors in an April 18 interview about an event during
his 1996 campaign at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the interview transcript public on Friday so American
can judge for themselves. ''I've told the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides LaBella's request, Reno already has rejected appeals for
independent investigators from FBI director Louis Freeh and former
Reno aide Robert Litt.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gore aides appearing on Sunday talk shows argued that
another Reno rejection would be the right decision. They pointed
out that LaBella, Litt and other investigators have said they have
seen nothing that would lead to a successful prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who on Thursday was the first to
disclose Conrad's request, made the same observation.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fairness to the vice president it should be emphasized that
there's a big difference between the level of information to
warrant a special counsel and what would be necessary to have a
prosecution,'' Specter said on ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But there are a great many unanswered questions. And I think
the American people have a right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he would call Reno to testify this week before his
Senate Judiciary administrative oversight subcommittee and ask her
''why she hasn't appointed independent counsels in the past. ...
It's obviously an enormous embarrassment for the Department of
Justice as to why the attorney general has not acted.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, upset that word about Conrad's recommendation had become
public, said Friday that she will do ''everything in my power to
see that any decision that I make is made without political
influence from anyone, without pressure from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, like LaBella, predicted Reno once again will not
appoint a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the attorney general is going to appoint a
special counsel,'' he said, ''and if she doesn't do so soon, it'll
be too late.'' He apparently referred to the proximity of
November's election, when Gore is expected to be the Democratic
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella agreed on NBC that timing is crucial for whoever
investigates the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be very difficult. There'll be time pressure,
and the (campaign) environment is just not the type of environment
you want to do an investigation in,'' LaBella said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella's recommendation for an independent counsel regarded
Gore's responses to questions about money-raising telephone calls
from Gore's White House office. Reno refused to seek an outside
prosecutor because she found that Gore had had no motive to lie,
and the questions asked were immaterial to the criminal
investigation then under way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think her analysis is going to be much different this
time,'' LaBella said. ''I think she's going to look at the
statements. She's going to look at the question of materiality and
motivation. And I think she's going to come down the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   And later, on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' LaBella cautioned: ''Since
the attorney general is tied to the White House -- she is a
presidential appointee -- people will always be suspicious of
whatever answer she comes up with, even if it is the right
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, former Gore chief of staff Ron Klain said
the only issue is ''whether or not Al Gore did anything wrong.
People have concluded that he hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawyers debate about whether or not that conclusion needs
to come from inside the Justice Department, outside the Justice
Department,'' Klain said. ''I don't think that is really that
interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Scientists Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. nuclear scientists traveling abroad have
reported being targeted by foreign agents who tried to obtain
secrets by bugging hotel rooms, rifling briefcases and computers,
or offering sexual favors, congressional investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   A report based on information gathered by the Energy
Department's counterintelligence office identified at least 75 such
cases in recent years involving trips by scientists from federal
weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department said Sunday it agreed with the findings,
which were largely based on data the department provided. The
scientists' names and countries involved were deleted.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they (the scientists) were reporting is that they were
approached by someone,'' Deputy Energy Secretary T.J. Glauthier
said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is no evidence that secrets were compromises in
any of the incidents cited by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier acknowledged the incidents demonstrate the degree to
which research scientists from the weapons labs are targets of
foreign intelligence operatives.
</P>
<P>
   He said thousands of trips are made abroad annually by
scientists working in a wide variety of disciplines at the labs,
including many involved in nuclear weapons research.
</P>
<P>
   The report, expected to be formally released this week, said
foreign travel ''can greatly benefit'' the country through
scientific exchanges. It also said some travelers ''may not be
receiving the necessary preparation to recognize and thwart
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report, requested by Reps. Benjamin Gilman,
R-N.Y., and Tim Roemer, D-Ind., was obtained Sunday by The
Associated Press. Its contents was first reported in Sunday's
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said that in 1998, the Energy Department increased
efforts to make scientists more aware of the potential risks when
traveling abroad. The agency agreed with most of the report and
recommendations, including the need ''sensitize'' scientists about
the risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report covered incidents reported between late 1995 to late
1998 by scientists from nuclear weapons facilities at Los Alamos
and Sandia in New Mexico, Lawrence Livermore in California, and Oak
Ridge in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign intelligence operatives ''used a variety of methods''
from bugging hotel and conference rooms to breaking into
scientists' computers and personal belonging, and casually
eavesdropping on conversations, the GAO said. It said the incidents
involved trips not only to ''sensitive'' countries -- Russia, China
and Pakistan, for example -- but also other nations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the GAO urged the Energy Department to establish
procedures to more closely monitor and advise scientists of the
risks involving all foreign travel and not only those to sensitive
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign intelligence entities can operate worldwide,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incidents cited in the GAO report:
</P>
<P>
   --Several scientists said suitcases or briefcases disappeared and
then were returned with their contents. One scientist said his
computer had been pried open from the back. Others reported zippers
being in different locations or locks missing on suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   --A scientist noticed a flashing red light in her hotel room when
the lights were dimmed, and heard a noise that sounded like an
auto-focus camera lens. She believed pictures were possibly being
taken from a ceiling smoke detector.
</P>
<P>
   --A scientist traveling in a ''sensitive'' country reported being
propositioned every night by prostitutes, a waitress and two other
women. He said he declined the offers.
</P>
<P>
   --Scientists attending an unclassified technical conference
noticed microphone wires leading from behind a door into the
conference room, leading some to believe their discussions were
being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   In one case involving a ''sensitive'' country, a scientist
became convinced his phone was being tapped. He telephoned his wife
in the United States and she mentioned she was going to play bingo.
The next day someone asked him, ''What is bingo?''
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Glauthier played down two incidents over the
weekend at Los Alamos -- the discovery of two 10-year-old floppy
computer disks where they were not supposed to be, and a door being
left unlocked in a secure area.
</P>
<P>
   The two floppy disks contained outdated material and were, in
fact, found in a secure vault, although their whereabouts was
uncertain for a day. ''Now that we're asking everybody to inventory
everything and doublecheck. ... We will find things like that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two floppy disks ''were secure and nothing was lost,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Suspends Military Zones  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein issued a decree
Sunday suspending his 1998 order that divided the country into four
military zones in anticipation of the heavy wave of U.S.-British
airstrikes that year.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Saddam's decision will lead to any
changes on the ground because most of Iraq's government-controlled
provinces are now run by veteran army commanders. Iraq's three
Kurdish provinces in the north are administered by Kurdish rebels
outside government jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In the decree, read over state-run television, Saddam said the
United States and Britain had failed to impose their will during
air raids launched in December 1998 to punish Baghdad for not
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors. U.N. sanctions imposed
for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait aren't to be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify Iraq no longer has or can produce weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were set up hours before the December 1998 blitz. Zone
commanders, all senior members of the ruling Baath party, were
given sweeping powers within their areas and had the army, security
organs and Baath party militias under their command.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam said Sunday that zone commanders should return to base in
Baghdad and assume normal responsibilities. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he was confident Iraq is capable of
repelling any further attacks and that the resolve of the United
States and Britain to force dictates on Iraq has weakened.

<HEADLINE> Mets 9, Pirates 0  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Hampton scattered five hits for his his
first shutout with New York, winning for the first time in a month
as the Mets beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 9-0 Sunday for a three-game
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora had a career-high four hits in five at-bats with a
homer, double and two singles.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (7-5), 0-1 with three no-decisions since a May 26 win at
St. Louis, pitched the first shutout for a Mets starter this
season, the seventh of his career. He struck out a season-high nine
and walked two, improving to 5-1 with a 1.60 ERA in his last nine
starts.
</P>
<P>
   New York outscored the Pirates 31-10 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this season Hampton outdueled Kris
Benson; Hampton allowed six hits in 8 1-3 shutout innings at
Pittsburgh May 9, striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who gave up six runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings,
allowed more than two runs for only the third time in 12 starts.
Benson retired 11 straight from the second inning through the fifth
but got in trouble in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets leading 1-0, Mora led off with a single and took
third on Derek Bell's hit-and-run single to right. Edgardo Alfonzo
walked to load the bases before Mike Piazza fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   Benson walked Robin Ventura, forcing in a run, and Todd Zeile's
sacrifice fly scored Bell for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   New York scored five times the following inning. Bell drove in
Joe McEwing and Mora with a single and Piazza knocked in two more
with a ground-rule double that extended his hitting streak to 14
games and his RBI streak to nine.
</P>
<P>
   Mora hit a solo homer in the eighth off Mike Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, a former No. 1 draft pick, allowed two runs in three
starts -- and one in 20 1-3 innings -- coming in. He struck out seven
in his worst start since giving up seven runs on May 11 against
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's best scoring chance came in the fifth, when Benson
singled with two outs. Mike Benjamin followed with a single and Pat
Meares walked to load the bases. Hampton struck out Bruce Aven on
three pitches to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton's RBI single in the second gave New York a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pirates backup C Keith Osik completed a strikeout-throwout
double play in the first inning, catching Mora trying to steal
third. Osik has thrown out three of the seven runners attempting to
steal this season, but couldn't get Mora again in the seventh when
he swiped second. ... Pittsburgh manager Gene LaMont and pitching
coach Pete Vuckovich were ejected in the first inning by first-base
umpire John Hirschbeck. Vuckovich was thrown out on Friday night by
Hirschbeck, arguing a balk call. ... Piazza, who entered with only
30 strikeouts this season, fanned in his first two at-bats against
Benson. ... Mora's previous best was three hits April 8 against Los
Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Talks in Fiji 'Hit Wall'  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- A day that started joyfully with the release
of four female hostages ended Sunday with the breakdown of talks to
free 27 men still being held at gunpoint in Fiji's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff between the army and gunmen holding Fiji's deposed
government hostage has ''hit a wall,'' with the coup leaders
insisting they be allowed to name a new president, military
spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   The military -- which has taken control of this South Pacific
island nation -- indicated Sunday it was losing patience with the
gunmen, and issued what looked like a veiled threat.
</P>
<P>
   The four women's release will enable the army to operate with
''less restrictions,'' Tarakinikini said, but refused to say if
that meant the military might use force to free the remaining
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Gunmen led by former insurance and timber executive George
Speight stormed parliament on May 19 and took the government,
including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, hostage. Chaudhry was
the first ethnic Indian to lead the country, where more than half
the people are indigenous.
</P>
<P>
   Before talks deadlocked Sunday, the army already had agreed to
most of Speight's demands, including that Chaudhry be ousted and
the constitution drafted in 1997 be thrown out. The demands aim to
strip power from Fiji's ethnic Indians, who make up about 44
percent of the 812,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   Many indigenous Fijians were enraged by Chaudhry's refusal to
raise rents charged to Indian sugar cane growers on land owned
communally by indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   Speight says he is acting in defense of indigenous Fijians'
rights, but critics say his cause is more about money than
ideology. Speight was fired last year as the government's timber
industry administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speight and his group believe that they can ... extract
from us every last ounce of concessions that they can possibly
get,'' Tarakinikini said in the capital, Suva. ''We are not
prepared to allow that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk was in sharp contrast to the glee that
accompanied the women's release earlier Sunday. The four freed
captives -- two cabinet ministers, one assistant minister and one
member of parliament -- were taken under heavy police escort first
to see relatives, then to trauma specialists for medical checkups
and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thankful to the Lord for making this day possible,'' said
freed hostage Lavenia Wainiqolo Padarath, the deposed minister for
women, culture and social welfare, fighting back tears outside a
church service she attended Sunday with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Jo Nata told Radio Fiji that the women were
released as a goodwill gesture. But Speight said: ''As for the
goodwill side of it, let people interpret what they want to
interpret.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those released was Adi Koila Mara -- the former minister of
tourism and transport and daughter of former President Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the standoff would end two days ago, when both sides
announced a deal to establish an interim government that presumably
would lead Fiji to new elections within two years.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday the military said Speight had issued a new
demand -- that his group be allowed to name a president. The
military wants the council of Fijian chiefs to select the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Local media reported Speight's change of heart was due to
objections from his powerful security adviser, Ilisoni Ligairi, who
felt they were giving too much away.
</P>
<P>
   Ligairi was quoted in the Fiji Times on Sunday as saying the
gunmen would have to be assured of a presence in an interim
government before the hostages could go home.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if talks would resume after Sunday's deadlock.
The standoff has raised concern abroad that Fiji has descended into
racism and intolerance. Australia, New Zealand and the United
States have threatened economic sanctions if democracy is not
restored.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel raid on parliament was accompanied by widespread
attacks on Indians, and many members of that community are fleeing
the country.

<HEADLINE> French Chef Coming to New York  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alain Ducasse isn't just any star coming to New
York. He's six stars, the only chef in the world with that many,
and he's crossed the Atlantic with Europe's most acclaimed cuisine
-- and record-setting prices.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, 65 diners a night will fill the restaurant
Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, off glitzy Central Park South,
paying $160 apiece to feast on his foie gras, savor his sweetbreads
and chew on his Camembert.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in wine, water, coffee, tax and tip, and the tab rises to
$250 a person and up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been crowned the greatest chef of his time,'' said
Daniel Boulud, whose Daniel has sometimes been called New York's
top restaurant. ''Alain is beyond the visionary, the mastermind of
his cuisine. It's his style, his service.''
</P>
<P>
   Never ones to trifle about their truffles, New York's foodies
have been phoning, faxing, e-mailing and begging for reservations
since the March 10 announcement. There have been 2,700 requests, a
backlog of about 8&AMP;frac12; months, even before the first ''delicate jelly
of frogs' legs, poultry pinions and vegetable pearls'' has reached
a diner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quality has a price,'' Ducasse said last week, the morning
after the first of five ''pre-opening'' nights. ''The important
factor is the best quality for the best price. But first of all is
the quality, and obviously you have to apply the price to the
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse, 43, is known to scream to achieve his vision, or to get
so mad he won't talk at all. Every glass and plate is measured for
perfection when it arrives. He sent back wine glasses when he
discovered they were slightly thicker than the others in the lot --
they were made by the craftsman's assistant, not the craftsman.
</P>
<P>
   He scribbles on yellow post-it notes everywhere he goes,
checking in with each restaurant at least twice a day. He talks
about constantly needing to ''evolve,'' both himself and the
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a staff of 55 to coddle each chosen 65 -- one sitting
per evening, Monday to Friday only, with lunch served Wednesday and
Thursday. There are no reservation times: The table is yours
whenever you show up.
</P>
<P>
   Women have stools on which to rest their handbags (with drawers
for men to hide diamond rings or other gifts). Christian Le Page
china is hand made in France, silverware created by Beard and
Emmanuel Barge, the pens to sign checks by Cartier, Tiffany, Mont
Blanc, Gucci and Carandache.
</P>
<P>
   Water pitchers are by Baccarat, Saint Louis and Bohemia, artwork
by Arman, sculptures in the fuchsia-and-gold dining room by
Jean-Michel Folon. Each time you sip water or wine, a hand reaches
around and makes sure the glasses of all at the table are level.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Michelin says yes, making his Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo and
Alain Ducasse in Paris two of only 22 restaurants in France and
Monaco to merit three stars -- ''exceptional cuisine worth a
journey.'' He is the only chef in the 100-year history of the guide
to operate a pair of three-star restaurants simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, five restaurants get The New York Times' top
rating, four stars: Bouley Bakery, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Le
Cirque 2000 and Lespinasse. The city has thousands of restaurants --
and enough food fetishists to support an off-Broadway show, ''Fully
Committed,'' about a restaurant too hot for people to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is the ultimate, any way you put it. It used to be
France, but it's no longer,'' said Lidia Bastianich, the owner of
Felidia in New York and co-owner of Lidia's restaurant in Kansas
City, Mo. ''I think he might receive criticism he's not used to,
but that's part of what the New York scene is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse was born in Castelsarrazin in Landes, southwestern
France. He started working in restaurants when he was 16 and
trained under Michel Guerard, Roger Verge and Alain Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Ducasse earned two stars at La Terrasse at
Juan-les-Pins, and three years later he was hired by Le Louis XV.
In 1990, at age 33, he became the youngest chef to win three stars,
earning them for a menu based primarily on olive oil and
Mediterranean vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, he took over the restaurant Joel Robuchon ran at
Paris' Hotel Le Parc, renamed it after himself, presented more
traditional, butter-based fare and seven months later earned three
stars there.
</P>
<P>
   While Le Louis XV lost a star in 1997, Michelin restored it the
following year, and both 50-seat restaurants have maintained their
lofty ratings ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He commutes back and forth between Paris and Monte Carlo; is a
consultant to the one-star Bar &AMP; Boeuf in Monte Carlo and to the
Spoon chain in London, Tokyo, Mauritius and Paris; and also owns
two inns in Provence and a cooking school.
</P>
<P>
   He even drops into McDonald's and Burger King on occasion,
saying he eats ''everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse likes the image he's created: whirling dervish. Where he
met his girlfriend of five years, Gwenaelle Guegnon, isn't much of
a surprise: an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't fall into habits,'' he said, ''because habits are
usually bad habits.''

<HEADLINE> Indians 2, Tigers 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Enrique Wilson homered on the first pitch of
the eighth inning Sunday, giving the Cleveland Indians a 2-1
victory over the Detroit Tigers, who still have Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who could soon be traded to the New York Yankees,
didn't play after fouling a ball off his left ankle during the
second game of Saturday's day-night doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   He received treatment for the injury before the game but was
still hobbling around the Tigers' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tigers had tied it at 1 in the top of the inning
against Steve Karsay (1-4), Wilson drove a fastball from Matt
Anderson (3-1) over the wall in right for his second homer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's other homer this season was an inside-the-parker on May
21 against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who blew several early scoring chances against
Detroit starter Jeff Weaver, won for just the fifth time in 15
games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland rookie Jim Brower pitched seven shutout innings but
got a no-decision when Karsay gave up an RBI double to Tony Clark
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Brower gave up just four hits and pitched out of a couple jams.
The right-hander walked three and struck out four -- three in the
sixth when he left the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Karsay gave up a one-out single to Juan Encarnacion in the ninth
before getting the final two outs for his first win since last Aug.
19.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position and
twice left the bases full against Weaver before finally scoring in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Jolbert Cabrera, who entered the game in the third when Omar
Vizquel got hurt, opened the seventh inning with an infield single
and Roberto Alomar sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Following an intentional walk, Jim Thome hit a grounder to
second baseman Damian Easley, who threw to shortstop Deivi Cruz for
the force at second. Cruz got the out, but dropped the ball while
taking it out of his glove.
</P>
<P>
   When Cruz didn't immediately pick it up Cabrera sprinted home
and scored with a head-first slide into the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth, but
Brower struck out Clark and Damian Easley to keep it scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit left fielder Rich Becker kept the Indians from scoring
in the fourth when he caught Lofton's one-out fly and threw out
Russell Branyan at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Indians loaded the bases with two outs in the fifth,
but came away empty when Wilson grounded out to second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With Detroit staying until Monday night, Tigers manager
Phil Garner planned to attend the ''Three Tenors'' concert at
Cleveland Browns Stadium following the game. ... Vizquel left the
game in the fourth inning after bruising his right knee during an
at-bat in the third. ... Detroit 3B Dean Palmer was struck on the
left elbow by a pitch from Brower in the second and was replaced in
the third by Shane Halter. Palmer is day-to-day.

<HEADLINE> Padres 5, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Brian Tollberg held Cincinnati scoreless into
the eighth and the San Diego Padres survived another Cincinnati
rally against closer Trevor Hoffman before closing out a 5-4
victory Sunday over the slumping Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati lost for the 14th time in 18 games, leaving the Reds
a distant second to St. Louis in the NL Central. The Reds play the
Cardinals seven times in the next 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got seven hits off Tollberg (2-0), who struck out seven
in 7 1-3 innings and left with a 5-0 lead and two on.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker gave up RBI singles to Sean Casey and Aaron Boone,
preserving the Reds' distinction as the only major league team yet
to be shut out this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds then completed a four-run inning by getting two
run-scoring pinch hits off Hoffman, who on Friday night blew a save
by giving up three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Taubensee's pinch single left him 8-for-15 career off
Hoffman and drove in another run, and Chris Stynes' pinch single
made it 5-4 before Juan Castro flew out to end the nine-batter
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman gave up one hit in the ninth, securing his 19th save in
21 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg, the 10th Padres starter this season, gave up only one
hit and one unearned run in seven innings as he won his major
league debut 3-1 in Arizona on Tuesday. In his two starts, he has
given up two earned runs and eight hits in 14 1-3 innings with 14
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego squeezed out five runs against Osvaldo Fernandez
(2-1), who struggled with is control in the worst of his eight
starts for the Reds. Fernandez gave up a season-high in runs,
walked five and allowed seven hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego scored on a double-play grounder by Phil Nevin, a
bases-loaded walk to Nevin, sacrifice flies by Bret Boone and
Carlos Hernandez and the double by Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have played a big role in the Reds' slide, winning
five of their six games in the last 10 days. Boone led the way with
big series against his former team, going 6-for-12 in the three
games with three homers, seven RBIs and six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Overall this season, Boone was 14-for-34 against the Reds, drove
in 15 runs and hit six of his 12 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens walked to open the game and the Padres loaded the
bases with no outs before Nevin hit into a run-scoring double play.
Owens had an infield single as the Padres loaded the bases to open
the third, and Fernandez walked Nevin on a 3-1 pitch before giving
up sacrifice flies to Boone and Hernandez. Boone and Hernandez had
two-out doubles in the fifth to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Owens leads the NL with 33 multihit games. ... Nevin has
hit into 12 double plays, second in the NL only to Dante Bichette's
13. ... The Padres and the Reds remain the only two major league
teams without a complete game. ... The Reds optioned struggling
starter Rob Bell to Triple-A Louisville. They're expected to call
up reliever Scott Winchester on Monday. In his last four starts,
Bell gave up 16 runs in 15 innings. ... With Pokey Reese sidelined
by a sprained ankle and Chris Stynes slowed by a sore hamstring,
Castro made his first start of the season at second base. ...
Dmitri Young was scratched from the lineup because of a sore left
calf. He pinch hit in the eighth and struck out, then stayed in the
game in left field.

<HEADLINE> Assad Nomination Process Begins  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- The late Syrian President Hafez Assad's
son was taking the final steps necessary to succeed his father
Sunday, with parliament meeting to schedule a nationwide
presidential referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In a 35-minute session Sunday evening, parliament speaker
Abdul-Qader Qadoura announced that a committee of 70 deputies will
study the ruling Baath party's nomination of Bashar Assad for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Qadoura said the committee will report back to parliament Monday
at 6 p.m. Deputies are then expected to vote on the nomination and
set a date for a presidential referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Baath and its allies hold a clear majority in the parliament,
and its adoption of Bashar Assad's nomination is virtually certain.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-seat parliament already has shown where it stands on the
young Assad becoming leader, as Hafez Assad had wished. Hours after
the elder Assad died June 10, parliament voted to lower the minimum
age for president from 40 to 34. Bashar Assad is 34.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad will most likely be the only candidate in the
referendum, expected to be held as early as the first week of July.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's voters will be asked to cast a ''yes'' or ''no'' vote on
the nomination. Some banners strewn across Damascus streets already
are urging Syrians to vote ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Assad, like several other Arab leaders, consistently
won presidential referenda with more than 90 percent -- sometime as
high as 99.99 percent -- ''yes'' votes.

<HEADLINE> Death Sent. Possible for Iran Jews  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An Iranian judiciary official said Sunday
that death sentences are possible for the 13 Iranian Jews accused
of spying for Israel, despite comments to the contrary by officials
close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   If they are convicted of spying, ''according to the law, they
are eligible to be sentenced to both death or prison terms,'' the
official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted prosecutor Ayatollah
Morteza Moqtadae as saying.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hossein Ali Amiri, the judiciary chief of Fars
province, where the trial is being held, said the death penalty
applies only to charges of ''moharebeh,'' fighting against God and
the state, and the men have not been charged with that offense.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy could not be immediately reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   The judge presiding over the trial closed the case Saturday and
verdicts are to be issued July 1, state-run Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 13 Jewish defendants have pleaded guilty, four have
pleaded innocent and one has said he passed information to Israel,
but did not think his action constituted espionage. Israel has
denied any of the 13 had spied for it.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, the United States and several European countries have
expressed concern about the case. Attention has focused on the
fairness of a trial closed to the public with no jury and the judge
acting as prosecutor.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Refinery Blast Kills 4  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- An explosion early Sunday at the largest of
Kuwait's three oil refineries killed four workers, injured 49 and
seriously damaged the facility, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was caused by a gas leak, but it was unclear what had
ignited the escaping gas, said the Mina al-Ahmedi refinery's
operations manager, Hamza Bakhash.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was under control by midmorning, and officials were
allowing leaking gas to burn off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The explosion was huge,'' Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser Al
Sabah told reporters Sunday at the refinery, about 25 miles south
of Kuwait City. ''Damage is extensive. We still don't know the size
or cost of damages. Some units might not be operational for months,
and some for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoke and flames rose from the gasoline unit following the
blast. Fire trucks parked nearby were littered with broken glass.
At least one concrete structure appeared destroyed, and the force
of the blast shattered windows in office buildings at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Crude exports from the port complex could resume immediately,
said Managing Director Sami al-Rshaid of the Kuwaiti National
Petroleum Co., which owns and runs the refinery. Products stored
could meet domestic needs for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accident was not due to any sabotage,'' the company said
in a statement that also reported 49 injured. By Sunday evening, 34
of the injured had been released from hospitals, al-Rshaid said.
Two people remained in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery produces gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel and other
fuels for export and the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   Mina al-Ahmedi can produce 444,000 barrels a day. The national
oil company also owns and operates the Mina Abdullah refinery,
which can produce 263,000 barrels a day, and the Shuaiba refinery
with a capacity of around 200,000 barrels a day.

<HEADLINE> Arson Probe for Aussie Hostel Fire  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PASSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILDERS, Australia (AP) -- Police stepped up their arson
investigation Sunday at a burned-out hostel where 15 backpackers
died and fire officials, hampered by rain, continued removing
bodies from what remains of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Only one body had been taken out of the 100-year-old Palace
Hostel on Saturday, the day after the blaze. Five more bodies were
removed Sunday, but persistent rain made retrieval of the remaining
nine difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working in a very small area, with gaping holes in the
floor,'' homicide Detective-Inspector Graham Rynders said. ''And
some of the bodies are in a very poor condition.''
</P>
<P>
   As authorities worked Sunday, young backpackers aboard buses on
the nearby Bruce Highway craned their necks to catch a glimpse of
the burned-out building.
</P>
<P>
   The hostel served as a way station for some of the thousands of
backpackers who tour Australia. Young tourists passing through the
town of Childers often worked in local farmers' fields, earning
travel money before moving on to more scenic parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-moving fire that destroyed the hostel broke out early
Friday. Seventy residents escaped the blaze. Ten suffered minor
injuries, most as they fled the flames by jumping onto the roofs of
nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Phil Wardrope said police were still looking for
Robert Paul Long, a 37-year-old fruit-picker seen at the Palace
Hostel just before the fire broke out. They want to question him.
</P>
<P>
   Long was told to leave the hostel about 10 days ago because he
fell behind in his $55 weekly rent. Some of those killed -- six from
Britain, four from Australia, two from the Netherlands and one each
from South Korea, Japan and Ireland -- had worked side by side with
Long, a former Sydney resident who picked tomatoes at local farms.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not confirm whether he was the same man who
threatened several women at the hostel a few days before the blaze.
They also refused to confirm reports in several Australian
newspapers Sunday that Long had written two suicide notes over the
past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Long's father, Syd Long, said in Sydney he was ''worried sick''
about his son, adding, ''I hope to God it wasn't him.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors expressed outrage that the blaze may have been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's the case, that someone deliberately set fire to the
place, then they should be strung up,'' said Keith O'Brien, a
22-year-old backpacker from Wigan, England. ''Some of those who
died were just kids.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Cambodian Torture Rampant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Most Cambodians alive today have
suffered some form of torture by criminals or authorities, who
generally go unpunished, a human rights group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ''most institutionalized use of torture'' occurs in police
stations, where authorities routinely use beatings and other
methods to extract confessions from suspects, the Cambodian rights
group Licadho said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be arrested in Cambodia is one of the surest ways to face
the prospect of torture,'' said the report, issued to coincide with
the United Nations' International Day in Support of Victims of
Torture.
</P>
<P>
   Torture is also common in domestic violence and forced
prostitution, it said, adding that, in recent years, human
trafficking may have become ''the fastest-growing forum for torture
in Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers and brothel pimps use severe violence to force their
victims to have sex with customers, including force-feeding them
narcotics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to past criticism, the Cambodian government has
acknowledged a problem with torture and pledged to work to curb
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Licadho report also noted ''the often ferocious nature'' of
domestic violence, adding that wife-beaters were often not arrested
or prosecuted because authorities considered the problem a family
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed cases from the past few years, including one
that told of police smashing an iron bar over the head of a
15-year-old boy to get him to confess to stealing. A woman at a
police station was whipped with wire, beaten with a stick and
nearly suffocated with a plastic bag, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison guards beat a group of inmates with the handle of a hoe
until they were bloody and bruised, then confined them to a cell
for more than two weeks without adequate food, clothing, bedding or
water for bathing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Licadho accused the government and police of being ''accomplices
to torture'' by failing to properly investigate and prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Licadho noted that ''the most notorious practitioners of torture
in modern Cambodia'' were found in the late Pol Pot's radical
communist Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''By virtually any definition of torture, most Cambodians who
lived through Pol Pot's rule can be said to have suffered
torture,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Nader Expects To Present Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Sunday the
Green Party is moving into mainstream politics and he does not care
if his campaign for president hurts Texas Gov. George W. Bush or
Vice President Al Gore, as long as the major parties listen to his
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also said he expects to present a challenge to the
Republicans, Democrats and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan, and
he urged frustrated voters to consider supporting a third party
like the Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Nader was one of three candidates campaigning Sunday for the
party's presidential nomination and was expected to easily defeat
challengers Jello Biafra and Stephen Gaskin.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging news conference before the nomination, Nader
urged the two major parties to open the presidential debates to all
candidates who qualify for federal matching campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates is limiting participation
to candidates with at least 15 percent support in national polls.
That threshold currently excludes Nader and Buchanan, both of whom
are in single digits in the surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ''The debates have now become a central part of the election
process. Millions of voters apparently make up their minds on what
they hear in these debates. To shut out legitimate third-party
candidates from these debates is to limit the competitive
democratic process on which the American electoral system is
supposed to be built,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader acknowledged his campaign could hurt Democrat Gore more
than Republican Bush, especially in key states like California. But
he said it ''really doesn't matter'' if his candidacy costs Gore
the election as long as the two parties get the message and listen
to the millions of disaffected voters who did not cast ballots in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said if Gore doesn't change the spectrum of his agenda and
broaden it out, ''he's going to lose California.''
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll on Saturday showed Nader ahead of Buchanan, but
still far behind Bush and Gore, who were in a statistical tie at 42
percent and 40 percent respectively. Nader got 3 percent and
Buchanan 2 percent in the poll. It had a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also is doing better than Buchanan in California,
according to a survey there.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lass, outgoing secretary of the Association of State Green
Parties, said the Greens are counting on Nader to bring the party
into mainstream politics and force the major parties to recognize
their issues, including political reform, universal health
insurance, labor reform and increased corporate responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think having Nader as our candidate will help us reach
people frustrated with politics and give people a clear choice. I
think this will definitely end our reputation as a fringe party,''
Lass said.

<HEADLINE> Sen.: Suspend Federal Gas Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from
oil-rich Texas and an ally of GOP presidential candidate George W.
Bush, said Sunday Congress should suspend the 18.4-cent per gallon
federal gasoline tax because of increasing pump prices.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller temporary tax rollback died in the Senate in April
when the rise in gas prices slowed and oil-producing nations agreed
to increase their output.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think part of a package that we should put forward in
Congress is short-term fixes like relief from gasoline taxes until
we stabilize these prices and then some longer term fixes,''
Hutchison said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, gas prices top $2 per gallon in some spots.
Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon has suspended the state sales tax on
gasoline for 60 days. The Illinois Legislature will meet in special
session this week to discuss repealing or suspending the state's 5
percent sales tax on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation introduced in Congress earlier this year would have
rolled back 4.3 cents of the 18.4-cent federal tax for the rest of
the year and suspended the entire tax if and when average prices
exceeded $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The issue lost momentum because the price rise slowed in the
spring and oil-producing nations in the Middle East bowed to U.S.
pressure to increase the oil supply.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, prices have climbed again, affecting summer
travelers and becoming an issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone thinks that this is going to stabilize by the
fall, so if we could go through the summer when people are taking
their vacations, I think we should do that,'' Hutchinson said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
he would be open to her proposal -- and others to eliminate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took a vote in April to do something very similar to that
and when it comes to cutting back tax on the American people, never
count us out,'' said Lott spokesman John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison also contended that the use of cleaner-burning
reformulated gasoline was adding as much as 25 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, and other Republicans fault the
Environmental Protection Agency for requiring that the areas of the
country with the worst smog problems use ethanol-blended gas.
Clinton administration critics also say the White House has not
done enough to persuade the 11-member Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries to raise production levels.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats blame the big oil
companies, saying they are maximizing profits at the expense of
consumers. President Clinton has indicated that he suspects
possible price gouging by the industry. The Federal Trade
Commission is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said on CNN's ''Late Edition'' that
the administration is using the oil industry as a ''guinea pig.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The chickens are coming home to roost for this administration,
7&AMP;frac12; years of no energy policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended the use of corn-based ethanol,
arguing that it is ''actually cheaper'' than conventional gasoline.
He said it is unfair to blame farmers in ethanol-producing states
such as his, at a time when he said oil company profits were
soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison countered that the reason it appears oil companies are
making money is because they had to settle for bare minimum profits
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're comparing it to $10-a-barrel oil, which drove half our
little guys (oil producers) out of the market,'' she said. ''They
no longer even produce.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he can see no reason why
prices have risen above $2 a gallon in parts of Michigan where
there is no ethanol requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no economic justification for these
prices,'' Levin said on CNN. ''In my home state Michigan, we can't
find any reason except really gouging as far as I'm concerned
because if you look at the explanations for it, none of them
wash.''

<HEADLINE> China's News Agency Denies Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's state-run Xinhua News Agency on Sunday
denied a newspaper's speculation that its new offices could be a
base for spying on the U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua said the office was purchased legally and denied that its
correspondents have ever engaged in spying.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is nothing but a rumor and smear. We are filled with great
indignation, and we strongly refute the reports,'' the statement
quoted an unidentified Xinhua spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. State Department said Xinhua did not get
required permission when it purchased a seven-story building for
news offices and living quarters close to the Pentagon. The United
States could force Xinhua to give up the building under the law
that governs foreign missions in the United States, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Xinhua said the State Department was formally notified of
its intention to purchase the building on May 22 and that it
completed the transaction June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like what has been done in the past, the purchase by the
Xinhua bureau was just a normal real estate deal done in conformity
with American laws,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The building is just under a mile from the Pentagon, with a
distant view of some of the building's outer wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Times newspaper had reported some private China
analysts were concerned that Xinhua could spy on the Pentagon from
its new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating its criticisms on the conservative newspaper,
which frequently reports on perceived Chinese security threats,
Xinhua accused the Times of ''deliberately distorting the fact and
creating rumors with an intention to make trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''Its reports are against the basic professional ethics of
newspaper men,'' Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Xinhua reporters stationed overseas have ''never been engaged in
anything that is not in conformity with their capacity of
correspondents,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 8, Cubs 7, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cliff Floyd homered with one out in the 10th inning
as the Florida Marlins completed a three-game sweep with an 8-7 win
over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd hit the first pitch from Felix Heredia (3-3) deep to right
field for his 14th homer of the year. It was Florida's first
three-game sweep of the Cubs since April 1-3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca (3-4) pitched a perfect 10th inning for the
win as the Marlins (38-38) improved to .500.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 7-5, the Cubs tied the game in the eighth with help
from a pair of errors by shortstop Alex Gonzalez, who entered the
game that inning as a defensive replacement
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez made a throwing error to allow Brant Brown to reach
first leading off the inning. With one out, Gonzalez misplayed
Sammy Sosa's grounder to put runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill hit an RBI single and Jose Nieves followed with a
sacrifice fly to tie the score at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith and Derrek Lee hit two-run homers in the seventh for
the Marlins to put Florida up 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has three homers the past two games after not homering at
home since Aug. 5, 1998. His shot off the upper deck in left field
Ruben Quevedo went 482 feet, the longest ever at Pro Player Stadium
by a Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth longest in the history of the stadium. Andres
Galarraga hit the longest (529 feet) on May 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves and Brant Brown homered for the Cubs, who have lost four
straight. Jeff Huson added a two-run triple in the fifth to give
Chicago a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who scored four runs in the eighth inning to win
7-4 Saturday, scored three in the first off Quevedo on Lee's bases
loaded walk and Dave Berg's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves hit a two-run home run in the second, and Brown, traded
from the Marlins on June 9 in a three-way deal, tied it with a solo
shot in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo, forced into action because of Ismael Valdez's blister,
allowed seven runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Ryan Dempster gave up five runs and seven hits in
seven innings, while striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Only four of Lee's first 35 career homers came at home. ...
After a crowd of 35,140 came out Saturday, the Marlins drew 16,512
for the series finale. ... The Cubs optioned OF Gary Matthews Jr.
to Triple-A Iowa to make room for Quevedo. ... Valdez, who was
scratched this weekend, will start on Friday for the Cubs. ...
Marlins C Mike Redmond, who sprained a ligament in his right knee
June 17 at Pittsburgh, returned to the starting lineup. He threw
Brown out attempting to steal in the first inning. ... Sosa had his
11-game hitting streak end after going 0-for-4.

<HEADLINE> Jail guard accused of sexual harassment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A jail sergeant accused of sexually
harassing female trainees repeatedly since 1997 despite warnings
has been suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Onondaga County Sheriff Kevin Walsh suspended Sgt. Michael Brown
with pay last month over five charges related to Brown's treatment
of women under his supervision in the training academy at the
county Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brown originally was suspended without pay in April. But when
that suspension reached the 30-day legal limit, he was suspended
with pay, according to Chief Custody Deputy Anthony Callisto.
</P>
<P>
   At least five female deputies told internal affairs
investigators that Sgt. Michael Brown sexually harassed them, the
Syracuse Herald American reported in Sunday's editions, citing
sources familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The charges include allegations that Brown made unwanted visits
to the homes of female trainees, used disrespectful language with
them, gave them gifts and had relationships with them. As the
women's instructor, Brown was in position to recommend they pass or
fail their training.
</P>
<P>
   Among Brown's duties was instructing deputies on the
department's policy against sexual harassment and of the importance
of reporting allegations of sexual harassment to supervisors so
they can take action.
</P>
<P>
   Brown will remain suspended until the disciplinary charges are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The case demonstrates how administrators have ignored claims of
sexual harassment until they're so pervasive that disciplinary
action must be taken, according to Daniel Matthews, president of
the Deputy Sheriffs Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies union is not representing Brown on the charges, and
Matthews said he had not seen a copy of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is accused of ignoring orders in 1997 from his supervisor,
Lt. Paul Marconi, and Chief Custody Deputy Anthony Callisto to stop
harassing female recruits. But according to the charges, Brown
continued his actions until he was suspended.

<HEADLINE> Bowman Returning to Red Wings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Scotty Bowman, the winningest coach in
NHL history, is returning for another season with the Detroit Red
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, 66, had been mulling his future since the Red Wings'
second-round playoff elimination by the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   As the league's entry draft was ending Sunday, Detroit general
manager Ken Holland said Bowman would be back under a one-year
contract. Holland had told Bowman after the Colorado series he
wanted him back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to feel in my heart that I could come back and,
healthwise, I wanted to make sure I was up to the challenge
again,'' Bowman said of the month it took him to decide to return
for a 29th season as an NHL coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good I've lasted so long. You like to go as far as you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching in five decades had been his goal, and he's
accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Barry Smith also will return. Dave Lewis, the other
assistant, is waiting to hear from the expansion Columbus Blue
Jackets on his application for the head coaching position. If he
doesn't get it, he'll stay with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who coached the Red Wings to the Stanley Cup in 1997 and
1998, said the team needs changes now.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we won our championships, we were a lot stingier,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to have Scotty still with us,'' Smith said. ''His
experience and his gut feelings he has when things happen help over
the course of a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has coached in St. Louis, Montreal, Buffalo, Pittsburgh
and Detroit. His regular-season career record is 1,144-529-294.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first 20 years, I probably didn't make as much money as I
have in the last three or four,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman also will be the spokesman for the new NHL Coaches'
Association.

<HEADLINE> White House Lobbying Ban Examined  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The strong restrictions on lobbying by former
Clinton administration officials may be loosened before President
Clinton leaves office, clearing the way for aides to take lucrative
jobs attempting to influence the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of current and former Clinton aides would be affected
if the rules are changed -- a move several outside lawyers,
lobbyists and academics have suggested is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers are taking an informal look at Clinton's
order, signed in the first minutes of his administration in 1993,
that banned former staffers from lobbying any federal agency for
which they had ''any responsibility.'' The order also imposed a
lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no formal review, but we have listened to some of the
comments that have been expressed about this ban,'' White House
spokesman Jake Siewert said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to ease the restrictions is not coming from those
directly affected, Siewert said, but rather ''from those who think
it is unduly restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's first full day in office, he issued an executive
order that effectively overrode federal law at the time, which
imposed a one-year hiatus on former staffers before they could
lobby their old colleagues and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton said the stronger ban would ''guarantee
that the members of this administration will be looking out for the
American people and not for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what the White House might do next. Lawyers
could undertake a more concentrated legal review with an eye to
altering or lifting the Clinton order, but White House officials
speaking on condition of anonymity said they do not anticipate any
action quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could take back his earlier order by simply issuing
another executive order. Likewise, a new administration could
issued orders of its own, as long as they are not less strict than
the existing law.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, the Clinton ban was criticized as a
barrier to recruiting topflight managers and policy experts to
federal service.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense, Clinton, Bush and Reagan appointees
interviewed for a Brookings Institution study published this year
also cited delays, endless paperwork and an arduous confirmation
process as hardships to taking even a desirable administration job.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many restrictions on people in public life,''
said Mark Rozell, a political science professor at Catholic
University who has written four books on the presidency. ''We've
entered a period of almost obsessiveness about avoiding even any
appearance at all about impropriety,'' Rozell said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism that the ban is excessive, Clinton has always
refused to alter it.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so now, even armed with independent assessments that the
ban is too restrictive, could open Clinton to charges of cronyism
at precisely the moment he is trying to burnish his presidential
legacy, Rozell said. ''The timing just looks bad,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Curb 'Globalization' Effects  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Globalization has largely failed in its promise to
benefit the world's masses, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Sunday during a special summit.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to lower barriers to trade, investment and business
around the world ''can benefit humankind as a whole,'' Annan told
organizations gathered to keep an eye on a special anti-poverty
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''But clearly at the moment millions of people -- perhaps even a
majority of the human race -- are being denied those benefits,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some have lost their jobs. Others see their communities
disintegrating. Some feel that their very identity is at stake,''
he said. ''Even in the richest and most democratic countries people
wonder if the leaders they elect have any real control over
events.''
</P>
<P>
   He said governments have to work with people, organizations and
corporations to turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Private corporations produce most of the wealth in the
world,'' Annan said. ''If only for that reason, we would be foolish
to ignore them.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong U.N. gathering, dubbed the ''Social Summit,'' kicks
off Monday. It was called to review progress and failure since a
similar meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, five years ago set a goal
of eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Since that 1995 session the number of people in absolute poverty
-- living on less than a dollar a day -- has climbed about 200
million people to 1.2 billion, the United Nations estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Before Annan's speech, thousands of people protesting poor
countries' debt burdens and other global problems demonstrated
peacefully in the streets of Geneva. ''The 'social summit'
organizes social misery,'' some signs read.
</P>
<P>
   Police steered the protesters, many of whom vehemently oppose
attempts to create freer trade among countries, away from the
headquarters of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO previously was a target of demonstrators' wrath in
Geneva and Seattle. Some protesters' signs on Sunday denounced the
WTO. An effigy of Mike Moore, the organization's director-general,
depicted him as a vampire.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said organizations like the WTO, World Bank and
International Monetary Fund were created ''to help manage the world
economy and ensure that its benefits are more widely enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If some of them have pursued mistaken policies, haven't we all
at one time or another?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker won for the first time since last
Aug. 22 when the Atlanta Braves beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4
Sunday as Curtis Leskanic walked four batters in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker (1-0), who has struggled with his control all season,
relieved with two outs in the eighth and pitched 1 1-3 innings,
walking two and striking out two. He threw just 11 of 21 pitches
for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial reliever, sent to the minor leagues from June
5-14 because of his lack of control, has 33 walks in 22 1-3 innings
this season, including eight in four innings since his recall from
Triple-A Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who pitched a scoreless ninth Friday for his 12th save,
took over for Kevin Millwood, who tied a career-high with 13
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Leskanic (0-2) had even worse control. He walked Walt Weiss
on four pitches with one out, then struck out Keith Lockhart and
walked Quilvio Veras on four straight balls. Andruw Jones walked on
a 3-1 count and Chipper Jones also walked on a 3-1 pitch, forcing
in Weiss with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta batters walked 12 times in all.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, trying to win consecutive starts for the first time
since April 26 and May 1, allowed four runs and eight hits. He
walked none for the first time in 23 starts since a 7-3 win over
Arizona last Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 3-0 lead in the first, Millwood allowed Tyler
Houston's two-run homer in the second. Veras' sacrifice fly made it
4-2 in the fifth, but Marquis Grissom's two-run homer tied it in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Levrault, making his first major league start, gave up
four runs -- three earned -- four hits and five walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta went ahead in the first on an RBI single by Andruw Jones
and a two-run single by Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston left in the middle of the sixth with a sprained
left ankle. Attempting to break up a double play in the fifth, he
slid hard into second and caught his left foot on the bag. Houston
is day to day. ... Houston's homer, measured at 443 feet, was the
fifth-longest at Turner Field.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official: No Ransom Paid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim guerrillas freed a Malaysian
hostage held with 20 other mostly foreign captives in a Philippine
jungle as a gesture of goodwill and no ransom was paid, an official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief negotiator Robert Aventajado turned over the hostage,
Zulkarnain Hashim, to Malaysian Embassy officials at the
presidential palace in Manila. Zulkarnain and Aventajado flew to
Manila on Saturday night aboard a private jet.
</P>
<P>
   He was released unharmed Thursday night by Abu Sayyaf separatist
guerrillas from a mountain camp on the island of Jolo, in the
impoverished southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy because we have saved somebody but sad because other
hostages have been left behind,'' Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said news reports that Zulkarnain was freed because
of a $3 million ransom offer by representatives of the Malaysian
government in unofficial negotiations was ''a blatant lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government has a policy of not paying ransom to
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar was quoted Sunday by
his country's national news agency, Bernama, as insisting that
Malaysia had not paid any ransom or offered any kind of concession.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are still holding three Germans, two French, two
Finns, two South Africans, a Lebanese, eight other Malaysians and
two Filipinos they seized April 23 from the Malaysian diving resort
of Sipadan and brought to Jolo, an hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more violent of two Muslim
rebel groups battling Manila to set up a separate Islamic nation in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian's release was the biggest breakthrough so far in
the two-month hostage crisis that has brought international
attention to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Zulkarnain, 29, appealed for the immediate
release of the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that as soon as possible that my friends and 20 other
hostages will be released,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a dejected, low tone, furrowed his eyebrows and
slightly bowed his head occasionally before the flood of camera
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said the rebels freed Zulkarnain, a Muslim, because
he was ''the most religious among the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Zulkarnain, a forest ranger in Sipadan, had grown a beard and
looked tired but was generally in good health. While in captivity,
he was bitten by a scorpion, but he neutralized the poison by
pouring hot water on the wound and burning it with a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada, whose government has come under
mounting international pressure to secure the immediate and safe
release of the hostages, welcomed the release but Aventajado said
the Philippine leader ''expected more.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have focused on political demands, including a
separate Islamic state, protection of traditional fishing grounds
from large trawlers, many of which are foreign-owned, and the
formation of a commission to examine the problems of Filipino
Muslims living in neighboring Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Housing Money Misses Target  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. (AP) -- This industrial city has a problem many
communities in California might envy: too few houses priced
affordably but $23 million to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The plan?
</P>
<P>
   The city's redevelopment agency is studying a proposal to build
new housing on a 74-acre gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
   Putting enough rock and dirt in the pit to fill four basketball
arenas would take nearly all of the $23 million the agency has for
housing. So it will spend about $5 million to cover just a fourth
of the pit and then put houses in the depression. Some of the 175
homes will be as much as 80 feet below their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The idea initially ''failed the laugh test'' for Jan
Breidenbach, executive director for the Southern California
Association of Nonprofit Housing. She said that although she would
have to look at the plans to know the project's worth, ''it sounds
weird to be building housing down in a pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale has one of California's roughly 400 redevelopment
agencies, which get more than half a billion dollars a year in
property tax and other public money for affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   Little, however, is being done to ensure that money is spent
wisely, critics say, and even proponents acknowledge that no
uniform rules exist, despite California being home to 14 of the
country's 25 least affordable housing markets.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five agencies spent every penny of the housing money on
administration, according to a report by the state Department of
Housing and Community Development. Other agencies, looking to
minimize the housing they have to build, have spent money on
needlessly expensive projects and infrastructure that has little if
anything to do directly with housing, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Still others just won't spend the money. In 1997-98 -- the last
fiscal year for which statewide statistics are available -- four
including Irwindale, 20 miles east of Los Angeles, had more than
$10 million in their accounts for three years in a row. Of 72
agencies in Los Angeles County, only 10 had more homes in 1997 than
they did 11 years earlier, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing that's consistent is none of these cities spend
enough of what they're required to spend,'' said John Mealey, who
works with redevelopment agencies in eastern Riverside County as
executive director of the Coachella Valley Housing Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows regulators to freeze an agency's operations if
it reports a long-standing and substantial surplus but that process
may take up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Private lawsuits can have an effect. Catherine Rodman, a lawyer
for San Diego Friends of Legal Aid, won a lawsuit against the San
Diego County city of Poway, with a court finding it wrongly spent
$2.1 million in housing money on street work. Now she's considering
suing the Orange County city of Brea, which she said spent about
$30 million in housing money on downtown street construction.
</P>
<P>
   Redevelopment agencies pass bonds and can buy and develop land
in blighted areas. The additional property tax money generated by
the new development goes into the agency's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   That property tax revenue amounted to nearly $1.8 billion in
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   One beneficiary was Frank Zepeda, who three years ago moved his
family into a house built with redevelopment money just across the
street from the Irwindale gravel pit. The city helped him cover
half the cost of the $150,000 home.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other people in the town and elsewhere would love to
get the same opportunity, said Zepeda, 28, who works at In-and-Out
Burger.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of young kids waiting for a house who have to
live with their parents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Irwindale, a town of barely 1,000, defend the
gravel-pit project. The town is so full of quarries that it's hard
to find a flat place to build, said interim city manager Joe
Guzzeta.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thinks the 34-acre pit project will turn out
beautifully with the help of landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, it will have the same feeling as if it's on a
hillside looking down into a valley,'' said Guzzeta.
</P>
<P>
   Family housing also is scarce in Indian Wells, a Coachella
Valley desert community of about 3,000 where advertised rents start
at about $2,000 a month and only one of the 30 city employees
actually lives in town.
</P>
<P>
   Its redevelopment agency's actions indicate city officials want
to keep affordable housing scarce, critics say. In 1997-98, it
declared itself exempt from a state requirement that it put 20
percent of its money -- more than $3 million -- into its housing
fund, contending the city had no need for affordable housing. The
state does not need to approve the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of low-wage workers in Indian Wells; they
clean the resorts and houses and tend the sharply manicured lawns
and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But unless their employer has a maid's quarters, they likely
live in neighboring Palm Desert and La Quinta, or in Coachella,
about an eight-mile drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells Mayor Percy Byrd said his city is doing all it
needs to for affordable housing -- in part because employer housing
like maid's quarters counts toward meeting the need.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said there are no plans to build affordable housing in
Indian Wells, and the city is working to pay off redevelopment
loans and discontinue the agency by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   When that's done, he said, ''I hope we don't continue to get
these compelling requests'' to build affordable housing.
''Hopefully that will all go away.''

Japan's Ruling Coalition Suffers

   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's ruling coalition suffered painful
losses in Japan's lower house election Sunday, holding onto its majority as
expected but dropping enough seats to weaken its ability to guide the nation.
Official results were not due out until Monday, but the Kyodo News Agency and
national broadcaster NHK said Mori's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition
partners had won 271 of the 480 seats in the lower house, or 56 percent. That
would be down sharply from the 65 percent they controlled before the vote.

Vieques Island on Monday, and protesters vowed to invade the range to stop the
bombing -- the largest such operation since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong
occupation of the training ground. The Navy detained 38 people who entered the

people remained in custody today because they refused to identify themselves, a

communist North Korea are poised to repair the legacy of their conflict, but
warned that the specter of war is still vivid even after their June 13-15

reconciliation with the North. In a sign of the newly conciliatory mood, South
Korea canceled a military parade planned for Sunday, as well as reenactments of

Sen.: Suspend Federal Gas Taxes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from oil-rich

gasoline tax for the summer because of increasing pump prices. A smaller
temporary tax rollback died in the Senate in April when the rise in gas prices
slowed and oil-producing nations agreed to increase their output. In the
Midwest, gas prices top $2 per gallon in some spots. Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon
has suspended the state sales tax on gasoline for 60 days. The Illinois
Legislature will meet in special session this week to discuss repealing or
suspending the state's 5 percent sales tax on fuel.

<HEADLINE> Navy: Vieques Exercise To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy said it would begin
exercises on Vieques Island on Monday, and protesters vowed to
invade the range to stop the bombing -- the largest such operation
since a fatal accident prompted a yearlong occupation of the
training ground.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the announcement, islanders said they heard
booms on Sunday afternoon that sounded like distant explosions, at
least a dozen over a couple of hours. At least three Navy vessels
could be seen near the range and two combat planes flew over
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy spokesman could not be immediately reached to clarify
what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy detained 38 people who entered the range Saturday night
after three ships from the USS George Washington battle group
appeared on the horizon. Eight people remained in custody Sunday
because they refused to identify themselves, Navy spokesman Robert
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters said 41 people had slipped into the range on foot,
indicating that three were still there. Activist Jose Rivera
Santana said even more protesters had entered by horse, but he
wouldn't say exactly how many.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Navy doesn't respect us and we have to put ourselves at
the frontline,'' said environmental activist Alberto de Jesus. De
Jesus said he was considering entering the range by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president of Puerto Rico's Independence Party, Fernando
Martin, said he and other party leaders would enter the range in
the next two days. Party president and prominent Vieques activist,
Ruben Berrios, would not be joining the group, though, because he
would be attending a Washington summit Wednesday on Puerto Rico's
status.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques activist Carlos Ventura said he would meet with
religious, union and political leaders to arrange a peaceful
demonstration on the small island at an undetermined time and
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're preparing ourselves for a massive demonstration and we
want you to give your support,'' Ventura told a crowd a protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1999 killing of a civilian guard on the range united
Puerto Ricans as never before to demand the Navy end its six
decade-long bombing of Vieques, a 21-mile-long island off the
eastern coast of Puerto Rico. President Clinton has order the Navy
to use only inert ordnance on the island.
</P>
<P>
   A notice warned fishermen and mariners that exercises would
begin Monday and last until July 2. The notice -- dated July 21 but
posted at the ferry terminal Sunday morning -- was accompanied by a
map outlining ''areas of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters pledged to block the exercises, which would drop
about 130,000 pounds of inert bombs and shells on the range, which
takes up a third of the island. The protesters claimed to have
thwarted Navy plans to begin the bombing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Five warships plan to fire up to 600 rounds at the range and
aircraft would drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs -- including
500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs -- during two to five days of
exercises, according to the Navy. They will then join the rest of
their battle group in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has mounted since last week's publication of the
Navy's plans for the exercise -- the biggest since the April 1999
bombing accident. Federal officials evicted protesters last month,
and since then officials have arrested more than 200 for
trespassing on the range.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say six decades of live bombing have caused
environmental damage, contaminated water supplies, stunted tourism,
destroyed fishing grounds and led to a high cancer rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says Vieques is the only place its Atlantic fleet can
hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ordered the Navy to abandon Vieques by May 2003 if
the island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum
expected next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use live munitions
again.

<HEADLINE> Biologists still trying to get trumpeter swans on right path  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATAVIA, N.Y. (AP) - Showing the determination of the migrating
birds they hope to protect, scientists are again trying to restore
trumpeter swans to New York state with a couple dozen fledglings
from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on 'go,''' said biologist Donielle Rininger of the
Environmental Studies Center at Airlie in Virginia. ''We have the
federal permits from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are
awaiting the New York state permits,'' she told the Batavia Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   Rininger said 20 to 30 cygnets were picked up in Alaska and
taken to Virginia for a kind of flight training. The swans will be
trucked to the John White Memorial Game Farm in the town of Alabama
in September, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpeter swans, North America's largest waterfowl, are a
federally protected bird.
</P>
<P>
   Rininger and other biologists from Airlie began the project in
September 1998 when they trucked 20 birds to the game farm. Out of
the 20, only 13 were eventually strong enough to make a migration
behind an ultralight aircraft. The project is similar to one made
famous by the movie ''Fly Away Home'' about a Canadian who taught
geese new migration routes.
</P>
<P>
   The project has had several setbacks. The swans were deemed too
tame, something that may have cost four birds their lives in
November. The four were shot to death on the Oak Orchard refuge.
Another died of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   An $1,800 reward is posted for information leading to the arrest
of the shooters. The shooting is a misdemeanor with a sentence up
to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Indep. Counsel Won't Finish Inquiry  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The independent counsel investigating the
Clinton White House said Sunday he knows the country is tired of
his work but he will continue his ''careful evaluation regarding
the president's conduct'' until he's finished.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray said that won't be until after President Clinton
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm well aware ... that the country is weary of this
investigation,'' Robert Ray said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' He
said he wants to complete the job ''expeditiously, responsibly and
in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how public opinion might influence his decision, Ray said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Abraham Lincoln said a long time ago that public sentiment
makes everything possible, and without public sentiment, things are
very, very difficult. I am mindful of the fact of the ...
environment that I operate in. I am well aware ... that I don't
exist in a political vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I have to make a responsible decision as a prosecutor. No
person is above the law; I have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray reported last week that there was insufficient evidence to
bring charges against Hillary Rodham Clinton in connection with her
role in the mass firings of the White House travel office staff in
the earliest days of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   He had reported in March that there was no ''substantial''
evidence of wrongdoing in the wholesale transfer of FBI files to
the White House and said he would file no charges in that case,
either.
</P>
<P>
   His next move, probably by September, will be a report on the
investigation into the Clintons' roles in the Whitewater land
development in Arkansas before they entered the White House, Ray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there remains an unfinished examination of whether
Clinton lied under oath about his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. That will be concluded after Clinton
is no longer president, Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have said publicly that the matter involving the president
in connection with the Lewinsky investigation and his prior
testimony remains under investigation, and that there will be an
appropriate time to render a judgment ... and that time will come
when the president leaves office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to say whether he planned to indict Clinton after he
is out of office, but made clear he would make no effort to do
while the president is in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''An investigation continues with regard to it, and an
appropriate judgment will be made, a responsible judgment will be
made ... when the president leaves office,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Austria Warns Against EU Reform  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- As the European Union ponders
institutional reform, Austria's chancellor warned Sunday against
changes which would upset the balance between large and small
member states.
</P>
<P>
   ''One should not sacrifice balance upon the altar of
efficiency,'' Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel told the final session
of an international seminar, which included delegates from EU
members and Eastern European states seeking to join.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel's comments came against the backdrop of efforts by the
15-member EU to reform its institutions before accepting a dozen
countries, most of whom are former Communist nations of Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, the largest EU member, has been pushing for reforms
which would give bigger countries more seats on the 20-member EU
Commission reflecting population and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals call for dropping unanimity in favor of more
majority voting in EU decision making and reorganizing the 626-seat
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   However, five of the 15 EU members -- Germany, Britain, France,
Italy and Spain -- comprise two-thirds of the population within the
European Union. Small countries such as Austria, which has about 8
million people, fear a loss of influence and sovereignty in an EU
dominated by the Germans and the French.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel said the reform debate within the EU has again drawn
attention to the ''old question of balance or hegemony.'' He warned
against a concept of Europe which ''endangers the balance between
the big and the small.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian leader also took issue with remarks made last month
by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher, who said that the EU
should move toward a European Federation led by an executive branch
and two houses of legislature codified in a European constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone isn't ready to go that far right now, Fischer said a
''core group'' of countries should make the first move and the rest
can join later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The small and medium-sized states do not want to take part in
a peripheral model,'' Schuessel told the gathering Sunday. The
president of the Czech parliament, Vaclav Klaus, branded the German
idea a ''dangerous position'' which could lead ''to the
disintegration of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were already on the periphery for a long time,'' said Klaus
at the seminar, referring to decades of Soviet domination which
ended in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of domination by major powers has taken on increased
attention here following the decision by the 14 other EU members to
impose diplomatic sanctions on Austria after Schuessel's
center-right Austrian Peoples' Party formed a coalition government
with the far-right Freedom Party of Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel and other Austrian officials have complained
repeatedly that the rest of the EU would never have taken such an
unprecedented move against one of the larger EU member states.
</P>
<P>
   Austria failed at last week's EU summit to have the sanctions
removed, although the Portuguese government is working on a plan to
lift the measures gradually. Portugal hopes the plan will be
accepted before it hands the rotating presidency over to France on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Three Teams Interested in Lindros  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- The New York Rangers and Los Angeles
Kings confirmed Sunday that they have been given permission by the
Philadelphia Flyers to talk to star center Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Maple Leafs were rumored to be a third team to
approach Philadelphia about Lindros. But Leafs general manager Pat
Quinn denied he'd approached Flyers GM Bobby Clarke about Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Glen Sather said that he was interested
in talking with Lindros, who will become a restricted free agent
July 1. Charges of tampering could be applied by the NHL if teams
do not receive the Flyers' permission to talk to the player.
</P>
<P>
   After multiple concussions, Lindros' playing future is in doubt.
A salary request of more than $8 million a year, and Clarke's
publicly stated dislike for dealing with the player's agent and
father, Carl Lindros, have led to speculation the Flyers do not
want to re-sign Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have received permission to talk to Eric,'' Los Angeles GM
Dave Taylor said. ''I have his phone number, but I haven't called
him yet.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch, French Gain Euro 2000 Semis  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUGES, Belgium (AP) -- Patrick Kluivert scored a record four
goals to lead the Netherlands into the semifinals of the European
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Gonzalez couldn't even manage a penalty kick, eliminating
Spain in an agonizing loss to World Cup champion France. He covered
his face with his shirt while leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert's breathtaking outburst in a 6-1 victory over
Yugoslavia in Rotterdam on Sunday was the greatest individual
scoring display in European Championship history.
</P>
<P>
   Raul, the star of the Spanish team, sailed his penalty kick over
the bar in the last minute, leaving Spain with a 2-1 defeat in the
other quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   The results set up next week's semifinals: Portugal-France on
Wednesday in Brussels and the Netherlands-Italy on Thursday in
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch produced the most goals by a team in tournament
history. It was the first time since 1984 a team scored at least
five goals in a European Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was incredible and no one could ever have thought this,''
Kluivert said. ''We were the masters of this match.''
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert became the tournament's top scorer with six goals,
surpassing Yugoslavia's Savo Milosevic. Milosevic scored his
country's lone goal in injury time to give him five for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before a mass of singing and dancing fans bedecked in orange,
the Dutch took a 2-0 lead at the half on goals by Kluivert in the
24th and 38th minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His other goals came in the 51st and 54th minutes before coach
Frank Rijkaard removed him in the 60th minute. The Dutch continued
the punishment, with goals from Marc Overmars in the 78th and 90th
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a score like that, you have to be able to let others play
too,'' Kluivert said. ''I don't care if I'm top scorer, as long as
I get to the final.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs were missing two players because of suspensions --
Slavisa Jokanovic and Mateja Kezman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dutch were playing, while we were watching,'' Yugoslav
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj said. ''It was a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bruges, France took a 2-1 lead on a goal by Youri Djorkaeff
in the 44th minute off a pass from Patrick Vieira. Earlier,
Zinedine Zidane of France curled in a free kick in the 33rd minute
and Gaizka Mednieta of Spain converted a penalty kick in the 38th.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive play in the 90th minute was set up when French
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez pulled down Abelardo Fernandez. But Raul
sent the kick way over the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards had scored two injury time goals to beat
Yugoslavia 4-3 in their third group game. However, there was no
escape this time.
</P>
<P>
   Two spectators carrying a banner reading ''Free Basque
prisoners'' ran onto the field during Spain's national anthem
before Sunday's game. They were apprehended by security.
</P>
<P>
   Italy will be without star midfielder Antonio Conte when it
plays the Netherlands. He was kicked in the right ankle, resulting
in torn ligaments, during the 2-0 quarterfinal win over Romania. He
will miss the rest of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's other concern is captain Paolo Maldini, who is
questionable with a strained thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has won all four of its games behind the excellent play
of Figo. He was dangerous the entire way in the 2-0 victory over
Turkey on Saturday and might be the top player of Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese clearly face a more demanding opponent in the
semifinal at Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Portugal is playing a great tournament, but we still have room
for improvement,'' Figo said.

<HEADLINE> Trevino Wins Cadillac NFL Classic  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- Lee Trevino ended a 27-month victory
drought by shooting a 3-under-par 69 to capture the Cadillac NFL
Classic by two strokes in a tournament record-tying performance
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, who turned 60 in December, won impressively, easing in
a downhill 5-foot putt for birdie to finish at 14-under-par 202,
tying the tournament record set by Bob Murphy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to buy me a house down the street,'' Trevino quipped
after posting his second win in this event, where he has never
finished worse than ninth since 1993. He had 17 birdies and three
bogeys all week.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the 10th time on the Senior PGA Tour that a
60-year-old has won, with Trevino being the ninth player to
accomplish the feat, and the second this year following George
Archer. Jimmy Powell did it twice in the mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The win was a senior tour-leading 29th for Trevino, but only his
second in the last 45 months. His last win was in the Southwestern
Bell Dominion in San Antonio, Texas, on March 29, 1998. That ended
an 18-month victory drought.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino earned $165,000, pushing his earnings this year to
$411,636 and his career bankroll on the senior tour to more than $9
million, only the third player to pass that mark. Hale Irwin and
Jim Colbert have earned $10 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hall birdied the last two holes to finish off a
6-under-par 66 that put him alone in second place at 12-under-par
204. Defending champion Allen Doyle (72), Mike McCullough (68) and
Leonard Thompson (67) finished tied for third at 11-under on the
tree-lined Upper Montclair Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, who overcame a bad back to win in a playoff last year,
started the final round tied for the lead with Trevino at 11 under.
Television golf analyst Gary McCord was a shot back and playing in
the same final threesome.
</P>
<P>
   McCord was never a factor and finished with a 75, falling into a
tie for ninth in a group that included Tom Watson (67).
</P>
<P>
   After three early bogeys that gave Trevino the lead for good,
Doyle rallied to draw within two shots at No. 16, and it could have
been closer had Doyle's 12-foot birdie putt on that hole not stayed
on the lip.
</P>
<P>
   After both bogeyed the 17th, Trevino closed out the tournament,
hitting his second shot into the greenside bunker at the par-5, No.
18. His blasted out to 5 feet and sank the putt to end.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino's biggest shot of the round might have been his second
on the opening hole. His drive landed in the rough above a fairway
bunker and he had to take his stance on the second with one foot in
the trap and another out of it. His punch shot landed on the green
and he made a 3-footer for par, one of at least seven short putts
he made to save par in the round.
</P>
<P>
   When Doyle banged a 2-foot par putt off the back of the cup at
No. 2, Trevino had the lead. He stretched the advantage to two
strokes with a downhill 10-footer on the par-3 third hole and it
became three when he made another downhill putt in the 10-foot
range on the par-5 fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle fell behind by as many as five shots on the front nine. He
bogeyed No. 4 after hitting into a fairway bunker and bogeyed the
sixth after chunking a wedge from less than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle rallied with consecutive birdies on the final three holes
of the front nine to draw within two shots of Trevino, but he hit
into a greenside bunker on No. 10 to fall three behind.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, who had only one bogey in the first 51 holes of this
tournament, bogeyed No. 16 after hitting his second over the green.
Doyle had a chance to draw within a shot but left his 12-foot
birdie putt on the lip.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and Trevino put their tee shots inches apart in the bunker
on the par-3 17th and both made bogey, with Trevino getting lucky
when his shot smacked the pin hard and stayed on the green.

<HEADLINE> Isles Get Vanbiesbrouck From Flyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- The rapidly changing New York Islanders
shook up their roster some more Sunday, acquiring veteran
goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck from the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders gave up a fourth-round draft pick for
Vanbiesbrouck, who fell out of favor with the Flyers and sat on the
bench late last season while rookie Brian Boucher played.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders haven't made the playoffs in six years, and
general manager Mike Milbury is intent on ending that drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're rolling the dice a little,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck was the fourth goalie involved in a move by the
Islanders in two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Milbury traded his best goaltender, Kevin Weekes,
along with young defenseman Kristian Kudroc and a 2001 second-round
pick, to the Tampa Bay Lightning for the fifth pick in the entry
draft and two late-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Milbury used the No. 1 selection to take Boston University
goalie Rick DiPietro, making him the first goalie taken overall in
any draft.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck is expected to serve as a mentor to the
18-year-old DiPietro.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury then traded Roberto Luongo, who was considered the
Islanders' goalie of the future after being taken fourth overall in
the draft three years ago, and forward Olli Jokinen to the Florida
Panthers for forwards Oleg Kvasha and Mark Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury took left wing Raffi Torres, a 91-point scorer with the
Brampton Battalion of the Ontario Hockey League last season, with
the No. 5 pick acquired from the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   When Milbury had the No. 35 pick overall, in the second round,
he made another trade, sending defenseman Eric Brewer and left wing
Josh Green to the Edmonton Oilers for defenseman Roman Hamrlik.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury said the Islanders' new owners are not content with the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our owners didn't come into this business to wait another five
years for us to make the playoffs,'' he said. ''The danger spot
obviously is going with a youthful goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know you're going to take some criticism, but we believe
we're a better team today.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Islanders-Flyers trade was the major move during the
final day of the draft Sunday, numerous other deals were completed,
most of them involving draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   In the few exchanges involving players, Dallas sent center Aaron
Gavey, left wing Pavel Patera and its eighth-round pick in the
draft to Minnesota for defenseman Brad Lukowich and the Wild's
third and ninth picks in next year's draft; Chicago traded the
rights to Ben Simon to Atlanta for the Thrashers' ninth-round pick;
Detroit dealt Shayne Hnidy to Ottawa for the Senators' eighth-round
pick; and Toronto traded the rights to Jonathan Hedstrom to Anaheim
for the Mighty Ducks' sixth and seventh picks.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 2, Dodgers 1  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Larry Sutton, recalled from the minor leagues
earlier in the day, singled home the winning run in the ninth
inning as the St. Louis Cardinals beat Los Angeles 2-1 Sunday for a
three-game sweep of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's hit on a 3-2 pitch glanced off the glove of second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek and made him 4-for-9 as a pinch hitter
with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria walked with one out off Antonio Osuna (0-4) and
advanced when Mike Matheny sacrificed. Renteria scored from second
on Sutton's hit, giving the NL Central leaders their 11th victory
in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was optioned to Triple A-Memphis on Saturday but never
got a chance to leave town. When Eduardo Perez injured his
hamstring Saturday on his first day after being called up, general
manager Walt Jocketty tracked down Sutton before he could drive
back.
</P>
<P>
   Heathcliff Slocumb (2-3) gave up two hits in two scoreless
innings, helping send the Dodgers to their fourth straight loss.
St. Louis swept Los Angeles for the first time since August 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Starters Kevin Brown and Rick Ankiel dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who gave up a season-high four runs in his previous
start, allowed one run and five hits in eight innings and struck
out nine. He has 56 strikeouts and five walks in eight starts since
May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel allowed one run and four hits in a season-high seven
innings. He is 5-0 with a 2.34 ERA Busch Stadium but 1-3 with a
5.38 ERA on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel threw seven scoreless innings against the Dodgers on May
13, also allowing four hits. He didn't get a decision in that game,
either.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis gave Mark McGwire a day off due to general fatigue. It
hasn't been affecting his bat -- he had homered in the three
previous games, taking over the major league lead with 28.
</P>
<P>
   Brown worked out of trouble in the first after he hit leadoff
batter Shawon Dunston and J.D. Drew singled to put runners at the
corners. Brown retired nine of the next 10 hitters before the
Cardinals took the lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Howard, subbing for McGwire in the cleanup slot, singled
to start the inning, stole his first base with one out and scored
on Renteria's two-out hit.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Gilbert tied it in the fifth with his first homer since
July 3, 1997. He had been 0-for-14 since being called up June 2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brown is 3-0 his last four starts against the Cardinals,
allowing seven earned runs in 31 innings. ... The Cardinals' Shawon
Dunston, who started at third, left after two innings with a sore
right elbow. He was hit by a pitch in the first. ... Ankiel, who
has two homers, had been in an 0-for-16 slump before singling off
Brown's leg in the fifth. ... Gary Sheffield, who was 25-for-50
during a 13-game hitting streak before Saturday, is 0-for-5 with
three walks in the last two games. ... Renteria is 6-for-14 against
Brown.

<HEADLINE> Gay Pride Marked Coast-To-Coast  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Drag queens and dignitaries shared Fifth Avenue
in the always-colorful annual Gay Pride parade known as much for
its politics as its revelry.
</P>
<P>
   Gays also marched Sunday in parades in San Francisco, Chicago
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and U.S. Senate candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton marched in Sunday's event in New York, but
Clinton's new Republican rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, chose to spend the
day campaigning upstate instead.
</P>
<P>
   Political victories were celebrated as activists pointed to
passage of a hate-crimes bill in Albany and a Vermont law that
allows civil unions between homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendously significant year,'' said lesbian activist
and former White House aide Virginia Appuzzo, one of the Heritage
of Pride Parade's grand marshals. ''The changes have been
dazzling.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Mrs. Clinton shouted ''You look gorgeous'' and
''We love you'' as the first lady joined the parade accompanied by
state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton marched 20 paces behind a man in a pink tutu and a
Rollerblader wearing nothing but a thong. She gave the thumbs-up
sign and clapped her hands to the disco music.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, because of the hate crimes bill In New York and the
civil union law in Vermont, it's a year we can look back on and say
there's been some progress,'' she told reporters. ''I'm pleased to
be here on behalf of equal rights for gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which commemorates the 1969 uprising at the
Stonewall Inn credited with sparking the modern gay rights
movement, was led by Stonewall veterans in drag riding behind a
rainbow of balloons stretched across Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   There were gay ''Star Trek'' fans, AIDS activists and church
groups singing gospel music. There also were scattered protesters,
including Joseph Garber of Brooklyn, who held a sign that said,
''Sodomy is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's 30th annual Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender
Pride Parade, replete with dancing ''nuns,'' all-male cheerleading
squads and drag queens in stilettos, attracted hundreds of
thousands of revelers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What began in 1970 as a meager procession followed by an
unassuming ''gay-in'' at Golden Gate Park has become one of
California's biggest events, and one of the world's best known
celebrations of gay pride.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's parade proceeded from the waterfront to city hall,
where a seven-hour party awaited. Numerous celebrities, including
comedienne Margaret Cho, made appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the parade had proceeded peacefully, and knew of no
counter-demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, thousands of revelers lined the streets of the
city's North Side for the 31st annual Gay Pride parade.
</P>
<P>
   The parade attracted more than 200 entries, including floats,
bands and marchers representing local businesses and civic groups.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Offer Energy Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore plans to outline a
multibillion-dollar ''market-driven'' proposal to promote energy
conservation and spark development of alternative power sources,
aides said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes as consumers are complaining about high
gasoline prices that top $2 a gallon in parts of the Midwest. Gore
blames oil companies for the high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Democratic presidential contender, who spoke on
condition on anonymity, stressed that the package he plans to offer
formally on Tuesday, looks at the larger picture.
</P>
<P>
   Though described as being driven by the marketplace, aides said
the plan would require significant new government spending on a
series of direct loans and tax incentives to influence corporate
and consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Aides did not provide a cost estimate, but directed reporters to
some of the campaign's recent proposals. Last week, Gore proposed
spending $2.3 billion over 10 years on job training.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is the latest in a wave from Gore as he seeks to focus
his campaign on the nation's economic health and how he would spend
the budget surplus it has produced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entrenched interests are trying to protect the status
quo,'' said campaign spokesman Chris Lehane. ''The apologists for
them say that we simply can't have a clean environment and
affordable energy at the same time. Al Gore says we can.''
</P>
<P>
   A major portion of the proposal targets tax incentives at
''hybrid'' vehicles, some of which use alternative energy sources
and others that get very high mileage, some up to 90 miles per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The measure offers twin incentives -- to manufacturers to develop
the vehicles and to consumers to buy them. Gore says the big auto
companies have the technology in hand and are eager to move ahead
with such vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also targets similar tax incentives at an array of
appliances ranging from stoves to furnaces to homes that are
designed to be energy-efficient. There also would be incentives for
add-ons, like installing solar capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are front-end costs in some of these but long-term bills
would be lower,'' one Gore aide said. The tax breaks would
encourage consumers to make the investment, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the package would:
</P>
<P>
   -- Make funding available, through loans and tax credits, to
develop high-speed and light rail programs as an alternative for
commuters. There also would be money for cleaner buses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Spark development of alternative energy sources through
financial incentives, including tax breaks and direct loans. For
example, farmers who produce crops used for biomass energy could
get incentives that would make their land more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   -- Give incentives to utilities to replace older and dirtier
power generating stations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said the plan is designed to make the marketplace
more environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The rival campaign of Republican presidential rival George W.
Bush criticized it.
</P>
<P>
   ''After eight years of weak leadership, Al Gore is offering
nothing new. The one consistent position of Al Gore has been
support of higher gas prices,'' said Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring gas prices have put energy issues at the forefront of
the presidential contest and Gore and Bush both have sought to take
advantage of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has quoted Gore as advocating higher fuel taxes as a way to
reduce dependence on foreign oil and has charged the Clinton-Gore
administration of pursuing a ''failed'' energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Gore has accused Bush of mischaracterizing his position
and has suggested the Texas governor is vulnerable on the issue
because of his fund-raising and other ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said Bush favors policies that will help reduce the
nation's reliance on foreign oil and supports making permanent a
tax credit for research and development.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush understands that we need a comprehensive energy
policy, something this administration has failed to implement,''
Bartlett said.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 8, Yankees 7  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez homered and drove in four runs
Sunday and the Chicago White Sox survived New York's six-run,
ninth-inning rally to beat the Yankees 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the season series with the Yankees 8-4, the White Sox
won six of the final seven meetings against the World Series
champions, who have a tentative trade pending for Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took an 8-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth
after starter Mike Sirotka (7-6) had allowed just five hits through
eight strong innings and retired the final 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago called on relief ace Keith Foulke to get an inning
of work and the Yankees hammered him. He hit leadoff hitter Chuck
Knoblauch to start the ninth and then gave up singles to Derek
Jeter, Felix Jose, Bernie Williams and Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, who has been the subject of numerous trade rumors,
then hit a three-run, pinch-hit homer to make it 8-7 and finish
Foulke.
</P>
<P>
   Foulke gave up six runs in two-thirds of an inning after
surrendering only nine earned runs in his previous 45 1-3 innings.
Bobby Howry struck out Jose Vizcaino to end the game for his fourth
save.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago stayed eight games ahead of Cleveland in the AL Central
after the Indians beat Detroit 2-1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez had a two-run triple in the first inning and then hit
his 16th homer, a two-run shot in the eighth off Allen Watson that
turned out to be crucial. In the three-game series, Ordonez was
5-for-9 with six RBIs and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka (7-6), winning for the fourth time in five decisions,
allowed five singles, walked none and struck out five in eighth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Andy Pettitte (7-4), who is 5-2 in his last seven
starts with both losses to the White Sox, allowed six runs, 10 hits
and four walks in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's triple down the right-field line followed singles by
Tony Graffanino and Frank Thomas in the first. The White Sox made
it 4-0 in the third when Paul Konerko hit a two-run, bases-loaded
single after the Yankees had intentionally walked Ordonez in front
of him.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Tino Martinez singled in the fifth. After Sirotka
started a double play, he threw a wild pitch allowing Spencer to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko hit a bases-loaded fielder's choice grounder -- just
beating the throw on a double play grounder -- and Jeff Abbott
followed with a run-scoring single for a 6-1 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Paul O'Neill was ejected in the fourth inning by home plate
umpire Terry Craft after throwing down his bat and helmet following
a strikeout. O'Neill, who'd been upset by a called second strike,
went to the dugout and was ejected moments later. He raced back on
the field toward Craft. Both he and manager Joe Torre argued with
Craft as first base umpire Tim McClelland tried to get between
Craft and O'Neill. ... Yankees 3B Scott Brosius left the game after
hitting into a double play in the fifth when he hurt his right
hamstring as he ran up the line. ... The announced sellout crowd of
40,817 was the sixth of the season for the White Sox at Comiskey
Park. ... Graffanino got the start for Ray Durham, who had fouled a
ball off his foot Saturday. Graffanino responded with three hits, a
walk and a sacrifice.

<HEADLINE> Off-duty cop shot during Brooklyn robbery attempt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An off-duty police detective was in serious
condition after being shot in the chest during at attempted robbery
in Brooklyn Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Victor Romero, a six-year veteran of the force, had
just opened his family-run laundromat at 94-20 Kings Highway in
East Flatbush a little after 7 a.m., when he was approached by two
robbers, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gunshots were exchanged and Romero was struck in the chest and
wrist, Nikas said. He was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he
was in serious but stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, Antwon Jones, 26 of Coney Island, and Marvin
Young, 23, of Brownsville were also wounded in the shootout. Both
were brought to Brookdale University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is on parole from a 1993 robbery, was shot in the
pelvis, foot and arm. He was in stable condition after surgery,
Brookdale administrator Jean Francisque said.
</P>
<P>
   Young was shot twice in the leg and was also listed in stable
condition, Francisque said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudoplh Giuliani, who visited Romero in the hospital
earlier in the day, later criticized the state's parole system
while marching in Sunday's gay pride parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please understand, New Yorkers, that in more than a majority
of the states, parole no longer exists,'' he said. ''We give major
free passes to criminals. This doesn't happen in 30 other states.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Young are scheduled to be arraigned once they are
released from the hospital, Nikas said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. nuclear scientists traveling abroad have reported
being targeted by foreign agents who tried to obtain secrets by bugging hotel

   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's ruling coalition suffered painful
losses in Japan's lower house election Sunday, holding onto its majority as

Official results were not due out until Monday, but the Kyodo News Agency and
national broadcaster NHK said Mori's Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition
partners had won 271 of the 480 seats in the lower house, or 56 percent. That
would be down sharply from the 65 percent they controlled before the vote.

temporary tax rollback died in the Senate in April when the rise in gas prices
slowed and oil-producing nations agreed to increase their output. In the
Midwest, gas prices top $2 per gallon in some spots. Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon
has suspended the state sales tax on gasoline for 60 days. The Illinois
Legislature will meet in special session this week to discuss repealing or
suspending the state's 5 percent sales tax on fuel.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 6, Red Sox 5, 13 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Delgado hit a two-run homer off Pedro
Martinez -- the first homer off Martinez with a man on base in two
seasons -- and Tony Batista's RBI single in the 13th gave the
Toronto Blue Jays a 6-5 win over Boston on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are winless in Martinez's last three starts -- his
longest winless streak since losing three straight in September
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have won five straight games to move two games
ahead of New York and 21/2 in front of Boston in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Boston reliever Byrce Florie (0-2) retired the first two batters
in the 13th before Chris Woodward hit fly ball to left-center that
ticked off the glove of center fielder Carl Everett for a
three-base error. It was Boston's fourth error of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Batista lined the next pitch to right field for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Matt Dewitt (1-0) pitched one scoreless inning for his
first career win.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, just 4-for-24 in his career against Martinez, hit a
game-tying, two-run homer off Martinez in the seventh. Martinez
hadn't allowed a home run with a runner on base in 43 starts, since
Baltimore's Chris Hoiles hit a two-run shot Sept. 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who extended his hitting streak to 19 games, leads the
AL with 27 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave up three home runs for the second straight start
after allowing only three in his first 12 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Stewart led off with a homer, and Batista also homered
for the Blue Jays, who have homered in a club-record 23 straight
games, two short of the major league mark.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez allowed a season high five runs -- four earned -- and six
hits in 6 2-3 innings. He struck out 10, walked one and hit two
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto swept the three-game series and won the season series
with Boston 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took a 2-0 lead in the first on Nomar Garciaparra's
two-run double. After Stewart homered in the bottom half, Boston
made it 4-1 in the third on Scott Hatteberg's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer's RBI double in the third made it 4-2 before Boston
went back up by three on Jeff Frye's RBI single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Batista's 19th homer just made it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before allowing Delgado's homer, Martinez hadn't allowed a
homer with a runner on in 325 innings. ... Toronto SS Alex Gonzalez
is day-to-day with a strained right groin. Chris Woodward played in
is place ... Blue Jays OF Raul Mondesi is day-to-day with a
strained left wrist. Mondesi hurt the wrist while swinging a bad
Saturday. ... Boston OF Trot Nixon is day-to-day with tightness in
his right hamstring. ... Boston OF Darren Lewis missed the game
with tightness in his left hamstring. ... Martinez hadn't allowed a
leadoff homer since April 20, 1996. ... The Red Sox demoted RHP
Brian Rose to the minors. Rose, winless in his last six starts,
gave up four runs in just 2 1-3 innings in Saturday's 6-4 loss. ...
Boston's Israel Alcantara got his first major league hit when he
singled in the 12th.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Candidates Close Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Struggling at a distant third in the polls,
Mexico's main leftist presidential candidate on Sunday rejected a
call to throw his support to the top opposition candidate during
the final day of major campaigning in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox on Saturday repeated his call for Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas to join his campaign to defeat Francisco Labastida, whose
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has governed
Mexico since 1929. Most polls show Fox and Labastida locked in a
statistical tie a week before the July 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   ''To believe Fox is going to share power would be to believe one
more of his tricks,'' Cardenas told an enthusiastic crowd of
100,000 people packed into the city's main plaza, the Zocalo. Fox
had drawn a crowd almost twice large a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''To believe that we could share power with someone who
politically instigated the use of illegal money from outside the
country for his brothers and his businesses would be to become as
delinquent and unpatriotic as him.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI on Friday submitted a formal complaint to the Federal
Electoral Institute accusing Fox of illegally receiving foreign
contributions, and offered copies of checks they said proved the
case. Fox's aides insisted they have not received foreign funds and
said the checks were not evidence of it.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas vowed Sunday to win the presidency -- though most polls
show he has the support of less than 20 percent of voters. Many
Mexicans believe Cardenas was cheated out of the presidency by
widespread fraud in the 1988 election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The streets that shake with jubilation and hope don't agree
with the dozens and dozens of polls that are released every day,''
he told supporters, who waved campaign flags and chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who won Mexico City's first election for mayor in
1997, vowed to improve the lives of Mexicans -- especially the poor
-- by strengthening public education, increasing wages and fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting among 20 pedicabs decorated with Cardenas campaign
posters, Leonardo Chavez said he planned to vote for Cardenas
because of his plans to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he didn't believe Cardenas should throw his support
to Fox, even if he didn't have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Cardenas united with Fox, he would lose his popularity,''
Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox held his last rally in the capital Saturday night, drawing a
crowd of nearly 200,000 and pledging to bring democracy to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the last legal day to release election poll results,
the ACNielsen polling firm for the national Milenio newspaper
showed Labastida favored by 42 percent of likely voters, Fox by 39
percent, and Cardenas by 16 percent. The poll had a margin of error
of 2.5 percentage points, putting the top two candidates in a
statistical tie.

<HEADLINE> Advances Made for Infertile Women  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Scientists have for the first time
transplanted defrosted human ovarian tissue into a mouse, extracted
eggs and made them potentially fertilizable -- an advance that could
allow women to delay motherhood or safely restore fertility to
women who need to have their ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the technique, which is to be presented Monday
at a four-day conference of the European Society of Human
Reproduction and Embryology, would be most effective if women
freeze their ovarian tissue in their early 20s, because a woman's
capacity to produce eggs diminishes with age.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very good option for men who are having chemotherapy
-- we freeze their sperm,'' said the project's leader, Dr. Ariel
Revel, an Israeli doctor who is working at the University of
Toronto. ''We don't have anything for women. This shows that this
could be one of the ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Revel's method uses animals to foster ovaries until the eggs are
grown large enough to be extracted and stimulated to reach maturity
in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, scientists have grafted tissue into animals and
detected small eggs, but this is the first group to obtain mature,
potentially fertilizable eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Another method used in experiments last year has also been
considered a promising approach to restore fertility. Doctors were
able to transplant the ovarian tissue of a 30-year-old woman back
into her body to help her overcome the discomforts of premature
menopause. She ovulated and had a normal menstrual period.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists presented that method mainly as a way for women
undergoing cancer treatment to regain their fertility after
chemotherapy. But the ovarian tissue of women who have cancer can
contain cancer cells. Mouse studies have shown that cancer can be
transferred to mice when cancerous ovarian tissue is implanted in
their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to find a mechanism to resolve her fertility,
using her own eggs, without transferring cancer back into her
body,'' said Dr. John Yovich, director of the Pivet Medical Center
in Perth, Australia, who was not connected to the research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of those channels are interesting,'' Yovich said. ''But
the cross-species work is fraught with disaster on an ethical
level. There's a risk of transferring mouse diseases to the
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   A method avoiding animals is preferable, Yovich said. But so far
scientists have been unable to remove ovarian tissue and mature the
eggs from start to finish in the lab, without using a surrogate
body.
</P>
<P>
   Revel acknowledged there is a concern about cross-species
transplants, but said his method has ways to protect the egg from
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a string of experiments, Revel's group removed ovarian tissue
from two women in their 20s about to undergo surgery for
endometriosis, a womb-linked pelvis disease.
</P>
<P>
   Eight or 10 slivers of ovarian tissue the size of a fingertip
were grafted onto the back muscles of mice that had been
genetically engineered to have no immune system so that their
bodies would not reject the human tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The mice were injected with human fertility drugs to stimulate
growth of ovarian follicles -- the sacs that contain the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The follicles, and the eggs inside them, are at various stages
of development. The larger eggs die from the shock of the
transplant, but the smaller ones can survive and grow.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, new blood vessels form and supply the graft with
blood. The tissue was left in the mouse for about three months
until the small follicles grew big enough to respond to the hormone
injections.
</P>
<P>
   The tissue was then removed from the mouse, the eggs extracted
and brought to maturity in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   One mouse that produced an egg, produced a second the following
month from the same fragment of ovarian tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's behaving just like a human ovary,'' Revel said.
</P>
<P>
   Revel said the eggs look normal and he believes the chances that
such an egg could produce life are high.
</P>
<P>
   Simply extracting eggs from the body and freezing them has not
proven very successful because they are damaged by the process. The
approach also may not be practical.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics presented at the conference indicate that while 60
percent of defrosted sperm is viable, there's a less than one
percent chance that an egg would recover, which means 100 eggs
would have to be frozen to achieve one pregnancy, Revel said.

<HEADLINE> Reds Option Bell to Triple-A  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- With the season starting to slip away, the
Cincinnati Reds started doing something about their unreliable
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds optioned rookie Rob Bell to Triple-A Louisville on
Sunday, shaking up their rotation on the eve of an important
stretch of games against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-4 loss to San Diego dropped the Reds a season-high 8&AMP;frac12; games
behind the Cardinals in the NL Central, their biggest deficit in
two years. They play seven games against the Cardinals in the next
11 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds open a four-game series against St. Louis at home
Monday. Bell was scheduled to pitch Wednesday's game, but will be
replaced either by Elmer Dessens or Manny Aybar, both long
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds planned to call up reliever Scott Winchester from
Triple-A Louisville on Monday to take Bell's roster spot.
Winchester, 27, hasn't pitched in the majors since 1998, when he
had surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 relief appearances for Louisville this season, Winchester
had three saves and a 1-0 record with a 3.31 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds also are hoping to bring Pete Harnisch back for a game
next Friday in Arizona. Harnisch, disabled by a weak shoulder,
lasted 5 2-3 innings Sunday in a rehab start for Louisville, his
final test before being activated.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch gave up six hits and six runs -- two earned -- and didn't
walk anyone while striking out six. He gave up a first-inning homer
but allowed only two hits to the last 18 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 23, was promoted from Double-A during spring training to
be the fifth starter. General manager Jim Bowden said at the time
that he knew the club was rushing Bell to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander pitched well initially, then fell into a
four-game rut. He lasted only 4 1-3 innings Friday in a 10-7 loss
to San Diego. In his last four starts, Bell gave up 16 runs in 15
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had 15 starts and he was going backward,'' manager Jack
McKeon said. ''Hopefully he can get it together down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor starting pitching has been the Reds' biggest problem,
leaving the consensus pick to win the NL Central with a 35-38
record. The Reds are one of only two teams in the majors without a
complete game, and their bullpen leads the National League in
innings pitched.

<HEADLINE> Parade celebrates this year's legal victories  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The always-colorful gay pride parade turned into
a celebration of political victories Sunday as activists pointed to
passage of a hate-crimes bill in Albany and a Vermont law that
allows same-sex civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendously significant year,'' said lesbian activist
and former White House aide Virginia Appuzzo, one of the Heritage
of Pride Parade's grand marshals. ''The changes have been
dazzling.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade featured notable politicians and one notable absence.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani marched with the Log Cabin Republicans, a
gay GOP group, while Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped off with a
group of openly gay elected officials. Her opponent in the Senate
race, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, spent the day campaigning upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters shouted ''You look gorgeous'' and ''We love you, Mrs.
Clinton'' as the first lady joined the parade accompanied by
Manhattan Democrats state Sen. Tom Duane, City Councilmembers
Christine Quinn and Phil Reed and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, because of the hate crimes bill in New York and the
civil union law in Vermont, it's a year we can look back on and say
there's been some progress,'' she told reporters. ''I'm pleased to
be here on behalf of equal rights for gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   The march commemorates the 1969 uprising at the Stonewall Inn
credited with sparking the modern gay rights movement. The parade
was led by Stonewall veterans in drag, riding in a top-down
convertible behind a rainbow of balloons stretched across Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   To the deafening cheers of spectators, Clinton marched 2 1/2
miles of the route, from 30th Street through the heart of Greenwich
Village to the site of the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street.
</P>
<P>
   Parade-watchers packed 10 deep on the sidewalk, leaned over fire
escapes and stood on tenement rooftops chanting ''Hillary!'' as she
passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great parade!'' Clinton said, grinning broadly, waving and
giving a thumbs-up to her fans.
</P>
<P>
   The normally buttoned-up first lady even clapped her hands and
nodded her head to the beat of disco music blaring from a nearby
float. Twenty paces ahead walked a man in a pink tutu and a
Rollerblader wearing nothing but a thong.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who marched with Clinton, suggested
that her campaign capitalize on the outpouring of support by doing
an immediate voter registration drive in the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ''For gay and lesbian people to have one of the most important
women in America march in their parade turns out to be a very
important emotional experience,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has been booed in some other parades, including
the St. Patrick's Day march and the Salute to Israel event.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Lazio's absence at the gay parade, Clinton
said: ''I think it's a shame he is not here. I regret that he
decided this was not important for his schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to criticize the man who replaced him as the
Republican Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Schedules are very, very difficult when you run for office,''
the mayor said. ''I remember people feeling very, very insulted
when I didn't show up for this parade or that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchers ranged from gay parents pushing strollers and gay
''Star Trek'' fans to AIDS activists, gay church groups singing
gospel music and bare-chested men dancing to disco music.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out when I was 43. Now I have a full identity,'' said
50-year-old Ed Mannix of Brooklyn, who carried a sign that said
''Of course we have an agenda. Equality. Nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a tiny handful of protesters, including Joseph Garber
of Brooklyn, who held a sign that said, ''Sodomy is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What you do behind closed doors if fine,'' he said, ''but to
publicly display sexual conduct is a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont law many marchers were celebrating is the first of
its kind for any state. It will allow same-sex couples to form
civil unions beginning July 1, entitling them to the rights,
privileges, benefits and responsibilities of civil marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Albany, New York's state Legislature passed a bill
last week to toughen penalties for hate crimes including those
targeting gays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so much to celebrate,'' said Matt Foreman, executive
director of the Empire State Pride Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in a very long time we had legislative
victories in Albany,'' he said. ''We're on the right road and we
have a lot to be thankful for.''

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Statehood Possible Soon  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Turning up the heat on Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told thousands of
cheering supporters in the West Bank on Sunday that Palestinian
statehood could be proclaimed within weeks. ''Palestine is ours,
ours, ours!'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, accused Palestinians of deliberately placing
obstacles in the path of a Camp David-style summit. A U.S. mediator
was working to assess prospects for a three-way gathering of
Arafat, Barak and President Clinton in order to try to meet a Sept.
13 deadline for a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's speech to a conference of his Fatah faction in the West
Bank town of Nablus was full of the type of fiery rhetoric he
customarily rolls out for such occasions -- but even so, the timing
was sensitive, as the two sides move into what a senior Palestinian
official called ''the last half-hour'' of a push to reach a
sweeping accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a few weeks left ahead of us, but they are the most
important and critical, because at the end of it we will declare
statehood,'' Arafat told a crowd of about 5,000 supporters. Aides
said, however, that the timing of a statehood declaration was still
being decided.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of defiance that was cheered wildly by the crowd,
Arafat scoffed at an assertion earlier this month by Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz, Israel's army chief of staff, that Israel would use tanks
and helicopter gunships if necessary to quell any outbreak of
rioting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't get threatened by tanks and planes -- no one can
threaten us,'' said the 70-year-old Palestinian leader, his voice
strong although his hand holding the microphone trembled violently.
''Whoever has forgotten, I want to remind him of ... seven years of
intefadeh (uprising) and I say we are willing to start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also reasserted Palestinian claims to a capital in
Jerusalem, over which Israel insists it will retain sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state will be established with its capital, Jerusalem, and
whoever does not like it can go and drink from the Dead Sea,'' he
said, stabbing a finger for emphasis. ''Palestine is ours, ours,
ours!''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's comments drew quick criticism from Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ''A peace process can't exist with threats,'' he told reporters
in Jerusalem. ''If he chooses to go (declare statehood) ... in a
unilateral way, then he directly allows Israel to choose the same
method.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has indicated in the past that if Arafat declares
statehood unilaterally, it in turn will annex chunks of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, meanwhile, conferred with his Cabinet in Jerusalem about
the upcoming visit of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is
expected to arrive Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of her visit, the third to the region in a month,
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross has been meeting with both sides to try to
determine whether a summit should be held under U.S. auspices.
Israel badly wants a summit, but the Palestinians say the two sides
are too far apart for it to be productive now.
</P>
<P>
   Ross met Sunday with Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian
parliament and a senior negotiator, at his home in Abu Dis, just
outside Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Another Palestinian negotiator and cabinet minister, Hassan
Asfour, said Sunday that none of the issues in the final status
negotiations have been settled. ''Not one word of the agreement has
been put on paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak complained to his ministers that the Palestinians were
trying to ''present conditions and demands before allowing a summit
to be held,'' according to the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, though, insisted conditions were not yet ripe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want real progress before such a summit because ... you
cannot build bridges on oceans,'' Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian
planning minister, told reporters in the Gaza Strip. ''The gaps
still remain wide, and we are in the last half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak dismissed as speculative a flurry of reports that have
appeared in Israeli newspapers purporting to detail the concessions
the two sides are willing to make to achieve an accord.
</P>
<P>
   On the statehood question, Arafat has said for some time that
Palestinians would have a right to declare independence once the
Sept. 13 deadline for reaching a treaty had expired. Such an accord
is meant to encompass extremely difficult questions including the
status of disputed Jerusalem, the borders of a Palestinian state
and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Past Palestinian plans for a declaration of independence have
always been deferred in the absence of a peace pact. But Arafat's
remarks in Nablus were clearly meant to pressure Barak by raising
the specter of independence whether Israel was ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister, said the matter would
be decided next month by the Palestinian Central Council, which is
to meet July 2-3 in Gaza. ''The decision ... will most likely be to
declare statehood, but we must wait and see the decision of the
PCC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, a unilateral declaration of Palestinian
independence would pose huge problems for both sides and likely
spark widespread violence. Even so, Shaath held out the possibility
that the Palestinians might move in that direction if negotiations
stall.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we find ourselves without an agreement on Sept. 13 and not
close to reaching one, then we must tell the international
community that ... our land is occupied,'' he said. ''And on this
we will declare statehood.''

<HEADLINE> Fire 13, Claymores 10  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL PALM
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Pepe Pearson scored from 1 yard out
with 1:12 to play Sunday and the Rhein Fire went on to a 13-10
victory over the Scottish Claymores in World Bowl 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire's victory wasn't assured until Roger Hart's 40-yard
field goal attempt with four seconds to play went wide left.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured the league's two best passers in Kevin Daft of
the Claymores and Danny Wuerffel of the Fire, but neither looked
sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, who led NFL Europe with a league-record 107.3 quarterback
rating, was 16-of-29 for 177 yards and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel, the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner from Florida who
finished with a 107.2 quarterback rating, was 12-of-30 for only 90
yards with two interceptions, but he led the Fire on a 43-yard
touchdown drive for the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Rhein which trailed for much of the game, opened the scoring on
Manfred Burgsmuller's 21-yard field goal in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland, though, wasted little time in getting on the
scoreboard, going 75 yards in three plays, capped by MVP Aaron
Stecker's 36-yard touchdown, the longest scoring run in World Bowl
history.
</P>
<P>
   Stecker rushed 13 times for 92 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's 32-yard field goal with 9:03 left in the half drew Rhein
within 7-6. Burgsmuller answered with a 23-yard field goal with
4:59 remaining in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Russ Ortiz struck out a career-high 12 and won
for the first time since May 21, leading the San Francisco Giants
over the Houston Astros 4-2 Sunday for a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard went 4-for-5 and Felipe Crespo had three hits,
including a two-run single in a four-run third inning. The Giants
had 14 hits, one day after getting 22 in a 13-4 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, swept at home for the second time this season, turned
six double plays, one short of the major league record. The teams
combined for eight double plays, one shy of the NL mark for a
nine-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz (4-7), winless in five starts since beating Milwaukee
16-10, allowed two runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings. Robb Nen
pitched the ninth for his 12th save in 16 chances, retiring Jeff
Bagwell on a game-ending grounder with runner at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt (3-8) gave up four runs -- three earned -- and 12 hits
in seven innings as Houston (26-48), which has the worst record in
the major leagues, dropped 22 games under .500 for the first time
since Oct. 6, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz started the third with a walk, Benard singled and Bill
Mueller sacrificed, reaching when Holt misplayed his bunt for an
error that loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Crespo followed with a two-run single, Ellis Burks hit an RBI
single and J.T. Snow doubled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell homered in the fourth and hit an RBI single in sixth.
Lance Berkman then walked, loading the bases, but Ortiz struck out
Daryle Ward, Chris Truby and Tony Eusebio -- giving him 12
strikeouts, one more than he had May 27 against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's homer was the 124th in Enron Field this season, six
more than were at at the Astrodome last year.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Two teams have turned seven double plays in a nine-inning
game: Houston against San Francisco on May 4, 1969, and the New
York Yankees against the Philadelphia Athletics on Aug. 14, 1942.
Atlanta (June 27, 1982) and St. Louis (June 16, 1994) also
accomplished the feat in extra-inning games. ... San Diego swept a
series at Enron from April 21-23. ... Barry Bonds is 3-for-22 in
his last seven games but is hitting .327 with 27 home runs and 53
RBIs. ... Craig Biggio's next hit will be No. 1,938, making him the
Astros' career leader, a spot held until now by Jose Cruz,
currently Houston's first-base coach.

<HEADLINE> Strike To Disrupt France Air Travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Flights to and from France were expected to face
major disruptions Monday due to a planned strike by air traffic
controllers, civil aviation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Direction for Civil Aviation has advised passengers
to avoid flying on Monday if possible, since all French airports
will be affected by the one-day strike.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said 85 percent of all flights are expected to be
canceled. Air France said that it planned to operate only 15
percent of its scheduled domestic flights and 60 percent of its
long-distance flights.
</P>
<P>
   France's rail authority, SNCF, said it would provide 5,000 extra
seats to compensate for canceled flights from Paris to Geneva and
to link the French capital with major cities in the north and south
of France.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman from the civil aviation authority said that minimal
service would be maintained to major capitals around the world.
Passengers were strongly advised to check with their airline before
heading to the airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Union of Air Traffic Controllers and air traffic
controllers from other French unions called the one-day strike to
protest what they claim are plans by the European Union to
privatize their jobs.

<HEADLINE> Tollberg Defeats the Reds  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Six years ago, Brian Tollberg was making $500
a month for Chillicothe's independent league team, hoping those bus
rides through southern Ohio would someday pay off.
</P>
<P>
   They are, in a way he never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg took a shutout into the eighth inning Sunday before
winding up with a 5-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, the favored
team around the southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the San Diego Padres gave him his first major league
callup last Monday, the right-hander has started two games and won
both of them impressively.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never could have guessed this in a million years,'' Tollberg
said. ''That was my motivation for going to Chillicothe in the
first place. I'd been hoping for this since I was 5 years old. If
you keep your goal in mind, anything's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg is 27 now and finally getting that chance. With
injuries wiping out the Padres' pitching staff, manager Bruce Bochy
has gone through 10 starters already.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg became No. 10 when he was called up from Triple-A Las
Vegas. In his debut Tuesday in Arizona, he gave up only one hit and
one unearned run while striking out seven in seven innings of a 3-1
win.
</P>
<P>
   He was nearly as impressive Sunday, holding the Reds scoreless
on seven hits with seven more strikeouts before leaving with one
out in the eighth. He was charged with two of the runs that the
bullpen let in.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of his pitches are average, but he has good command and
that usually will bring good results,'' Bochy said. ''We've been
forced to keep calling guys up. He probably should have been up
earlier. He earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg throws a curve, a changeup and a fastball that only
occasionally reaches 90 mph. So far, he's been able to throw them
in the right spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''He throws strikes,'' Bochy said. ''Today he was aggressive,
had good command and could throw any of his three pitches at any
time. He goes after the hitters and is not going to beat himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg was grew up in Bradenton, Fla., went to the University
of North Florida and wound up starting his career in Chillicothe
when major league teams showed little interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd never been to Ohio before that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up living with a couple that had a 400-acre farm,
starting his career at the lowest level of pro ball. The team used
a school bus for trips to Lancaster, Newark, Erie and parts
in-between.
</P>
<P>
   His lasting memory of Chillicothe?
</P>
<P>
   ''Just that the fans were super,'' he said. ''They were real
supportive for a team with no affiliation with the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   He pitched four complete games in 13 starts for Chillicothe,
starting a climb that took him to Beloit, El Paso, Mobile and
finally Las Vegas. A sore elbow slowed him last year, but he put
himself in position to finally get a big-league call-up by going
6-0 with a 2.83 ERA in 13 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat with a plate of spaghetti and three large meatballs
resting on his lap in the Padres clubhouse, it seemed to him that
things had worked out much better than he ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you would have asked me on the day I came up if I expected
this, no way,'' he said. ''I'd have said I'd be happy just to give
them some strong outings and let them make plays behind me. So it's
special.''

Advances Made for Infertile Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Scientists have for the first time transplanted
defrosted human ovarian tissue into a mouse, extracted eggs and made them
potentially fertilizable -- an advance that could allow women to delay
motherhood or safely restore fertility to women who need to have their ovaries
removed. Scientists said the technique, which is to be presented Monday at a
four-day conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and
Embryology, would be most effective if women freeze their ovarian tissue in
their early 20s, because a woman's capacity to produce eggs diminishes with age.

Schumer: Bioterrorism Plans Lacking

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Last year's West Nile virus outbreak exposed gaping holes in
the nation's preparedness to deal with bioterrorism, a congressional report
says. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who released the report today, said the
mosquito-borne virus was ''the closest example of a dry run for a bioterrorist
attack that we could possibly face.'' Only two medical laboratories in the
country are equipped to deal with the extremely lethal viral agents a terrorist
might employ, and local hospitals would be inundated by such an emergency, he
said.

Report: U.S. Scientists Targeted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. nuclear scientists traveling abroad have reported
being targeted by foreign agents who tried to obtain secrets by bugging hotel
rooms, rifling briefcases and computers, or offering sexual favors, a
congressional investigator says. A report based on information gathered by the
Energy Department's counterintelligence office identified at least 75 such cases
in recent years involving trips by scientists from federal weapons labs. The
Energy Department said today it agreed with the findings, which were largely
based on data the department provided.

Sen.: Suspend Federal Gas Taxes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from oil-rich
Texas, said today that Congress should suspend the 18.4-cent per gallon federal
gasoline tax for the summer because of increasing pump prices. A smaller
temporary tax rollback died in the Senate in April when the rise in gas prices
slowed and oil-producing nations agreed to increase their output. In the
Midwest, gas prices top $2 per gallon in some spots. Indiana Gov. Frank O'Bannon
has suspended the state sales tax on gasoline for 60 days. The Illinois
Legislature will meet in special session this week to discuss repealing or
suspending the state's 5 percent sales tax on fuel.

<HEADLINE> Peru Opposition Leader Calls on OAS  </HEADLINE>
By BEATA PASEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Former Peruvian presidential candidate
Alejandro Toledo on Sunday called on the Organization of American
States to recommend new elections when a delegation visits his
country this week.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS mission should say ''we need to go through the process
of strengthening democratic institutions ... and that means
performing early elections,'' said Toledo during the World Forum on
Democracy in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo boycotted the May 28 presidential runoff, claiming it was
rigged in favor of President Alberto Fujimori, who won an
unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   An OAS election mission refused to monitor the runoff vote,
saying the election was ''far from what could be considered free or
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 34-nation organization later rejected calls from the
United States to question Fujimori's win or consider collective
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the OAS on Tuesday is sending the mission to work with
the government and the opposition to strengthen democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they close their eyes, if there is no important
declaration, the country will be even more paralyzed than it is
now,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the international community has a responsibility to
monitor countries where democracy is in jeopardy because ''the new
style of dictatorship is likely to spread across the whole region
of Latin America, and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a long battle,'' said Toledo. ''I've decided to give
my life to recuperating democracy in my country, no matter what the
price may be.''

<HEADLINE> Top student criticizes Regents, new standards at graduation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUDSON FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A top student seized the moment at her
high school graduation to blast the state Board of Regents that
radically raised academic standards since her freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sometimes felt that grades were the only thing that
mattered about us,'' said Sarah Carman, salutatorian at Hudson
Falls High School. 'The humanness of the students seemed brushed
aside by the pressure to raise the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in Saturday's graduation that the new expectations set
by the Regents and the plan to phase in required, tougher Regents
examinations and Regents diplomas for almost all students created
division among students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the new higher standards is to improve
education,'' Carman said to her class of 122 graduates at the rural
school 46 miles north of Albany. ''But it set up another wall
separating us from one another. Those who did well felt like geeks.
Those who didn't do well felt like idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Regents is raising academic standards required for
graduation and phasing out general diplomas that have been issued
by schools using lesser standards. State education officials said
that most students appear to be rising to the challenge.

<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - Police responded to reports of bodies in
three of upstate New York's most fierce rivers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Sheriff's deputies were trying to identify a
female body found Sunday in the Hudson River in Queensbury, about
40 miles north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Sheriff's Sgt. John Shine says an autopsy is
scheduled for Monday on the body found before 3 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to figure out how the body got
into the river. Police aren't releasing any details that could
identify the body.
</P>
<P>
   Niskayuna police are also hoping an autopsy will help identify a
body found Saturday about 15 miles west of Albany in the Mohawk
River. Police said evidence at the scene indicate the person may
have come from Arizona. Police say the body is believed to have
been in the water about five days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in Binghamton, two women at a diner along the
Susquehanna River reported that they saw a boy fall off an inner
tube into the churning river below a dam.
</P>
<P>
   No boy has been reported missing, but police searched. The
effort was called off hours later when no body was found. and
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fourth search since April in the Susquehanna River.
A Binghamton University student was found three weeks after he

<HEADLINE> Con Edison and union avoid strike with new contract agreement  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Consolidated Edison workers will be asked to
approve a new contract proposal, described by a union spokesman as
a ''win-win'' agreement, reached in negotiations early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 4 a.m. deal headed off a strike that would have affected
about three million Con Ed customers in New York City and 300,000
in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mangione, spokesman for Con Ed employees in Local 1-2 of
the Utility Workers of America, said the agreement ended ''a long
and difficult process of collective bargaining'' on behalf of 9,000
Con Ed employees.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposal would be submitted to the union's 27-member
board on Monday and if approved as expected, would be put to a
membership vote by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Separate agreements were reached for 1,000 employees at NRG
Energy, Orion Power and Keyspan Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Mangione called it a ''win-win situaton'' for the workers and
for Con Ed's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed spokeswoman Joy Faber said: ''We are pleased to have
reached a tentative settlement that is fair to the men and women of
Con Edison who provide such an important service to our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Petta, another Con Ed spokesman, said the utility would not
comment on the agreement before it goes to union members for a
vote. A date for the vote was not immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   Mangione also withheld details of the tentative pact, but said
the union had won ''across-the-board'' concessions in wages,
pensions, medical benefits and job security from Con Ed. ''Most
importantly, the union was able to beat back what became the major
stumbling block, which was reductions in sick time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mangione said the companies would have had difficulty
maintaining services in a walkout, but Con Ed said managers and
supervisors were ready to step in and customers would not have been
affected.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Election Said Tainted  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabweans voted peacefully and in
strong numbers Sunday in the final day of parliamentary elections,
but international observers declared the polls tainted by a dirty
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The country's most closely contested parliamentary election
since it gained independence was marred by violence and
intimidation during the campaign and therefore not free and fair,
said Pierre Schori, the head of the European Union observer
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Schori said Monday that although the two days of voting ending
Sunday evening were conducted with efficiency and professionalism,
the run-up to the balloting had flawed the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The term free and fair elections is not applicable to these
elections,'' Schori said in an interim statement.
</P>
<P>
   Schori will issue a full report on the election next week, after
the votes have been counted and the country's reaction to the
results assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Mariyawanda Nzuwah, head of the elections directorate, said he
expected at least a 60 percent voter turnout, the highest level of
voting since the first post-independence elections of 1980. Only 29
percent of registered voters cast ballots in the 1995 parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ruling party of President Robert Mugabe and the
country's main opposition group predicted they would win control of
the parliament when results begin to be announced later on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overwhelming voter turnout that we've experienced in this
country can only mean one thing -- change,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai,
leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe refused to comment on the election at a news conference
following a mini-summit with Zimbabwe's military allies in the
Congo civil war. But his ruling party has insisted it will continue
to dominate the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, squads of riot police armed with rifles began
blocking roads leading to Harare's main police barracks, next to
Mugabe's house. Police would not comment on their actions.
</P>
<P>
   With Zimbabwe's economy in shambles and the government riddled
with corruption, the newly formed MDC poses the most serious
challenge to Mugabe's ruling party since it led the country to
independence from white-minority rule 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''These elections are about real freedom, real freedom from
corrupt, inept, arrogant, egoistic leadership that has been running
this country,'' Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai claimed that if his party does not win a majority of
the elected seats, then the vote will have been rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Even a strong victory, however, may not guarantee the MDC
control of the 150-member parliament. Since 30 members are
appointed by Mugabe, Tsvangirai's party would need to win at least
76 of the 120 contested seats to have a majority. Tsvangirai
predicted it would.
</P>
<P>
   A win that large would be a near revolution in a country where
the ruling party controlled all but three of the seats in the
previous parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At least 2.8 million people, or 55 percent of the 5.1 million
registered voters, had cast their ballots by 2 p.m. Sunday in the
two-day election, Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said. However,
many polling stations had not reported their figures and the final
count was expected to be significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has two years left on his term and will not step down
unless the opposition gains a two-thirds majority in parliament and
then changes the constitution to remove him, said John Nkomo,
chairman of the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union
Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
   That overwhelming total, 101 of the 120 contested seats, is
considered to be well beyond the MDC's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The election campaign was marred by months of political
violence, much of it instigated by ruling party militants, leaving
more than 30 people dead. Human rights activists and opposition
officials accused Mugabe's party of using the violence to scare
opposition supporters away from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactic did not seem to work on the country's 5.1 million
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of voting Saturday, lines of hundreds of voters
snaked around some of the country's 4,000 polling stations. Amid
scattered reports of intimidation and voting irregularities, voter
turnout continued to be strong Sunday, though the state elections
directorate said the lines were much shorter and many polling
booths had no lines at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Goromozi, 12 miles east of the capital, Harare, about a dozen
voters lined up late Sunday morning outside a courthouse to vote
beneath the gaze of a cracked photo of Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are now feeling that it's high time we have a change.
Twenty years is too long for a government to run a country,'' said
Graciano Jeremiah, 29, who works in video production.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters refused to talk with reporters, saying only that
their vote was secret.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition MDC staged a last-minute information campaign
intended to dispel rumors the ruling party had installed cameras in
the voting booths and would exact retribution against opposition
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of violence, however, did depress voter turnout in some
districts, Tsvangirai said, adding that his party would ask to have
those results nullified.
</P>
<P>
   Nzuwah, the head of the elections directorate, denied reports of
violence or unruly behavior.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 4, Orioles 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Tom Lampkin hit his first career grand slam as
the Seattle Mariners rallied in the eighth inning to hand the
Baltimore Orioles their ninth straight loss, 4-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who have six straight, swept the Orioles in a
four-game series for the first time in their history. It was also
Seattle's first four-game sweep at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Sidney Ponson took a three-hitter and 2-0 lead into
the eighth inning before faltering. He walked Stan Javier and Alex
Rodriguez to open the inning and was replaced by Alan Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin (2-3) came in with two outs and runners on first and
second and blew his third save of the season. He hit Mike Cameron
with his first pitch before Lampkin drilled a 2-1 pitch to right
field to give Seattle the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes (2-2) struck out all three batters he faced in the
eighth, and Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 14th save in
16 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Baines and Charles Johnson hit solo homers for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners won for the second straight day despite getting
only four hits. They beat Baltimore 2-1 on Saturday behind John
Halama's strong pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott did the job Sunday, but ended up with a no-decision.
He allowed only four hits and two runs over seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott has allowed three or fewer runs in all but one of his 10
starts this season. In his last five outings, he is 3-1 with a 2.32
ERA (31 IP and 8 ER).
</P>
<P>
Notes: Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff extended his hit streak to 19
games with a single in the second inning to match Detroit's Juan
Encarnacion for the longest streak in the AL, and second longest in
the majors this season. ... Despite going 1-for-12 in the series,
Cal Ripken Jr. more hits against Seattle (256) than any other team.
... Seattle's Edgar Martinez is 0-for-11 in his last three games.

<HEADLINE> Iran Media Crackdown Defended  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's hard-line judiciary closed another
reformist newspaper Sunday and defended its media crackdown as a
way of upholding the country's Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
   Bayan became the 19th newspaper ordered to shut down in the past
two months. Its closure coincided with a Tehran Justice Ministry
statement responding to a letter from 151 lawmakers that had urged
an end to such measures, saying they had tarnished Iran's
reputation at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, published Sunday in the hard-line daily Jomhuri
Eslami, said the judiciary is obligated to enforce the views of
Islamic experts, including Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judiciary considers it an obligation ... to ease their
concerns about the media attacks against religious sanctities and
the attempts at undermining Islamic principles,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the country and the judiciary were to seek international
approval, we would have to eradicate our religious government and
establish a secular, liberal political system, which was what the
banned newspapers had been trying to do,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Reformists, who swept Feb. 18 elections and ousted hard-liners
from parliament after 20 years of control, have promised to give
priority to press and political reforms. The lawmakers' letter,
read out last week in parliament, was the first strong attack on
the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Alireza Nouri, who signed the letter, said reformist lawmakers
had started with a letter but soon would pass bills to promote
press freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist legislators also are trying to get rid of the
hard-line Guardian Council's supervisory role in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Iran Islamic Participation Front, the country's largest
reformist party with more than 60 members in parliament, issued a
statement Sunday urging an amendment of the election laws.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 1997 election, President Mohammad Khatami has eased
many social, political and cultural restrictions the clerical
establishment seeks to maintain. But Khamenei is the final
authority in Iran, and all bills passed by the legislature must be
approved by the Guardian Council. Hard-liners also control the
military and the broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, an activist detained in April for spreading
anti-Iranian propaganda was released on $62,500 bail, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said. It said a trial date has not
been set for Ali Afshari, head of Iran's largest student group, the
Office for Fostering Unity.

Advances Made for Infertile Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Scientists have made an advance that could allow women
to delay motherhood or safely restore fertility to women who need to have their
ovaries removed. For the first time scientists have transplanted defrosted human
ovarian tissue into a mouse, extracted eggs and made them potentially
fertilizable. The technique, which is to be presented Monday at a four-day
conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, would
be most effective if women freeze their ovarian tissue in their early 20s,
because a woman's capacity to produce eggs diminishes with age.

mosquito-borne virus was ''the closest example of a dry run for a bioterrorist

Rodham Clinton marched in Sunday's event in New York, but Clinton's new
Republican rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, chose to spend the day campaigning upstate
instead.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. nuclear scientists traveling abroad have reported
being targeted by foreign agents who tried to obtain secrets by bugging hotel
rooms, rifling briefcases and computers, or offering sexual favors, a
congressional investigator says. A report based on information gathered by the
Energy Department's counterintelligence office identified at least 75 such cases
in recent years involving trips by scientists from federal weapons labs. The
Energy Department said today it agreed with the findings, which were largely
based on data the department provided.

   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Juli Inkster won the LPGA Championship again, this
time with 4-over 75, the highest closing score by an LPGA champion in at least

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb In Spain Injures 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GETXO, Spain (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in a wealthy residential
zone of this small Basque town early Sunday, injuring seven people,
emergency services said.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous phone caller said the Basque separatist group ETA
claimed responsibility for the blast in Getxo, 12 miles east of
Bilbao. The caller told the regional newspaper Gara that the attack
was aimed at ''the oligarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency services in the northern Basque region had received a
phone tip that the bomb would go off in 15 minutes on a street in
the wealthy Las Arenas district, known to be populated by some of
the leading members of the Basque business elite.
</P>
<P>
   Police were able to close off the street and alert residents
before the bomb exploded just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martin, spokesman for the regional government, said the
blast shattered windows and produced a big crater in the street.
The car bomb, a white Mercedes with French license plates laden
with 110 pounds of explosives, burst into flames and set two nearby
vehicles on fire.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people were slightly injured with cuts and bruises
and were treated at the scene. Two women and a 12-year-old boy with
minor injuries were taken to a local hospital in the nearby port
city of Bilbao and were released some hours later, said Basque
Interior Minister Javier Balza.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- the initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom -- has
killed some 800 people during a 30-year campaign for independence
of the Basque region of northern Spain. ETA is blamed for five
killings since ending a 14-month cease-fire late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Security force members top the list of ETA targets, but in
recent years, politicians have also been victimized, especially
city councilors of the governing Popular Party and the opposition
Socialist party.
</P>
<P>
   Getxo's mayor, Inaki Zarroa, visited the scene and said that the
explosion had been very powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had luck today,'' the mayor said, expressing relief
that no one had been killed. ''But we need to condemn this action.
It's time that these actions disappear, that ETA disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Basque businessmen live in the area, including
the family of businessman Cosme Delclaux, who was released by ETA
after his family reportedly paid a hefty ransom after his
kidnapping three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has commonly used extortion against Basque businessmen to
finance its armed campaign for independence. The group calls the
money it collects in this way a ''revolutionary tax.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Not in Tigers' Lineup  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers stayed in town for another
day, and so did Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who may soon be dealt to the New York Yankees, wasn't
in the lineup and didn't play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it had nothing to do with a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez fouled a ball off his left ankle during Saturday
night's game and was still hobbling around the Tigers' clubhouse
following Sunday's 2-1 loss to the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''See you guys tomorrow,'' Gonzalez told reporters after
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Tigers and Gonzalez's agent, Jim Bronner, were
negotiating Sunday, trying to determine if they could finalize the
deal, according to a baseball official familiar with talks who
spoke on the condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no confirmation, it appeared the sides and the
commissioner's office had agreed to an extension of the deadline to
complete the trade, which originally was Sunday. The sides planned
additional talks Monday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which dropped two games behind AL East-leading Toronto
with an 8-7 loss at Chicago, also was still talking with the
Chicago Cubs about a possible trade for Sammy Sosa, and with other
teams, too, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, according to a Yankees official speaking on the
condition of anonymity, gave the Yankees several combinations of
players they would accept for Sosa, and there have been
back-and-forth talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs appear to have become impressed with Alex Graman, a
left-hander from Indiana State taken by the Yankees on the third
round in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he expected to hear from his agent later Sunday,
but had no idea if the talks had progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know, I've been here,'' he said. ''I don't know what's
happening outside the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   New York and Detroit agreed Thursday to the tentative trade that
would send outfielder Ricky Ledee, third base prospect Drew Henson
and minor league pitcher Randy Keisler to Detroit for Gonzalez.
However, they need Gonzalez's permission.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for completing the deal originally was Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What time is it?'' Tigers manager Phil Garner asked before
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Garner's office phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner had a brief discussion with Tigers general manager Randy
Smith, but said there was no news.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be kind of funny when people see he's not in the
lineup,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Garner didn't have any further information postgame.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea,'' he said. ''You guys I'm sure know more than
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers and Indians are scheduled to complete their five-game
series Monday night before Detroit returns home for a three-game
series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who has the right to block a trade to the Yankees, had
difficulty walking after Saturday's game when the Tigers rallied
from a 7-0 deficit behind three homers from Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said he has been pleased with how Gonzalez, a two-time AL
MVP, has handled the pressures of the past few days since news of
the possible blockbuster deal broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he just wants to play ball,'' Garner said. ''Juan
sometimes wears his heart on his cuff, but I think he's doing
pretty well with this.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officer Stabbed in S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. Army doctor was in serious
condition after being stabbed with a knife by a South Korean man on
a busy Seoul street, the U.S. military and South Korean police said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, identified by South Korean police as Maj. Barry
David, was stabbed in the chest during a brawl with a South Korean
man on Sunday at Itaewon near the main U.S. military compound, both
sides said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker, identified by South Korean police as Lee Yong-kyu,
36, was picking up two knives from a roadside garbage can when the
American officer passed by, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee told police he became angry after the American said
something that insulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know exactly what happened, but Lee's testimony
indicates that he is not mentally stable,'' said Kim Joon-su, a
lieutenant at Yongsan Police Station.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military confirmed that the doctor was hospitalized
with stab wounds but refused to disclose other details, including
his name and hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crimes are rare in South Korea, especially against
Americans. About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Sunday's BB Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Tigers-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT: Scoring is difficult for the Tigers, who are last in
the majors in runs scored and several other offensive categories.
With Sunday's 2-1 loss to the Indians, the Tigers have now scored
two runs or fewer 32 times this season. ''We are a team that
doesn't walk,'' said manager Phil Garner. ''When you don't walk and
you don't get runners on base, then the stats are going to catch up
to you.'' ... And when the Tigers do have a big game, they can't
seem to follow it up with another. Detroit is now 1-8 the day after
scoring 10 runs or more. The Tigers won 14-8 on Saturday night. ...
3B Dean Palmer is day-to-day after straining his groin while
sliding into second base in the second inning. ... Hideo Nomo's
second career relief appearance on Saturday night had Garner and
his Tigers teammates kidding the right-hander that he has a new
role. ''I told him he was our closer, and he just laughed,'' Garner
said.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Paul Shuey made his second rehab start for
Double-A Akron on Sunday, pitching a scoreless inning against
Bowie. Shuey had hip surgery on May 30 and has recovered way ahead
of schedule. ... Utilityman Enrique Wilson, whose homer in the
eighth inning beat the Tigers on Sunday, is batting .364 with two
homers and seven RBIs in his 17 starts this season. ''Enrique is
making me like him more and more,'' said Indians manager Charlie
Manuel. ''You guys talked me into using him.''
Yankees-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Ricky Ledee is doing is best to put aside the
distraction of hearing his name in trade rumors for Juan Gonzalez
and Sammy Sosa. ''They want players who can carry a team. I can't
be compared to those guys,'' Ledee said. ''The only thing I can do
is do my job until they stop it.'' ... Manager Joe Torre said RHP
Ramiro Mendoza is fine after leaving Saturday's game in the sixth
inning because his shoulder stiffened up. Although Mendoza said he
was scared by the problem, Torre said it was nothing major. The
Yankees will cut back on Mendoza's daily workouts in an effort to
solve the problem. He's not scheduled to miss any starts. ... Torre
says the Yankees have had trouble with consistency all season and
most recently pitching has been the culprit. ''I don't care if you
have Ruth, Gehrig and Mel Ott, if you can't get 27 outs, you are
going to have trouble winning games,'' he said. ''I don't think
we're concerned with how good we are, I'm just concerned about how
often we can be good.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox finished a tough two-week stretch against
the Indians and Yankees with 11 wins in 14 games and built their
lead in the AL Central to eight games. Does that make the White Sox
the team to beat in the AL? ''I'll never say that until we win a
ring,'' Frank Thomas said. ''The New York Yankees are still the
team to beat. And Cleveland is still the Central Division team to
beat.'' ... 2B Ray Durham, who fouled a ball off his foot Saturday,
got the day off. Tony Graffanino filled in and had three hits. ...
Through 75 games, the White Sox are 48-27. In 75 games last season,
they were 37-38 and 12&AMP;frac12; games behind Cleveland.
Orioles-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles are on pace to hit 329 doubles,
shattering the club record of 2999, done in 1996 and 1999. ... The
four hits allowed by the Orioles pitchers on Saturday was a season
low. Baltimore allowed only four hits again Sunday, but lost both
games.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The last time the Mariners won six straight games was
July 29-Aug. 3, 1999. ... The longest winning streak the Mariners
have had at Safeco Field is six games.
Royals-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals juggled their lineup Sunday, putting
Luis Ordaz in the leadoff spot for the second time this season and
batting Joe Randa second for the first time. Ordaz, who had two
hits and drove in a career-high three runs on Saturday, made his
other leadoff appearance on April 23 at Seattle. ... The Royals
ended a six-game trip with a 2-4 record, losing two out of three in
Anaheim and Oakland. Kansas City opens a nine-game homestand
Tuesday against Cleveland. ... Johnny Damon and Mike Sweeney are
among the Royals who will spend the off-day Monday playing in the
Medical Center of Independence Benefit Golf Classic, proceeds of
which will be used to purchase equipment for the surgery
department.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: DH John Jaha returned to the lineup after missing three
games with strep throat. He went 0-for-2 with two walks. ... The
A's have used 64 starting lineups in 74 games this season. Last
year, Oakland used 133 different lineups. ... Manager Art Howe said
Ariel Prieto's turn in the rotation will be skipped Wednesday
against Texas, thanks to two days off since his start last week.
Prieto, promoted from the minors because of an injury to Omar
Olivares, has his next start scheduled for July 1 at Anaheim.
Red Sox-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Boston has lost five straight to Toronto. ... The Red
Sox were swept for the second time this season. ... The Red Sox
matched a season high with four errors. ... Pedro Martinez gave up
his first leadoff homer since Nelson Liriano hit one off him on
April 20, 1996 in Montreal. ... Martinez pitched 6 2-3 innings. It
was only the second time this season he hadn't finished an inning
that he started. ... Boston pitchers have allowed 26 home runs in
their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays had their fourth consecutive three homer
game, and their eighth consecutive multihomer game. The major
league record for consecutive multihomer games is nine. ... The
Blue Jays have won 14 of their last 19 games. ... Chris Carpenter
has allowed 14 earned runs in his last two starts. ... Toronto's
bullpen pitched 9 2-3 shutout innings.
Devil Rays-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Juan Guzman will have exploratory arthroscopic
surgery on his right shoulder Tuesday. Dr. James Andrews will
perform the operation in Birmingham, Ala. Guzman has been on the DL
with tendinitis in his right shoulder since April 8, the day after
his only start of the year. ... Tampa Bay plays 15 of its next 18
at Tropicana Field, where it has won three straight series for the
first time in franchise history. ... Roberto Hernandez's save
Saturday was the 344th of his career, tying the late Dan
Quisenberry for 17th all-time.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Rangers manager Johnny Oates isn't about to blame his
coaching staff for his team's woes. Oates said that if management
wanted to fire a coach, they'd have to fire him first. ''I wouldn't
have hired them if I didn't believe in them,'' Oates said. ...
Oates was hoping to start Kenny Rogers on three days rest Thursday
in Oakland for the finale of a three-game series against the
division-leading Athletics. It also would enable Rogers to get in
an extra start before the All-Star break.
Twins-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: OF Brian Buchanan, part of the four-player package
acquired in 1998 for Chuck Knoblauch from the Yankees, was named
the organization's minor league player of the week after going
8-for-23 with 4 homers and 12 RBIs with Triple-A Salt Lake. ...Even
after a rare multihomer game Saturday (only their 10th), the Twins
have been outscored 2-to-1 on long balls. The opposition has scored
168 runs on 104 homers, while the Twins' 58 homers have accounted
for 84 runs. ... C Marcus Jensen had a career total of 14 RBIs in
99 games before driving in five Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Rookie C Bengie Molina tops all AL catchers with 18
runners caught stealing. ... 3B Troy Glaus (lower back spasms)
missed his first game of the season, leaving Mo Vaughn as the only
Angel to have played all 74 games. ... Justin Baughman, who missed
all of the 1999 season with a compound leg fracture, started at
second base Sunday in his first big-league appearance since 1998.
... Reflecting their lack of a pure DH, the Angels have used eight
players in that role this season.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Phillies-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Andy Ashby threw before the game and GM Ed Wade
said that Ashby will be activated from the 15-day DL and start
Wednesday. ... Rookie 1B Pat Burrell went 3-for-4, including an RBI
single to drive in the Phillies' only run, to raise his average to
.259. He also committed his fourth error in 29 games. ... Despite
the loss, Philadelphia went 4-2 on their road trip, which included
winning two of three in New York.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: LF Rondell White went 0-for-3 and left following the
sixth inning because of stiffness in his left knee. ... 2B Jose
Vidro and RF Vladimir Guerrero homered, and both also went 2-for-3.
Vidro, who raised his average to .371, singled in the first to
become the first National Leaguer to reach 100 hits this season.
The hit also tied his career-best hitting streak of 10 games, set
last season. His 12th homer tied his career-high, also set last
year. Guerrero's 21st homer raised his average to .365.
Dodgers-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Orel Hershiser, who threw 27 pitches in 1 1-3
innings in Saturday's rain-delayed game, will start Monday against
San Diego. He left the game after the 3-hour, 16-minute delay in
the second. ... Todd Hundley was 3-for-4 Saturday in the second day
of his rehab assignment at Triple-A Albuquerque. He has been on the
DL since May 31 with a strained right rib-cage muscle and is
scheduled to join the team Monday. ... C Paul LoDuca is 9-for-26
during a seven-game hitting streak since being called up June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Darryl Kile, who pitched two innings in Saturday's
rain-delayed game, will make his next start Tuesday at Cincinnati.
... Reliever Mark Thompson was called up after the game and John
Ambrose was sent back to Double-A Arkansas. Thompson made three
starts at Memphis and Sunday was his fourth day of rest, so he was
unavailable. Control problems figured in his demotion. ''I was
pitching too fine instead of going right at people,'' Thompson
said. ''I've always been more aggressive as a starter, and I need
to keep going right at guys.'' ... Eduardo Perez, who hurt his
hamstring on a double Saturday in his first game after being called
up, said the injury wasn't serious. He was placed on the DL mainly
because a number of players are nursing minor injuries. ''They're
short on the bench, so they can't be another guy short for a few
days,'' Perez said. ... The Cardinals signed LHP Allen McDill,
released earlier this year by the Detroit Tigers, and assigned him
to Memphis.
Giants-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Barry Bonds was the only Giants starter who
didn't get a hit in Saturday's 22-hit, 13-4 victory over the Astros
but that's not the reason he wasn't in Sunday's starting lineup.
Manager Dusty Baker tries routinely to give his slugger a rest. ''I
have been planning to give him the day off anyway,'' Baker said.
''With two straight day games it seemed like a good time.'' ...
Baker removed Ellis Burks early in Saturday's blowout and he was
back in the lineup on Sunday. ''I didn't want to have Ellis and
Barry out both on the same day but getting Ellis out (Saturday), he
can go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Reliever Billy Wagner will fly to Los Angeles on Monday
to get a second opinion on his injured elbow. Wagner likely will
miss the rest of the season and is facing surgery to repair a
partial tear of the flexsor tendon in his left elbow.
Cubs-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs optioned OF Gary Matthews Jr. to Triple-A Iowa
to make room for starter Ruben Quevedo. ... Ismael Valdez, who was
scratched this weekend, will start on Friday for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Derrek Lee has three homers the past two games after
not homering at home since Aug. 5, 1998. Only four his first 35
career homers came at home. ... Lee's homer in the seventh traveled
482 feet, the longest ever at Pro Player Stadium by a Marlin. ...
Marlins C Mike Redmond, who sprained a ligament in his right knee
June 17 at Pittsburgh, returned to the starting lineup. He threw
Brown out attempting to steal in the first inning. ... It was
Florida's first three-game sweep of the Cubs since April 1-3, 1997.
Padres-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Eric Owens had his NL-leading 33rd multihit game,
raising his batting average to .345. ... Phil Nevin hit into his
12th double play, second in the NL to Dante Bichette's 13. ... The
Padres and the Reds remain the only two teams in the majors without
a complete game. ... In his two appearances during the three-game
series, closer Trevor Hoffman gave up seven hits and three runs in
2 1-3 innings. ... Eddie Taubensee's pinch RBI single Sunday left
him 8-for-15 career against Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Starter Rob Bell was optioned to Triple-A
Louisville. Either Elmer Dessens or Manny Aybar will take his start
Wednesday against St. Louis. ... The Reds plan to call up reliever
Scott Winchester from Triple-A Louisville on Monday to take Bell's
roster spot. Winchester hasn't pitched in the majors since having
surgery in 1998 for a torn rotator cuff. ... The Reds fell a
season-high 8&AMP;frac12; games behind St. Louis in the NL Central, their
biggest deficit since they finished the 1998 season 25 games out.
... With Pokey Reese sidelined by a sprained ankle and Chris Stynes
slowed by a sore hamstring, Juan Castro made his first start of the
season at second base.
Pirates-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Manager Gene LaMont and pitching coach Pete
Vuckovich did not last long Sunday as both were ejected by
first-base umpire John Hirschbeck following the first inning. The
ejections stemmed from an argument about players sitting at the top
of the dugout and yelling at the umpires. Vuckovich, who was thrown
out by Hirschbeck on Friday for arguing a balk call, was tossed
first Sunday. ''One thing led to another,'' LaMont said as to why
the two were kicked out. ... The Pirates have only one hit in their
last 13 times up with the bases loaded -- John Vander Wal's grand
slam last Wednesday. Bruce Aven struck out on just three pitches in
Pittsburgh's only chance on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: OF Jason Tyner was sent down to Triple-A Norfolk.
Tyner, the Mets' first-round draft pick in 1998 was hitting only
.195 in 13 games. INF-OF Mark Johnson was recalled from Norfolk.
... Derek Bell has reached base in 10 of 11 plate appearances,
after going 2-for-3 with a walk Sunday. ... It was Tom Seaver
bobble-head doll day at Shea Stadium. Fans 14-and-under received a
doll with the likeness of the Hall of Fame pitcher. ''I've won Cy
Young Awards and world championships, but nothing compares to
this,'' Seaver quipped before the game.
Brewers-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: In surrendering 12 walks, the Brewers came within two
of matching the club record, which they set in a 10-3 loss to
Houston on April 29. ... RHP Curtis Leskanic, who walked four
batters to take the loss, entered with an 0.90 ERA in his previous
17 appearances -- a span of 20 innings. ... In going 3-6 against
Atlanta this year, the Brewers hit only .215 against Braves
pitching. ... RHP Allen Levrault, who made his first major league
start, was the organization's Pitcher of the Year last season. He
went 10-5 with a 4.77 ERA at Triple-A Louisville and Double-A
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Javy Lopez ended the first inning by grounding into his
12th double play, second-most in the NL. ... Andruw Jones, the only
Atlanta player to appear in every game last year, has started all
75 of the Braves' games this year. ... 1B Wally Joyner, who walked
twice, went hitless in two at-bats, dropping his June average to
.107 (3-for-28). ... Keith Lockhart, who struck out in the ninth,
dropped to 0-for-18 as a pinch-hitter this season. Lockhart led the
Braves with 15 pinch-hits last year.
Rockies-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Colorado hasn't won a series at Bank One Ballpark
since May 14-16, 1999. The Rockies also won the first-ever series
between the clubs, March 31-April 2, 1998. ... The Rockies are one
stolen base shy of matching last year's full-season total of 71.
... Colorado is 17-16 in games without hitting a homer. ... Gabe
White has thrown a club-record 23 consecutive scoreless innings.
... The Rockies won't face the Diamondbacks again until Sept. 25.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ruling Coalition Suffers  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's ruling coalition
suffered painful losses in Japan's lower house election Sunday,
holding onto power but dropping enough seats to weaken its ability
to guide the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The three-party coalition led by Mori's Liberal Democratic Party
kept its majority in the 480-member chamber, and LDP leaders
quickly claimed a mandate for its fiscal stimulus program to spend
Japan's lackluster economy into recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result means that we've received the approval from the
public,'' LDP Secretary-General Hiromu Nonaka told national
broadcaster NHK. ''Therefore, it's only natural for Mr. Mori to
stay as prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the LDP lost its single-party hold on the majority,
making it more dependent on two coalition partners who were also
badly damaged in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The results called into question the alliance's ability to push
key legislation through the powerful lower house of Parliament and
fueled speculation that the LDP would try to jettison the unpopular
Mori after Japan hosts the G-8 summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo News agency reported that LDP chieftains would meet later
Monday to endorse Mori as premier and discuss forming the next
government. Mori also reportedly planned to convene Parliament on
July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Major gains were posted by the LDP's top competition, the
opposition Democratic Party. Unofficial tallies of votes by NHK and
Kyodo showed the party boosting its representation by more than 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't have done better,'' an ecstatic Yukio Hatoyama,
leader of the Democrats, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which campaigned on promises to keep up a massive
fiscal spending program, had been widely expected to garner a
majority in the election despite rock-bottom support ratings for
Mori's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Affairs Ministry was still counting some ballots early
Monday and official final figures were not immediately available.
But NHK reported that the coalition won 271 seats in the lower
house. That would give it control of 56 percent of the chamber --
down sharply from the 65 percent controlled before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a major defeat for LDP,'' the national Asahi newspaper
declared in an editorial early Monday. ''What the election results
show is the public's hope for a change -- not approval.''
</P>
<P>
   According to NHK, Mori's LDP won 233 seats, for a loss of 38 and
eight below the number needed for the party alone to hold a simple
majority. The Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition
party, won 127 seats, for a gain of 32.
</P>
<P>
   Some LDP bigwigs also suffered in the election. Trade Minister
Takashi Fukaya and Agriculture Minister Tokuichiro Tamazawa were
both ousted in their local districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll take a lot of work to rebuild the LDP,'' Fukaya told
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's slowly improving economy was the top issue in the 12-day
campaign leading up to the vote. After two years of shrinkage, the
economy is growing slightly again, but a solid recovery is still
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   While the LDP and its two coalition partners, the Komeito and
the Conservative Party, campaigned on more spending, the opposition
argued that the ballooning public debt should be dealt with. Public
debt now totals more than 130 percent of Japan's gross domestic
product, and the Democrats called for a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition also attempted to capitalize on Mori's
unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   Mori took over on April 5, days after then-Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi suffered a stroke and fell into a coma. Mori has faced
constant criticism, both for allegations of being a policy
lightweight and for calling Japan a ''divine nation,'' recalling
Japan's wartime emperor-worship. Obuchi died on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Affairs Ministry said that turnout for the 300 seats
decided by direct ballot was 62.5 percent, higher than the
record-low turnout in the 1996 lower house election of 59.7
percent. The figure for proportional representation was also 62.5
percent, up from 59.6 for the last election.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively low turnout had been expected to help the Liberal
Democrats, which have ruled Japan for nearly all of the past 45
years and can count on organized blocks of voters in the
countryside for support.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP appeared set, however, to maintain its role as Japan's
dominant party. Obuchi's daughter, Yuko Obuchi, for example, easily
won the race for his former seat in Gunma prefecture (state) north
of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''June 25th was supposed to be my father's 63rd birthday,'' she
told supporters after the vote. ''Today ... I was given a new life
as a politician. I'll never forget this day.''

<HEADLINE> MASH nurse relives the carnage of Korean War  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY PATRICK
The Daily Gazette
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - The injured soldier arrived at the
121st Evacuation Hospital in South Korea just as doctors and nurses
were packing to go.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy was advancing and hospital personnel were under orders
to leave the area within four hours. The soldier's leg had been
badly damaged, seemingly hanging on by the skin. Amputation was in
order. While staffers continued to dismantle the hospital, one
doctor began surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got it into his head that he wasn't just going to save the
soldier. He was going to save the soldier's leg,'' said the
assisting nurse Barbara Kinkead of Ballston Lake, N.Y., 20 miles
north of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The big surgical room - full of operating tables and medical
instruments - was emptied of supplies while Kinkead, an anesthetist
and the surgeon continued. At noon, when the four hours were up,
the operation was done. And nurse, doctor and patient were on the
road, the last ones to leave, as advancing gunfire sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing and sounding like the spirited 24-year-old Army nurse
she was then, Kinkead makes it clear that she was just doing her
job. The need for nurses was so strong that their tours of duty
lasted 18 months, longer than the 12 months doctors served or the
six months combat troops served. Kinkead arrived in Korea on New
Year's Day, 1951, the second youngest of 42 nurses assigned to the
121st Evacuation Hospital. She stayed for 19 months, 21 days.
</P>
<P>
   There's no fear in her voice, no hubris over heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkead's approach to her service during the Korean War was
typical of the women who served there, according to Joanne McFadden
of Charlton, N.Y., who is writing a book on nurses during the
Korean War. ''They looked at this as their duty, as doing their
job,'' McFadden said. ''They did their jobs and they came home.''
</P>
<P>
   American women played primarily a medical role in the Korean
War, which began 50 years ago Sunday when North Koreans crossed the
38th parallel and invaded South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The need for nurses was especially great in the Korea War. By
the time it ended in July 1953, more than 92,000 U.S. soldiers had
been wounded and more than 36,000 killed. In contrast, the nearly
58,000 American deaths in Vietnam came over a 10-year stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did really push to send WACs (Women's Army Corps) to
Korea, but they didn't have room for the right barracks and only a
handful went,'' McFadden said. ''Basically, the only women the
military sent over there were nurses.'' Some of these nurses were
seasoned veterans of World War II surprised to be called back to
duty, McFadden said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were young nurses. ''You have to consider what they were
there to do: to take care of what was left after a battle,''
McFadden said. There were soldiers with horrible traumas, children
who had stepped on bombs, prisoners of war and, among Kinkead's
more lasting memories, Turkish troops with tetanus, or lockjaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hadn't gotten tetanus shots,'' said Kinkead, who retired
after more than 40 years in civilian nursing. ''It was the only
time I saw lockjaw, and it was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkead would try to ask each of her patients before she
administered anesthesia if they would like to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would always try to talk to them, ask them where they were
from and give them a couple of minutes to talk,'' Kinkead said. ''I
think it helped.''
</P>
<P>
   The winters proved especially grueling. ''They were living in
tents,'' McFadden said, ''and you'd hear them talk about trying to
stay warm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty cold at times,'' Kinkead conceded. ''There were
tents, cots and sleeping bags.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Kinkead is still looking out for the men who fought
this war, sometimes known as ''the forgotten war.'' She welcomes
the attention Sunday's 50th anniversary is bringing to men whose
wartime service is often overlooked. ''You hear a lot about Vietnam
and Desert Storm, but not Korea. And we lost an awful lot of men in
Korea,'' Kinkead said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the time has come, too, for the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''These women were amazing,'' McFadden said. ''They didn't give
a second thought to putting themselves in harm's way. They did
their duty, they worked until they could work no longer and they
had compassion and great strength.''

<HEADLINE> Anand Wins Frankfurt Chess Classic  </HEADLINE>
By ROY KAMMERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAD SODEN, Germany (AP) -- Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand
proved Sunday that Garry Kasparov doesn't rule the entire world of
chess.
</P>
<P>
   Anand, known for his lightning play, reclaimed the world rapid
chess title by winning the Frankfurt Chess Classic, where all the
top 10 players have gathered for the first time since rankings were
introduced in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''To win with all the top players here and win so easily --
absolutely fantastic,'' said Anand, who won in 1998 and was
dethroned last year by Kasparov. ''I have to admit I have a real
fondness for this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Anand finished with 7.5 out of 10 possible points, while
Kasparov was second at 6.0 for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Kasparov let the tournament slip away during Saturday's third
day of play, when he misplayed a draw into a stunning defeat
against Peter Leko, a 20-year-old rising star from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday I collapsed,'' said Kasparov, the world's best
classical chess player. ''I tried to think it out but I realized I
had just lost all my time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Kasparov's first loss in any competition to Leko.
</P>
<P>
   The $420,000 event, boasting the largest budget for any
tournament outside of world championships, is widely regarded as
the tournament that decides who is champion of rapid chess -- a
fast-paced variety of the game that is exploding in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Anand, who lost a 1995 challenge to Kasparov for his classical
chess title, admits that he wanted the title back for rapid chess
and his reputation as perhaps the world's best player of fast
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh absolutely,'' said Anand. ''I'm certainly proved I'm one of
the best -- although Garry can also play well.''

Navy Begins Vieques Exercises
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The thud of military shelling returned to
Vieques Island today as the U.S. Navy began training even as protesters vowed to
invade the range. It is the largest exercise since a fatal accident prompted a
yearlong occupation of its range. At about 2 p.m., ships began shooting inert
shells at the range, Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon said. The exercises are

Advances Made for Infertile Women

   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Scientists have made an advance that could allow women
to delay motherhood or safely restore fertility to women who need to have their
ovaries removed. For the first time scientists have transplanted defrosted human
ovarian tissue into a mouse, extracted eggs and made them potentially
fertilizable. The technique, which is to be presented Monday at a four-day
conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, would
be most effective if women freeze their ovarian tissue in their early 20s,
because a woman's capacity to produce eggs diminishes with age.

Schumer: Bioterrorism Plans Lacking

mosquito-borne virus was ''the closest example of a dry run for a bioterrorist

<HEADLINE> Korean War Anniversary Marked  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Old soldiers in suits and crisp
uniforms marked the 50th anniversary Sunday of the start of the
Korean War, fanning themselves in the summer heat and wiping away
tears as they remembered fallen comrades.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike previous commemorations, there was also joy:
President Kim Dae-jung said democratic South Korea and communist
North Korea are poised to repair the legacy of their Cold War
conflict, which has endured for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Kim warned, however, that the specter of war was still vivid
after his June 13-15 summit in Pyongyang with North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il, during which they pledged to work toward
reunification. Their border remains the most heavily armed in the
world, a symbol of the depth of animosity between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Pyongyang, I stressed that if another war broke out, it
would be different from the one we had,'' Kim said. ''If that
happened, the whole nation would be decimated by the use of
extremely advanced weapons of mass destruction. We should never
dream of unification by force or absorbing the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim also ordered his armed forces, which are backed by 37,000
U.S. troops deployed in the South, to remain wary despite moves
toward reconciliation with the North. North Korea has maintained a
perpetual war footing for years, even though it is so poor that it
relies on outside food aid.
</P>
<P>
   The main anniversary ceremony was held at the War Memorial
Museum, where schoolgirls presented garlands to veterans and
military honor guards carried flags of the 21 countries that
contributed to the U.S.-led U.N. force that fought North Korean and
Chinese troops as well as Soviet air force planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud of what I did for the country, but I also feel
sorry when I think about colleagues who died,'' said Lee
Kyong-hyun, 73, a South Korean retired army sergeant. ''My thanks
also go to the United States and other Allied countries which came
to our aid in great danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mosley, 68, of Britain, described Korea's deep poverty a
half-century ago, sobbing as he recalled comrades who died during
his tour of duty from May 1951 to March 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think of them and it's a bit hard,'' said Mosley, who
was among 1,000 foreign veterans at the event. Another 4,000 South
Korean veterans also attended.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean soldiers stood stiffly in yellow gowns and tall
hats -- the costume of the royal guard of the Chosun dynasty that
ruled the peninsula for centuries until it was ousted by Japanese
colonizers in 1910. Advancing U.S. and Soviet forces divided the
Korean peninsula at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A women's choir sang ''Spring in My Hometown,'' a popular song
on both sides of the Demilitarized Zone that has become a
melancholic anthem for families separated from loved ones on the
other side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the newly conciliatory mood between the North and
South, the ceremonies were scaled back from their original plan.
South Korea canceled a military parade planned for Sunday, as well
as reenactments of pivotal battles, including the famed amphibious
landing at Inchon in September 1950 that reversed North Korean
advances.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean media did not mention the war anniversary Sunday,
instead issuing follow-up reports on the success of the summit,
according to private and government monitors in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony at the National Cemetery in Seoul, where 50,000
Korean War dead are buried, veterans prayed, burned incense and
laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans included Fidel Ramos, former president of the
Philippines, and Paik Sun Yup, an 82-year-old former general who
was South Korea's top military commander during the war. Togo West,
the U.S. secretary of veterans affairs, was also present.
</P>
<P>
   The three men honored the dead by tolling a giant bronze bell in
the cemetery, which is nestled in a valley between two low hills
overlooking the Han, the river that bisects Seoul. The bustling
capital of 11 million is now the center of one of the world's
leading economies -- a stunning contrast with the impoverished,
war-torn land that veterans remember.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the war museum, West said nearly 37,000 American
soldiers died, 92,000 were wounded and 8,000 remain unaccounted-for
in the Korean War. Nearly one million South Korean troops were
killed or injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our two nations were united forever in the crucible of war by
a history of shared hardships, and a future of common purpose,''
West said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the South Korean president reiterated the points
of understanding reached with his North Korean counterpart. He said
they included his belief that U.S. troops deployed in South Korea
should remain on the peninsula even after unification to maintain
the balance of power in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North showed substantial understanding on my explanation
on the need for the U.S. troops,'' Kim said. ''I am reporting this
to you as a major accomplishment made during my visit to
Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on at least two occasions since the summit, North Korea
has repeated its longtime demand for the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
In the past, the North has often engaged in fiery rhetoric against
negotiating partners even as it showed a willingness to deal with
them.
</P>
<P>
   More events were planned for Monday, including a banquet to
honor performers who entertained American troops during the war.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Doctors Vote on Strike  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Doctors returned to work Monday,
ending a six-day strike that paralyzed medical services in South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Medical Association, a lobby for the nation's 65,000
doctors, called off the walkout after members voted Sunday to
reopen their clinics and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The association's proposal to end the strike was approved with
51.9 percent of about 32,000 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's mediation plan is not fully satisfying but it
is time to end the strike,'' association president Kim Jae-jung
said. ''We're sorry for causing inconvenience to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was called after political parties agreed Saturday to
accept one of the key demands by doctors: new legislation to give
them more authority to prescribe drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the concession for doctors, pharmacists initially
threatened a nationwide protest but they later relented and decided
to wait and see. They warned that the concession could compromise
their interests.
</P>
<P>
   While giving doctors more authority to prescribe drugs, the
revision would restrict pharmacists' power to sell drugs without a
doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   In a confrontation with the government last year, the nation's
40,000 pharmacists went on strike and closed their stores. They
reopened them only after they won concessions from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors walked off the job Tuesday, protesting a new industry
system that they fear would deprive them of a major source of
income. Doctors also complained that the system could restrict
their authority to prescribe drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In order to satisfy the doctors, the government last Friday
promised to increase prescription fees -- currently set at $7.20 per
person -- to give them more financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, President Kim Dae-jung made clear that
the new system will be put into effect on July 1 as scheduled.
Doctors demanded that it be delayed or drastically altered.
</P>
<P>
   The strike caused most of the nation's 19,000 private clinics
and hospitals to close. Hospitals, short of doctors, sent patients
home and delayed surgical operations. There were several deaths
linked to the strike.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Buys Hyundai Stake  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S.-German auto giant DaimlerChrysler
will acquire a 10 percent stake in South Korea's leading carmaker
Hyundai Motor for $428 million, both sides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was aimed at strengthening Hyundai's strategy to become
a global player by ranking among the top five automakers by 2010.
The announcement boosted Hyundai's share prices in early trading on
the Korean Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The tie-up also boosted chances of a joint bid to be submitted
by the two firms to buy debt-ridden Daewoo Motor Co. in an
international auction due Monday. Korean government officials have
said they would only approve a Hyundai bid if the Korean carmaker
joined with a foreign company to avoid a potential monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hyundai aims to become a major global player by the end of
this decade with 4 million units, and this is one of the steps to
reach that goal,'' said Steve Kitson, a Hyundai spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The capital tie-up calls for the two companies to set up a
separate 50-50 joint venture to operate Hyundai's commercial
vehicle plant with an annual capacity of 100,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has already agreed to buy a major stake in
Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. But as the deal does not include the
production of trucks, DaimlerChrysler has turned to Hyundai to
strengthen its presence in Asia, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Mitsubishi group, including its carmaking arm,
Mitsubishi Motor, holds a 4.36 percent interest in Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   Since word of DaimlerChrysler's interest in Hyundai circulated a
week ago, the price of the Korean firm's share has increased
steadily. After Monday's announcement, it jumped by nearly 5
percent in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor, South Korea's second-largest automaker with $18
billion in debt, is being auctioned off by its creditor banks.
General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Fiat and Hyundai have been
invited to submit bids.
</P>
<P>
   Before the DaimlerChrysler-Hyundai deal, GM and Ford were
considered the front-runners in the Daewoo bidding. Now, GM and
Fiat were reportedly moving to submit a joint bid for Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's creditors plan to select two finalists by Friday and
one successful bidder by the end of September. The successful
bidding price is expected to reach $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has the capacity to make 2 million vehicles a year in
plants stretching from the Philippines to Poland. But Daewoo
borrowed heavily to expand, and cash flow from operations
eventually fell short. Then the Asian currency crisis hit South
Korea in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Daewoo Motor lost $3.9 billion on revenues of $5
billion, prompting demands for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai acquired the nation's third-largest car firm, Kia Motor,
last year, which allows it to control two-thirds of the nation's
1.2 million vehicle domestic car market.
</P>
<P>
   In April, French carmaker Renault bought another debt-ridden
South Korean auto firm, Samsung Motors, for $562 million. That gave
Renault a 70.1 percent stake in the Korean company.

<HEADLINE> Emigration Tradition for China Area  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUZHOU, China (AP) -- For generations, the path for anyone with
more ambition than money in China's southeast has been clear: Work
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings are used to buy land, build houses and start businesses
back home. Even for those who stay overseas, money sent back vaults
families up the social ladder.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition is so ingrained that even today, when foreign
investment has made the coastal provinces some of China's richest
and expanded opportunities, tens of thousands of people still go
abroad each year, convinced they can do better.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of 58 Chinese a week ago in an overheated truck in
the British port of Dover are unlikely to change attitudes. That
group set out less than six months after others from the same
region of Fujian province died in a cargo container en route to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the years, the horror stories have filtered back to the
villages, but people still want to take the chance,'' said Ying
Chan, a professor at Hong Kong University who has studied the
Chinese migrant-smuggling trade for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Migrants pay up to $60,000 to smugglers for a chance at menial
jobs in restaurants or sweatshops, enduring harsh conditions in
ships or hiding in cargo containers. They risk enslavement by
smuggling gangs and worse.
</P>
<P>
   This intense, restless ambition has so far frustrated China's
increased effort under foreign pressure to rein in the flow.
American immigration officials estimate the outflow of Chinese at
up to 100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For many, being smuggled to the United States, Japan or Europe
is more a calculated investment than an act of desperation. Many
migrants are uneducated and poor, but the high cost keeps smuggling
out of reach of the poorest. A down payment can cost thousands of
dollars, and a family needs good credit to finance the rest.
</P>
<P>
   One victim in Dover was identified by the Hong Kong newspaper
Apple Daily as a 24-year-old entrepreneur who was trying to recover
from business losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know of doctors who've put themselves into the pipeline (to
be smuggled abroad). They want to make more money,'' said Chan.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, emigration meant escape from an unpromising arc
of land crowded between mountains and the sea, with too many people
and not enough good soil. While other areas of China were famous
for tea or silk, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Changle and other coastal cities
earned a reputation for exporting their sons and daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Fujian province, where Fuzhou is the capital, sent the first
mainland settlers to Taiwan centuries ago. In the 19th century,
poverty drove a flood of migrants from Fujian and Guangdong
provinces to Southeast Asia, Hawaii and California.
</P>
<P>
   Their descendants are the elite of modern Singapore and the
Philippines, and money sent home by migrants has transformed
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Liem Sioe Liong left Fujian in 1938 to seek his fortune in
Indonesia. Today, Forbes magazine ranks him as the world's 473rd
richest man, worth $1 billion. He has shared lavishly with his
hometown, paying for roads, schools and a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, migrant money is paying for a mini-building
boom in dozens of villages, making life abroad all the more
seductive.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in Britain seem especially tragic in light of the
economic revolution being wrought in Fujian by foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The province, which retains ties of language and culture to
Taiwan, is the mainland base for billions of dollars in Taiwanese
investment. Factories that make everything from umbrellas to
computer parts have created hundreds of thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And the area is hardly barren. The countryside around Fuzhou is
carpeted with rice and vegetable fields. The province exports
produce and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the people still leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to many migrants in New York City who regret
going,'' Chan said. ''But a lot of times, even if they tell horror
stories, people in the village won't believe them, so they still
want to go.''
