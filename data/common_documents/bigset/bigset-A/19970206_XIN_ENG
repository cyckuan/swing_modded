<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Refute US Human Rights Report (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tian Jin, a research fellow at the China Center of
International Studies, pointed out that in recent years, when the
United States maliciously attacked China's human rights situation,
China has made overall progress in human rights undertakings.
</P>
<P>
As a populous yet economically under-developed country, China
has taken great efforts towards the protection of human rights,
making world-acknowledged achievements, he noted. In
1996, on the basis of sustained and rapid economic development,
China strengthened the building of democracy and the legal
system. In particular, he added, work on grassroots democracy and
amendments to the "Criminal Procedural Law" won praise from the
world in general.
</P>
<P>
"It set people thinking that the US ignored all those basic
facts and distorted China's image as one with a worsening human
rights situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Nansen, a professor at Peking University, said that the
US Human Rights Report, which refers to China as a "hell", serves
as a "masterpiece" of "demonizing China" by anti-China forces in
the world, and "reflected the US authorities' anti-China mentality
marked by antipathy and gloom."
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Hongyi, of Beijing Normal University, pointed
to the political prejudice of the US report, noting that the crux
of the problem is that, as long as China keeps its socialist
system, the US will see it as an "authoritarian state" with no
human rights to speak of.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Lei, the deputy director of the Beijing Women Journalists
Association, said that US' real interest lies in its attempt to
impose the human rights problem on and then demonize China, so as
to justify its malice toward China. "While the US strives to
impose its 'format of democracy" upon other countries, the
practice itself is extremely undemocratic," she added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jue, the deputy director of the China Society for the
Study of Human Rights, who presided over the seminar, noted that
the US report, instead of evaluating China's human rights
situation in an objective and fair way, lauded a small number of
criminals who violated the interests of the broad masses of people
as "fighters for human rights".
</P>
<P>
This shows that the US' true purpose is to interfere in China's
internal affairs, to vilify China, and to contain China's
development. he concluded.
</P>
<P>
The US State Department keeps issuing the yearly reports,
passing judgement on the human rights situations in the world
according to its own standards, he said, adding that such
provocative practice runs against trends of development and
impedes the development of human rights in the world, Zhou
said.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebels Claim Progress on All Fronts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's Tutsi rebels today
claimed progress in fightings against government forces on all
fronts, and said that they are chasing "fugitives" of the
regular troops.
</P>
<P>
Laurent-Desire Kabila, chief of the rebels, told the Agence
France-Presse that the rebel force is now 40 kilometers from Moba,
a small port on Lake Tanganyika, 160 kilometers south of Kalemie,
a strategic town which has fallen into the hands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
This means that the rebels are approaching the copper-bearing
southern province of Shaba, formerly called Katanga.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are also "fewer than 19 kilometers from Lubutu"
west of Goma, and 33 kilometers west of Shabunda, west of Bukavu,
said Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the town of Isiro, northeastern Zaire,
will fall into the hands of the rebels "within hours."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Gendarmes Seize Large Quantity of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish gendarmes have seized 16
kilograms of hashish and four kilograms of opium in three recent
operations against drug trafficking in eastern and southeastern
Turkey, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official news agency report said that gendarmes
stopped a car in Yuksekova town of Hakkari province bordering Iran
and Iraq and found 13 kilograms of hashish in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
In another development, according to a tip-off, gendarmes
searched a house at Inanli village in the same province and
confiscated three kilograms of hashish in the house, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers detained three suspects of involvement in the
drug trafficking, added the agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said that 140 liters of acid anhydride
and four kilograms of opium was seized in Baskale town of Van
province over the border with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia report did not give the time when the drugs were
seized in the three operations.
</P>
<P>
Tuncay Yilmaz, official of the Turkish Security
Directorate-General, said last month that the Turkish police
seized in 1996 4.4 tonnes of heroin, accounting for 40 percent of
the world's total haul, 12.3 tonnes of hashish, 233 kilograms of
opium, 13 kilograms of cocaine and 1,157 kilograms of base
morphine.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry denounced the allegations of
western countries that some Turkish government officials had been
involved in illegal drug dealings.

The Washington Post:

a balanced budget and campaign finance reform within months and
to lead a "national crusade" to improve education by the turn of
the century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Cooperation on Final Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today the Palestinian-Israeli talks on final stage
issues need the cooperation of both sides and the support of all
peace-loving countries to produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with Farouk Kadoumy, Chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) political department,
Moussa told reporters that the final stage requires more support
on the part of the two sides so as that the aspired goal of the
establishment of a Palestinian state would be realized.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy arrived here Tuesday for talks with Egyptian government
officials.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis have to be ready to discuss these issues in order
to be aware of the importance of reaching acceptable solutions to
those questions," he said, adding that this phase also needs
the support from the peace-loving powers.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his talks with Kadoumy touched on such sensitive
issues as refugees, Jerusalem settlements and the Palestinians'
right to self-determination, which are supposed to be solved in
the final talks ending no later than May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The talks also deal with the current impediments hindering the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiating process, Kadoumy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We make our utmost to secure a significant withdrawal and make
sure that implementation of the accord be effected to the letter
of the protocol," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on the continuation of settlement
activities and the selling of housing units to Jewish settlers,
Moussa said it is very "dangerous and horrible."
</P>
<P>
This question was among issues which Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat raised in Davos World Economic Forum as one of major
obstacles impeding the peace march in the Middle East, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Those unites should have been sold to the Palestinian refugees
and not to settlers," he said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the importance of common Arab action and
inter-Arab solidarity, Kadoumy said that the Palestinians seek
world public opinion's support for activating the peace drive and
criticized Israel for placing "obstacles to making peace."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Investment Company's Good Economic Performance in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The China International Trust
and Investment Corporation (CITIC) maintained growth in its profit
in 1996, with assets, equity, and profits increasing by more than
20 percent over the previous year, and its ratio of liabilities to
assets falling.
</P>
<P>
CITIC is one of China's leading state-owned companies. Its
business in Hong Kong developed at a high speed in the
year. CITIC's Pacific subsidiary had tremendous growth in profit
and became the largest overseas investor in the mainland. At the
end of last year, CITIC sold part of its Pacific shares originally
held by CITIC Hong Kong to its executives, with CITIC Hong Kong
remaining the biggest shareholder. The transaction was valued at
more than one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other achievements for 1996 cited by the company spokesman, Yao
Jinrong, include:
</P>
<P>
-- Profits of CITIC's Industrial Bank grew by nearly 57 percent
from the previous year. The bank maintained its place among the
top six domestic commercial banks in profits and assets. CITIC
Securities Co. Ltd. made a profit of 216 million yuan in the first
year of operations and became one of the first 10 securities firms
to be accorded underwriter status from the China Securities
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
-- Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company Ltd., in which
CITIC is a major shareholder, was listed in Hong Kong and New York
on June 19. In addition to getting back all its investment, CITIC
also got 300 million U.S. dollars in assets.
</P>
<P>
--Together with New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge Group and
Brierley, CITIC successfully acquired the NZ Forestry Company at a
cost of 1.34 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- On July 25 of the year, a 328-million-U.S.-dollar loan for
the CITIC Tehran Subway Project was signed. The Project is the
biggest export of electromechanical equipment ever since the
founding of new China. In October, a 120-million-U.S.-dollar
contract for the Beijing Metro Carriage Project, for which CITIC
won the bid, was signed.
</P>
<P>
-- An agreement to jointly run Bohai Aluminum Industries
Ltd. signed by CITIC and the U.S.'s Reynolds Metal, went into
effect.
</P>
<P>
--The first meeting of the CITIC International Advisory Council
was held in Beijing in March. President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li
Peng, Vice-premiers Zhu Rongji and Li lanqing met with the
participants, who were leading politicians, financiers,
industrialists and businesspeople from various countries.
</P>
<P>
-- In may, CITIC signed a joint venture agreement with the
Zhengzhou City Government, Henan province, allowing CITIC to
purchase 90 percent of the shares of the Zhengzhou Auto Works and
change the name to the CITIC Zhongyuan Automobile Company. The two
parties will cooperate on building a fairly large modern
light-duty vehicle production base.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. auto sales increased by
6.1 percent in January from a year earlier, reflecting a better
future this year, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sales of cars and light trucks in last month totaled 1,087,598
vehicles, up from the year-earlier 1,025,499. The sales in January
were equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rates of 15.5
million vehicles this year.
</P>
<P>
The sales of GM, the biggest auto maker in U.S., was down by
0.9 percent in January while sales of Ford and Chrysler were up by
1.5 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Most of Japanese auto makers increased their sales in the U.S.
market sharply. Sales of Toyota Motor Corp. shot up by 56 percent
and Honda's sales increased by 21.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As many U.S. executives had predicted, the Japanese makers'
share in the U.S. market in January shot up to 24.6 percent from
the year-earlier 21.2 percent. And the Big Three auto makers'
market share dropped to 70.9 percent from a year-earlier 74.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the rising U.S. dollar was the major reason
that pushed high sales of Japanese cars in the U.S. market
because a strong U.S. dollar has made Japanese cars cheaper and
more competitive.

''The reviewing of prices will continue, and there is going to be

making it impossible to get into the plantations to cut down trees
and take them to the sawmills.

If rains continue, the shortage of timber will last six to

<HEADLINE> ANC, SACP Call for Full Probe into Hani Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Two major ruling parties in
South Africa called on a fact-finding group here today to fully probe
into the "broad conspiracy" which led to the 1993 murder of former
South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Chris Hani.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC), the No. one party in the
government, and its political ally SACP made the appeal to the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) at a joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
ANC Acting Secretary-General Chery Carolus stressed no amnesty
applications from Clive Derby-Lewis and Janusz Waluz, who were charged
with murder of Harni, should be considered before a full investigation
into the circumstances surrounding Hani's death was carried out.
</P>
<P>
Carolus said "like many other South Africans, we have felt the
trial and sentencing of Waluz and Derby-Lewis only touched the surface
of a much broader consipracy.
</P>
<P>
"The TRC must, at the very least, postpone its consideration of the
Waluz and Derby-Lewis amnesty application until a full investigation
has been completed," she said.
</P>
<P>
TRC, a special judicial organization authorized by the ANC-led
government, is responsible for investigation into the violation of human
rights activities in apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the local press quoted ANC member of Parliament
Winnie Mandela as saying that ANC members may have involved in
the assasination of Hani. The ex-wife of President Nelson Mandela
said it was hard to believe that Hani's murder was the work of
the right-wing alone.
</P>
<P>
SACP Secretary-General Charles Nqacula said at the presss
conference that the investigation must determine the previous history
of the pistol used to shoot Hani.
</P>
<P>
SACP Deputy Secretary-General Jeremy Cronin also appealed to the
Department of Correctional Services to pay particular attention to the
safety of Hani's jailed killers.
</P>
<P>
"They (the killers) may say more than they have said so far,"
Cronin added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Minister on Party, Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's deputy minister of
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Alois Mangwende today
warned ruling Zanu PF members against interfering with government
functions.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from participants to a two-day seminar on
industrial relations in the public sector which opened in Mutare
of east Zimbabwe today, Mangwende said there were instances where
civil servants who held senior party positions harassed senior
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
''I think the message must be clearly sent to them, that no
party cadre should interfere with government functions. A party
cadre who harasses a civil servant for any reason should be
fired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deputy minister defended the government's

<HEADLINE> Eurostat: Total EU GDP Up by 2.5 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union(EU)'s GDP(Gross
Domestic Product) in real terms grew by 2.5 percent in 1995
following the 2.9 percent rise in 1994, according to a report out
today from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
This return of growth followed a slowdown of +0.9 percent in
1992 and -0.5 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 EU GDP amounted to 6,434.3 billion ECU(about 7,786
billion US dollars), and EU-wide, Germany had the highest GDP:
1,845.2 billion ECU or 28.7 percent of the EU total.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the EU GDP is accounted for by Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Four other member States -
Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg - account for only 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat figures showed that, among the 15 EU member states,
Ireland recorded the fastest growth at 10.7 percent, followed by
Finland with 4.2 percent. Others ranged from Austria's 1.4 percent
to Sweden's 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed how EU countries and some of their
partners compared in terms of GDP per person in PPS(purchasing
power standard), which is used to cancel the impact of price
differences among countries for a set of comparable and
representative goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The list is headed by Luxembourg. Its GDP per person is 15
percent higher than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Expressed as an index(EU15=100), Luxembourg weighs in at 169,
the United States next at 147. Next in the EU are Denmark(116),
Belgium(112) and Germany(111). In between are Switzerland(134),
Norway(122), Iceland(118) and Japan(117).
</P>
<P>
Below the EU average are Britain and Finland(both 96),
Ireland(93), Spain(77), Portugal(67) and Greece(66).

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Down in Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
fell by 1.3 percent in December, the second consecutive decline,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decline in December was the fifth in last year and it
followed a 0.5 percent drop in November.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1996, U.S. factory orders were up by a
moderate 4.9 percent, comparing with a 6.6 percent gain in 1995.
It was the smallest increase in three years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department said that orders for durable goods -- items
expected to last for more than three years -- dropped by 1.9
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
It was led by a 12.7 percent decline of electronic and
electrical equipment orders.
</P>
<P>
Order for nondurable goods such as clothing fell by 0.7 percent
in the month.
</P>
<P>
But the backlog of unfilled orders in U.S. factories rose 0.1
percent, the fourth consecutive increase.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, fell 0.6 percent, the
first drop since last June.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are the principal gauge of the manufacturing
strength in the U.S. and continued declines would presage reduced
production and fewer jobs.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. on Telecommunication Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada offered to further
relax controls on foreign participation in the country's
telecommunications industry, the Wall Street Journal reported
today.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, the U.S. government is unsatisfied
with the offer and said the new Canadian move still falls short of
what's needed for a successful outcome of current negotiations for
a world telecommunications pact, which is under negotiation in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
U.S. said that Canada insisted that foreigners be limited to
owning no more than 47 percent of a Canadian telecommunications
company. It said that would go against the spirit of the
telecommunication pact which calls for a more open market. The
latest Canadian proposal made some concessions to foreign
investors but still restricts foreign interests to a 47 percent
share, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian official said that Canada has agreed to end by
October 1998 a monopoly held by Teleglobe Inc., Montreal, on
telecommunications traffic between Canada and overseas
countries.

<HEADLINE> US Auto Makers Lose Ground to Foreign Competitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Big Three auto makers of the
United States have lost ground to their Japanese and European
competitors as a result of strong U.S. dollar, according to sales
figures shown in January.
</P>
<P>
The Ford Company reported on Tuesday that its sales rose 2.8
percent in January from a year ago, while Toyota said its sales
jumped 55.5 percent. Chrysler Corporation said its sales rose 1.5
percent last month. The General Motors Corporation said its sales
dropped 1.0 percent last month, compared with the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Toyota and Honda, with sales up 55.5 percent and 21.1 percent
respectively, each recorded their best-ever January sales results.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, for Volkswagen, a big German auto maker,
sales rose 19.6 percent for its best January in eight years.
Subaru sales rosed 24.5 percent and Mercedes sales jumped 28.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are gaining ground, and this is a pattern we have
seen in the past few months," an analyst with Morgan Stanley
said.
</P>
<P>
Strong dollar is most attributable to the Japanese auto makers
gaining on U.S. Big three. the dollar has risen sharply against
the japanese yen, also against the German mark, since hitting lows
in April 1995. For foreign auto makers, a strong dollar means it
is cheaper to ship cars built abroad to the United States, and to
assemble cars in this country with imported parts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to analysts, foreign auto makers have
recently introduced a number of popular models, wooing customers
with strong rebates, discount and unchanged prices.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Emergency Food Reserve Grows 8-Fold in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's emergency food
security reserve has grown by 8-fold in the past four years, the
Emergency Food Security Reserve Administration (EFSRA) of
Ethiopia announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Administration manager of the SFSRA Samuel Tumoro said the
emergency food reserve has this year reached 283,000 metric
tonnes against 30,000 in 1993, adding that the administration
could in case of emergency feed nearly four million people for
six months by providing each 400 grams of food daily.
</P>
<P>
He ascribed the increase in food reserve to assistance donors
and annual budget allocation by the Ethiopian government for the
purchase of 5,000 metric tonnes of food.
</P>
<P>
The administration which used to depend on foreign food aid
has over the past two years raised its food security reserve from
the surplus in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The adminsitration is conducting a study to construct
additional warehouses with a view to implementing its medium-term
objective, that is, stockpiling 307,000 metric tonnes of food, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia harvested over 11.7 million metric tonnes of crop in
1996/97 agricultural season.

<HEADLINE> Libya Supports Formation of African Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Foreign Minister
Omar Mustafa EL-Montaser said here today Libya supports the United
States proposal on the formation of an African intervention
force, provided it is made out of OAU member states.
</P>
<P>
The minister told journalists on his arrival at the Dar es
Salaam International Airport, "the idea put
forward by the USA is good. However our concern is that the
forces should be controlled by the OAU (Organization of African
Unity) and not otherwise."
</P>
<P>
EL-Montaser said that his country would not support any intervenion
forces formed from outside OAU member states.
</P>
<P>
Last year, during his first ever visit to Africa, the former US
Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, proposed to African countries
the formation of intervention forces that will be used during crises
such as the one in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, however, received mixed feelings, some African states
arguing that the forces may have Western influence because of the US
and its allies readiness in meeting the cost of the forces.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela told the US envoy that the
formation of the african intervention forces should be initiated by
OAU member states and not otherwise.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela statement was echoed in Dar es Salaam last month
by the OAU's Secretary General, Salim Ahmed Salim, who told
journalists that his organisation was working on the idea based on
African initiatives and strategies.
</P>
<P>
According to a program, the Libya foreign minister is expected to
pay a courtesy call on President Benjamin Mkapa and his counterpart
Jakaya Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with his hosts, El-Montaser will brief them on the
preparations of the OAU's ministerial meeting to be held in the Libyan
capital, Tripol, starting on Frebruary, 26, this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Call for Direct Negotiations on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side has
called on the Turkish Cypriot leader to hold direct
negotiations on President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for
demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The call was made here today by Cypriot Government Spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides at the daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides is ready to enter into direct
negotiations with Rauf Denktash (Turkish Cypriot leader) on the
demilitarization of Cyprus, if the Turkish Cypriot side is
willing to discuss his idea, irrespective of the rest of issues
relating to the Cyprus problem," Cassoulides told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president, he explained, is ready to hold direct
talks on demilitarization, the sole item on the agenda of the
direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
If there is an agreement to discuss the proposal for
demilitarization, then "we pave the road for talks on other,
much easier issues," Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
"Should the matter be concluded, then demands to find common
ground on the fundamental aspects of the Cyprus question will be
modified in the future," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said Denktash had accepted the U.N. proposal
for direct talks between leaders of the two communities, but the
Greek Cypriot side insisted that common ground should be reached
on main aspects of the Cyprus problem before the two sides enter
into the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
When clarifying this position, Cassoulides did not rule out
the possibility of abandoning the present demand for common
ground if the Turkish Cypriot side agrees to a discussion on
demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) top official arrived here this evening for a
two-day official visit to Turkey for discussions of the
enlargement of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana will
meet with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and other senior
officials of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government will argue that the enlargement of the
NATO should be related to the expansion of the European Union
(EU) and its designated defense arm, the Western European Union
(WEU) during the talks, a local press report said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry sources said the EU must give a
reasonable response to Turkey's desire to be a full member.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission is considering the membership
applications by up to 10 candidates, but Turkey is not among them.
</P>
<P>
Ciller warned that Ankara might block plans for NATO expansion
if her country's plea for EU accession was stalled.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foregin minister made the remarks last week in
Rome, Italy, after an informal meeting with her counterparts from
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Turkish foreign minister threatened to
block the use of NATO equipment for the WEU after Greek
objections to Turkey's participation in WEU activities. Turkey is
an associate member of the WEU.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and EU require unanimity for enlargement, giving each
member a veto.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made a full membership application to the EU in April
1987.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Mayor Complains of Israeli Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of the West Bank town
Hebron Mustafa Natsha today complained of restrictions imposed on
Palestinians living in the city after an Israeli partial troop
pullback last month.
</P>
<P>
Natsha, in an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, said
only part of the al-Shuhada street or the Martyers street are
opened to some Palestinian public service cars -- after the
Israeli pullback from most of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Palestinians should be given full access to
the entire street in accordance with the executive protocol on
implementing the Israeli redeployment from Hebron which was signed
between the Palestinians and Israelis on January 14.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol's security arrangement for the city, Israeli
is bound to reopen the Arab wholesale market and Martyrs street, a
thoroughfare passing through the Israeli-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, asked on the Israeli decision banning the
restoration of Palestinian houses in the old part of the city,
said this decision is illegal and runs contrary to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Israel does not give full freedom to Palestinians to carry out
their religious rituals inside al-Ibrahimi mosque," he said.
</P>
<P>
It even imposes restrictions on the entry to the mosque by
Palestinians, something which forces some of them to steer clear
from the mosque, he added.

NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides today denied U.S. claims that President
Glafcos Clerides has given assurances not to deploy Greek
fighters to an air base currently under construction on the
island's western coast.
</P>
<P>
"Our side has made neither commitments nor concessions, nor
has it agreed to any specific time frame about the use of
the air base near Paphos," Cassoulides told reporters after a

<P>
No decision has been taken about if and when the air
base will be used as a refueling point or a base to

It was reported previously that the military base in Paphos
was being built for the deployment of Greek military jets
under the defense pact between Cyprus and Greece, singed in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was also believed that the Cypriot government's recent
decision to buy Russian surface-to-air missiles was taken to
protect the Paphos base.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides' comment echoed Tuesday's statement by President
Clerides, who also denied claims by U.S. State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns that Clerides committed himself "not to
deploying Greek fighter aircraft to the base and not to deploying
the Russian anti-aircraft system."
</P>
<P>
Once the base is completed, Cassoulides explained, it can
be used either for refueling or for the stationing of military
planes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile
system the Cypriot government has decided to buy, Cassoulides
said any missiles that arrive here in 16 months will be fully
operational, adding that "a second batch will arrive at a later
stage."
</P>
<P>
Tension has heightened on this eastern Mediterranean island
after the Cypriot government signed last month a contract with
Russia to buy anti-aircraft missiles with a range of 150
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The deal has triggered criticism from the U.S. and Britain,
and Turkey has threatened to strike at the missiles if they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
seized the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter Agree to Big Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The brokerage and credit-card
company Dean Witter agreed here to a 9.9 billion-U.S.-dollar
merger with investment banking giant Morgan Stanley to create the
biggest securities firm in the world.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that once again, both companies value each
other's strength and wish to have a bigger market share.
</P>
<P>
Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co. is strong in the "retail" brokerage
business, selling stocks, bonds and such to individual investors.
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. is mainly catering to institutional
clients.
</P>
<P>
The merger will create a new company called Morgan Stanley,
Dean Witter, Discover &AMP; Co. with annual revenue of 12 billion U.S.
dollars, the two companies said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The combined company will manage 270 billion U.S. dollars in
financial assets, the biggest of any securities firm, Dean Witter
chairman Philip Purcell said. It will be valued in the market at
21 billion U.S. dollars, compared with current industry leader
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s 14.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the merger news was confirmed, share prices of both
companies rose in the morning with Morgan Stanley's going up
almost 13 percent, or 7.25 dollars to 64.62 dollars on the New
York Stock Exchange, where Dean Witter was up almost 4 percent, at
40 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new company would rank as No. 1 in mergers and
acquisitions, and in underwriting initial public stock offerings.
It will have a total of 9,300 brokers and 3.2 million retail
customers. Dean Witter, with a successful story of Discover Card,
ranks as the nation's No. 3 credit-card issuer with 39 million
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the deal, each Morgan Stanley share would be
exchanged for 1.65 Dean Witter common shares. Based on Tuesday's
closing prices, the total value stands at 9.86 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU to Finance S. African NGOS Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
today announced a financial support to the value of 20.3 million
Rand (about 4.4 million U.S. Dollars) for 48 non-governmental
projects in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, the EU said the money would
come from EU's grant to the Transitional National Development
Trust (TNDT), established in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The EU last year presented the TNDT with 81 million Rand
(about 17.6 million US Dollars) in order to facilitate
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOS) and Community Based
Organizations (CBOS) in their crucial role in South Africa's
reconstruction and development process.
</P>
<P>
The TNDT was aimed at increasing the volume and rate of
grant-making to projects during 1997 and a complete list of the
48 projects and their individual values would be made public in
Johannesburg later in the day, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU is confident that the TNDT would play a vital role in
stimulating the capacity of NGOS and CBOS to support the
government's Reconstruction and Development Program, said Erwan
Fouere, head of the delegation of the European Commission in
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Chief Urges New Funding Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Executive Director, Elizabeth Dowdeswell, today
called for a reliable and predictable funding structure for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Opening the ministerial meeting of the on-going 19th session of
the UNEP Governing Council, the UNEP chief said it would not be
enough to pledge more contributions, to honor past pledges or to
deliver contributions on time in the future.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is a new funding structure which guarantees
the financial reliability and predictability," she told delegates
from more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
Dowdeswell stressed that a further cut to UNEP's budgets and
programs would not be a solution to the financial problems faced
by the U.N. body because "surgery alone cannot succeed as the
cure for this starving patient."
</P>
<P>
She said UNEP's budgets are far from sufficient in terms of
the scale and pace of damage to the global environment.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no illusions that building UNEP's capacity,
raising its stature and improving its effectiveness can be done
without adequate resources," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP is facing serious financial problems and a number of
countries, led by the Untied States, is urging a further cut of
the budgets and programs of the U.N. body.
</P>
<P>
"Throwing more money at UNEP's problems is not an answer to
the problems," a spokesman of the U.S. delegation told a two-week
consultative session which opened on January 27.
</P>
<P>
The United States called for steep cuts in UNEP's budget and
programs, accusing it of being "wasteful, inefficient and
outdated."
</P>
<P>
UNEP's biennial budget fell to 105 million U.S. Dollars for
the past two years, down from a budget of 160 million Dollars for
1991 and 1992.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Turkey for Summoning Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
criticized Turkey for summoning its ambassador to Ankara Monday
night in protest at his disputative statement against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs Alaeddin
Borougerdi said Ankara's move is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"The announcement of such stands should not have been given
such a reaction," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official termed the recent developments in Turkey
as a "move by the Zionists against Iran."
</P>
<P>
He defended Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Reza Bagheri's
statement, saying what the ambassador did is a usual practice by
every Iranian diplomat in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bagheri was invited by the mayor of Turkey's Islamist-governed
city of Sincan, which is near Ankara, to the commemoration of
the "Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Night" on Monday evening and made a
speech to the public.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bagheri stated that the Jews act on the basis
of their ideology and they take pride in fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
He added "If fundamentalism means to return to original roots
of Islam and the Koran, yes, we Iranians are fundamentalists. We
are Muslims and our motto and main goal are to support the rule of
Islam."
</P>
<P>
Bagheri's address sparked sharp criticism in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government lodged a protest against the the
Iranian ambassador for expressing disputed religious views.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current relations between Iran and Turkey as
"friendly," Borougerdi expressed hope that "the enemies of both
nations who created such a hue and cry on the threshold of the
international Qods (Jerusalem) day cannot leave negative impacts
on the mutual relations."

JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The computer software

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Urges Israel to Draw Lesson from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz has urged Israel to draw a lesson from the crash of
two Israeli army helicopters in northern Israel Tuesday night, in
which more than 70 Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz was quoted by the official Lebanese News Agency today
as saying that the Jewish state should learn from the incident
that its occupation of south Lebanon is "costly."
</P>
<P>
Israel said that the two giant U.S.-made Sikorsky CH-53D
helicopters were on a routine deployment, rotating fresh troops
into the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" Israel
self-carved in south Lebanon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister said that the Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon "is still making us hurt and making
Israel bleed."
</P>
<P>
"Now is the time for the world to realize that the peace in
the Middle East region can be reached only if it is
comprehensive and Lebanon is one of its focuses," the Lebanese
official underlined.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter collision occurred following heavy artillery and
mortar exchanges between Israeli forces in the occupied zone and
guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Violence in the region has been intensifying in recent days
and four Israelis soldiers have been killed since the new year.
</P>
<P>
The incident was hailed by the fundamentalist Hezbollah,
which said in a statement that the crash was "divine justice,
God forgets no one."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said that the fact the Israelis were airlifting
troops under cover of darkness underlined how guerrilla attacks
in recent weeks have forced Israel to avoid roads in south
Lebanon, especially during daylight.

GENEVA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR) here today called for all
necessary security measures to protect its workers in concert with

</P>
<P>
Five members of the Human Rights Field Operation (HRFOR) in

"The perpetrators of this outrageous and cowardly attack on
unarmed United Nations personnel in an ambush have not yet been

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
said today his government is committed to creating Best possible
conditions conducive to private investment and business expansion
in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the remarks when meeting with President of the
Coca-Cola Company Douglas Ivester, also the Chief Operating
Officer of Coca-Cola Company, who is in the country for the
inauguration of a Coca-Cola plant in the city of Dar es Salaam
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
During discussions with the coca-cola boss at the State House
here, Mkapa said a tripartite commission has been appointed to
undertake a study of the current taxation regime with a view to
looking into the possibility of lowering the tax rates while
expanding the tax base without revenue loss to the government.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the State House earlier,
the coca-cola boss told President Mkapa that the high taxation
rates for soft-drinks in the country is a hindrance to expansion
of the industry in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He, however, revealed his Atlanta (USA) based company's plans
to expand its African market.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania had the right policies and desirable economic
conditions for investment and expansion of the soft-drink
business.
</P>
<P>
The Plant to be inaugurated tomorrow is the largest investment
in Africa except those in South Africa. It is operating in
cooperation with IPP industry group as a local partner.

<HEADLINE> Profit Plunges Sharply for Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Pepsico Inc., one of the
largest soft drinks makers worldwide, only next to Coca-Cola,
reported on Tuesday that its earnings plummeted 84.5 percent in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Net income declined to 28 million U.S. dollars from 181 million
U.S. dollars in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times listed today the decline in the
international beverage business as the biggest problem for the
fourth quarter during which volume declined 9 percent. But much of
the decline in the business stemmed from problems in Latin
America. There, the company's archrival, the Coca-Cola Company,
wooed away Pepsi's Venezuelan bottler, the Cisneros Group,
eliminating overnight one of the rare markets in which Pepsi-Cola
had outsold Coke.
</P>
<P>
It will take several years before Pepsi will get back to
anything resembling a normal level of profit-ability in that
business, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from big losses overseas, sluggish profit from two of its
three fast-food chains was also attributable to Pepsi's big profit
drop for the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Market 18 Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will sell a proportion of
18 joint ventures in the fields of industry, agriculture, housing,
banks and tourism during the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at today's meeting of the Cabinet
committee in charge of the public business sector and the
expansion of ownership, said the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said the corporate shares
to be offered for sale are valued at 2 billion Egyptian pounds
(590 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the report did not specify how large the for-sale
proportion is to the companies -- six joint industrial companies,
an agricultural company, two housing companies and six banks and
three tourism services.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gamal el-Ganzouri, who chaired today's meeting,
said Egypt is taking steady steps towards economic liberalization
and is committed to launching its economy toward the vaster global
horizons.
</P>
<P>
In full swing of the reform process, Egypt has taken serious
steps towards privatization since 1993, either selling part of the
profit-losing company to its employees or the whole company to
foreign or domestic individuals, or putting it on the public
market.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has listed 300 state-owned enterprises
amounting to 27 billion U.S. dollars on its selling agenda.
</P>
<P>
However, at the moment the public sector still controls 70
percent of the country's industry, especially in the vital sectors
of metal and steel, cement and wheat powder refining.
</P>
<P>
The government has been keeping a firm hand on other pillar
departments, such as the four largest banks of Egypt, electricity
generation, oil refinement, natural gas pipeline, telephone and
air service, water conservation, insurance, the Suez Canal and
railways.
</P>
<P>
Private sectors now account for 49.8 percent of Egypt's total
investment annually, which amounted to 13.2 billion pounds (nearly
4 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> 4,512 Investment Projects Set up in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Altogether 4,512 investment
projects have been set up in Egypt over the past 15 years since it
adopted the open door policy in 1981.
</P>
<P>
These projects have a combined capital of 40.4 billion Egyptian
pounds (11.9 billion U.S. dollars) and aggregate investments of 80
billion pounds (23.5 billion dollars), creating 440,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Fawzi, head of the Executive Board of the General
Investment Authority, said the economic reforms in the Egyptian
economy have been a "miracle" which he attributed to the wise
management of President Hosni Mubarak who steered the reform "with
negligible side effects."
</P>
<P>
In fact, these reforms have had very positive bearings on the
investment drive in Egypt, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
today quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said before 1981 only 810 investment projects existed with a
total capital of 11.4 billion pounds (3.35 billion dollars), an
investment capacity of 18.8 billion pounds (5.53 billion dollars)
and a labor absorption of 166,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The spread of investment projects have given rise to the 30
industrial zones as well as the steady increase in free zones.
</P>
<P>
The government endeavors to create more industrial and free
zones in order to give investors the opportunity to enjoy the tax
breaks and other perks made available to projects in these areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As investment has become a major driving force behind Egypt's
economic momentum, the government has put forward a string of
investor-friendly policies.
</P>
<P>
It has decided that investment projects can take place
without getting permission from the government, with the exception
of the military and tobacco industries and the development of Sinai.
</P>
<P>
During the first 20 days of this year, the investment authority
has approved 140 investment projects.

<HEADLINE> US to Deploy Warplanes in Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States will deploy
30 warplanes in Qatar in the next few months, according to reports
from Qatar reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The deployment will begin no later than May 20, the Qatari News
Agency quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deployment, some pilots and ammunition will also
be sent to Qatar, the statement said, adding the deployment is
"just a routine movement."
</P>
<P>
It is the second time for the U.S. to deploy warplanes in
Qatar. The U.S. made its first warplane deployment in Qatar during
the period from June 18 to August 20 in 1996, when 34
U.S. fighters and tanker aircraft were stationed there.
</P>
<P>
The statement said this year's deployment comes after
consultations between the U.S. and Qatari governments, which were
held recently in the framework of a defense cooperation agreement
inked by the two sides in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It said the deployment showed an expansion of the U.S.-Qatar
military cooperation, which is "directed against nobody" and "with
no hostility,"
</P>
<P>
Qatar and the U.S. have a very close military relationship.
The two countries have held several joint maneuvers for past few
years. The U.S. has set up several arms depots in Qatar as part
of a plan to pre-position weapons in the Gulf region for swift
response at crisis time.

<HEADLINE> Britain Uncertain Over Early Lifting of Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg today expressed doubts over an early lifting of the
European Union's (EU) worldwide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the British National Farmers' Union conference
today, Hogg said that although Britain had now put in place all
the necessary measures to eradicate the BSE or mad cow disease, he
did not expect Britain's EU partners to grant a quick lifting of
the 10-month old trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main reason was internal pressures on other EU
governments from their farming and consumer organizations, which
are strongly opposed to lifting the ban on British beef products.
</P>
<P>
The British minister also expressed his conviction that EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fitzchler was ready to listen to
Britain's case.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview this afternoon, Hogg
said that he thought scientists would be unable to resolve the key
issue of whether BSE can be passed from cow to calf in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"My own bet is the scientists will not come up at least within
the near future with a definite answer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef products exports
last March when the British government admitted possible links
between mad cow disease to its human equivalent Creutzfeldt Jacob
Disease.

<HEADLINE> France Suggests Holding of Summit Between Allies, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- France has suggested that it host
a summit between four Western allies and Russia in April in Paris
to discuss relations between the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted reliable sources in
Brussels as saying that at such a summit, the United States,
France, Britain and Germany would make proposals to Russia on
relations between NATO and Russia, and on the creation of a joint
consultation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
They would also present proposals on the reduction of armament
under the treaty on control of conventional forces in Europe, and
on Western economic aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential office said today that no decision has
been made on such a summit, while the German government has
confirmed that such a summit is "envisaged," according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac talked about the idea of
holding such a summit when he met with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin on February 2 in Moscow, AFP quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that with the NATO summit to be held in July in Madrid
bound to take in its new members, the Western allies are running
out of time to insure Russia that NATO's eastward expansion would
not create a new East-West split.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly opposed to NATO expansion and has warned of
a new division of Europe.

<HEADLINE> ICRC: Two ICRC Workers Taken Hostage in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) said here today that two ICRC workers in
Tajikistan had been taken hostage in the lower Garm Valley by a
local commander.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that its delegation in Dushanbe, capital of
Tajikistan, was informed of the incident late Wednesday. So far no
ransom demands have been made; nor any explanations have been
given.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC did not give the name of the commander but said that
he had previously abducted five members of the United Nations
observer mission in Tajikistan and five members of the Russian
press.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC team was returning to the base from the town of
Tavildara, where they had been conducting a survey to ascertain
the needs of the many people severely affected by the brutal
conflict in the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC, together with the UN mission, deplores this
abduction. It is yet another blatant violation of international
humanitarian law and an act of direct aggression against those
whose sole purpose is to aid victims of war," the ICRC said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC joins the observer mission in calling upon all those
with influence in the area to take every possible step to ensure
the speedy release of all hostages," the ICRC said.

TUNIS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali received a letter today from his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad on the latest developments of the
Mideast peace process and Syria's stance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tunisian news agency, the letter was conveyed
during a meeting between Ali and the visiting Syrian
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam who arrived here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Khaddam said that meeting covered
the current situation in the region and Syria's stance towards the
resumption of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he reiterated during the meeting Syria's
readiness to resume negotiation from the point it had left off,
provided the Israeli government adopts the the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam added that Ali underscored Tunisia's support of Syria's
efforts to resume peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara who accompanied Khaddam
in the visit also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke off a year ago. The new
Israeli rightwing government has repatedly called for resumption
of talks without preconditions. But Syria has made it clear that
negotiation is only possible when Israel agrees to full
withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captureed in the 1967 war
with Arabs.

<HEADLINE> UK Central Bank Indicates No Interest Rate Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Official interest rates in
Britain will stick at 6 percent with no immediate change after
Wednesday's monthly monetary meeting, the Bank of England
signaled to finance markets today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that base interest rates are unlikely to rise
before the general election.
</P>
<P>
The news follows the latest monthly meeting today between
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England
governor Eddie George, and will please home-buyers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with economists' expectation that Clarke would
resist the central bank's calls for a rate hike which would be
unpopular ahead of the election.
</P>
<P>
The bank usually announces any changes in base rates
immediately after the monthly monetary meeting. It made no such
announcement today, which indicates that the official interest
rates were left unchanged.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists were urging caution until money
markets reopen Thursday in case the central bank announces a rate
change in the morning.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Editor Under Arrest, Mentally Unstable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The chief editor of an Iranian
magazine, whose arrest has caused trouble in Iran-Germany
relations, is mentally unstable, his brother said in a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Ismaiel Sarkuhi said "My brother is currently under arrest in
Tehran, he is physically well but mentally unstable."
</P>
<P>
Iranian security authorities said that Faraj Sarkuhi, 49,
chief editor of Adineh, a cultural weekly in Persian, was
arrested along with his brother and two other smugglers while
attempting to make an illegal exit in Bushehr, a port city in
southern Iran Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ismaiel brushed aside doubts by the Iranian Information
Ministry for Faraj's escape, saying that his brother had become
suicidal and even tried to kill himself by putting his fingers
into the plug.
</P>
<P>
Ismaiel added that Faraj Sarkuhi became horrified and decided to
leave the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
He said that his brother's mental instability forced him to
help to leave the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
He said Faraj was arrested for a short period in September 1996
due to his contacts with the cultural attaches of the German and
French embassies in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Later he applied for a trip to Germany which was initially
rejected but later approved. He then went to Germany in early
November and returned to Tehran via Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Back in Tehran, the Iranian Information Ministry expressed
doubts and accused him of cooperation with the German security
service, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has protested against German intervention in the case
since the editor sought political asylum in Germany.

Sihanouk stated.
</P>
<P>
The King said he upholds the stance "in the name of the
friendship between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the People's
Republic of China and equally in the name of fairness that there
is only one China of which Taiwan is a simple province."

This is why many countries have ridiculed and rejected the

<P>
The U.S. slander against the DPRK is part of its reckless
pressure prompted by its hostile policy towards the DPRK, the KCNA

</P>
<P>
The spokesman went on to say that Korean socialism, which
regards the idea of "juche" or self-determination, as its
political philosophy, centered on the masses of the people, is
the best social system in the world which perfectly guarantees
human rights.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Stresses Turkey's Importance in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Islamist Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan today stressed Turkey's importance in NATO to
underline the country's bid to join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with visiting NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana here, the prime minister said his country is the strongest
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has argued that the enlargement of the
NATO should be related to the expansion of the European Union
(EU). The European Commission is considering the membership
applications by up to 10 possible candidates, but Turkey is not
among them.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here Wednesday on a two-day official visit,
also met with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Chief of General
Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi, Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and
Defense Minister Turhan Tayan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry sources have said the EU must give a
reasonable response to Turkey's desire to be a full member.
</P>
<P>
Last week Ciller warned that Ankara might block plans for NATO
expansion if her country's plea for EU accession was stalled.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Solana told reporters during a stopover in
Hungary that he did not expect Turkey to block NATO's expansion
into Eastern Europe in a bid to gain closer Turkish links with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made a full membership application to the EU in April
1987.

JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Protesters and policemen
clashed in part of areas around Johannesburg, South Africa, today
and at least three people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a
crowd manning barricades in Eldorado Park, south of Johannesburg,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The crowd was taking part in a boycott to highlight the
grievances of Eldorado Park residents who have had their water

Residents in the western Johannesburg suburb of Westbury also
held demonstrations against over charge for municipal service.
</P>
<P>
"There are many of us who cannot afford the amount of charge
for services," said one angry resident, adding that "many of our
homes have got no water and the lights have been cut off."

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Urges Greek, Turkish Cypriots to Seek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's
special envoy for Cyprus Han Sung Joo today urged the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities on this divided island to seize the
opportunity available to them in the coming months for a solution.
</P>
<P>
Han made the remarks at the airport before his departure here
for Turkey after a week-long shuttle diplomacy between the two
sides in a bid to bring them to a negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"There is a kind of time-frame and we have to take advantage
of the remaining few months or we may have to wait for a long
time before the situation gets better," Han told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also said "we must ensure that the window of opportunity
is not locked."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had identified any areas of agreement between the
leaders of the two sides after his contacts, Han said "both
recognize the importance and urgency of finding a permanent
solution, which is a good start."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted "there is still a lot of distance in terms
of the positions and in terms of mutual trust, which I think is
very important."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said he arrived here hoping to find areas of
convergence between the two sides and "I think there is some
movement, but not sufficient for me to recommend a direct
meeting between the two leaders at this time."
</P>
<P>
Han said he will report to the Secretary-General how far the
two community leaders would go in approaching direct
negotiations. "I will recommend we make further preparations
before inviting the leaders for such a direct meeting," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Thursday, Han said there has
been no convergence of views between the two sides in Cyprus to
allow for direct talks between President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"It would be somewhat premature to call for direct talks at
this stage," he told the Greek and Turkish Cypriot Journalists,
adding that "more convergence of views is needed to make such
talks successful."
</P>
<P>
Han identified two elements as being most important for
convergence of positions. "One is the willingness on the part of
the sides to be flexible to enter into talks in the spirit of
compromising and give and take. The other element is how far
each side is willing to walk", he said.
</P>
<P>
Han will continue his talks in Turkey and Greece in a
bid to push the Cyprus peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island in the wake
of an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held on
and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- In a small county in southwest
China's Guizhou Province, home of people from various ethnic
groups living together, the biggest market fair is held each year
on December 25 of the Chinese lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
People of Miao and Yi ethnic groups like to get an early
morning start on their Spring Festival shopping. Young people
travel to the fair on motorcycles, while three years ago they
could only ride bicycles.
</P>
<P>
Meat, eggs, festival rice cakes, sausage, red candles and
lanterns are available to satisfy many tastes. Seafood, which in
the past was rare in the area, is also on sale.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to try some seafood, since we have had enough of
other types of food in mountain areas," said two brothers from the
Miao ethnic group, with packages of dried sea fish in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuanrong, 52, of the Yi ethnic group, has just sold some
pork, earning about 120 yuan. "We've already made 100 kg of rice
cakes, and I will go home to have a happy festival after selling
all the meat."
</P>
<P>
At a spice stand, a peddler is busy serving the customers. "In
the old days, the only dish for farmers here was rice soup with
some salt in it, and no other spices," he said. "But now, you can
see things are different."
</P>
<P>
Music from a stall where cassette tapes are sold has attracted
many buyers. "These days during the fair, I can expect to sell
more than 100 cassettes a day," said Tang Zhongsong, the owner of
the stand, who has been selling cassettes here for a decade.

At the home of Wang Guomin, a Miao farmer in Lianhua village in
Longli County, the family is watching television.
</P>
<P>
"We have five family members, and three can do farming," said
Wang. "We reaped more than 4,500 kilograms of rice last year, and
spent more than 10,000 yuan on fixing our house."
</P>
<P>
In another house, Wang Yongqiang puts down his painting tools
and said, "There are 94 families, or 400 people in our village.
The average per capita income reached more than 3,000 yuan last
year. More than 80 households have set up closed-circuit
televisions, and more than 40 households built new houses."
</P>
<P>
There are 10 tractors, two mountain motors for farm use and
many motorcycles in the village, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shanyuan and his wife may be the busiest couple in the
village. Yu transports villagers on his tractor to do their
festival shopping, while his wife makes 100 to 150 kilograms of
noodles from bean or sweet potato starch a day for the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Singing can be heard from the house, where young people are
playing with a karoake machine. "It was brought here by people who
have been to Xiamen and Guangzhou," said Wang Yongqiang with a
smile, adding that the group will hold a basketball tournament in
a few days.
</P>
<P>
It's still hard for many of the local residents to believe that
new houses with TV antennas now stand in the area once home to
thatched huts and people who did not have enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to make it a really big year through hard work,"
said Wang. "We have already stored enough seed, fertilizer and
farming tools."

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian National
Association for the Blind today demanded enforcement of law on
the right of the blind for employment.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made by Vice-chairman of the association Zemed
Gebre Amlak at a meeting here on employment and educational
constraints on the blind.
</P>
<P>
Zemed said the right of the blind for employment has not yet
been fully ensured despite the issuance of the proclamation
providing for the rights of the disabled to be employed in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to change employers' biases and backward
attitude against the blind, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Atakilt Assefa, deputy commissioner
of the Federal Civil Service Commission said preparations to
issue regulations and directives for the implementation of the
proclamation has already been completed, adding that his
commission will try its best to enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government issued a proclamation on rights of
the disabled for employment two years ago.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: 40,000 Refugees Flee Camps in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- About 40,000 Rwandan refugees
fled the Shabunda camps in eastern Zaire on Wednesday following
reports that rebels had taken a nearby town, the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR quoted local authorities as saying that the refugees
moved out after reports swept Shabunda that Katshunga, a small
town located 45 kilometers northeast of Shabunda, had
fallen.
</P>
<P>
There has been no independent confirmation of these reports.
</P>
<P>
"All the refugee sites in Shabunda are empty," said Dillah
Doumaye, UNHCR's deputy representative in Zaire. "The refugees
packed their belongings, the plastic sheets they use for shelter
and went away. They were prepared to leave and the departure was
orderly."
</P>
<P>
A small UNHCR plane bringing in blankets and food was
surrounded by a group of about 150 people demanding to be flown
out, said UNHCR. The plane took off with all three UNHCR staff
members posted in Shabunda on board after distributing the relief
supplies, originally destined for the Catholic mission of Shabunda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
said on Wednesday that it had suspended its work in Rwanda for 10
days and was pulling non-essential staff out of the country
following Tuesday's killing of five U.N. workers.

BRUSSELS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Loans provided by the European

economic cooperation rose 8.4 percent over 1995 to 23.2 billion
Ecus (28.5 billion U.S. dollars) the bank's President Brian Unwin

such as communications and energy, Unwin said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 10 percent were provided to boost economic
cooperation between EU countries and countries in central and
eastern Europe and the Mediterranean lining up to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Unwin said the EIB increased its loans last year to boost the
EU economy and help launch the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank will continue to increase loans in 1997 to

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China had 146.6 billion US
dollars in imports and exports of processed goods using imported
materials in 1996, accounting for more than half of the foreign
trade volume.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Against German Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran protested against German
intervention in arrest of a chief editor of Iranian liberal
magazine, who seeks political asylum in Sweden or Germany,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that Ali Ahani, Director General for the
West European Affairs of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Wednesday
night summoned German ambassador to Iran Horst Beshama and asked
hin to deliver the message of Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
to his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the German ambassador, the Iranian
official protested against the "irrational statements" of the
spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised that the spokesman of the German Foreign
Ministry links relations between the two countries to the
destiny of an Iranian national who has taken illegal measures
and whose case must be investigated according to the laws of the
Islamic republic," Ahani was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that German officials should be vigilant as to
avert any attempt to mar Tehran-Bonn relations.
</P>
<P>
The German ambassador said that he will relay Ahani's
statements to senior German officials, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
Wednesday night that the case of Faraj Sarkouhi, editor of the
Persian weekly Adineh, was unrelated to relations between Iran
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iranian security authorities said that the Iranian editor was
arrested along with his brother and two other smugglers while
attempting to make an illegal exit in Bushehr, a port city in
southern Iran Monday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the statement of the German Foreign Ministry on
the case, Mohammadi said "the arrest of the Iranian editor was
simply a national issue that did not warrant the interference of
any foreign government."
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic government could not possibly ignore its own
laws and principles when dealing with a person who has committed
heavy crimes," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
After Sarkuhi's disappearance last week, international efforts
spearheaded by Sweden and Germany have been made to find out
what has happened to the Iranian journalist who has disappeared
twice in three months.

Officials have sent artistic troupes to entertain the flood
victims, and have provided supplies of meat and rice and
assistance for reconstructing homes.

<HEADLINE> Flower Popular Again Before Lunar New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- As they do every year, flowers
are brightening the streets of Chinese cities during the Spring
Festival holiday season, the celebration of the lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
Flower peddler Li Dagui, from the southwest China city of
Chengdu, said "I can earn at least 2,000 yuan during the holidays"
selling a vast array of buds, including lilies, plum blossoms and
chrysanthemums.
</P>
<P>
In a major flower wholesale market there, nearly 400,000
bouquets of flowers are sold daily at holiday time. China has a
total of 700 flower markets, and the number of flower shops
nationwide has ballooned to over 6,000.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese say flowers are now a substitute for fireworks,
the former celebratory symbol of choice, which were banned in
cities several years ago.
</P>
<P>
And the gentle flower power has had an effect on some people's
holiday spirit. "I will place a spray of chrysanthemum in my room,
hoping that they will bless me with a good spring," said a buyer
in northwest China's city of Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jia Jianzhong said that though Chinese people have become
wealthier, they are cutting back on excessive and expensive
holiday partying, opting instead for more basic pleasures. "I
choose to buy flowers because they can make me feel relaxed during
the five-day festival," he said.
</P>
<P>
Improved technology has made it possible for flowers to be
planted in most places in the country and in any season. A bunch
of flowers usually costs 20 to 30 yuan (about three or four US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Flowers are an appropriate gift to send to my relatives and
friends during the holidays," said one government worker.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Holiday Travellers Going Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 Shanghai residents
planned on spending an exotic Spring Festival in Singapore,
Thailand, or Malaysia, and thousands were turned down because
airlines didn't have enough seats available on flights.
</P>
<P>
To many Shanghai holiday-revellers, going to Southeast Asian
countries is no longer just some crazy dream, and more of them
want to spend China's most important holiday away, instead of the
usual gathering with family members.
</P>
<P>
Jin Liming, an official in charge of overseas trips at the
Shanghai branch of the Youth Travel Service, said that his agency
arranged trips to Southeast Asian countries for over 1,500 people
during Spring Festival, and even chartered two planes for Thailand
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increased number of travellers going abroad
to increased incomes and the changing of some traditional
ideas. Most of the travellers are in their 40s and work in finance
or for foreign-funded ventures, or own their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
He said the agency's heapest package is an eight-day trip to
Thailand for 5,800 yuan (725 US dollars) and the most expensive is

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Chief Wants to Be Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Renato de Villa said today that he wants himself becoming the
standard bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party and winning
President Fidel Ramos' endorsement in the 1998 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that I would win such an endorsement," he said.
</P>
<P>
De Villa said he considered Ramos' endorsement as a "great
factor" for any candidate of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
He added that the endorsement of the Lakas-NUCD was also
important because it is "now the largest party in place."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, de Villa indicated that he was looking forward to
certain opportunities that would level the playing field between
him and House Speaker Jose de Venecia in the contest to become the
ruling party's candidate in the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, de Villa conceded that de Venecia, the
secretary general of the ruling party, has an advantage over him
in seeking to become party's standard bearer because the House
Speaker "is a big man in the party."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that President Ramos favors de Villa
although he was still not a member of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was forbidden by the Constitution to seek a second term
beyond 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chiefs Grilled Over Loans to Collapsed Steelmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution
summoned two bank heads and one former bank president here today
to grill them on their banks' loans to Hanbo Iron and Steel
Company, which collapsed last month with billions of U.S. dollars
in debts.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors suspect that the three, President Kim Shi-hyung of
the Korea Development Bank, President Chang Myung-sun of the Korea
Exchange Bank and former President of the Cho Hung Bank Lee
Jong-yun, may have received kickbacks from Hanbo, the country's
second largest steel maker, in return for the loans.
</P>
<P>
There are also suspicions that they may have been pressured by
legislators or government officials to extend loans to Hanbo, a
subsidiary of South Korea's 14th largest conglomerate, Hanbo
Business Group.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Iron and Steel was declared bankrupt on January 23 after
racking up about five trillion won (5.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
loans.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo, General Chairman of Hanbo Business Group was
arrested on January 31 on fraud, embezzlement and other charges.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution confirmed that Chung had floated bad checks in
an attempt to raise funds, and had diverted part of the bank loans
to finance capital investment in his steel mill for unauthorized
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Chung had secured billions of dollars in bank loans between
1992 and 1996 without sufficient collateral for his flagship firm.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo case has become a major political issue as the
opposition camp claims that government officials were instrumental
in helping the debt-ridden firm obtain the loans.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, South Korean President Kim Young-sam ordered the
law enforcement authorities to investigate "the
loans-for-kickback" allegations.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The police forces of
Southern Africa have been urged to work closely to dismantle
criminal syndicates which have formed networks at regional and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
The call was made today by Botswana's minister for
Presidential Affairs and Public Administration, Ponatshego
Kedkilwe, when he was opening a special conference of the
Southern African regional police chiefs in Gaborone,capital of
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the meeting will contribute toward
continued efforts to minimise differences in the strategies to
fight crimes within the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference comes at a time when crime has reached alarming
propotions in Southern Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore crucial for countries in the region to pool
their resources together to fight law-breakers, he added.
</P>
<P>
This, the minister said, will help attract much-needed
domestic and foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of police chiefs will also examine all
laws dealing with extradition of fugitive criminals and
repatriation of stolen property.
</P>
<P>
Police leaders from 12 member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) are attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Party Secretary Extends Greetings to Taiwan People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The top Party official in
southeast China's Fujian Province today extended New Year's
greetings to the Taiwan people, wishing all on the other side of
the Taiwan Straits a happy Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
In a festival message to the Taiwan people on behalf of the
over 30 million Fujian people, Chen Mingyi, secretary of the
Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
said that 1997 is a great year for the Chinese people because of
Hong Kong's return on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He urged people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to be
further united and work together for China's reunification,
fighting any activities intended to divide the country.
</P>
<P>
"This year Fujian will continue to make every effort to promote
economic cooperation, trade, and other kinds of exchanges across
the Taiwan Straits, in line with the central government's basic
principles of peaceful reunification and 'one country, two
systems'," he promised.
</P>
<P>
He added that his province will also further improve the
investment environment for Taiwan businessmen, and well manage the
existing enterprises with Taiwan funds.
</P>
<P>
He added that Fujian people are very glad to see that two of
the province's major ports, Fuzhou and Xiamen, last year were
named as experimental ports for direct shipping across the Taiwan
Straits, and hope the realization of direct shipping will come as
soon.
</P>
<P>
Describing 1996 as a successful year which witnessed fast
economic growth and social stability in Fujian, he welcomed more
people from Taiwan to visit Fujian and other provinces in 1997, to
have a better understanding of the dramatic changes of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> 7 People Killed in Clan Clashes in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people have
been reportedly killed and ten others wounded in the inter-clan
fighting in Somalia's central region of Hiran between the
clansmen of Hawadle and Badi Adde.
</P>
<P>
The armed clashes erupted yesterday afternoon between heavily
armed militiamen in Jalalaqsi District, 140 km north of the
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, widespread looting also took place
as the Badi Adde clansmen were driven out of the town early last
evening.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the fighting broke out when elders from
the two sides were trying to contain any possible outbreak of
fighting between their clansmen.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the efforts by the clan elders, the wild
militiamen of the two sides exchanged heavy fire, forcing the
elders to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have so far accused each other of starting the
fighting, but there is no independent confirmation for the cause
of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the two clans of Hawadle and Badi Adde have not
been in good terms with each other since the Canadian aid agency
of Oxfam's local worker was killed outside the town late last
month.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Badi Adde clan elders in Bulo Burto have accused
the aid agencies of creating hostility among the clans, urging
the agencies to be neutral or leave the whole area.
</P>
<P>
There are four international aid agencies currently operating
in Hiran region. It is reported that the clansmen of Hawadle and
Badi Adde had been living together in Bulo Burto and Jalalaqsi in
harmony.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Announces Measures to Boost Local Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
announced a series of measures and incentives, amounting to 17
million Cyprus pounds (about 34 million U.S. dollars), to help
boost the local economy in the wake of the adverse effects
of the recent missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to local press today, the range of incentives and
fiscal measures, approved by the cabinet, aim at promoting
tourism, exports, agriculture and financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Announcing measures Wednesday, Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou said the recent unrest and Turkish threats for
pre-emptive strike against Cyprus, following the Cypriot
government decision to purchase Russian anti-aircraft missiles, had
affected public confidence and the government was ready to act
to prevent tourism from suffering.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government views the economy as remaining stable
and generally healthy despite signs of a slowdown in growth
performance in some areas over the last six months, the
Minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister, a total of 4 million Cyprus
pounds (about 8 million dollars) will go in subsidies to the
export industry made available for this year only.
</P>
<P>
Clothing, footwear, luggage makers and leather goods will be
subsidized at three percent of the value of their exports,
while other industries will get a two percent subsidy on
value of exports.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Tourism Organization will get an extra 1.5
million pounds (about 3 million dollars) to run a promotion
campaign to reverse the damage which adverse publicity over the
missile crisis has caused to Cyprus image abroad.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture will receive 2 million pounds (about 4 million
dollars) to compensate for drought damage and help local
produce compete against European Union products.
</P>
<P>
Around 1.5 million will go in offering incentives toward
hotel renovation.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou also announced a reduction of interest rates by
half percent (from 8.5 percent to 8). However the Minister called
for moves to reverse the prevailing negative mood among financial
circles.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow will be the
traditional Chinese Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, when people
across the country welcome in the Year of the Ox in the manner
fitting a nation undergoing social and economic transformation.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the festival, millions of residents in the
Chinese capital are busy cleaning streets, bus stops, railway
stations, hotels, school campuses, factories and the scenic spots
of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to have the city to become the most
beautiful city in the country and in the world," said a local
resident with a broom in his hand, who had joined the clean-up
group on Chang'an Street in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In Xi'an, the capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
residents are finishing last-minute shopping for their relatives
and friends. In the Kaiyuan shopping center, Miss Liu Fang is
trying on a wool coat. "My family members are spread all over the
country, and we'll be getting together in Xi'an during the Spring
Festival," she said. "I think I should buy each of them a
beautiful gift."
</P>
<P>
People are expected to greet the Spring Festival quite
differently than in the past, as China has seen rapid and
sustained social and economic growth, residents' income has
increased and their living standard has greatly improved, said an
official from a travel agency in Jinan, a booming city in east
China's Shandong Province.

Many of the people in Jinan Province spend their festival
holidays traveling across country, rather than the traditional
practice of staying home and eating "jiaozi", or Chinese
dumplings, watching TV and visiting friends, said a middle-aged
school teacher, who has decide to join a tour group to Guangzhou,
Shenzhen and Zhuhai during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone can afford the expensive trips; most of
the people in central and west China live in poverty as a result
of the harsh geographical conditions and natural disasters. In
southwest China's Sichuan Province, government officials have sent
money and daily necessities to the neediest people in the remote,
mountainous areas on the eve of the festival.
</P>
<P>
Also on the lunar new year's eve, food distribution stations at
all levels in central China's Hubei Province have sent 135 million
kg grain to people who suffered from floods last year.
</P>
<P>
To ensure local people affected by disasters will have enough
food this spring, Hubei has provided a total of 402 million kg
grains since the beginning of the year, according to a provincial
food official.
</P>
<P>
In Dalian, the biggest port city in northeast China, people
have decorated the city with holiday lanterns and will stage
colorful performances during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, unlike Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and other big cities, fireworks are allowed in Dalian
during the festival, and a fireworks exhibition featuring
traditional Chinese lion dances will be held in the city, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks Japan Not to Make Accusation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today asked Japan
not to accuse the country of being a stumbling block to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) accord on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Japan should not
blame Malaysia if the accord was not signed by February 15 in
Geneva, Switzerland as it had been expected by other nations that
have offered to liberalize their telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
"Japan too has problems. They are also strict. We want to sell
canned pineapple (to Japan) for example, the country imposes many
restrictions. So we all have to be patient. There is no need to
accuse each other," he told reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
On when Malaysia would make an offer to liberalize its
telecommunications sector, Mahathir said "we need to take care of
our national interest."
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was not keen to make an attractive offer on
other sectors because the national interest had to be given
priority.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the statement when asked for his view on an
earlier report that Japan's Telecommunications and Posts Ministry
officials accused Malaysia for being the stumbling block for the
failure in reaching accord under the WTO which was expected to be
signed next week as Kuala Lumpur had yet to make an offer to
liberalize its telecommunications sector.

<HEADLINE> Most Romans Support Bid for 2004 Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three-quarters of Romans
support the Italian capital's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games,
according to a poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of 1,000 Romans commissioned by the
city in January, 72 percent said they support the bid, of which
38.4 percent are "very supportive" and 34.4 percent are "fairly
supportive". Only 13 percent said they were opposed to the bid.
</P>
<P>
Support for the Games is strongest (80 percent) in the city
outskirts, like Tor Vergata, the projected site of the Olympic
Village.
</P>
<P>
But the project gets only 51 percent support from residents of
the city's historic center. "Where the fear of a tourist influx,
like the one predicted for the Jubilee Year 2000 celebrations, is
probably the highest," the Rome 2004 committee said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest supporters are shopkeepers (77 percent), students
(79 percent) and people aged 18-34 (80-90 percent). Overall,
polls in December and November found similar support for the bid
among Romans.
</P>
<P>
Rome is competing with ten other cities for the right to host
the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) is expected to name five finalists in March and
select a winner city in September.
</P>
<P>
The Eternal City is the odds-on favorite to win the 2004
Olympics, according to London bookmakers. The William Hill House

<HEADLINE> Tourist Spending in HK Hits Record High Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Tourists spent a record high
of 84.5 billion HK dollars (about 11 billion U.S. dollars) in Hong
Kong last year, up 13 percent over 1995, according to today's
local press reports.
</P>
<P>
"The increase has confirmed tourism's role as Hong Kong's top
earning service industry," said the Hong Kong Tourist Association,
which released the figures Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Visitor spending from all major markets except Taiwan recorded
growth last year, said the association.
</P>
<P>
Japanese visitors alone put 18.5 billion HK dollars (2.4
billion U.S. dollars) into Hong Kong's coffers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland trailed in a close second, with visitors
spending totaling 15.2 billion HK dollars (1.9 billion
U.S. dollars). Taiwan ranked third with 13.7 billion HK dollars
(1.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan was the only major market with decrease in
total visitor spending, down 9 percent from 1995, Taiwanese still
had the highest per capita spending, among all major market areas.
</P>
<P>
They spent an average of 7,549 HK dollars (968 U.S. dollars) in
 Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Figures also showed that although shopping contributed 40.9
billion HK dollars (5.2 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 10
percent over 1995, last year was the first time in more than 30
years that visitors' shopping expenditure dipped below half of
total visitor spending, comprising 49.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
This year, the association is expecting a 7 percent increase in
 the number of visitors and a rise of 11 percent in
earnings.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Lawsuit against U.S. to be Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today that the
International Court of Justice will review the nature of Iran's
lawsuit against the United States on destruction of its oil
platforms about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Oil Ministry said that according to the latest order
issued by the Hague, the U.S. administration is bound to
register its response with the court by July 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran's claim against the United States had been filed on
November 1, 1992 for damages as the result of U.S. attacks
on Iranian offshore oil platforms by four U.S. navy warships.
</P>
<P>
On October 19, 1987, American warships surrounded and shelled
the two Iranian oil platforms of "Resalat" and "Reshadat" in
the Gulf. The fire completely destroyed one and damaged the
other by 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Americans pounded Iran's Salman oil platform
and the Nasr oil platforms, destroying the two platforms along
with their peripheral installations.
</P>
<P>
Washington has alleged that it had attacked Iran's oil
platforms because Iran had laid mines in the Persian Gulf
which, Washington claimed, had damaged an American ship named
U.S.S. Samuel and injured a number of her crew.
</P>
<P>
The Americans had claimed that the Iranians used the two
platforms for military purposes, while the Iranian government
has shown that it never used either of the two platforms for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said in her complaint to the court that the
United States is responsible for her unwarranted attacks on the
Iranian platforms which was in transparent violation of the
treaty between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Iran demanded that the United States must offer
adequate compensation to Iran for physical damage to those
platforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African armed forces
will drastically disband and amalgamate units as part of a cost-saving
exercise in the military services, the local newspaper The Star reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Several group commands, regiments and other units in all the 10
territorial commands have either been disbanded, amalgamated or
closed, Chief of the Army Reg Otto was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The downsizing of the army, the lieutenant-general Otto said, would
allow the army to comply with budgetary restrictions, while
maintaining and promoting combat efficiency.
</P>
<P>
A similiar exercise has been conducted in the South African navy,
airforce, the medical services serving the armed forces and at defense
headquarters, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major restructuring program since 1990, at
which time rationalization affected thousands of personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to Otto, the South African army had been told last year to
start planning for a significan reduction in the 1997/98 defense
budget and had conducted an in-depth investigation into the feasibility
of a redesigned forces.
</P>
<P>
It is widely anticipated in military circles that the current 10
billion Rands (2.2 billion U.S dollars) budget will be cut by more
than 26 percent, and this will have a major effect on force design in
all arms of service.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of personnel have taken retrenchment packages as part of
the rationalization of defense fore in terms of a proposal to cut
the number to about 70,000 by April 1999, the newspaper said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- An opinion poll of 50 Iranian
students revealed here today that hardline Parliament Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri is poised to win the presidential race scheduled
in June.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted by the English daily Tehran Times said that
36 students said that Nateq-Nouri will win the election, five
said the winner will be Mir-Hossein Mousavi, former prime
minister, and one said Mohammadi Reyshahri, former information
minister and leader of the Iranian pilgrims for the annual Hajji
ceremonies,will be the next president.
</P>
<P>
Three candidacy have been announced so far for the 7th
presidential elections. They are Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri,
who has been regarded as a front-runner in the race at present,
Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri and Seyyed Mohammad Khatami,
presently presidential advisor and president of Iran's Library.
</P>
<P>
They are all clergymen. Former prime minister Mir-Hossein
Mousavi, who enjoys a wide popularity among the people, refused
to join in the race.
</P>
<P>
A Tehran University graduate in political geography said on
condition of anonymity that Nateq-Nouri is not approved of by
the students. But it is the votes cast by the villagers and
the masses that determine the fate of the elections.
</P>
<P>
"The villagers will vote for the individual who has been
seen at the inaugural ceremonies the most," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asgari, a mechanical-engineering student at Amir-Kabir University,
said that Nateq-Nouri will be the winner in the elections due
to his earnest publicity campaign.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Rand Reaches Four-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's local currency
Rand yesterday surged to its best level in four months of 4.5 against
the US Dollar in the monetary market, said sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The Rand on Wednesday touched a day's best level of 4.4825 bid
against the Dollar which traders said was its strongest level since
September 20 last year, from Tuesday's close of 4.527.
</P>
<P>
Traders and analysts here attributed the continuing in-flow of
international funds into South Africa and improvement of the business
confidence index as the main factors of Rand's performance.
</P>
<P>
Rand has lost about 30 percent of its value against the Dollar last
year.
</P>
<P>
Speculations spreading over the local market also put that the
improved confidence about South Africa's economic prospects would
allow President Nelson Mandela to announce plans to relax exchange
controls in his opening of Parliament address on Friday, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Expectations to this effect were also heightened after Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel's Wednesday failure to deny there were such
plans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Manuel ducked questions about
the possibility of an announcement on the lifting of the remaining
exchange controls, saying there had been rumours recently on a variety
of different topics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a rally bond market also contributed to the Rand's
recent recapturing of its lost ground last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Bond Exchange figures, foreigners have so far this
year bought a net 535 million US Dollar of South African bonds,
compared to 138 million US Dollar in the whole of the second half of
1996. enditem

<HEADLINE> ICRC, UN Mission Condemn Hostage-Taking in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) and the U.N. observer mission in Tajikistan
today condemned Tajik rebels to take ICRC and U.N. representatives
and Russian reporters as hostage, news reports reaching here from
Dushanbe said.
4  The Geneva-based ICRC headquarters in a press release available
here described the seizure of two ICRC and five U.N.
representatives and four Russian journalists as a flagrant breach
of international humanitarian law and as a direct aggression
against those whose only purpose is to help the victims of war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observer mission Wednesday also issued a press
release, describing the hostage incident as terrorist acts and
expressing deep concern about rebel action.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Tajik rebels seized four Russian reporters and
two Red Cross aid workers on Wednesday, demanding that authorities
provide a corridor on the Afghan border for Sodirov's armed
supporters to cross into Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the U.N. mission in Tajikistan Milos Strugar said
that rebels had allowed U.N. observers to talk to the mission by
radio and the rebels did not make any physical threats against the
hostages.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gives New Shot to Cotton Plantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has put up new stimulas to
encourage farmers to plant more cotton, which is the most
important agricultural produce in the country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will allocate 15 million pounds (4.4 million U.S. dollars)
as the state's contribution to the cotton plantation for this
year, said today's Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and
Land Reclamation Youssef Wali said this money will be used to help
farmers clear their land of the present crops to start the cotton
planting early.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wali issued another decision banning the planting of
the new crops after March 15 in southern Egypt and after March 31 in
northern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Those who plant cotton after winter crops will be deprived of
any advantages the Ministry of Agriculture offers to cotton
farmers, either in preparing the land or combating pests.
</P>
<P>
In 1996-97 farming season, Egypt plans to increase the cotton
acreage by 10 percent to one million feddans (420000 hectares) and
raise the crops to 8 million cantar (0.36 million tonnes).
</P>
<P>
The target export will top 1.5 million cantar (67500 tonnes), a
rise over 1.38 million cantar (61100 tonnes) last year.

<HEADLINE> EU Mideast Envoy Calls on Israel to Withdraw from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) special
Middle East envoy Miguel Moratinos has said that the Israeli
government cannot obtain peace with Syria unless it fully
withdraws from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Moratinos, who met with Syrian
President Hafez Assad last week, as saying that he does not
think "full withdrawal is just Assad's thinking, but it is the
view of the Syrian people as well."
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who is also the Spanish ambassador to Israel, was
named Middle East special envoy by the EU last October, despite
the opposition of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, in an interview with the Jerusalem Post, said that
it may be possible to resume talks with Syria on the basis of the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for trading
land for peace.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be "helpful" if Israel said resolution 242
applies to the Golan Heights, noting that Assad is waiting for a
signal that Israel is serious about negotiating with Syria over
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Likud government has said that it accepts 242 as basis
of the 1991 Madrid peace conference, but has never said that
it accepts the resolution as applying in particular to the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that one interesting factor in the talks is
that unlike its Labor predecessors, the current Israeli
government is more in synchronization with Syria in not seeking
extensive normalization between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, past peace formula should be adjusted to take this
new reality into account, Moratinos added.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy suggested each side declaring a "full
withdrawal" from the Golan in return for "full security" for
Israel, including Golan-related security arrangements, south
Lebanon and water.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spillage Affects 1,000 Villagers in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 villagers in Mpika of
northern Zambia have been affected by the oil-spillage from a
pipeline burst which occurred one week ago.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper today quoted sources from the Tazama Pipeline
Corporation as confirming that there is a massive underground oil
spillage.
</P>
<P>
The sources said they still have not located the exact position of
the spillage but it has spread to about one kilometre along the Malambo
stream and the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
But the company management has maintained that their pipeline has
not burst only claiming that there is a ''little spillage'' in the
Mpika area.
</P>
<P>
The continued reports of the pipeline burst in Mpika have
prompted the government and the Environmental Council of Zambia
to dispatch a team of environmental inspectors to the area to
probe the case.
</P>
<P>
The oil pipeline from Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam to Zambian
northern city of Ndola is alleged to have burst leading to the death
of livestock, chickens and fish in two rivers in the area.
</P>
<P>
But Tazama dismissed the reports as unfounded. enditem

Lagos, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Nigerian newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian
</P>
<P>
-- The Nigerian government Wednesday night described its dual
foreign exchange rate policy as a major plank in the war against
inflation, saying the official rate of 22 Naira to the dollar is
mainly for accounting purposes.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times
</P>
<P>
-- The high command of the West African peacekeeping force has
warned all those yet to voluntarily submit their arms in Liberia

Daily Champion
</P>
<P>

political parties registered only last October, announced Wednesday

critical stage.
</P>
<P>
The Punch

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Giving Military Aid to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli officials have
flatly denied that Israel is to train Zairian government
troops to combat the spreading rebel war in the central
African country, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, reports from Zaire said that Israel was
to help train new brigades of up to 26,000 fighters,
including child soldiers, to fight the steadily advancing
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Senior Zairian defense officials said troops from Togo, Chad,
Morocco and other countries were standing by to fly to
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli defense officials denied Israel was involved
in the actions there, saying the Israeli defense ministry
recently decided as a policy "to freeze all security links
with Zaire in light of the internal problems there."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they noted that a number of Israeli companies do
have permits to deal in security-related business in Zaire,
and it would take a number of days to detail their
activity.
</P>
<P>
Private Israeli companies have sold Zaire over 50 million
US dollars in military equipment in recent years, and one
company headed by a former Israeli army brigadier recruited
dozens of recently discharged soldiers from elite units to
help set up the presidential guard in Zaire in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Youth Criticize U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Youth Wing of
Malaysia's ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO) has
made a strong objection to the 1996 Human Rights Report issued by
the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
Its deputy chief Hishammuddin Tun Hussien said in a statement
released here today the continuing existence of the report is an
affront to all independent sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. government of "attempting to foist its own
so-called universal, social and political and moral values and
principles on other sovereign independent nations."
</P>
<P>
"The UMNO Youth rejects the right of the United States to sit
in the judgment over Malaysia and Malaysians and demand to know
what gives the U.S. State Department to judge the rest of the
nations of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the freedom of speech and press mentioned in the report
which is predominantly positive on Malaysia's human rights record,
he said the report fails to understand that in Malaysia and in
most Asian nations, press and media freedom are not considered to
be absolute.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia as a nation is liberalizing for example in terms of
media freedom but this liberalization will be at our own pace and
on our own terms," he stressed.

HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Two special envoys from Lesotho
yesterday called on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe at his
office to brief him on the present political situation in their
country.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Attorney-General Fine Maema and Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle's Special Advisor Tom Thabane briefed Mugabe on progress
made on constitutional amendments and the establishment of an
independent electoral commission to supervise elections due in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been riddled with civil strife, including industrial
unrests and political disturbances, which prompted some Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to intervene.
</P>
<P>
SADC has managed to calm the situation in Lesotho, said the two
envoys.
</P>
<P>
The two special envoys thanked SADC leaders on behalf of Prime
Minister Mokhehle for stabilishing the political climate in their
country. Technical assistance in drafting Lesotho's new constitution
was rendered by Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The envoys said the reports on recent coups in their country
were mere rumours, adding opposition parties were responsible for the
unsubstantiated reports.
</P>
<P>
On factionalism within the ruling Basutoland Congress Party, the
envoys said the issue was being resolved through the court, adding
that the power struggle was not as serious as reported. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Looks Foreign Investors to Fund Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBUR, February 6 (XInhua) -- The South African government is
turning to foreign investors to help accelerate housing delivery and
meet the goal of building a million houses within five years.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made here yesterday by Housing Minister Sankie
Mthembi-Mahanyela in an interview with a local newspaper, the
"Business Report".
</P>
<P>
She said the government did not have sufficient funds to meet the
country's housing needs and was considering joint ventures with
foreign investors and local private players to get the mass
delivery of low-cost houses off the ground.
</P>
<P>
Accoding to the minister, foreign investors would ideally provide
offshore funds, but would also work closely with local contractors.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of prefabricated houses to help meet this goal was
also imminent, she said.
</P>
<P>
But this is in stark contrast to the government's election promise
to provide the black homeless with brick and mortar homes, and is
unlikely to be well accepted by those communities, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The government was concerned at the private sector's lack of
interest so far in the production of low-cost housing, the minister
added.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Reduce Zimbabwe's Spending Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Local economist Eric Bloch said
on Wednesday the AIDS pandemic is likely to reduce Zimbabsweans'
buying power by 150 million US Dollars in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Bloch said the incurable disease, which health experts estimate
kills 500 Zimbabweans weekly, had impacted negatively on the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Over one million of the 11.5 million Zimbabweans are estimated to
be infected with the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Bloch said, ''the loss of spending power on the economy through
all the people who will no longer be earning either through falling
ill or death will cost about two percent of the Gross Domestic
Product which currently stands at about 6.2 billion US Dollars.''
</P>
<P>
He urged the private sector to increase financial contributions
towards AIDS research in order to reduce the high loss of the
country's manpower, productivity and cost of retraining new skilled
personnel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the government and the private sector were
incurring rapid increases in costs of provinding health services and
social welfare as more people died, leaving behind dependents and
orphans.
</P>
<P>
He said the high death rates severely impacted on pension funds

<HEADLINE> Bangkok's Chinese New Year Sales Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- In the run-up to the Chinese
new year, merchants in Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown, are
complaining of slower sales than last year.
</P>
<P>
They attribute slow business to the ailing economy of the
country. The economic growth rate of Thailand was 6.7 percent last
year, the lowest in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Food venders are worried about large amounts of food stocks
being left over after the festival, which falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most food venders are keeping fewer goods in stock than they
did in previous years in response to weaker consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Although gold prices are down by about 7 percent compared with
last year, gold shops have attracted few customers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shops run by Chinese-Thais closed today and will
remain shut until Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Travel overseas is normally high during the Chinese new year
season, but this year, tour operators do not get as many clients
as they had expected.
</P>
<P>
Suparek Soorangura, managing director of N.S. Travel and Tour
Co., said the economic slowdown is the major cause. People are not
sure what will happen next so they prefer tightening their belts
rather than spending money on tours, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese new year is not a public holiday in
Thailand, the festival is widely celebrated in large cities where
there are large Chinese communities.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that among the country's 60-million population,
about 6 million are of Chinese ancestry.

<P>
HANOI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hanoi Commercial Service (HCS)
has prepared a large quantity of consumer goods worth more than
30 million U.S. dollars for the lunar new year festival 'Tet,'
almost twice the figure of the previous 'Tet'.
</P>
<P>
According to HCS, more than 350 tonnes of pork, 80 tonnes of chicken,
250 tonnes of cooking oil, 1,500 tonnes of confectionery, 3.5 million
bottles of soft drinks, 200 tonnes of fruits and flowers have been provide

This year, the prices of foodgrain, foodstuffs, confectionery,
alcoholic and soft drinks and other kinds of consumer goods have remained
stable in the Hanoi market due to a balance of demand and supply and state
control of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of consumer goods prepared by the state-owned trading
system has made up only 30-40 percent of the commodity available in the
Hanoi market, the other economic sector provided the rest.
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi authorities have organized more than 20 flower markets where
peach blossom branches and kumquats are abundant and prominent. however,
their prices have indicated a slight increase over the previous 'Tet'.
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi Spring Fair '97 which was opened two weeks ago has
attracted tens of thousands of Hanoi residents. In addition,
three more supermarkets in Hanoi have opened to the public on this
occasion of 'Tet'.
</P>
<P>
The Vetnamese party and state leaders also visited ordinary people
on the occasion of 'Tet'. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet Wednesday visited

JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy is continuing
search for a lost aircraft and its four crew members that
disappeared Tuesday night during joint maneuvers with an Israeli
submarine, the state-run Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Viking sub-hunting was believed to have crashed at
sea some 87 miles west of Haifa, an Israeli Mediterranean port,
during a routine training exercise when it dropped off the radar.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebel Talks Rescheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to move their
scheduled low-level talks on the Buldon issue to another date, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for
political affairs, as saying that the meeting was moved from
scheduled February 9 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said the reason behind the change in schedule is the
celebration marking the end of the Holy Ramadan might fall on
February 9.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both the government and the MILF's committees on the
cessation of hostilities headed by General Joselin Nazareno and
lawyer Lanang Ali respectively, agreed on a seven-point agenda to
settle the conflict in Buldon city, Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
The incident has claimed the lives of at least four government
soldiers and 32 MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, out of the seven-point agreement, both committees have
only agreed on six points and are yet to "discuss further" the
problem on the "as is, where is" positioning of forces in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said both committees are also to discuss on their next
meeting, the proposed creation of a "third party" that will
monitor truce violations of the Buldon agreement.

<HEADLINE> Quake Toll Rises to 78 in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll reached 78 and
220 others were injured in two strong earthquakes measuring 6.1
and 5.4 on the Richter scale in northeastern Iran Tuesday, Iran's
official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rasoul Zargar, head of the headquarters for Natural
Disasters, was quoted as saying that 24 villages were damaged, 20
of which were leveled to ground.
</P>
<P>
The official added that at least 3,500 families have lost
their homes. But they have been provided with all necessities by
the Red Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the earthquake would be the most
serious one to hit Iran since 1990 when an earthquake measuring
7.3 on the Richter scale left 40,000 dead and half a million
homeless in the northern provinces of Gilan and Zanjan.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that the society provides living facilities for
the quake-stricken victims up to three months. Reconstruction of
houses will start within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Two quakes measuring 6.1 and 5.4 degrees on the Richter scale
jolted several cities in Khorasan province including Bojnourd,
Shirvan, Esfarayen, Sabzevar, Quchan, Neishabour and Mashhad
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The seismographical base of the Mashhad Geophysics Institute
registered the epicenter at 250 kilometers northwest of Mashhad, in
Bojnourd, about 500 kilometers northeast of Iran's capital of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the seismographical center of northeastern Iran
said Wednesday that more than 160 aftershocks have hit the
region following the first quake Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The center said that there is still the possibility that more
aftershocks will struck the area in the days to come.

<HEADLINE> Testing of Aids Drug Banned in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Medicines
Control Council has banned the testing of anti-Aids drug Virodene
P058, the local daily The Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Peter Folb, the Chairman of the council, announced
investigations found that Virodene P058 contained a highly toxic
industrial solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF), which can cause
fatal liver damage and cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Aids patients may be at special risk of developing some of these
complications because of their disturbed immunity," Folb was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
This meant further tests and research on humans had to be put on
hold until the serious and unresolved safety issues had been sorted
out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Three medical researchers in Pretoria University claimed at a
cabinet meeting two weeks ago that their latest development of
Virodene P058 had produced far better results for curing Aids.
</P>
<P>
Despite wide scepticism about the "wonder Aids drug", South African
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said on Tuesday the government would
provide funds for further research into the drug. enditem

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Rejects U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam today rejected a
U.S. report on its human rights conditions, saying it cannot
accept any interference into other countries' internal affairs
under the guise of human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The "1996 human rights record" was a brazen distortion of the
real situation in Vietnam, a commentary carried today in the
official newspaper Nhan Dan said.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued recently by the U.S. State Department,
portrayed Vietnam's human rights records as remaining low with
political and religious freedom restricted by the government.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that the United States has given
itself the right to judge and impose its viewpoints of human
rights on other countries for many years and expected to force
other countries to follow its "teachings".
</P>
<P>
But in fact, the United States is the greatest violator of
human rights, having launched some 70 wars against other countries
in its 200-year history including the Vietnam war, admitted as a
serious mistake by its former Defense Secretary Robert
S. McNamara, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is still the only country which has used
nuclear weapons during its wars. It has intentionally deprived
Cuba and some other countries of their development rights by
imposing economic embargo against them, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government views the implementation of human
rights as first and foremost the responsibility and right of each
country. It should not be judged by any other outside authority,
the commentary reiterated.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Foreign Intervention in Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry rejected
German intervention in the arrest of a chief editor of Iranian
liberal magazine, who seeks political asylum in Sweden or
Germany, according to an official report here today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, the spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, said
Wednesday night that the arrest of Faraj Sarkouhi, editor of
the Persian weekly Adineh, was unrelated to relations between
Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iranian security authorities said that the Iranian editor was
arrested along with his brother and two other smugglers while
attempting to make an illegal exit in Bushehr, a port city
in southern Iran Monday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the statement of the German Foreign Ministry
on the case, Mohammadi said "the arrest of the Iranian editor
was simply a national issue that did not warrant the
interference of any foreign government."
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic government could not possibly ignore its own
laws and principles when dealing with a person who has
committed heavy crimes,+ he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
After Sarkuhi's disappearance last week, international efforts
spearheaded by Sweden and Germany have been made to find out
what has happened to the Iranian journalist who has "disappeared"
twice in three months.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Swedish Foreign Minister Pierre Schori in
Stockholm called on the government in Tehran to clarify the
case.

ISTANBUL, February 5 (Xinhua) - Turkey's Efes Pilsen routed
Bayer Leverkusen of Germany 91-68 on Wednesday to strengthen their

</P>
<P>
Unable to penetrate the Efes defense, the German side resorted
to long-range shots which initially proved effective and gave them
an early lead.

But Efes soon fought back with similar three-pointers from
Petar Naumovski, who led the team with 16 points, and by the
interval the home team had moved into a 42-36 lead.

Efes quickly went further ahead in the second half and in the

<HEADLINE> Beijing Gathering Marking Lunar New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese Party and state
leaders this morning joined more than 4,000 representatives from
all works of life in a gathering in the Great Hall of the People
to celebrate the lunar Year of Ox beginning tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Attending the gathering were President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li
Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress Qiao Shi, Chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Ruihuan,
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, Vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council,
the gathering was presided over by President Jiang Zemin, who is
also the general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, and
Chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council,
Jiang extended festive greetings to all those present and extended
cordial regards to workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres
nationwide, officers and men of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army as well as compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and
overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also thanked those foreigners who had helped and
supported the China's ongoing socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech to the gathering, Li Peng, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and premier of the State Council, described 1996 as a
"good starting year" in implementing the country's 9th Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000), featured by new achievements in reform and
opening and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Li Peng said, the CPC will hold its 15th National
Congress and China will resume the exercise of its sovereignty
over Hong Kong. The Chinese people are full of joy and confidence
to greet the two important historical events with new
achievements, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, "we should make down-to-earth efforts to push
ahead the reform of the economic structure, effect a shift in the
mode of the economic growth, speed up the reform of state-owned
enterprises, and open to the outside world wider so as to achieve
a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national
economy," Li Peng stressed.
</P>
<P>
While grasping the economic development tightly on one hand, it
is also imperative to promote the build-up of socialist culture
and ethics, raising the national ideological and moral quality
with a view to consolidate the political stability and accelerate
the all-round social progress, the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that "We will continue to promote the exchanges and

the independent foreign policy of peace and further develop the
country's friendly and cooperative relations with all other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"There will still be difficulties and problems on our way of
advance," Li Peng said. However, he said, "the close unity of and
the reliance on the people of all the nationalities will be our
source of strength to get over the difficulties, to fulfil various
tasks and continuously advance the country's modernization cause,"
Li Peng concluded.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng called on the whole Chinese people to score new
victories by keeping to the development orientation of the general
situation, redoubling their concerted efforts and pioneering new
ways of advance, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line
of the Party, and under the leadership of the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.

<P>
KIEV, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Soviet of the Crimea
Republic in Ukraine adopted today in its plenary session a
decision demanding resignation of the presidium with a majority of
55-41 votes.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax reports, the decision actually dismissed
the vice-chairmen and those on the standing committee, who were
accused of "failing to exercise their duties."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Supreme Soviet agreed to vote secretly on
sacking ahead of time Vasily Kiselev as chairman of the parliament
for his improper performance of duties.
</P>
<P>
It noted that most participants of the meeting expressed no
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Krichnikov, one of the four vice-chairmen of the
Supreme Soviet, said that the parliamentary crisis was triggered
by the parliament's expression of distrust in Prime Minister
Arkady Demidenko not long ago, and internal differences of the
parliament over the matter.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- India is likely to acquire
armament and state-of-the art technology from Italy and Israel in
the near future, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime Indian newspaper, the groundwork for
arms trade is likely to be done by Defense Secretary T.K. Banerji,
who left for a ten-day visit to the two countries Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Indian Air Force and the Defense
Ministry were part of his entourage.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would take part in the first meeting of the
Joint Committee of Indo-Italian Defense Cooperation. The Indians
are also expected to look for a particular type of ammunition
required by the Indian defense forces.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis are interested in supplying remote piloted vehicle
(RPV) to India, which can be used for real time battle field
reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis have also offered India a multi-mode maritime
surveillance radar which reportedly could counter Pakistan's
latest acquisition of PC-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft
form the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation would look into these offers there, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Navy is keen to acquire fast patrol boats from
Israel considered as leaders in building such craft.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Currency Devalued Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi taka has been
devalued once again by 30 paisa against the U.S. dollar with
effect from Saturday, said the governor of Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation, the fifth since the new government came to
office last June and first in the new year, is designed to make
Bangladesh's export more competitive in the international market.
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment will help increase the country's export at
least by 20 percent," said central bank governor Lutfar Rahman
Sarker.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that the measure would not cast any adverse
impact on the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the central bank's buying and selling rates for
the U.S. dollar have been refixed at 42.65 taka and 42.85 taka
respectively as against 42.35 taka and 42.55 taka earlier.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi exporters, especially garment manufacturers and
exporters, have long been demanding a larger devaluation of taka
on the plea that their products were losing competitiveness in the
international market due to massive devaluation by neighboring
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The taka was last adjusted on September 23, 1996.

<P>
DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Investment in the Chittagong
Export Processing Zone (CEPZ), the largest industrial park of
Bangladesh, has shown an upward trend during the second half of
last year, according to CEPZ sources.
</P>
<P>
During the period of July to December last year, 10.545 million
U.S. dollars were invested in the CEPZ, against only 5.591 million
dollars during the corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that about 25 million U.S. dollars were
expected to be invested in the zone during the current fiscal
ending June, while 16.128 million dollars were invested in the
last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to available statistics, the highest ever investment
in the CEPZ had been made in 1993-94 fiscal with 29.181 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already spent 1.16 billion taka
(about 29 million U.S. dollars) for the development of the
Chittagong Export Processing Zone since its inception in 1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Interbank rates in Thailand
rose to as high as 18.5 percent Wednesday as the Thai currency
baht continued to weaken against the appreciating U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank fixed the exchange mid-rate at 25.89 baht to
the dollar, up three satang from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning, trading pressure for the dollar was heavy,
pushing the rate to as high as 25.95 baht before falling slightly
in the afternoon session to 25.93 baht.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an estimated 2 billion U.S. dollars' worth
of orders came in from Singapore for dollar purchases.
</P>
<P>
One trader said many Singapore traders were moving to square
their positions ahead of the Chinese new year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices tumbled 2.7 percent, or 20.83 points,
Wednesday to close at 744.59, a 54-month low.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the baht's weakness against a climbing
dollar, lack of foreign investor confidence and bad debt problems
hung over the Thai share market.

NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D.

</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepal May Postpone Local Elections by Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government have
decided to postpone local elections by two months as a
decentralization bill is still awaiting parliamentary approval, a
newspaper here said today.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet meeting made the decision Tuesday after acquiring
consent from the main opposition party, the Kathmadnu Post said by
quoting unconfirmed reports.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission is expected to announce the exact dates
for the local elections this week but commission sources said they
have not yet been informed of the government's decision of
postponement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a senior official of the commission said the local
elections, which will choose officials for local administration
bodies in all villages, municipalities and districts in the
country, would conclude before the five-year tenure of current
local bodies expires by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
However, under the country's Constitution the government has
legal authority to defer the local elections for one year.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the government, led by the Nepali Congress
(NC) party, wants to hold the local polls after introducing the
decentralization law, which will give more autonomy and power to
local bodies.
</P>
<P>
The bill on the Decentralization Act is expected to be approved
by the forthcoming winter session of Parliament, which is to be
convened later this month.
</P>
<P>
The NC party, which currently controls most of the local bodies
in the country after the last elections in 1992, fears that it
would lose its advantage to the opposition if the local elections
begin at an earlier date, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Results of the by-elections for five lower house vacant seats
held last month showed that more voters supported the main
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
The NC party, which has led the three-party coalition
government since 1995, only won two of the five vacant house seats
in the by-elections while the CPN-UML bagged three.

MONTEVIDEO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. human rights report
is "an absolutely partial and erroneous vision of the real

Araneo made the remarks when he summoned the U.S. ambassador in

During an interview with "El Espectador" radio, Uruguay's
acting Foreign Minister Carlos Perez del Castillo said that the
report contains "a series of criticism and elements that do not

SINGAPORE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong called today for national efforts to "close the cracks"
opened up in Singapore in the general elections, which was held on
January 2, with the arrival of the Chinese New Year of Ox.
</P>
<P>
"Elections always stress a society. Arguments are hurled back
and forth, emotions are heated up and fanned and people are forced
to take sides, and divide into opposing camps. Cracks appear.
Sometimes these are difficult to close after the election," Goh
said in his Chinese New Year Message.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the election is over, let us close the cracks opened
up in the heat of election. Let us work together to make Singapore
Our Best Home ... We cannot afford to be divided between
English-educated and Chinese-educated Singaporeans, between one
religion and another," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that his government, or the
government of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), accepts what
he called "honest differences of views".
</P>
<P>
But, "these differences must not so divide us that we become a
fractured society, unable to compete as a team against other
countries, or to unite as one people against external threats," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Meet Maastricht Treaty on Time: Prodi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy was solemnly committed to
meet the Maastricht Treaty's criteria for entry into the single
currency of the European Union "within the allotted time," Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Prodi made the statement as a response to a story carried today
by the British daily, Financial Times, which referred to a
"face-saving compromise designed by senior EU central bankers and
monetary officials" to allow Italy to delay entry into the
European single currency Euro till the year 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
The plan, the story goes, was meant to quell German fears that
the lira's inclusion would devalue the Euro and unstabilize the
financial markets, and to offer Italy a way out of a potential
"popular domestic backlash" if its lira were not included.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister deplored the article as "constant
trickle of false reports and unsupported statements, even on the
part of prestigious news sources" and warned against "continual,
senseless spread of rumors" on developments toward the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who vowed more than once that he would resign if Italy
failed to make the grade for the Euro, reaffirmed his country's
"firm intention" and "solemn commitment" to meet on time the
Maastricht target, which demands a 3.0 percent or less inflation
rate in a EU member country to join the single currency by the end
of the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the country's Treasury officials suggested
rumors about Italy's exclusion were being fostered by some
financial circles hating the lira's inclusion.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Italy's public accounts continued to improve,
inflation was sharply down and its economy was producing the
largest balance of payments surplus in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The officials cited these positive developments as reasons why
"a certain unease is growing in some financial circles as the
prospective of Italian entry in the single currency becomes more
concrete."

BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai authorities have
adopted drastic measures to prevent Malaysia from pushing illegal
foreign workers back into Thailand, according to local press
today.
</P>
<P>
More officers will be deployed along the border to deter the
mostly South Asian workers who entered Malaysia illegally from
crossing over into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Using Thailand as jump-off point, the illegal workers, the
majority of them Bangladeshi nationals, slipped into Malaysia with
the help of local job brokers.
</P>
<P>
Kachadpai Burutpat, secretary-general of the National Security
Council, expressed concern Wednesday over the border situation in
the south, saying the struggle to push back workers could create
unnecessary tension between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
To prevent possible friction, all the affected sides should
make concerted move to find a common solution to the problem, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia earlier allowed some one million alien workers to
register, but the grace period ended last month.
</P>
<P>
The country has since intensified its crackdown on illegal
foreign workers, prompting many of them to flee to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Building An Automobile City in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the leading
industrial center in southwest China, is striving to become an
automotive industry city and to get a third of the domestic market
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is in Sichuan Province and is the fifth largest auto
maker in China. It produced 120,000 motor vehicles and 1.8 million
motorcycles last year. The city is home to 14 auto manufacturers,
which produce a number of types of vehicle. Of these, the Jialing
and Jianshe brands control a quarter of the motorcycle market in
China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, an official with the city's office
of automotive industry predicts, it will be able to produce
470,000 vehicles a year, 95 percent of which will be light trucks
and mini cars. Its motorcycle output will rise 60 percent to four
million.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry contributed two thirds of the city's
industrial profit last year, and it provides jobs for 300,000
people, supporting 600,000 people.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to this hilly city, Vice-premier Wu Bangguo
praised it as a manufacturer that gives thought to both light and
heavy-duty trucks.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition in the motorcycle market did, however,
threaten Chongqing's position, causing a 19-percent reduction in
motorcycle output last year.
</P>
<P>
In a move to reverse this trend, the city has decided to raise
14 billion yuan in the next four years for developing high-tech
auto parts and new brands and expanding the scale of
production.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Fisheries Facing Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- After dominating the world
aquaculture production for over two decades, Asia's fisheries
industry would suffer setbacks unless major problems affecting the
sector are solved soon, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, Asia has maintained its position as
the world's leading fish producer and dominated the global
fisheries output. Between 1972 and 1982, Asia's aquaculture
skyrocketed with its harvest increasing one million tons annually.
The region's output accounted for almost half the world's
aquaculture production.
</P>
<P>
From 1984 to 1994, Asia did even better, according to a recent
report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It said
that Asia continued its dominance of the world production of fish,
shell fish and aquatic plants in 1994, with its output accounting
for 89.9 percent of the global total.
</P>
<P>
As the world's key player in the sector, China's production in
the year occupied 60.4 percent of the global output. It was
followed by India, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. All of
the five major fish producers are Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast and South Asia, nets and fishing lines have
brought in large catches -- from 9.1 million tons in 1984 to over
17.6 million tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The increasing output has provided enough for dinner table for
the region. Asia's consumption amounts to 14.2 million tons now.
Consumption rates, per capita, range between 30 and 37 kilograms
in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. It is a little over 25
kilograms in Thailand. A Bruneian consumes 22 kilograms, and
Indonesia, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka report about 16 kilograms per
capita -- still above the world average.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute policy support to the production surge in
the region. The governments of Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines adopted aquaculture as a strategy to increase the food
supply, create job opportunities and boost exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the encouraging situation may soon deteriorate due to
over-fishing, water pollution and fast population growth in the
region, analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
At present, the greatest challenge to the aquaculture
production in the region is over-fishing. The Asia-Pacific Fishing
Commission (APFC) said in its latest report that annual catches
from most of the known fish stocks in Asia are close to their
maximum sustainable yield.
</P>
<P>
Tuna and skipjack in the South China Sea are declining, and
coastal demersal species are over-exploited in the Malacca Strait,
Gulf of Thailand and Bay of Bengal, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of fish population at risk is higher than ever,"
the Washington-based World-Watch Institute also warned.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested tough pullbacks in fishing to allow stocks to
repopulate and reefs to recover.
</P>
<P>
Long-lived species will need to be monitored for at least a
decade, they said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the population increase in Asia may not allow the
needed breathing spell. The United Nations Population Fund
predicted that with an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, Asia's
population will expand by 600 million in just 14 years.
</P>
<P>
If fish consumption in the region is not to shrink drastically
in the next 14 years, another six million tons will have to be
hauled in annually starting today to meet the requirement of the
population growth.
</P>
<P>
But that need is unlikely to be met because marine fishery
resources of Southeast Asia and South Asia are fully exploited or
in some cases depleted, the APFC said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, marine pollution is threatening the
aquaculture production. It is reported that "fishkills" due to
pollution, cyanide in Manila and cadmium in Bangkok and other
places symbolize the spreading environmental miasma.
</P>
<P>
It is doubtful whether the recent high-growth rates obtained
for shrimp aquaculture production can be maintained in the long
term in view of increasing environment constraints, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the years ahead, small-scale fisheries development policies
must be strongly oriented to resource management and environment
protection, they said.

BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Education Ministry

<HEADLINE> Alatas: ASEAN, EU to Create New Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and members of the European Union (EU) will
create a new economic cooperation scheme based upon partnership,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here last night.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the plan would be discussed further by the
ministers of the two sides at their meeting in Singapore in the
middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, was expecting such a
cooperation scheme because of the progresses it has already made.
</P>
<P>
To promote the success of the Singapore meeting scheduled for
February 12, the EU has set up a special commission to work out
the framework of the new cooperation scheme and follow up the
results of the talks between the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the ASEAN-EU meeting, Indonesia would also attend
the Asia-Europe foreign ministerial meeting to be held at the same
venue of the ASEAN-EU meeting on February 15.
</P>
<P>
At the first ministerial meeting since the Asia-Europe summit
was held in Bangkok in 1995, the foreign ministers of the two
sides would discuss the follow-up of the implementation of the
Bangkok summit.
</P>
<P>
One of the topics would be the setting up of the Asia-Europe
Foundation in which a special council would handle such matters as
exchange of academicians, extension of scholarships and cultural
exchanges, Alatas said.

<HEADLINE> One Million Illegal Immigrants in Russia </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- There are almost one million
illegal immigrants in Russia, Tatyana Regent, head of Russia's
Federal Migration Service (FMS), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Only about 10,000 of them had applied to FMS for legal
residential status, and very few of the applicants would be
qualified because of the rather strict examination and
verification process, Regent said.
</P>
<P>
FMS predicts that there will be 2.8 million immigrants in
Russia by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 immigrants living in Russia are regarded as
transit refugees awaiting the opportunity to go to more developed
western countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 750 immigrants had asked for political asylum in
Russia, but no more than 15 would be granted asylum, Regent said.

KIEV, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Ukrainian students are
rated as the best Chinese speakers in the country after an intense
five-hour competition here today.
</P>
<P>
The top three of the 15 winners are Natalia Nanoilenko from the
Kiev Linguistic University, Vladislav Scodovliko from the
Dnepropetrovsk State University and Elena Dobrovolskaya from the
Kramotorsk Economic and Social Sciences Institute. They will be
sent to China for further study sponsored by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 Ukrainian students and their teachers turned up
at the first Chinese-language speech competition, which is funded
by the Chinese embassy in Ukraine. It will be held once a year
from now on.
</P>
<P>
In today's competition, the competitors showed not only
marvelous speech art, but also great knowledge of the Chinese
language, culture and history.
</P>
<P>
However, some Ukrainian students told Xinhua that it was
difficult for students of Chinese to find a job to show their
language ability as there were few Chinese businesses in
Ukraine. Many hoped to work as Chinese-Russian interpreters.
</P>
<P>
"I know it's difficult to find a China-related job in Kiev, but
I still love to learn Chinese. The mysterious Chinese culture
attracts me," said Oksana Mazur, a senior student from the Kiev
Linguistic University.

<HEADLINE> Medicinal Herb In Shape Of Human Body Found In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in southwest China
recently found two tubers of multiflower knotweed, shaped like the
human body when digging.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zhanguo, who lives in Jiao'er Village in the Aba Autonomous
Prefecture of Sichuan province, found the tubers in late December
on a mountainside some 3,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The tubers weighed a total of 1.1 kg when they were just dug up
and about 700 grams after they dried out, and were thought to be
more than 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
They resembled a man and a woman. The "male" tuber looks like a
Buddha and has something that resembles a penis. The "female"
tuber, which is thinner, has something resembling breasts.
</P>
<P>
Local scientists say that the plant, the polygonum multiflorum,
is a rare medicinal herb.
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is that makes the tubers resemble the human body
has aroused the interest of Chinese scientists.

KIEV, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin will visit Kiev in late February or early March, the
Director of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Evgeny Kushnarev,
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Kushnarev said Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
Chernomyrdin settled the visit over a telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin will discuss problems in the division of the Black
Sea Fleet during his visit, Kuchma said. There was also the
possibility of the signing of a friendly treaty with Ukraine
during his trip.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had hoped to sign the treaty with Russia last year, but
the signing was delayed because of rows over the division of the
Black Sea Fleet and the status of Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
Disputes over the fleet and Sevastopol have soured relations
between the two countries. Both have claimed the city of
Sevastopol, the main base of the Black Sea Fleet, since the
collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991.

<HEADLINE> US Praises Swiss Banks for Holocaust Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
hailed a decision by Switzerland's major banks to create a
Holocaust memorial fund.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Swiss banks is an "important demonstration
of good will," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
"We note that the banks indicated the new account will be open
for further contributions from other parties, including the Swiss
government and the Swiss National Bank. We hope that that proposal
is implemented expeditiously," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Suisse
Group and Swiss Bank Corp., three largest Swiss banks, announced
they would contribute some 71 million U.S. dollars to set up a
fund for Nazi Holocaust victims during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government and banks have been under strong pressures
as Nazi Holocaust survivors accused Switzerland of still holding
their assets of some 7 billion U.S. dollars, which were looted by
Nazis during the war.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Government Drafts Law on Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government today
drafted and submitted to parliament a law proclaiming as final the
preliminary municipal election results.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed that the country's interest in promoting
relations with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and the international community exceeded the
importance of any election dispute in Serbian towns, said a
statement released by the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic ordered Tuesday the
reinstatement of disputed opposition victories in local elections
as recommended by the OSCE which has sent a delegation to Belgrade
for dispute investigation and confirmed the election victory of
the opposition coalition in 14 big cities.
</P>
<P>
The government annulled the election results in November,
sparking off widespread demonstrations over the past two and half
months by the opposition Zajedno coalition, thus causing a
political crisis over the election disputes.
</P>
<P>
The law, drafted by the government, proclaims the preliminary
results of local elections on November 17, 1996 as the final
results.
</P>
<P>
The individual election of deputies, based on the results of
article one of this law, is established by municipal election
commissions, or city election commissions, within three days of
the law taking effect.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that constituent sessions will be
called by the president of the National Assembly within five days
of the proclamation of the established election results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic, acting on
the proposal of the Serbian government, has decided to convene a
special parliament session for next Tuesday, February 11.
</P>
<P>
The main point on the agenda will be the draft law on declaring
final the preliminary results of elections for town and
municipality assembly deputies in keeping with the OSCE report,
the Tanjug news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Police Detains 19 in Belgrade for Violent Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian Interior Ministry
said today that it had detained 19 people over two days of
violence in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The 19 have been detained for disrupting law and order and
jeopardizing the security of person and property in Belgrade," the
ministry said in a statement. Of them, 17 have been charged with
misdemeanors and two with criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement quoted by the Tanjug news agency, a
violent group had stayed on in Belgrade's central Republic square
Tuesday after a protest rally organized by the Serbian opposition
Zajedno (Together) coalition.
</P>
<P>
"The group behaved aggressively and their vandalism disrupted
traffic and disturbed law and order in the capital," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
An off-duty police officer who was on the spot stepped into the
breach and, identifying himself as an officer of the law, fired a
few warning shots in an effort to protect a driver, who was beaten
by the group, it said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, some young people damaged several public
transport, private and police vehicles, throwing rocks at them,
and breaking windows and windscreens, it added.
</P>
<P>
The previous day, February 3, large groups of young people had
also stayed behind after a Zajedno rally in downtown Belgrade,
wielding clubs and throwing rocks, disturbing law and order and
jeopardizing the safety of people and property, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
But local press reports said Serbian police halted more than
50,000 opposition protesters in central Belgrade Monday after an
overnight confrontation in which more than 80 demonstrators were
injured when police used water canon and clubs to expel the
demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> US Says No Specific Food Aid Promise to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Department said
today that the United States never promised a specific amount of
food aid in trading for agreement from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) for a U.S.-South Korean-proposed briefing
over the Korean Peninsula peace.
</P>
<P>
"The United States never promised a specific amount of food aid
to the North Koreans as an inducement to come to the table and
have a briefing on the four-party talks," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular briefing. "We did not
promise to deliver food or to guarantee commercial shipments of
food."
</P>
<P>
Burns said what the United States had done was to issue license
to some private companies for their export of grain to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We recently approved an application by a private American
grain company for a license to export grain to North Korea. We
approved that already. Now, that deal needs to be concluded
between that grain company and North Korea," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Burns was referring to Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., a grain
trader, which is negotiating with the DPRK for a deal of export of
500,000 tons of grain. The United States said it was "commercial
transactions" between the DPRK and Cargill Inc., and refused to
become involved in them.
</P>
<P>
But Burns stressed that the United States had been "assiduous
in listening to the World Food Program and the other non-profit
organizations."
</P>
<P>
"We understand the World Food Program is considering another
appeal and that we would look very seriously at that appeal," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Heroin Use on Rise in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno today appealed for actions to fight against drug abuse and
warned that drug addiction was expected to increase in the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Recent trends in heroin's availability, purity and price
clearly indicate that this is one of the most critical problems we
face in fighting narcotics in this country today," Reno said.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not counteract the heroin threat now, we risk
repeating the terrible consequences of the 1980s' cocaine and
crack epidemic," Reno told some 250 law enforcement officials who
gathered in Reston, a Washington suburb town, to discuss a
national strategy to fight heroin.
</P>
<P>
She said that heroin addiction has increased 20 percent in the
U.S. and worldwide production of the drug has grown sharply. "It
is time to develop enforcement and prevention strategies together
before we have this demon totally out of control."
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said, "Today an estimated 6 percent of
Americans have used illicit drugs within the last month, less than
half of the 14 percent in 1979, but heroin has not followed that
trend."

<HEADLINE> Britain to Establish New Military College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
has approved the plan to establish an entirely new military
college in Wiltshire, northwestern England, according to local
press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided to scrap original plans to develop the
Army's staff college into a tri-service establishment and instead
set up a new college, which is expected to cost some 500 million
pounds (about 800 million U.S. dollars), the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The military authorities have entered final negotiations with a
private business consortium to build and run the new college for
30 years and the construction of the new college is expected to be
completed by 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a written answer to the House of Commons, Nicholam Soames,
the Armed Forces minister, announced Tuesday the construction of
the new college on the grounds of Royal Military College of
Science at Shrivenham.
</P>
<P>
"The college will be a center of military excellence, building
on the legacy of its prestigious predecessors to maintain our
global reputation for command and staff," Soames said.
</P>
<P>
The new college, with lecture halls, work areas, and living
accommodation, is designed to receive some 650 students at any one
time.

UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is not yet ready to name a deputy secretary-general and
would have to obtain General Assembly approval to create that
post, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said today.
</P>
<P>
"In the first place, the post of deputy does not yet exist in
the U.N. budget, and so his intention to name a deputy would have
to be preceded by a request to the General Assembly to approve the
post," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks when asked about a report from
Oslo that Annan had asked former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland to become deputy secretary-general. He
acknowledged that Annan would prefer to name a woman as deputy
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
He said that the envisioned deputy secretary-general would
"assist him in his activities as secretary-general across the
board... someone that, when he has to travel, he can feel
comfortable leaving behind the daily work of the organization to
that person," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: World's Environmental Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The world's environmental
ministers started their three-day deliberations today as their
rows over role definition, structural reform and cost reduction
of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) continued.
</P>
<P>
Japan demanded that the sole U.N. environmental body be
focused on specified, concrete areas and conduct its activities
"within a limited budget", said Takao Ohnishi, vice-minister of
the Japanese Environment Agency.
</P>
<P>
"UNEP has been involved in such an extensive range of affairs
that its activities are now losing their focus," he told the
two-week 19th Session of the UNEP Governing Council which started
on January 27.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP should "serve not as the agent for the implementation
of environmental activities, but as the brains of the U.N." in
terms of offering information and technical and policy advice,
said Ohnishi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ministers from India, Iran, Germany, Norway and
Turkey hoped that UNEP will find its way to a future role as the
world's top environmental body based on a cleared mandate and
adequate funding.
</P>
<P>
The world needs "a strong global environment organization to
meet the challenges of the third millennium and as a meeting
place for solving global environmental issues," said Norwegian
Environmental Minister Thorbjorn Berntsen.
</P>
<P>
"UNEP should also play a catalytic role in policy coordination
and assist in developing regional and national action programs,"
said Iranian Vice-President Hadi Manafi.
</P>
<P>
On reforming the money-starved UNEP, German Environmental
Minister Angela Merkel said her country is in favor of setting up
an "inter-sessional body" to rule UNEP during the adjournment of
the biennial session of its Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
"Participation in this body must be geographically balanced
and at the same time be limited," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In no way should this body replace the Governing Council or
the Committee of Permanent Representatives (CPR)," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey called for an enhanced role for the CPR,
saying it "would represent the simplest and the least expensive
solution to most of the existing difficulties" facing UNEP.
</P>
<P>
Indian Environmental and Forest Minister Jai Nishad also
suggested strengthening the power of CPR, an intersessional
subsidiary body of the UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
Almost all ministers making speeches today highlighted the
fund-raising issue of UNEP which is facing the most serious
crisis since its establishment in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was mainly caused by the sharp cut of contributions
of the developed countries, said Iranian Vice-President Manafi
who urged rich nations to honor their pledges made in the 1992
Earth Summit on transfer of environmentally-sound technologies,
information and experiences.
</P>
<P>
However, in the wave of donation cutting by the west, Germany
announced it will maintain its status as one of the largest
contributors to the international environment body.
</P>
<P>
This is aimed at helping "lay the financial and political
basis for UNEP's future success," said German Environment
Minister Merkel.
</P>
<P>
UNEP's biennial budget fell to 90 million U.S. Dollars in
1996-97, down from 160 million Dollars in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
And so far the world's top environmental agency has actually
received only 62.5 million Dollars of donations, hence a huge
budget gap.

<HEADLINE> Major European Shares End at New Record Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all made strong gains and ended at new closing highs today,
cheered by the firm dollar, strong opening on Wall Street and
hopes of steady interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index in London had surged to a new all-time
intraday high of 4,286.9 before closing at a new record high of
4,281.5, gaining 20.6 points, helped by a good start of the Dow,
buoyant futures and signs that UK interest rates are on hold for
now.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said that the market was aware that the Bank
of England may yet signal a rate hike. Also, the outcome of the
U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting was not known at the
close of play and a Federal Reserve tightening has not been ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
German shares also ended the session at a record high of
3,098.00, up 30.94 points, boosted by the firm dollar and strong
bonds, which made progress on the back of an unexpected slide in
manufacturing orders in December.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares followed London and Frankfurt's suit
and rallied to a new record peak of 2,541.25, 38.18 points higher
and breaching the previous record closing high of 2,516.56 set
last Friday, supported by the strength of the dollar and hopes
that U.S. interest rates would not rise.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 20.6
points at 4,281.5. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished 30.94
points higher at 3,098.00. The Paris CAC-40 index closed up 38.18
points at 2,541.25.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Leaves Short-Term Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) left short-term interest rates unchanged today, apparently
deciding that U.S. economic growth is moderating and inflation
does not pose a threat.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a brief statement at the end of a
two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the
U.S. Fed's policy-maker, and was widely expected in the financial
market.
</P>
<P>
A Fed spokesman said that the committee meeting had adjourned
and there would be no further announcement, a wording used when
the Fed decided to keep the intereat rates stable.
</P>
<P>
The Fed decision was based on the fact that the U.S. economy is
increasing moderately and inflation is under control.
</P>
<P>
The latest data showed that the U.S. economy is slowing down
its pace of expansion. The Commerce Department reported today a
1.3 percent drop in orders to U.S. factories, the second
consecutive monthly decline. Among other hints are a 1 percent
drop in sales of new homes in December and a dip in the National
Association of Purchasing Management index in January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the inflation could not pose any threat to the
economy in the near future. The consumer prices index (CPI)
excluding volatile food and energy prices rose only 2.6 percent
last year, down from 3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are expecting that the U.S. Fed would raise the
rate by a small margin in its next policy-making meeting in March.
They said that tight jobs markets -- with the unemployment rate
near a seven-year low -- sooner or later will lead to an increase
of price pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has kept the short-term interest rates unchanged since
January of 1996 when it lowered the federal fund rate to 5.25
percent from 5.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Wisconsin became the
21st state to sue the tobacco industry to recover the cost of
treating smoking-related health problems when it filed suit
against eight tobacco companies today.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges the companies conspired to mislead, deceive
and confuse the public about the health effects of tobacco use,
an Associated Press report said. But it does not specify how much
money the state wants to recover.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers "systematically suppressed and concealed
material information and waged an aggressive campaign of
disinformation about the health consequences caused by their
products," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General James Doyle said, "This lawsuit is necessary
to protect the children of Wisconsin from the deceptive and
manipulative advertising practices of the tobacco industry."
</P>
<P>
Defendants are Philip Morris Inc.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.;
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.; the Tobacco Institute; B.A.T.
Industries; Lorillard Tobacco Co.; Liggett &AMP; Myers Inc.; the
United States Tobacco Co.; Hill &AMP; Knowlton Inc.; the Council for
Tobacco Research USA Inc.; and the Smokeless Tobacco Council Inc.,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Solidere, the top Lebanese company for the
reconstruction of Beirut's downtown, has recorded profits of 58.5
million U.S. dollars in 1996, an 81 percent rise over 1995's
figures.
</P>
<P>
In a latest statement published in the Daily Star newspaper,
Solidere, the flagship of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
reconstruction plans, said that its total revenues stood at 74.2
million dollars, a 70 percent increase over those in 1995.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will sell a proportion of 18 joint ventures in
the fields of industry, agriculture, housing, banks and tourism
during the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at today's meeting of the Cabinet
committee in charge of the public business sector and the
expansion of ownership, said the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said the corporate shares
to be offered for sale are valued at 2 billion Egyptian pounds
(590 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the report did not specify how large the for-sale
proportion is to the companies -- six joint industrial companies,
an agricultural company, two housing companies and six banks and
three tourism services.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has listed 300 state-owned enterprises
amounting to 27 billion U.S. dollars on its selling agenda.
</P>
<P>
Private sectors now account for 49.8 percent of Egypt's total
investment annually, which amounted to 13.2 billion pounds (nearly
4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Altogether 4,512 investment projects have been set up
in Egypt over the past 15 years since it adopted the open-door
policy in 1981.
</P>
<P>
These projects have a combined capital of 40.4 billion Egyptian
pounds (11.9 billion U.S. dollars) and aggregate investments of 80
billion pounds (23.5 billion dollars), creating 440,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Fawzi, head of the Executive Board of the General
Investment Authority, said the economic reforms in the Egyptian
economy have been a "miracle."
</P>
<P>
The spread of investment projects have given rise to the 30
industrial zones as well as the steady increase in free zones.
</P>
<P>
The government endeavors to create more industrial and free
zones in order to give investors the opportunity to enjoy the tax
breaks and other perks made available to projects in these areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided that investment projects can take
place without getting permission from the government, with the
exception of the military and tobacco industries and the
development of Sinai.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt received about one billion U.S. dollars grants
in 1996 for its various development programs, Nawal el-Tatawi,
Minister of Economy, Foreign Trade and International Cooperation
has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Egyptian MENA news agency today that the
grants were provided by the United States, Japan, Canada, Britain,
Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and some other quarters.
</P>
<P>
She said that her ministry signed a number of grant agreements
with these countries and international institutions.
</P>
<P>
The United States, topping the list of the benefactors to
Egypt, offered 803.2 million dollars under 23 grant agreements,
she said. The U.S. grants were dedicated to a number of projects
in various fields.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Foreigners to Stay Out of Zairian Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi to stay out of fighting in
eastern Zaire between the Zairian government forces and Tutsi-led
rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The United States appeals again to the neighbors of Zaire to
stay out of Zaire, to not involve themselves in the fighting,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a regular
briefing. "We have underscored this message to Uganda and Rwanda
and Burundi."
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Tutsi-led rebels were helped by those
neighboring countries in their fighting with the government forces
and had captured strategic towns of mineral-producing Shaba
Province.
</P>
<P>
Burns said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had raised the
issue Tuesday with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Wednesday
with Foreign Minister Erick Dervicke of Belgium, a former colonial
power in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about this situation and Secretary Albright
has taken the opportunity over the last 24 hours to transmit this
message," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Leaders Affirm Secularism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coalition government
today affirmed the republic's secular system while striving to
thwart an opposition drive to bring down the weak government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the secular
state system by the founders of the republic, pro-Islamic Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan said that Turkey will not give up the
secular system.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Republican People's Party and Democratic Left Party
today tabled a censure motion in the parliament against the
coalition government for undermining the secular system, demanding
a confidence vote in next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said the adoption of the secular system has "enabled
the conciliation of religious freedom in the country with a
pluralist, political democracy."
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Erbakan and his Welfare Party (RP) was under
heavy fire from the opposition, press circles as well as the
public due to RP's efforts to legitimize Islamic-style head carves
in college campus and government offices.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, also
chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP) has denied the allegations
that her coalition partner RP was planning to go away from the
secular system.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has said that her party would continue to be in
coalition with RP, and she also tried to allay the fears of
several DYP ministers who publicly vowed not to undersign
anti-secularist decrees from the Islamist cabinet colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has been suffering criticism for her cooperation with
RP from both the public and her own party.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Auto Sales Rise in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Auto sales rose 8.4 percent in
Canada last month, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Sales of cars, trucks and minivans for the entire auto industry
hit 78,147 in January, up from 72,071 from the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Canada Inc. was the biggest winner, whose auto sales
jumped by 100 percent. It was followed by BMW Canada Inc., Suzuki
Canada Inc. and Volkswagen Canada Inc., with increases of 62, 45
and 42 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
These increases by European and Asian-based manufacturers
pushed their share of the Canadian market to about 24 percent from
19 percent in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, sales at Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. and
Chrysler Canada Ltd., two of the Big Three North American auto
makers, dropped 1 and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The auto giant General Motors of Canada Ltd. saw its sales rise
6 percent. Yet, its market share in Canada fell slightly to 35.2
from 35 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The reports noted that though Canada's auto sales increased,
last month's numbers still can't match the glory days of the
1980s, when January sales topped 90,000 in some years and exceeded
85,000 on a regular basis.
