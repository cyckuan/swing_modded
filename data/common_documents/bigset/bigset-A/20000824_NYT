HATE CRIMES PLAGUE L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Religion-motivated hate crimes rose more than 34
percent in Los Angeles County last year, driven largely by copycat
incidents after the North Valley Jewish Community Center shooting
rampage, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of hate crimes rose 11.7 percent across the
county last year, to 859, the second-highest figure in 20 years,
according to the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission
report.
</P>
<P>
   While religion-motivated hate crimes showed the largest
increase, African-Americans were the No. 1 victims of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There were 137 religion-motivated crimes, including 118 _ or 86
percent _ directed against Jews, the report says. In 1998, Jews
were the target of 86 out of 102 religious hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in anti-Semitic hate crimes is closely tied to the
Aug. 10, 1999, shooting spree at the North Valley Jewish Community
Center, officials said during a news conference. Buford O. Furrow,
a self-described white supremacist from Washington state, is
accused of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack in Granada Hills resulted in copycat incidents,''
said David Lehrer, western regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of anti-Semitic incidents, California and Los Angeles
County are bucking the national trend. Over the past five years
nationally, we've had a 25 percent decrease in anti-Semitic
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   While the overall crime rate has declined nationally and in Los
Angeles, the study found hate crimes continue to rise. The highest
number of hate crimes _ 995 _ was reported in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, hate crimes rose 22 percent, from
169 in 1998 to 206 last year, according Police Department
statistics released in January.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to stem hate crimes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $450,000 county program that focuses on the communities
hardest hit by hate crimes, and a new commission Web site that will
provide information about anti-hate resources and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ A District Attorney's Office program to rehabilitate juveniles
who commit hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislation that calls for better reporting of hate crimes by
schools and law enforcement agencies and the formation of a
statewide human relations commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ The county Human Relations Commission has sponsored
conferences, launched a public information campaign, funded
community groups and developed a human relations curriculum for
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the overall increase is due in part to
increased public awareness and reporting, coupled with greater
efforts by law enforcement to investigate hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission report found that violent hate crimes
disproportionately target African-Americans, who were victims in 50
percent of the cases. In these cases, equal numbers of perpetrators
were white and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``As African-Americans move out of the inner city into the
suburbs, I've seen a reluctance by people to accept people who look
different from them,'' county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report found hate crime prosecutions of juveniles went up 19
percent, marking an increase for the second consecutive year.
Prosecutions of juveniles comprise more than half of all hate crime
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing number of racial hate crimes were carried out by
racially based youth gangs, whose racism seems to blend with the
timely tradition of pitting established residents against newcomers
and also in defense of drug-selling territory,'' said Robin Toma of
the Human Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said prosecutors filed 174 hate
crime cases last year, up from 83 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are three youths who burned a cross in Shadow Hills,
a Latino man who assaulted of a gay Latino man, and a white
elementary school principal in Panorama City who was beaten by two
unknown assailants.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, hate crimes on school campuses
went up dramatically, rising 58.7 percent, from 46 to 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incident of hate crimes in our schools is very alarming,''
said county Supervisor Don Knabe.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a $150,000 federal grant, Garcetti started the
Juvenile Offenders Learning Tolerance program in the Antelope
Valley and expanded it to the Long Beach area. It provides hate
crime prevention education in public schools and a diversion
program for youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are low-level offenders, juveniles who we believe can be
turned around so they do not commit more heinous hate crimes and we
have seen some success there,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's study found the second-largest increase in hate
crimes were related to sexual orientation _ up 16.8 percent from
226 to 264. Racially motivated hate crimes were up 5 percent from
436 to 458.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also know that homophobic assaults are among the most
violent, with 41percent of hate crimes against gays and lesbians
(involving) murder, attempted murder, assault and attempted
assault,'' Toma said.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists said they believe hate crimes against gays
rose after voter passage of Proposition 22, which bars same-gender
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing a grisly and frightening trend,'' said Gwenn
Baldwin, executive director of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although not all hate crimes were violent, the number of cases
of murders and attempted murders rose from six to 16, assaults with
deadly weapons from 122 to 134 and arson from one to six.

BULLPEN COLLAPSES, SO POSADA AND MARTINEZ SAVE YANKS
</HEADLINE>
  By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three previous times on this homestand, the New York
Yankees watched their bullpen squander late leads and produce the
demoralizing losses that come with blown saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees witnessed a fourth failure Wednesday night. For a
change, they rallied back.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson laid the groundwork for a demise,
but Jorge Posada hit a tying two-run homer in the eighth inning and
Tino Martinez delivered a ninth-inning single that produced a 10-9
victory over the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia led off the ninth with a single off Tim Crabtree
and Jose Vizcaino grounded a single past the drawn-in third baseman
Mike Lamb when he swung away at a 1-1 pitch. Vizcaino had squared
to bunt on the first two pitches. Jose Canseco grounded into an
apparent double play, but Luis Alicea's throw pulled Frank
Catalanotto off first base.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander Mike Venafro entered to face Martinez, who
grounded an 0-1 pitch just inside the first-base line and into
right field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have struggled on this homestand, splitting the
previous six games, and manager Joe Torre has been frustrated
because he has sensed the team was ready to go on a long winning
streak several times. The Yanks gave their manager more cause for
worry Wednesday night as the baffling bullpen continued showing the
inability to close games.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in the past week, Yankees relievers blew a
sizeable lead and wasted a strong outing by a starter. Mariano
Rivera was responsible Friday, when he couldn't hold an 8-4 lead in
the ninth inning. Wednesday night, he worked out of a ninth-inning
jam for the victory after allowing a leadoff double.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, pitching on his fourth straight day, had a shouting
match with Torre on Sunday over not being allowed to work out of
his own jams. But he could blame no one but himself for Wednesday
night's performance. Stanton had already allowed Ricky Ledee's
three- run homer in the eighth inning. That wiped out a 7-4 lead
Roger Clemens helped to build.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson came in and Bill Haselman hit a squibber to the right of
the mound. Nelson ran over and reached down but couldn't grip the
ball. Haselman reached first on the error and Lamb tried to bunt
him over, but Posada nearly replicated Nelson's mistake by not
gripping the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A routine bunt then moved the runners to second and third before
Alicea grounded a single up the middle, ending Nelson's night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens overcame his own rough start to pitch six innings. He
allowed four runs, but none after the third inning when he appeared
to rediscover his fastball. He struck out the side in the fifth
inning and finished with nine strikeouts and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' outfield alignment, meanwhile, could have caused
rubber necking. By the late innings, it featured Polonia in left
field, Clay Bellinger in center and Scott Brosius in right field.
Brosius, who won a Gold Glove award at third base last season, had
made one appearance in right field since joining the Yankees in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had been dominant since losing to the Mets June 9 at
Shea Stadium, posting a 2.54 ERA in his 10 starts leading into
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored twice off Clemens in the first inning, on a
double by Gabe Kapler.

A LAWYER AND A WITNESS TO THE REVOLUTION RECALLS ABBIE HOFFMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAN HOFFMAN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The young lawyer had just been fired from his first
job for being a troublemaker _ in 1968, preaching union to fellow
Legal Aid lawyers was a no-no _ when the stranger telephoned.
</P>
<P>
   The caller was facing two criminal cases in Chicago, he said,
and one from the Columbia student strike. ``I have a doctor and a
dentist,'' Abbie Hoffman, the anti-war leader and political stunt
master, told Gerald B. Lefcourt, ``but what I really need is a
lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, this is how they took meetings: Lefcourt, who
didn't have an office, spent the night at Hoffman's St. Marks Place
pad, talking, drinking, eating. Smoking? ``Absolutely!'' When the
sun came up, Hoffman spelled out their pact: ``If you keep me out
of jail, I will make a revolution!''
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt gives a rueful, toothy smile. ``I believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years and some 25 criminal cases, Lefcourt kept
his famously irrepressible nonpaying client from serving
significant time.
</P>
<P>
   And if the revolution is still on hold, Hoffman _ a manic
depressive who died at 52 in 1989, probably a suicide _ did live to
see the blossoming of the causes that animated him: registration of
black voters, the end of the Vietnam War, protection of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The new film ``Steal This Movie'' tells how Hoffman was a
fugitive for six years after being caught selling cocaine to
undercover agents. Meanwhile, Lefcourt, who is portrayed by Kevin
Pollak and who is the film's associate producer, moved into a
comfortable office in the Upper East Side town house he owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbie was the mentor, and I ended up as caretaker,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With his summer-tennis/winter-ski perpetual tan and the floridly
handsome features of a Victor Mature, Lefcourt hardly looks the
part of the hand-to-mouth, Kunstleresque legal eagle he played in
the years when his clients included Mark Rudd, the student leader,
and members of the Black Panther Party. He was one of the Panther
21 lawyers at the signature 1970 radical chic fund-raiser at the
Leonard Bernsteins'.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he looks like someone who owns a house in
Bridgehampton, who posed for that Paul Stuart winter coat ad (``It
was for charity!'') and is a frequent TV talking head. He is
charming, funny, a good storyteller, smart and short:
characteristics that juries find endearing. Small wonder he has
represented headline clients like Harry Helmsley and Mel Miller,
the former New York State Assembly speaker. One could also call him
a drug lawyer _ he defends clients caught shipping many tons of
illegal substances (usually marijuana).
</P>
<P>
   Press him and he will tell you not only that he believes
marijuana should be decriminalized but also that somebody must defy
the government when it conducts illegal searches.
</P>
<P>
   ThiS happens to be standard-issue talk for most defense lawyers
with clients who pay cash _ and Lefcourt lost a celebrated fight
when the government compelled lawyers to name such clients. But
Lefcourt, who can drop celebrity names as adroitly as the next
high-profile lawyer, still walks the walk, after a fashion. In the
last two decades, as he acquired paying clients, he was also a
president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
and testified in Washington about many noble, and usually losing,
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I enjoy making money; so what?'' he smiles affably.
</P>
<P>
   Some tales of Hoffman, please.
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt (his father, an optometrist, changed the name from
Lefkowitz) rewinds to 1968. He is with Abbie on a plane to Chicago,
having notified authorities that his client is returning to face
charges (like obscenity: to deter photographers, Abbie once wrote a
four-letter expletive across his forehead).
</P>
<P>
   But agents swarm the plane, search Abbie, find a penknife. Two
more cases: state and federal weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Long day at the police station. They're about to fly home, when
two gentlemen in trench coats hand Abbie a subpoena from the House
Un-American Activities Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first day with my new client,'' says Lefcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Exhilarating memories: Here is Lefcourt, drunk and singing in a
Chicago jail cell with Bobby Seale, Jerry Rubin and the lawyer
Michael Tigar, courtesy of Judge Julius Hoffman. It's a Friday
night, and Bill Kunstler apologizes because he can't get a bail
hearing till Monday. ``Then he asks if he can borrow the keys to my
New York apartment,'' Lefcourt says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot: Lefcourt embracing Abbie in 1980, as his friend
surrenders, the moment for which Lefcourt worked exhaustively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when he made me angriest?'' says Lefcourt,
mournfully. ``In 1984, when he attempted suicide. I saw him at
Bellevue and I said, `Abbie, what are you doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt shakes his head. ``He said, `Aw c'mon, Gerry, you know
I'll try anything once!'''
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt is now 57, a divorced father, a dignitary of the bar,
who interviews candidates for New York's top court. In 1970, when
he was 27 and in the middle of the Panther 21 trial, he told The
New York Times: ``Youth _ that's what it's all about.'' He
continued: ``In three or four years we're going to turn the legal
system upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   When shown the clipping, he grows silent. At last he says, ``We
were so wild then, such believers, and we had no cynicism.'' His
smile is sad. ``Now you can't trust anyone under 30.''

BLAZE GUTS HOME OF BUDWEISER FROGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The business that made those toylike Budweiser
frogs and chatty Foster Farms chickens for TV ads was gutted by a
swift-moving fire Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty firefighters battled the intense blaze at The Character
Shop for 75 minutes, struggling against flames feeding on resins,
acetone, spray paint and compressed gas used to create animated
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had everything that firefighters dread. It was extremely
dangerous because of its toxicity,'' said Capt. Steve Ruda of the
Los Angeles Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals and materials created heavy black smoke and
intense heat that partially collapsed the roof and a wall at the
business, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters and a worker from the shop were treated for
minor smoke inhalation injuries. Five LAPD officers and six
civilians were treated at the scene for minor smoke inhalation,
said Bob Collis, an LAFD spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a matter of about five minutes, it had already consumed
everything inside and gone through the roof,'' said Battalion Fire
Chief Thomas Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is known in the film and television industry for its
special effects, puppets, animatronics and prosthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Among its creations was the 8,000-pound pachyderm in the Disney
film ``Operation Dumbo Drop,'' according to firefighters and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Both the elephant and Foster Farms chickens were damaged in the
blaze, firefighters said. The cause of the fire was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A life-size cow was among the few creations still intact among a
charred mess of metal that stretched about 100 feet across and 75
feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze started near the famed elephant, as employees worked
around flammable liquids, firefighters said. The employees tried to
knock down the blaze by using fire extinguishers, Brennan said, but
the flames overwhelmed them.
</P>
<P>
   The Character Shop's owner and employees declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said flames shot 40 feet above the shop's rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising how fast the flames came through,'' said Ben
Griffiths, a warehouse supervisor in one of four adjoining business
saved by firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Haren, who co-owns Architectural Security Products, two
doors from the gutted building, praised firefighters for keeping
flames away from his shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drove up and realized where the flames were coming
from, my heart just stopped. I was thinking it was the end of my
business and my mom just died, and I didn't want another thing like
this to happen,'' Haren said. ``They did a great job, incredible.
They saved our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Haren's and three other businesses had some water and smoke
damage.

PREPARING FOR OPEN, NORMAN WINS MATCH
</HEADLINE>
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COMMACK, N.Y. _ After winning his first hardcourt title as an
unseeded player in last year's Hamlet Cup, Magnus Norman reached
the fourth round of the U.S. Open before a back injury forced him
to withdraw. It was his best showing in a Grand Slam event to that
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so confident coming from a win here, I was hitting so
well, it was a shame I had to withdraw,'' Norman said on Wednesday
after dispatching Jonas Bjorkman, 6-4, 6-1, in the Hamlet Cup.
``But I think I'm a better player this year. I'm much better in big
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a 24-year-old Swede who is ranked No. 3 in the world and
seeded third for the Open, has won three titles this year: at
Auckland, New Zealand, Rome, and Bastad, Sweden. He also reached
the semifinals of the Australian Open and the final of the French
Open, where he lost to Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think about that,'' Norman said. ``I got off to a
slow start in the French, going down, 0-2, after an hour. But after
that I played well. I think my results this year have been the
result of a lot of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday he took just 1 hour 12 minutes to get past
Bjorkman, his fellow Swede, dominating throughout as he won 20 of
24 first-serve points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my best match so far this year,'' Norman said. ``I'm
moving good, feeling good. I'm going to work hard this weekend. I'm
definitely ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could not be said of No. 2-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia, who was eliminated in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3, by Karol
Kucera of the Czech Republic in another second-round match.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to win every match,'' Kafelnikov said. ``Maybe
in the back of my mind I'm trying to save energy for the Grand
Slam. I'm sure I'll be ready for the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only other match completed before a rain delay, Fernando
Meligeni, a qualifier from Brazil, upset ninth-seeded Albert Costa
of Spain, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. Arnaud Clement, seeded 15th, was leading
George Bastl in the third set and No. 5 Cedric Pioline was down a
set to Andrei Pavel before play was interrupted.  &QL;

LOAN POOL PUTS HOMES IN RANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Low to moderate income residents buying a home for
the first time in Los Angeles and Orange counties will have access
to a $90 million pool of low interest loans, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's about enough money to put 560 families in the two-county
area into their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 mortgage lenders in the two counties have access to the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of money was created when Fannie Mae, the nation's
largest source of financing for home mortgages, bought a bond issue
put together by the city of Los Angeles and the two counties.
</P>
<P>
   This is the region's largest loan pool created by this type of a
joint issue. The second largest was a $50 million loan pool created
last year, said Barbara Zeidman, director of the Los Angeles
Partnership Office of JFannie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds will fund 15- to 30-year fixed rate mortgages at below
market interest rates as low as 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's well below the current interest rate of 8.5 percent for a
30-year loan, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The financing program was announced by Democratic Congresswoman
Lucille Roybal-Allard and Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco,
chairman of the Housing and Community Redevelopment Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home ownership strengthens entire communities, and initiatives
like this one can provide the catalyst for neighborhood
revitalization throughout Los Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First-time buyers are considered anyone who has not had their
name on a home title in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are available to residents earning no more than 120
percent of the median income in their community. Those levels vary
according to family size.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that home shoppers should check with their real
estate agents to see if they qualify or call the Fannie Mae
consumer center at (800) 732-6643.
</P>
<P>
   This announcement comes at an opportune time, since prices in
the San Fernando Valley are rising, making it tougher for
first-time buyers to afford single family homes.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of programs typically expand purchasing power rather
than drive sales.
</P>
<P>
   For example, since interest rates are lower that those for
conventional loan, consumers will be about to buy more house for
their money.
</P>
<P>
   But both things could happen now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up the window of what you can afford,'' said Jim
Link, executive vice president of the Van Nuys-based Southland
Regional Association of Realtors. ``This year its going to be
interesting to watch. We've had such high appreciation in prices
this might spur a little more activity for the first-time buyers.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) - Babies who swap germs in day care or with siblings
are roughly half as likely to develop asthma later in life, says a
sweeping new study, furthering the idea that Americans are becoming
too clean for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Arizona findings, appearing today in the
(beginitalic)New England Journal of Medicine(enditalic), are part
of the world's longest-running study of childhood respiratory
illnesses and support recent studies showing that children benefit
from minor colds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now appears (children) need to get messages from microbes
in their environment to develop healthy immune systems,'' said
Thomas Ball, a pediatrician and the lead author of the UA study.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, UA researchers have been following more
than 1,000 children born healthy in Tucson to study what triggers
allergies or asthma later in life. Known as the Tucson Children's
Respiratory Study, the project previously has linked cigarette
smoking by adults to asthma in children, and bottle feeding with
ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   Today's study of 1,035 children analyzed asthma rates of babies
who spent time in day care or around older siblings. Researchers
found children were 40 percent more likely to develop asthma if
they were not exposed in their first six to 12 months of life to
other kids in day care, play groups or even brothers or sisters in
their own families. The study didn't surprise the UA researchers,
especially Ball, who recently spent a year in rural Africa and
realized that none of the children there had asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got me thinking about the whole `hygiene hypothesis,'''
Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is a growing problem worldwide, especially in developed
countries. More than 17 million Americans, including 316,000 in
Arizona, are afflicted with the respiratory disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the ailment is partially inherited and
partially caused by environmental factors. Although the findings
mesh with two recent German studies, they also seem to contradict
other evidence that asthma is growing among inner-city poor
children raised in dirty environments with cockroaches, dust mites
and other allergens.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Wright, one of the study's authors, said the contradiction
lies in the fact that not all bacteria are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex picture, but when we talk about
cleanliness, we mean a lot of different things,'' she said. Germs
from cockroaches, for example, are not considered ``gram-negative
bacteria'' like those found in feces, livestock and other organisms
that seem to protect children from asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 100 years, we have fundamentally changed our
relationship with microorganisms,'' Wright said, noting the demise
of the family farm, rural life and the growth of antibacterial
products. ``It looks like day care is kind of making up for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the findings seem to suggest babies not currently in
day care should be enrolled to bolster their immune system, the
researchers stopped short of recommending such a move in all cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pediatrician, I cannot make a generic recommendation for
every child,'' Ball said. But in some cases, putting small children
in day care ``might actually be beneficial to them for preventing
allergies and asthma later on.''
</P>
<P>
   They also said the findings suggest it may not be so bad to keep
a messy house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what is clean?'' Wright said. ``Maybe we don't
have to worry so much about hygiene. Maybe we've gone overboard
with our anti-bacterial soap.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, a prominent asthma researcher at the Mayo Clinic in
Scottsdale, agrees with the study findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure to organisms should have the effect of the immune
system revving up to deal with other pathogens in the world,'' said
Lee, who is studying the genetic component of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that the UA study doesn't explain the entire
asthma picture.
</P>
<P>
   The study, paid for by the non-profit National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, also did little to convince one mother that she
should have put her asthmatic son in day care as a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she regretted keeping 6-year-old Matthew out of
day care, Lavonda Session of Phoenix said, ``Not at all, because
kids in day care are always getting sick.''

MICROSOFT INVESTS IN LABOR SPECIALIST
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. _ Labor management company eLabor will get
more than $40 million in venture capital in a new partnership with
Microsoft, the companies announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The giant computer company will include eLabor's labor/resource
management technology in its Microsoft Project 2000 program for
large employers. With 500,000 users of the latest version of
Microsoft Project, ``the potential is huge,'' said Patrick Egan,
eLabor's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The synergy between Microsoft Project and (eLabor product)
Enterprise Project is really going to benefit customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is one of three investors participating in the second
round of financing of eLabor, a privately held company. Lehman
Bros. is leading the venture, with Brentwood Venture Capital also
taking part. Microsoft's portion of the funding was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Enterprise Project is offered as an add-on to
Microsoft Project, a program that allows employers to manage
individual employee projects and analyze resources. The deal calls
for Enterprise Project, which lets employers manage several
projects at once, to become a part of the next version of Microsoft
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said alliances with Microsoft tend to dramatically
improve the outlook for the Redmond, Wash.-based company's
partners. Edward Jones analyst Art Russell said the move follows a
Microsoft practice of partnering with small companies to get
technologies it can't develop itself expediently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously good news for eLabor that Microsoft is using
some of their technology,'' Russell said. ``In terms of marketplace
endorsement, it validates their technology.''

USC FRESHMAN HOLMES WILL PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Eight true freshmen will accompany USC to the
Kickoff Classic to play Penn State, and none is more excited than
tight end Alex Holmes of Harvard-Westlake High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unbelievably excited. I can't wait,'' said Holmes, who
will play a central part in USC's double-tight end offense. ``I am
bursting at the seams.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who was primarily a pass-catcher at Harvard-Westlake,
has become a more-versatile player during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm much more prepared than when I played in high
school,'' Holmes said. ``I learned to block in camp. I didn't
really have to do that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, though, Holmes' forte is receiving. It's the primary
role he'll have whenever he is used as the Trojans' second tight
end, and he is expected to be a viable part of the offense in the
season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   Another pass-catching tight end, true freshman Gregg Guenther of
Taft, said his sore back has recovered and he is available to play
against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik gets start: The defensive line has been an area with
some of USC's toughest competition, but senior Sultan Abdul-Malik
has edged out junior Lonnie Ford for a starting position against
Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Ford could split time equally with Abdul-Malik, though, because
the Trojans will rotate linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who has made a move is tackle Bobby DeMars of
Westlake High. DeMars is the fourth tackle, the highest he has been
on the depth chart, and will probably see some action against Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves his chance,'' defensive line coach Ed Orgeron
said.
</P>
<P>
   Early payday: USC will clear more than $700,000 from the Kickoff
Classic, which is about the same amount the Trojans made from the
1996 game.
</P>
<P>
   Trading places: Hackett said tailbacks Sultan McCullough and
Malaefou MacKenzie would probably alternate series against Penn
State, although McCullough is expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Feeling good:!off! The Trojans were in high spirits as
they finally broke camp Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the work ethic and work level was outstanding,''
Hackett said. ``From what we've demanded from them, they gave us
what we wanted. It's a very confident team that leaves camp.''
</P>
<P>
   It was USC's longest stay in Irvine (2 weeks), and the Trojans
were thrilled to be leaving and heading back to campus Wednesday
night, before leaving for New Jersey today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here a little too long,'' quarterback Carson Palmer
said. ``We're ready to get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Ending what was the worst-kept secret of training
camp, Hackett officially announced that junior David Newbury would
handle place-kicking duties, beating out senior David Bell and
freshman John Wall of Birmingham High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Newbury) I'm not going to make a change, you go do
it,'' Hackett said. ``I feel good. He's ready to have a strong
year. I don't imagine we'll be trying 50-yard field goals, so he
keeps his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell will still handle kickoffs for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane: Senior offensive guard Trevor Roberts (strained
foot) will not suit up but will attend the Penn State game. He is
tentatively scheduled to return for the Colorado game on Sept. 9,
but it is possible he won't play until the Sept. 23 contest with
San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Practice schedule: Hackett said the Trojans would probably
practice only 30 minutes in New Jersey on Friday, and one hour
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do much,'' he said. ``We've got to polish
up. We need to keep our legs fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk-ons honored: Wide receiver Matt Nickels and linebacker Ryan
Shapiro were awarded scholarships by Hackett, in his tradition of
giving at least one walk-on a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Nickels, a senior and former teammate of Palmer at Santa
Margarita, is currently considered the Trojans' No. 3 receiver,
although sophomore Steve Stevenson and freshman Keary Colbert are
likely to be used just as much against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro is a senior who played at Carson High.

REGIS HAWKS NEW LINE OF SHIRTS, TIES IN VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ America's No. 1 pop culture icon dazzled Wednesday
with his million-dollar smile, twinkling eyes and untiring
sincerity as he basked in the adoration of his fans young and old.
</P>
<P>
   Some chanted, ``Regis ... Regis ... Regis ... you're our man!''
while others screamed and applauded as Regis Philbin, host of ``Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire'' pitched a new line of Van Heusen shirts
and ties that bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 people already were lined up in Macy's at the Sherman
Oaks Fashion Square when the store opened at 10 a.m., three hours
before Philbin arrived.
</P>
<P>
   There was Elma Wallace of Bel-Air who boasted she was first to
arrive at 9 a.m. and 85-year-old Betty Salomon of Sherman Oaks who
wore head-to-toe-pink to meet Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says it's my best color,'' she said, ``and you know,
there's only one Reege. He's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Another early bird was 67-year-old Marie Nolan of Northridge,
who said she's been a fan since 1977.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've brought pictures of him from his early days, plus I
bought a new Regis tie for him to sign,'' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   When Philbin, 65, looked at her photo collection, he shouted,
``Oh my God,'' and held the pictures from his pre-icon years up to
his face as fans snapped photos.
</P>
<P>
   Once an NBC page seating guests on Steve Allen's ``Tonight
Show'' nearly 50 years ago, Philbin has been a sportscaster, news
anchor, late-show personality and ``The Morning Show'' host with
Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly relished his new role as superstar posing with young
mothers with their babies and a little boy dressed like him in a
blue shirt and tie, shaking hands with businessmen buying into the
Regis look and autographing a pair of black ties for 15-year-old
Agoura Hills residents Daniel Steinman and Lauren Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not square. He's smarter, more sophisticated than other
game show hosts and he dresses really well,'' Steinman said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Goldstein: ``I don't see Regis as old and I love his
'final answer' quote, but also like his morning show. I saw Darva
Conger try out for Kathie Lee's job and I think she'd be good for
Regis.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Byrd, 54, of Bellflower explained why she's been a fan for
16 years. ``He's very natural, not afraid to speak out, and would
do well to pick Marie Osmond for his next co-host.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like 41-year-old Misak Balyan of Pasadena, made the
celeb's personal appearance a family outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love the 'Millionaire' show, so I surprised the
children by bringing them,'' Balyan said.
</P>
<P>
   His 10-year-old daughter, Mari, said she liked Regis because
``he's nice to the contestants even when they don't know the
answer,'' while her brother Artashes, 8, said he liked the game
show host's laugh. And also the Pokeman questions that he was able
to answer.
</P>
<P>
   During the long wait, fans shopped for shirts and ties, while
friends held their place in line. Macy's reported the silvery color
combo worn by Philbin that day was the bestseller, followed by an
eggplant number and Philbin's favorite, a navy blue.

DISCOURAGING FINDING ON ESTROGEN THERAPY AND HEART DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.C., Calif., Mass., Md.) (SUBS for rewriting thruout)  
 By GINA KOLATA  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study finds that estrogen replacement therapy, which
doctors have long hoped will prevent heart disease in
postmenopausal women, does nothing to slow the disease's
progression in those whose arteries have already been partly
blocked by it.
</P>
<P>
   The study is being reported in Thursday's issue of The New
England Journal of Medicine. But another study, in the same issue,
cites the hormone therapy as a factor _ along with beneficial diet,
exercise and avoidance of tobacco _ in the decline of heart disease
among women. An editorial accompanying the studies says women will
not know whether hormone therapy protects the heart until larger
studies are completed in several years.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10 million U.S. women take estrogen replacement
therapy; Premarin, an estrogen made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories,
is the nation's best-selling prescription drug. The drug was
approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, like hot
flashes, and for the management of osteoporosis, but there has also
been a widespread belief among doctors and women that it will
protect against heart disease, the leading killer of U.S. women.
Heart disease is rare among premenopausal women, but its incidence
begins rising in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   In one study being reported Thursday, investigators injected
women's coronary arteries with a dye and then examined the arteries
with X-rays. They found that the women's arteries gradually
narrowed as the three-year study progressed, whether or not they
took estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David M. Herrington, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Wake
Forest University School of Medicine, the lead author of the new
artery study, said he began the work in hopes of confirming the
belief that estrogen would help women with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   A study reported previously, called HERS, had already shown
discouraging results, but some researchers wondered whether the
reason might be that the women in it took either a combination of
estrogen and methoxyprogesterone, or a placebo. Some experts
proposed that if the women took estrogen alone, the hormone would
protect their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   So the 309 women in Herrington's study were randomly assigned to
take estrogen alone, estrogen plus methoxyprogesterone, or a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still hopeful that there would be an underlying effect
on the progression of atherosclerosis,'' Herrington said. Now, he
said, he thinks the question has been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this study, coupled with the HERS trial, is a pretty
compelling combination of evidence showing that estrogen
replacement therapy is not effective in reducing the risk for heart
attacks or heart-disease deaths, or for slowing the disease that's
responsible for those heart attacks, in women with established
heart disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very convincing that after three years in a
well-designed study, there was no evidence of benefit,'' said Dr.
Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a professor of family and preventive
medicine at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But the artery study and the HERS study do not address the
question of whether hormone therapy at menopause can prevent the
development of heart disease in women who do not yet have it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the scientific director for clinical
research at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said she
was withholding judgment on the question of whether hormone
replacement therapy protects against heart disease. She noted that
the average age of the women in the study of artery narrowing was
65, long after they had entered menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would hormone replacement therapy possibly be more effective
if it was initiated at the onset of menopause?'' Nabel asked.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said that while the women in Herrington's study
were followed for only three years, ``it may be that protective
effects may be apparent only years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most experts said, the data are not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   They added that a study now under way, involving 25,000 women,
most of whom did not have heart disease, was also finding hints
that estrogen might not help women's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   In April, directors of that study, known as the Women's Health
Initiative, informed its participants that those taking estrogen
were having slightly more heart attacks than those taking a
placebo, possibly because of estrogen's well-known proclivity to
encourage blood clots in susceptible women.
</P>
<P>
   The finding reminded scientists of data from the HERS study,
which looked for heart attacks in women who already had heart
disease. There, too, the women taking estrogen initially had more
heart attacks. But later the incidence of heart attacks declined,
so that in the end estrogen had no effect on heart attack
incidence.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at
the University of California at San Francisco, said the preliminary
results from the Women's Health Initiative made it statistically
unlikely that hormone replacement therapy would turn out to prevent
heart disease. ``It's very unlikely in my mind that they will ever
be able to show an overall benefit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a study being published Thursday alongside
Herrington's on artery narrowing attributed a reduction in heart
disease among women in part to hormone replacement therapy. While
it was not a randomized trial _ that is, the women chose to take
estrogen or not to take it _ it was huge: Dr. Walter C. Willett of
the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues followed
85,941 female nurses for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   But epidemiologists said non-randomized studies could be
misleading. And, in fact, such studies previously indicated that
estrogen could slow the progress of heart disease, making it all
the more surprising when it did not and stunning some who had
believed in the treatment.

EDWARDS FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc. filed for bankruptcy
protection Wednesday and moved to close four of its outdated movie
houses amid mounting industry concern that the glut of multiplexes
far outstrips demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport Beach-based company said it will leave untouched its
remaining 70 theaters, including ones in Calabasas, Camarillo, Simi
Valley and Santa Clarita.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' move comes just two weeks after one of the nation's top
multiplex owners _ Carmike Cinemas Inc. of Columbus, Ga., with
about 2,750 screens _ also filed under Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other major chains are scrambling to restructure
their assets in a market that, analysts say, has built up to 50
percent more screens than the public can sustain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There became a fervor to do this and now the whole industry
has backed off, realizing that we probably went too fast,'' said
Stephen Coffey, president of Edwards Theatres, the nation's
11th-biggest chain, with 739 total screens.
</P>
<P>
   The industry added more than 3,000 screens to the U.S. market in
1999 alone, sharply accelerating the multiplex building boom that
started four years earlier. The industry believes multiplexes are
what the public wants _ theaters with 10, sometimes 20 or more
screens under one roof, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation now has 37,185 screens, according to the National
Association of Theatre Owners in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But by industry estimates, there is only enough business for
25,000 to 30,000 screens, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion in multiplex construction over the past five
years coincided with a steady rise in average ticket prices and
movie admissions, although the latter dripped by 1 percent last
year after growing 6.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the industry added nearly 10,000 new screens from 1995
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards Theatres helped pioneer the multiplex concept, opening
one of the nation's first such theaters in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The four Edwards Theatres being closed are in Stanton, San
Diego, Temecula and Rancho Cucamonga. Each was losing business to
newer theaters with more modern seating, sound and screens, company
officials said.

   Edwards Theatres, which also operates in Idaho and Texas, filed
voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 as part of
a strategic restructuring of its debt and operations, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reviewing the various alternatives available, we
concluded that utilizing the Chapter 11 process to complete our
restructuring is in the best long-term interests of the company and
its constituents,'' said Chief Executive Office W. James Edwards
III.
</P>
<P>
   Coffey said the company had no immediate plans to close any
other theaters, but would inevitably do so as newer ones are built
to replace the aging movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, operations and movie screenings will continue
without interruption. The company plans to seek court approval to
honor policies regarding gift certificates, movie passes and other
customer programs.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary petitions were filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Santa Ana.

REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE CANCELS A COMMERCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to add 250 words with quotes, details)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee has canceled plans to use a
television commercial showing Vice President Al Gore saying in a
1994 interview with NBC that neither he nor President Clinton had
lied in their political careers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was pulled, Republican officials said, because it
did not make clear the date of the interview, nor did it explain
that Gore was responding to questions about the U.S. Senate
campaign of Oliver North in Virginia. There was also fear, they
said, that swing voters would see the commercial as an unfair
effort to saddle Gore with responsibility for Clinton's deceptive
remarks about his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was confusion about when the interview was made that
would be a reason not to run the ad,'' a spokesman for the
Republican National Committee, Clifford May, said Wednesday. &UR;  &LR; ``We
want to make things clearer for viewers and voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee declined to release a tape or
transcript of the advertisement or to say how many copies had been
sent to television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans, who would speak only if they were not
identified, said the commercial produced by National Media showed a
television set on a kitchen table. The television is on, and the
screen shows an excerpt from the 1994 interview by Lisa Meyers, who
was asking Gore about his description of North as a ``pathological
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you say that neither you nor President Clinton has told a
lie in your political career?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, none spring to mind, I'll tell you that,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``And President Clinton has not uttered a single untruth in the
last two years?'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I have heard. Absolutely not,'' Gore answered.
</P>
<P>
   At Gore's campaign headquarters in Nashville Wednesday, some
advisers professed disappointment that the advertisement was not
shown as scheduled. They said they were certain that the
advertisement would have backfired on the Bush campaign, angering
voters because it did not make clear the time or context of the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the latest indication of disarray in the Bush
campaign,'' said Gore's communications director, Mark Fabiani.
`Yesterday Bush failed to coherently defend his tax plan. Today
Bush is mired in an indefensible ad debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   May said there had never been a decision to use the commercial,
adding, ``If the Democrats want to make a big thing about an ad
that didn't run, they can do so.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other Republicans also emphasized that Gore's character
and integrity were likely to be the subject of future
advertisements paid for by the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of Al Gore's credibility remains to be discussed in
this campaign,'' May said. ``But clearly we don't want to have an
ad out that would confuse people in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to the Bush campaign said Wednesday that senior
officials at the Republican National Committee first approached the
Bush campaign on Wednesday with concerns about the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Al Gore's credibility is an issue, but to raise
that issue, it has to be done in a credible way,'' the adviser
said. ``And this particular ad, with the date, might have been
taken out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was concern that the ad could undercut Bush's
pledge to raise the tenor of campaigning, the adviser replied: ``We
think the tenor of the campaign is important, but it's also
important to set the record straight. They've run $30 million worth
of ads, the bulk of them being attack ads on Governor Bush's
leadership in Texas.''

AUGUST DOG DAYS CHALLENGING BUSH CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush has long
predicted that the presidential race would tighten after the
summer's political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few people expected the dog days of August to be this cruel
to the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In the six days since Vice President Al Gore accepted his
party's presidential nomination, Bush has lost his lead in seven
national polls, an advantage he had enjoyed since winter.
</P>
<P>
   On the hustings, Bush stepped into a hard-to-win dispute with
the only Republican member of the Clinton administration over the
readiness of the military, and acknowledged that he needs to ``do a
better job'' explaining the virtues of his signature $1.3 trillion
tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   Never known for his verbal fluidity, Bush has had more
difficulty than usual with syntax and word choice, declaring in one
speech that ``Nothing can be further than the truth,'' mistaking
``hostile'' for ``hostage'' and ``terrors'' for ``tariffs'' and
suggesting that President Clinton had been in office for four years
rather than eight.
</P>
<P>
   And just Wednesday, Bush campaign officials stepped in at the
last minute to kill a Republican TV ad criticizing Gore for
defending President Clinton's honor _ a line of attack that has
backfired on every Republican who has tried it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no outward sign of alarm in Bush's Austin, Texas,
headquarters, where aides talk about the ebb and flow of campaigns.
Yet, as independent pollster Ken Warren observed from the Midwest
battleground state of Missouri: ``You'd better believe that some
Bush people are shaking in their boots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No question that Republicans have a lot more reason to be
concerned than they did a month ago,'' said Warren, who teaches
political science at St. Louis University. ``The worst-case
scenario for Republicans has come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Bush saw a comfortable lead slip away, he was
battling Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor regained his footing by appealing to his
party's conservative core and deploying his vast advantage over
McCain in money and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, battling an increasingly populist vice
president, those options are simply not available.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the primaries, the battleground over the next 10 weeks
will be for swing and independent voters _ and each campaign has
roughly the same size war chest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, still a novice on the national political stage, faces the
daunting task of riding out a wave of unfavorable publicity and
re-establishing his image as a natural leader to win over voters
who say they are more closely aligned with Gore on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of patience'' said GOP strategist Rich
Galen. ``In any sport, the other guy gets the ball every once in a
while. Sometimes they score. It doesn't mean they are going to win
the game. The Bush campaign has to just keep plowing ahead, step by
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Bush is that Gore's lead is very small,
falling within the statistical margin of error in several polls.
</P>
<P>
   And history shows that the bounce a candidate receives after his
convention often doesn't last very long.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter jumped 10 points in the polls after the 1980
convention in New York before losing to Ronald Reagan. Four years
later, Walter Mondale jumped to within 2 percentage points of
Reagan after the Democratic gathering in San Francisco, only to
suffer the most lopsided electoral rout in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the polls that come out in late September should be
viewed far more seriously. While many candidates have lost
elections after strong conventions, only Harry Truman in 1948 came
back to win after trailing in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Bush embarks Thursday on a campaign swing that will take him to
Florida, where Republicans had thought they had a strong advantage.
Not only will Bush find Gore already stumping in the state, he may
get a firsthand glimpse of dark clouds even more ominous than those
some say are gathering over his campaign _ Tropical Storm Debby is
on course to hit the Florida coast by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has been knocked down on a number of fronts,'' Warren
said. ``Now is when most people are paying attention. Now is when
he has to re-establish himself as a leader.''

CLINTON ORDER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RELIEF FOR HARD-HIT 
 POST-DEREGULATION CONSUMERS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered millions of dollars in relief
Wednesday for hard-hit California electricity users as federal
regulators opened an investigation into the state's problem-plagued
power market.
</P>
<P>
   Federal energy authorities said they are looking into how
wholesale electricity rates are set and whether power generators
are manipulating prices.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives from Washington came just hours before Gov. Gray
Davis and a pair of Democratic lawmakers unveiled legislation that
would sidestep state regulators and place a cap on electricity
prices for all San Diego ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request for help from Davis, the president
ordered the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to release
$2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income San Diego
residents pay their electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unusual impact there, different from virtually any
other place in America, and it needs to be examined,'' Clinton told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, the first California city to face the effects of
deregulation of the state's electricity market, has seen average
power bills more than double in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. and other utilities have warned that
their customers could face similar price spikes as deregulation
spreads over coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to speed up its investigation of wholesale power markets nationwide
``so we can better understand what's happening in California and
provide policy makers with the information they need to protect
consumers in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission Wednesday said its investigation was a response
to a complaint from San Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility,
that power generators may be using a variety of techniques to
profit from California's energy shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``SDG&AMP;E has asked us to limit what it believes to be excessive
rates in the California wholesale market,'' commission Chairman
James Hoecker said in a statement. ``This order demonstrates that
the commission is committed to reasonable rates for consumers of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   California officials have called on the commission to rule that
the state's power market is uncompetitive. Such a ruling would
allow federal regulators to subsequently impose ``just and
reasonable'' rates on market participants.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least one commissioner, William Massey, believes the
commission is unlikely to take such a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little appetite in this commission for
re-regulation,'' he said in an interview from his office in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Massey said he expects federal energy authorities to
work with state regulators to implement short-term measures to
stabilize electricity prices while lawmakers decide whether to
amend California's deregulation blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term,'' he said, ``the commission wants market
forces to produce just and reasonable rates.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its investigation, the commission will hold hearings
in San Diego next month, Massey said. A final ruling on the
market's competitiveness could come as early as October, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said the November presidential election ``is not a
factor'' in the timing of the commission's activities. But he
acknowledged that Clinton's sudden interest in California's energy
troubles does raise investigators' sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sort of indication that our national leaders are
interested in an investigation is taken very seriously by
everyone,'' Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer activists were pleased that federal authorities are at
last zeroing in on California's electricity situation, in which
surging demand is far outstripping available supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they're investigating is a very good sign,''
said Mike Boyd, president of Californians for Renewable Energy.
``It shows that there's a problem with the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it remains to be seen how all this federal heat will
affect what is largely a state issue.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Spiller, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley's Haas School of Business specializing in regulatory
issues, said it will be up to the California Public Utilities
Commission to oversee changes to the state's electricity market.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that even if federal regulators find evidence of
price manipulation among power generators, such actions are not
necessarily illegal under current rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find collusion among generators, then it would be up
to the Justice Department to act,'' Spiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the governor reiterated his belief that power
generators are gouging consumers. Related investigations are under
way by state regulators and the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation introduced Wednesday would go beyond a limited
rate freeze approved by the Public Utilities Commission on Monday.
That measure only covers about 70 percent of San Diego ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge moment for San Diego,'' said Sen. Dede Alpert,
D-San Diego, who will co-author the bill with Assemblywoman Susan
Davis, D-San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said bipartisan support is expected in the
Legislature and that he hopes the bill will be ready for his
signature by the end of next week.

 `SURVIVOR' KING RICHARD: HE'S TOUGH, HE'S RICH, HE NEEDS A SHOWER  &HT;     By JOHN CARMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In the words of one of the losing contestants, the snake ate the
rat Wednesday night in the conclusion of the summer TV phenomenon,
``Survivor.''
<P>
   Richard Hatch, a 39-year-old corporate trainer from Newport,
R.I., won the million-dollar grand prize in the show's two-hour
finale on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch won a 4-to-3 vote among the last seven contestants voted
off the island, defeating Nevada river guide Kelly Wiglesworth, 23.
</P>
<P>
   The show ended with hugs and handshakes around the ``tribal
council'' fire, and perhaps with gasps of surprise in living rooms
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's victory seemed an upset. Though Hatch said in his final
plea to the jury that ``I think I played as ethically as is humanly
possible,'' he was the architect of the alliance that ousted most
of the players who went on to decide the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the jurors thought of Hatch the same way Martin Balsam's
character thought of Holly Golightly in the 1961 film ``Breakfast
at Tiffany's.'' ``She's a phony,'' Balsam said, ``but she's a  &UR; real
 &LR; phony.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch had barely survived ``tribal council'' balloting in the
program's eighth installment, when three players voted to eliminate
him.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and his fellow castaways were in Los Angeles last night
for a live CBS ``town hall'' special after the finale.
</P>
<P>
   The last hour of ``Survivor'' was marked by sharp acrimony,
especially when Wisconsin truck driver Susan Hawk, 38, the first of
the four finalists voted out of the competition last night,
unloaded on her former friend Wiglesworth.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the other jurors and in the presence of the two
final competitors, Hawk said Hatch was ``a bit of a loser in
life,'' but then called Wiglesworth ``two-faced and manipulative.''
</P>
<P>
   If she encountered Wiglesworth dying of thirst, Hawk said,
glaring at Wiglesworth, ``I would not give you a drink of water.
I'd leave you to the vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawk added that Pulau Tiga, the Malaysian island where the
series was filmed last spring, was ``pretty much full of only two
things, snakes and rats.'' She described Hatch as a snake and
Wiglesworth as a rat, and said that ``the snake eats the rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently stunned by Hawk's remarks, Wiglesworth argued that
``I don't think anybody in this game is without faults.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting as jurors, expelled players Hawk, Rudy Boesch, Sean
Kenniff and Greg Buis voted in favor of Hatch. Gervase Peterson,
Jenna Lewis and Colleen Haskell voted to award the million-dollar
prize to Wiglesworth.
</P>
<P>
   Wiglesworth won $100,000 for finishing second among the 16
contestants who swam to the island at the game's outset.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who is gay and an avowed nudist, seemed most to embody
the scheming that characterized the reality show in its 13-week
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach to the game was one of strategy from the
beginning. ... For me, instead of who's the better person, it is
about who played the game better,'' Hatch said in his argument to
the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Casting his vote for Hatch, Kenniff said that ``Survivor'' had
become ``a contest of who's least objectionable'' and that Hatch
was ``just an out-and-out scoundrel, but I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the four finalists, Hawk was voted out first on last
night's show after Wiglesworth won an ``immunity challenge'' that
involved recalling details about players who had lost earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wiglesworth also won a second ``immunity challenge'' by walking
across a fire pit and then keeping a hand on a totem pole for four
hours and 11 minutes. She outlasted Hatch and the 72-year-old
Boesch in that contest.
</P>
<P>
   The victory and her resulting immunity enabled Wiglesworth to
choose between Hatch and Boesch. She voted to eliminate Boesch, who
later blamed his defeat on momentarily losing his grip on the pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have nothing to say to these two,'' Boesch, a retired
Navy SEAL, said at the final tribal council the next day. ``I just
want everybody to know how dumb I feel about a mistake I made
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   The finale of executive producer Mark Burnett's real-life
amorality play was projected to attract the biggest television
audience of the summer, perhaps upward of 40 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after a hit Swedish television series, ``Survivor'' has
triggered an avalanche of reality concepts bought by U.S. networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' will return in January for a new round of shows,
set in the Australian outback.
</P>
<P>
   But first, CBS is expected to repeat the original 13 episodes in
September, as a counter-programming move against the Olympic Games
from Sydney, Australia, on NBC.

NOT ENOUGH FALLOUT IN THIS WINDFALL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eighty-eight million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   I know what I'd do with $88 million. If I were Nita and Tommy
Colla, who took their California lottery winnings in a lump sum,
paid taxes and wound up with $29 million, I'd hire a detective to
find out what happened to my other $59 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government lures you into their gambling scheme, which has
odds that make Vegas look like Santa Claus, then they slice and
dice away two-thirds of your winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Where is that compassionate conservative tax-the-poor agenda
when you really need it?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, $88 million ain't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Collas immediately hired a financial adviser. Me, I'd ask
for the money in one-dollar bills and hire a forklift operator.
</P>
<P>
   And for the heck of it, I'd pick up a cherry '88 Oldsmobile
Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   I would also hire advisers. Financial advisers, technical
advisers, foreign-policy advisers. You can never have too many
advisers. And spokespeople.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No, Mr. Donaldson, what Mr. Ostler MEANT to say was... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE PROBLEM, though: With $88 mil, how would you deal with
all your new friends?
</P>
<P>
   Do they like you for you or for your money?
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Barbieri, star of radio KNBR, told me he once interviewed
Herb Caen for a magazine story.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph asked, ``Everywhere you go, Herb, people are glad to see
you, they're nice to you, they buy you drinks, they laugh at your
jokes. But how do you know whether they like you for yourself or
because you're a famous columnist?''
</P>
<P>
   And of course Herb said, ``Who gives a s_?''
</P>
<P>
   BURIED TREASURE? The Friends &AMP; Foundation of the Library people
don't exactly promise you'll find hidden riches at their big book
sale Sept. 7-9, but they drop hints.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's sale, they tell me, one reader bought a book and
found that it had been hollowed out. Inside were five very large,
gold-capped teeth. Yes, a book you can sink your teeth into.
</P>
<P>
   Another hollow book contained an out-of-circulation $100 bill
and three rings.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is all donated books, no library rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 100,000 books at Herbst Pavilion at Fort Mason, only
a small percentage is likely to contain cash and jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Every last book, though, contains riches for the mind, if you're
into that sort of materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Running shoes are recommended. Last year an elderly volunteer
holding back the first-day crowd before the nine o'clock opening
bell was almost trampled when someone in the crowd shouted ``Go!''
a minute early.
</P>
<P>
   Unruly louts, those book junkies.
</P>
<P>
   THE DREADED dot-commers are forcing the mass exodus of medical
people from the 450 Sutter building, which means that those same
dot-commers will have no place to go for Botox shots and ski-injury
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   And the place will need a new nickname. Tom Sweeney tells me
that the big medical building has long been known to locals as 450
Suffer.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE WAY, as William Thomas Quick is quick to point out, the
company that now owns 450 Suffer and is jacking up rents about 400
percent is ... Harsh Investment Properties.
</P>
<P>
   I'M WITH reader Tex when he says, ``Thank goodness there are no
Firestone blimps flying overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   A Firestone rep told Tex's friend, who lives near Redding, that
she would have to drive to Sacramento to turn in her faulty
Flintstone _ I mean Firestone _ tires.
</P>
<P>
   That's a long ride over red-hot pavement, so Tex figures the
Firestone slogan should be, ``No guts, no glory.''
</P>
<P>
   JANET RENO, with a name like that she should have been a
gambler. But anyway, Lou Bristol notices that the attorney general
said Tuesday, in response to a question about Gore's fund raising,
``I don't comment on conversations I have with attorneys.''

<P>
   I guess that would narrow the possible questions down to: ``Ms.
Attorney General, what does your hairstylist say about Al Gore's

   FORGET ABOUT the polls. What George W. Bush should be worried
about losing points in is not the polls, but his IQ tests.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain his fiscal plan, W sounds like me trying to
balance my checkbook with three margaritas. He bumbles and rambles,
misplacing and realigning trillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush vows not to let ``terrorists or rogue nations hold our
nation hostile or hold our allies hostile ...''
</P>
<P>
   The man has some charm, and all the charisma money can buy, but
he's going to have to hire an interpreter to stand next to him at
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe W just needs more speech practice. Like standing at the
seashore with marbles in his mouth, saying over and over,
``Inclusion illusion confusion,'' and ``The hostile hostage ate the
sausage.''

CONTROVERSY ERUPTS OVER GUIDELINES FOR EMBRYO RESEARCH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medical researchers hailed the government's new guidelines on
federal funding for human embryo cell research Wednesday, while
anti-abortion forces promptly denounced the move as condoning
murder and vowed a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   At no time in the history of medical science have researchers
been so convinced that the tiny cells, contained within human
embryos shortly after fertilization, can offer a path to
breakthroughs in the fight against dozens of major disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered that during the earliest days after
fertilization, the tiny clusters of embryonic cells contain within
them pluripotent stem cells that can be guided to develop into all
sorts of other cells: muscle, heart, nerves, blood, bone and many
others.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines announced by the National Institutes of Health
Wednesday after more than a year of public debate will create a
high-level scientific review group that must approve every proposal
seeking federal funds for research into the cells.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also insist that federal research be conducted
only on cells that would otherwise be discarded after women have
become pregnant through in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   In such fertilization efforts, clusters of embryonic cells
normally are produced in a laboratory dish. After two or more
clusters of the embryonic cells are returned to the womb and the
woman becomes pregnant, the remaining surplus cells are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While allowing federal funds for the human embryonic stem cell
research under strict controls _ including a requirement for
``informed consent'' by any woman permitting her surplus cells to
be used _ the new guidelines explicitly ban any experiments on the
embryos themselves.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton himself hailed the new NIH guidelines at a
press conference Wednesday and said the research offers
``potentially staggering benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives
and improve lives, to help people literally get up and walk, to do
all kinds of things we could never have imagined, as long as we
meet rigorous, ethical standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is certain to be taken up by Congress and is
likely to spill over into the presidential campaign because it is
so closely linked to the hot-button abortion issue. Several
Republicans threatened new legislation reversing the guidelines and
banning any research with human stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush made
clear his opposition to the administration's guidelines. ``The
governor opposes federal funding for stem cell research that
involves destroying a living human embryo,'' said campaign
spokesman Ray Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic leaders also weighed in. Douglas Johnson,
legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee,
declared: ``You have to kill a human embryo to get (stem cells).
There will be a legal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leading scientists predicted that speeding the
research with federal funds could yield the first clinical trials
to treat specific diseases within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Berg, a Stanford University biochemist and Nobel
laureate, said he is constantly puzzled by outcries against the
research because the cells to be used come from embryonic tissue
that would otherwise be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it more ethical to destroy these embryo cells or to
preserve them for enormous human benefit?'' Berg asked. ``To me
it's a no-brainer. We have the moral imperative to save human life
and improve human health, and I can't understand how one small
minority can hold up the work by imposing their view of morality or
ethics on the rest of us.''

 E-TRADE'S MARKETING PROBED  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Regulators have begun investigating the
marketing practices of E-Trade Group and have forced the online
broker to get advance approval of all advertising materials,
according to a document filed by the company.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade is best known for edgy, offbeat ads that make light of
investor lust for money and have helped propel the firm to the No.
2 spot among online brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Menlo Park, Calif.'s E-Trade said in a quarterly report filed
last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission that NASD
Regulation, the National Association of Securities Dealers
affiliate that polices the industry, and the SEC had opened formal
investigations of its ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, we have voluntarily agreed to prefile all
advertising 10 days prior to first use for (NASD Regulation's)
review and comment,'' E-Trade noted. The prefiling requirement
began June 12 and ends on Sept. 12, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has already been sanctioned twice this year by NASD
Regulation for failing to comply with security industry rules. The
company has said its violations were unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   NASD Regulation and the SEC declined to elaborate on the matter.
E-Trade is ``fully cooperating with the NASD'' but can't comment
further ``until that investigation is completed,'' E-Trade
spokesman Patrick Di Chiro said.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to E-Trade said NASD Regulation is insisting on
reviewing anything that can broadly be construed as marketing
material, including such items as press releases, hampering the
firm's ability to quickly gear up promotional campaigns. If E-Trade
runs afoul of its rules, the agency has threatened to extend the
review period for a full year, the source noted.
</P>
<P>
   The probes of E-Trade come more than a year after government and
industry leaders sharply criticized the online brokerage industry
for advertising that implied trading on the Internet was a fast and
easy way to get rich.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 1999 speech, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt slammed
Internet brokers for ads that ``more closely resemble commercials
for the lottery than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically cited an ad by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (then
known as Discover Brokerage) featuring a tow truck driver who buys
an island with his stock market winnings and an Ameritrade ad that
shows a woman returning to her computer after a morning jog,
bragging that she had just made $1,700 on a biotechnology stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last year, NASD Regulation promised
more-vigorous oversight of online brokerage advertising, citing its
concern about ads that seem ``to unfairly portray the benefits of
the trading online, without disclosing the risks associated with
online investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it has stepped up enforcement by forcing brokers
to change and, in some cases, stop running commercials. ``Members
that repeatedly have issues regarding their compliance with the
advertising rules will be subject to greater sanctions,'' it
warned.
</P>
<P>
   NASD Regulation can censure brokers, fine them, force them to
halt advertising or, ultimately, expel them from the association,
effectively putting them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, brokers pay heed to the agency. Ameritrade
stopped running its jogger commercial after NASD Regulation
questioned it, said Donna Kush, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska
firm. Ameritrade isn't being investigated by the agency, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear which E-Trade ads caught the eyes of NASD
Regulation and the SEC. But the firm has also used television
commercials and billboards that dangle riches in front of
prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, E-Trade has been one of the
industry's most aggressive, creative and successful advertisers,
building one of the industry's best-recognized brand names. During
the nine months ended June 30, the firm spent $422 million on
marketing, one of the biggest budgets in financial services.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's ads have ``been extremely effective,'' said
SalomonSmithBarney analyst Matthew Vetto. ``They have generated
tremendous growth in accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's television, print and billboard ads, created by
superstar San Francisco agency Goodby, Silverstein, have garnered a
slew of awards. One of the most outlandish was a Super Bowl
commercial showing a chimpanzee lip-synching the song ``La
Cucaracha,'' followed by the tag line: ``Well, we just wasted two
million bucks. What are you doing with your money?''

 CALIFORNIA PUC COMMISSIONER OFF CASE AFTER CONFLICT COMPLAINT  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry
Duque, under fire for investing $10,000 in a cellular phone company
his agency regulates, was dropped from a PUC case last month amid
complaints he had a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a Santa Cruz, Calif., lawyer asked PUC President
Loretta Lynch to consider removing Duque from overseeing a case
involving mobile-home parks because he owned $81,000 in stock in
Chateau Communities, which owns five mobile-home parks in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding could determine whether apartment buildings and
mobile-home parks _ including Chateau's _ can resell water to
tenants at a profit and whether the PUC can set the rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such financial holdings raise the appearance of a conflict,''
wrote Benjamin Scharf, an attorney representing mobile-home owners.
</P>
<P>
   Duque, however, said the PUC's lawyers advised him the
investment didn't pose a problem. The PUC's top lawyer, Peter Arth,
declined to confirm that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Duque said he decided to sell his stock and remove
himself from the case after a reporter asked him about the
complaints. The Santa Cruz Sentinel ran a story about the
allegations on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, OK, discretion is the better part of valor,'' Duque
said. ``It's really nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a commission official said the PUC lawyers recommended he be
moved off the case. The case was transferred on July 18 to Lynch,
but the order does not indicate who requested the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is not clear that Duque violated the law in the
mobile-home case but complain that Duque hasn't done enough to
avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in his role at the
PUC.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, The Chronicle reported that Duque bought stock in
Nextel Communications, the country's fifth-largest wireless firm,
despite state regulations barring commissioners from investing in
companies regulated by the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is going to be increasing pressure for him to
vacate his seat,'' said Michael Shames, executive director of the
Utility Consumers' Action Network. ``There's a compounding effect.
It makes the (Nextel) violation even that much more egregious.``
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Duque never tried to hide the investments. In forms
filed with the PUC in February, Duque reported he invested at least
$460,000 in 46 companies, ranging from telecommunications to
semiconductors to real estate.
</P>
<P>
   And even consumer watchdogs who differ sharply with Duque
politically do not question his honesty. ``Duque is an honorable
man, and he would not do anything to put himself in this position
deliberately,'' said Paul Stein, a lawyer with The Utility Reform
Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein added: ``Duque needs to be more careful, and the PUC
legal staff needs to take a more active role in identifying
potential conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   PUC lawyers review only the financial filings if the
commissioners ask them for advice. In an earlier interview, Arth
said it is up to the individuals to follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duque is taking action to make sure the problem doesn't
occur again. He retained a lawyer Wednesday who specializes in
election law to review his investments and identify potential
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing his best,'' said Joseph Remcho of San Francisco.
``He hired me to set up a procedure so that inadvertent errors that
may cause an appearance of a conflict do not happen in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that Duque seemed unfamiliar with some of his
investments.
</P>
<P>
   In the mobile-home case, for instance, Duque said he didn't
realize Chateau owned any mobile-home parks until an attorney in
the case complained that he had a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But Chateau's Web site touts it as ``the largest owner/manager
of manufactured (or mobile) home communities in the nation.''
Indeed, that is almost all Chateau does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just calls his investment adviser, and his investment
adviser says `Buy that' and (Duque) says `OK,' '' Remcho said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it seems clear that Duque broke state rules in the
Nextel case but not necessarily in the mobile-home situation.
</P>
<P>
   Scharf, who represents mobile-home tenants in the Golden State
Mobilehome Owners League, said he believes the Public Utilities
Code bars commissioners from owning stock in any company subject to
regulation by the commission _ including mobile-homes parks.
</P>
<P>
   But Duque notes that mobile parks are regulated by the PUC only
in rare instances.

 AMAZON GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO ONLINE CAR SALES  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It may be difficult to visualize dropping a
2,000-pound Ford Explorer into your ``shopping cart,'' but
Amazon.com is asking customers to do just that as the leading
e-tailer begins selling new automobiles online Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To the likely relief of stockholders in the money-losing
e-tailer, Amazon isn't actually buying cars from manufacturers and
setting up a delivery system. Instead, the Seattle company is
leasing space on its Web site to Livermore, Calif.'s
Greenlight.com, which sells new cars online and arranges their
delivery through 1,500 local dealerships in 27 states, including
several Bay Area chains.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jupiter Communications' rosy forecasts of a $30 billion
online car market by 2004, selling new cars online has so far
proved difficult. CarOrder.com, based in Austin, Texas, shut down
its Web site Friday, and other car-sales sites have seen their
stock prices sink in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   However, this agreement is a low-risk way for Amazon to test the
online car-sales market, said Heath Terry, a financial analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody can sell (cars online), Amazon can, but it's going
to take awhile before direct car sales on the Internet are going to
become a big thing,'' said Terry of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a category we want to be in,'' said Amazon Chief
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos. ``It is completely clear that over
the long term, online is going to have a lot to do with car
buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike books, home-improvement tools or other items Amazon
sells, automobiles are subject to state laws designed to protect
the current dealership system and supported by powerful dealer
lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   State franchise laws make it illegal to sell new cars without
going through a dealer, so most car sites _ including Greenlight _
depend on commissions from dealers for revenues. (Greenlight also
gets some revenue from financing, trade-in fees and other sources.
The closely held firm won't disclose details about its revenues.)
New cars carry a profit margin of only 1 to 2 percent, leaving
little for an Internet company to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling cars over the Internet just doesn't work,'' said
Jonathan Lawrence, an auto e-commerce analyst with Dain Rauscher
Wessels.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos' response to such doubts: ``Five years ago, they were
telling me the same thing about books.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenlight will pay Amazon $15.25 million during the two-year
contract in exchange for access to the popular site's 23 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon agreed in January to acquire 5 percent of Greenlight and
has the option to buy more shares at a fixed rate. Industry sources
say Amazon has warrants for up to 30 percent of the company. In
addition, Amazon contributed less than $5 million to the $39
million round of funding Greenlight raised Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Greenlight page is integrated into Amazon's site. Amazon
terminated a similar arrangement with furniture seller Living.com _
in which it held an 18 percent stake _ last week, when the company
went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon also holds minority shares of Webvan and Pets.com, and
analyst Terry said these companies are potential candidates for
similar partnerships, should Amazon decide to start selling
groceries or pet supplies. Bezos has said he eventually wants every
product under the sun to be available at Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon received warrants to buy 5 percent of ToysRUs.com two
weeks ago in exchange for taking on the responsibility of running
the toy seller's troubled Web operation. Under the 10-year
agreement, Amazon will receive fixed payments as well as a
percentage of each toy sale.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon shares closed at $38.81 Wednesday, up $2.31. The stock
has lost about 60 percent of its value this year.

 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health issued long-awaited rules
Wednesday that would permit federally financed researchers to work
on human embryonic stem cells, cells derived from the very early
embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these cells' ability to form every tissue of the
body, scientists say they hold great promise in treating many
diseases, particularly the degenerative maladies of age.
</P>
<P>
   The rules permit federally financed researchers to use cell
lines that are derived from frozen human embryos due to be
discarded by fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion have objected to federal approval of the
research because the embryos, which they consider to be capable of
life, are destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to sidestep the abortion issue, the National
Institutes of Health will allow its researchers to use only cells
that have been obtained by private firms. The agency's researchers
will not be allowed themselves to extract and culture the cells
from discarded embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The cells, which were first cul- tured two years ago, may be
legally derived by anyone who does not receive federal funding.
Human embryos are created by mixing eggs and sperm in fertility
clinics. Those that are not used are often frozen, stored for many
years, and eventually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was welcomed by scientific groups like the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, and
President Clinton referred in a press conference Wednesday to the
``potentially staggering benefits of this research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives
and improve lives, to help people literally get up and walk, to do
all kinds of things we could never have imagined,'' Clinton said,
``as long as we meet rigorous, ethical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as rigorous ethical standards are met, he said, ``I
think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives and
improve lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lana Skirboll, director of science policy at the National
Institutes of Health, said that the agency's special review
committee for embryonic stem cells would hold its first meeting
next month and that the first research grants could be awarded
before the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the Senate's leading critic of the
agency's policy, said in a statement Wednesday that human embryonic
stem cell research was ``illegal, immoral and unnecessary.''
Brownback said the research was prohibited by a congressional ban
on financing research that led to the destruction of human embryos,
sought to benefit by taking human life and would lead to treatments
that could be developed by other means: the use of adult stem
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The initial draft of the agency's guidelines, issued in
December, drew criticism as morally inconsistent from anti-abortion
groups and even the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In their final form, the guidelines have been made more
stringent, by the addition of a new level of review. Biologists
seeking federal funds to work on human embryonic stem cells will
have to win approval from four separate bodies _ their university's
in-house review group and three panels within the N.I.H. _ before
receiving their money.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines include several provisions designed to discourage
anyone from donating embryos for profit or for the medical benefit
of relatives. The new version also allows the donor of the
embryonic cells to be identified, since the immunological makeup of
the cells may be important if they are transplanted into patients.
</P>
<P>
   The extra reviews required by the new rules should not delay
research because they will take place within the agency's normal
reviewing cycle, Skirboll said.
</P>
<P>
   One new issue that has been raised in recent months comes from
the finding that a different kind of stem cells found in the organs
of adults are far more versatile than supposed. The opponents of
funding embryonic stem cells have argued that the promised health
benefits can be obtained just as well as from a patient's own adult
stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is not without substance. Most organs seem to have
a small reservoir of stem cells that generate new cells, among them
the bone marrow stem cells that daily replenish the red and white
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Adult stem cells are less versatile than embryonic stem cells
but they now appear to be less tissue-specific than thought; recent
experiments have shown that the blood-making stem cells can also be
coaxed to make muscle cells and even nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Blood-making stem cells are quite accessible and could perhaps
be converted into dopamine-secreting brain cells, the type lost in
Parkinson's disease. Use of a patient's own stem cells would avoid
both the ethical problems of embryonic stem cells and the threat of
immunological rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But embryonic stem cells grow much more prolifically than adult
stem cells and biologists have in mind several ways of handling the
problem of immune rejection. In short, no one yet knows which type
of stem cell will prove more suitable for clinical use, and
researchers want to try both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is bad public policy for politicians to say
which cells should be studied,'' said Daniel Perry, chairman of the
Patients' Coalition for Urgent Research. ``we think all of them
should be studied.''
</P>
<P>
   Embryonic stem cells are taken from the embryo at a stage when
it is a hollow sphere consisting of a thousand or so cells. Inside
the sphere is a blob known as the inner cell mass, which contains
the stem cells. The cells can form any tissue of the body except
the placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a scientific committee recommended to the British
government that researchers should be allowed to embark on
therapeutic cloning, in which an ordinary body cell is taken from a
patient and inserted into a human egg cell whose own nucleus has
been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Through mechanisms that are not yet understood, the egg's
interior contents or cytoplasm can reprogram the introduced nucleus
and enable it to regain its full potential; instead of operating
just as the nucleus of a skin cell, say, it can make any tissue of
the body.
</P>
<P>
   In principle the inserted nucleus can then direct the egg to
grow into an entire adult organism. This is the process that was
used to clone Dolly the sheep, the nucleus being taken from an
adult mammary gland cell.
</P>
<P>
   A human egg cell with an introduced adult cell nucleus would
presumably be a viable embryo, but inserting it into a uterus would
be a criminal offense in Britain. For therapeutic cloning, the egg
would instead be cultured in laboratory glassware and exposed to
signals that would convert it into the type of tissue that the
patient needed to have replaced. The concept has been demonstrated
in repairing heart tissue in mice and is considered to have
enormous clinical promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, therapeutic cloning could legally be
undertaken by private researchers but no one is known to have done
so, Skirboll said. Therapeutic cloning is specifically prohibited
for federally financed researchers by the guidelines issued
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Skirboll said the N.I.H.'s special review committee for
embryonic stem cells would hold its first meeting next month, and
that the first research grants could be awarded before the end of
next year.

 JUKE JOINTS JUMP WITH HIGH-TECH TUNES  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You're at your favorite bar. You amble up to the
new Internet-connected jukebox and punch up your favorite tune. In
moments, the jukebox downloads the song, plays it and asks if you
want to buy the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Then you notice the jukebox displaying the live video feed of an
attractive patron sitting in a bar 3,000 miles away. In seconds,
you've e-mailed a hopeful message: ``Can I buy you a song and a
drink?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is not your father's jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bubble-tubed, Art Deco mechanical machines that
have survived for a century as an American music icon are about to
be transformed by the Internet music revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Little-known startups such as Ecast Inc. of San Francisco as
well as long-established jukeboxmaker Wurlitzer are rolling out
online, computer-powered digital jukeboxes that they hope will
supplant an estimated 250,000 machines that spin vinyl 45 rpm
records or plastic CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the new ``downloadable'' jukeboxes promise a
virtually limitless selection of songs _ nearly enough to make a
Napster junkie happy _ but analysts say it is a concept that could
also make e-commerce transactions like buying a CD palatable for
the millions of people who don't use computers at home or work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is kind of a `duh' idea,'' said Edward Bevilacqua,
chief executive of Fun e-Business Inc., a San Diego County company
that designed the technology inside a new computerized jukebox that
Wurlitzer Jukebox Co. of Chicago plans to roll out later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jukebox is a multigenerational product that people feel
good about,'' Bevilacqua said.
</P>
<P>
   A deal that Ecast announced earlier this week is the biggest
signal to date that digital music is beginning to transform the
$2-billion-a-year jukebox industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe International Inc., the world's biggest manufacturer of
jukeboxes, said it will build new downloadable jukeboxes using
Ecast's Internet technology, called the Siren Entertainment System.
</P>
<P>
   The Rowe-Ecast jukeboxes will be able to tap into a library of
thousands of songs from major and independent record labels. Each
box can store up to 400 discs on a local hard drive. For payment,
the boxes will also accept credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rowe International of Grand Rapids, Mich., claims about
70 percent of the North American jukebox market, its alliance with
Ecast will get the attention of traditional jukebox operators who
historically have been skeptical about switching to new technology,
said Marcus Webb, editor of the industry publication RePlay
Magazine, based in Tarzana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leading jukebox factory has made this very close alliance
with a firm making downloading-music technology,'' said Webb, who
has followed the jukebox industry for 15 years. ``That is going to
send a really big signal to the operators who buy these
jukeboxes.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, TouchTunes Music Corp. of Montreal, has already
leased about 2,000 of its Genesis digital jukeboxes around the
country. The TouchTunes jukebox can store 750 downloaded songs.
</P>
<P>
   According to jukebox historians, the first commercial
``coin-operated phonograph'' made its premiere on Nov. 23, 1889, in
San Francisco's Palais Royal restaurant on Sutter Street. Inventor
Louis Glass affixed a coin slot to an Edison gramophone, which
played sound for two minutes on a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 20th century, jukeboxes became cabinets that played
songs from a small collection of vinyl records stored inside. For
example, the first Wurlitzer jukebox, the Debutante, which
premiered in 1933, had 10 songs. The company now has a model that
holds 120 CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Wurlitzer plans to roll out a model that looks
like an old-fashioned rainbow-colored jukebox on the outside but
replaces the mechanical CD or record changer on the inside with an
off-the-shelf computer.
</P>
<P>
   The jukebox can store 10,000 songs in digital form on a hard
drive and, through a high-speed DSL connection, access and download
music from a virtual library of 200,000 songs, using Liquid Audio
Inc.'s digital audio format.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, mechanical jukeboxes have to be manually
updated to add the latest top hits. That means jukebox distributors
typically have to go to each unit and replace the 100 CDs with new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem you have with CD jukeboxes is that only
one to three songs out of 12 (on a CD) are being played by the
jukebox patron,'' said Joe Pankus, chief executive officer of
Wurlitzer USA.
</P>
<P>
   However, with Internet-connected jukeboxes, ``you have all the
hits,'' Pankus said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Ecast chief executive and founder Mouli Cohen said his system
also has the ability to link to a site that sells CDs. And the
system is designed to deliver other forms of entertainment, like
video games, film and cartoons. Cohen also envisions a time when
the jukeboxes could be used to buy and print concert or sports
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine a day, Cohen said, when a jukebox network includes
screens that show people in other taverns around the country. ``If
you're in a bar in San Francisco and see someone in New York,'' he
said, ``I can buy him or her a drink or a song from the location
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   While that scenario is still too futuristic, the Ecast jukeboxes
are becoming a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ecast has demonstration models set up in about 50 U.S.
locations, such as Kennedy's Irish Pub Curry House on Columbus
Avenue in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The company earlier this year signed a deal with England's
Leisure Link Group Ltd., the world's biggest electronic amusement
game operator, to deploy Ecast technology in about 20,000
Leisure-made jukeboxes in the United Kingdom during the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the downloadable jukeboxes will catch on
quickly. According to a report by Dataquest analyst Van Baker, the
Ecast business model ``is so compelling at all levels of the supply
chain that it is bound to have a profound impact on the traditional
jukebox industry. ... This is clearly a potential change-or-die
scenario for the operators.''
</P>
<P>
   That could bring sweet music to an industry that has been slowly
shrinking due to competition from the new forms of digital
entertainment, from video games to the home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that jukeboxes remain a staple in bars but
practically disappeared since the late 1980s from restaurants, said
Jim Hayes, chairman of the jukebox committee for the Amusement &AMP;
Music Operators Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to find them in other places besides bars, like ice
cream parlors and pizza places,'' Hayes said. Downloadable
jukeboxes ``gives our industry a chance to gain back some market
share in some of the venues we used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Connell, an analyst with Frost &AMP; Sullivan, a San Jose
company that tracks Web-connected kiosks, said music will only be
the first step toward introducing non-Web-savvy consumers to
Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, retailers may be able to use the jukebox
to sell products to restaurant customers who are playing music and
waiting for their food to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of providing music through an Internet jukebox is a
neat idea,'' Connell said. ``This is a great way to provide revenue
streams.''
</P>
<P>
   But Webb, the editor at RePlay, said persuading the thousands of
bar and restaurant owners to install downloadable jukeboxes could
be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same group that waited until 10 years after CDs were
introduced _ and five years after CDs had replaced vinyl albums as
the dominant music media _ to start replacing the old vinyl-playing
jukeboxes with ones that played CDs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a new, but still-unreleased jukebox industry survey by
the University of New Orleans shows 19.6 percent of the commercial
jukeboxes still in use play vinyl 45 rpm records.
</P>
<P>
   And although 41 percent say downloadable jukeboxes will
eventually replace the old technology, 43 percent say the new
machines will have no effect, according to the survey commissioned
by the amusement operators association.
</P>
<P>
   ``American operators are coming to the reluctant conclusion that
the technology that they were 10 years behind the rest of the
country in embracing _ CDs _ may eventually have to be replaced by
downloading music,'' Webb said. ``But they're not eager to do it.''

 POWER-MISER MICROCHIPS GENEROUS TO HANDHELD DEVICES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even as it pushes to bring its new Pentium 4 and
Itanium chips to market, Intel announced plans Wednesday for yet
another processor design, this one intended not for PCs but for
Web-capable mobile phones, handheld computers and networking
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Officially called the XScale Microarchitecture, the new
technology will be the foundation of a series of products Intel
will begin announcing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because these chips will deliver high performance on very little
power, devices incorporating them will be capable of carrying out
demanding tasks such as videoconferencing while running on just a
single AA battery, according to Ron Smith, vice president and
general manager of Intel's Wireless Computing and Communications
Group in Folsom, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Chips based on the architecture will be capable of operating at
variable voltages and performance levels. In a demonstration
Wednesday at the Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Calif., Smith
and the chief Intel engineer on the project, Jay Heath, cranked up
a prototype to a speed of 1 gigahertz _ 1 billion cycles per second
_ by increasing its power to 1.75 volts.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Intel's latest Pentium III chip, running at 1.13
gigahertz, can consume up to 35.5 watts, according to Intel
technical documents.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith and Heath dialed the power going into the XScale
prototype down to 0.7 volt, the chip ran at 200 megahertz. At that
level, it would consume only about 50 milliwatts, or 0.05 watt.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Smith said, the chip could operate on as little as 10
milliwatts, running at 50 megahertz. Application programs will be
able to tell XScale-based devices how much power and performance
they require, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a multimedia player running on a personal digital
assistant with an XScale chip could set the voltage to a high level
so the chip could handle a heavy-duty chore like decoding an MPEG2
video stream. But when the user switched to, say, an appointment
calendar, which needs much less processing performance, the program
would tell the device to drop to a lower power mode to preserve
battery life.
</P>
<P>
   This power-conservation scheme bears some resemblance to the
LongRun technology used in the Crusoe chips announced earlier this
year by Transmeta, a secretive Santa Clara, Calif., startup. The
Crusoe chips, however, adjust voltage levels on the fly, depending
on the chip's current workload, without waiting for instructions
from software applications.
</P>
<P>
   The XScale architecture is an enhanced derivative of the
StrongARM, a family of chips Intel acquired in 1998 as part of the
settlement of a patent dispute with the former Digital Equipment
Corp. Digital in turn had developed the chips around technology
licensed from a British chip design company called Advanced RISC
Machines (ARM).
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it would incorporate the new chips into its own
networking products but declined to identify prospective outside
customers. Currently, the StrongARM chip powers the iPAQ Pocket PC,
a hot-selling new handheld computer from Compaq, and Palm Inc. has
said it plans to adopt ARM chips in future version of its handheld
organizers. (Palm today uses a Motorola chip called the
Dragonball.)
</P>
<P>
   Already the largest supplier of flash memory chips for mobile
phones, Intel hopes the new chips will also find a home in that
burgeoning market. Aside from their communications chips, today's
phones have only rudimentary processors, but as phonemakers add
features such as color screens, Web access and MP3 music
capabilities, they will require the combination of high performance
and low power XScale is designed to deliver, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel closed Wednesday at a 52-week high of $74.63, up
$2.50.

 FORMER ORACLE PRESIDENT LANE JOINS VENTURE FIRM  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oracle's former No. 2 executive, Ray Lane, who
left the database software giant last month after he was stripped
of his duties, resurfaced Wednesday as a general partner at one of
Silicon Valley's most prestigious venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, 53, will become a general partner at Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, one of the early investors in ``new economy''
titans America Online and Amazon.com, where he said he hopes to
help Fortune 1000 companies found startups harnessing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the shakeout in dot-coms, venture-capital success is
about how well you can pick CEOs, build management teams and choose
acquisitions _ I've done that,'' Lane said in an interview,
referring to his pre-Oracle job at business consulting firm
Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Lane also said the job's flexible hours and the proximity of
Kleiner Perkins' Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters to his home in
Atherton, Calif., will let him spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another operations role would put me on the 18-hour-a-day
circuit with a lot of travel. This is an industry and a firm that
structurally fits my life,'' he said, adding that he considers
Kleiner Perkins ``the New York Yankees of the venture-capital
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane's decision answers a much-asked question in Silicon Valley
and beyond. Since his abrupt departure from Redwood Shores,
Calif.'s Oracle last month, many have wondered where the highly
respected Lane would turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts said Lane was particularly talented at
running the day-to-day minutiae of a large high-tech company,
others said Lane will have a wider-ranging impact on the industry
in his role at Kleiner Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets Ray play an active role in incubating and
germinating and fertilizing smaller companies as they embark on
aggressive growth paths,'' said Wendell Laidley, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At Oracle, Lane was considered a buttoned-down counterbalance to
chief executive Larry Ellison's flamboyance.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Ellison often made brash promises to the marketplace and
media, Lane, during eight years as Oracle's president and chief
operating officer, forged strong bonds with customers and revamped
the company's overly aggressive sales practices, according to one
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Oracle has assessed what they lost in Ray
Lane,'' said Giga Information Group analyst Terilyn Palanca.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the mercurial Ellison unexpectedly reassigned
Lane's duties, from decisions about ``every PC the company bought,
to every person the company hired,'' Lane told The Chronicle in the
first published interview after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the interest of the company to distribute his
functions more broadly among up-and-coming senior managers,''
Ellison said in an interview at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lane resigned a newly minted billionaire by way of Oracle's
soaring stock and several weeks later said he would not seek
another executive post, though that hasn't stopped firms from
trying to recruit him.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after his break with Oracle, Lane said at least 50
firms called with offers of chief executive or director slots. Some
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Lane joined the board of Sheer Networks, a
Sunnyvale, Calif., firm that creates software to manage
telecommunications networks. In addition to Sheer Networks and
Oracle, Lane sits on the boards of Marimba, C-bridge Internet
Solutions and Software Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lane is the latest in a string of high-tech defectors to Kleiner
Perkins. John Doerr joined Kleiner from Intel Corp., Floyd Kvamme
came from Apple Computer Inc. and Thomas Jermoluk moved to the firm
from ExciteAtHome Corp. in May.
</P>
<P>
   William R. Hearst III, a board member of Hearst Corp., which
owns The Chronicle, is also a partner with Kleiner Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was founded in 1972, Kleiner Perkins has invested more
than $1.2 billion in more than 100 companies that have since sold
shares in initial public offerings. The firm has become one of the
most sought-after venture capitalists for young technology
companies.

 Computing Q&AMP;A: E-Books Aren't Quite Ready to Make a Move  &HT;     By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I've been hearing a lot about e-books. Exactly what are they,
anyway? Do I need special hardware or software to read them, and
what makes them different from any other document I can view on my
PC?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It's a good thing I don't charge by the question or you would be
in trouble. E-books _ or electronic books _ are actual books, like
novels, textbooks and classics, that have been digitized and
formatted in a way that makes them appear on a computer screen
exactly as they do in print. You can read e-books on a PC, but the
goal is to put them on portable devices like specially designed
handheld readers or personal digital assistants, so you can read
them while you are on a bus, train or plane.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, e-books are in their infancy. The primary software
formats for them are the Microsoft Reader and the Glassbook Reader.
Both are free downloads _ from  &LR; www.microsoft.com/reader &LR;  and
 &LR; www.glassbook.com &LR;  _ that you can load onto your PC or notebook
computer. The Microsoft reader also comes loaded on new Pocket PC
handheld computers from companies including Hewlett-Packard and
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   A few e-book devices also are available, including the $600
SoftBook Reader from SoftBook Press and the $269 Rocket eBook from
NuvoMedia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more titles are available for the Microsoft Reader than
for other formats. But it probably won't be long before most
e-books are released in all available formats. Right now, expect to
pay about the same price for an e-book that you would for a
discounted regular book.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot more information on e-books, go to
 &LR; www.barnesandnoble.com &LR;  or to  &LR; www.ipublish.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cleaning Up Temp Files
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have collected about 48 megabytes of temporary files on my
hard drive. Is it safe to delete them?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: In general, the answer is yes. Any file ending in ``.tmp'' is a
temporary file that your computer can live without very nicely.
Many programs create temporary files while you work.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, temporary files are automatically deleted
when you close a program or reboot your PC, but because it isn't a
perfect world, you will always have some temp files hanging around.
The first place to look for temporary files is in the TEMP folder
inside the Windows folder. You can also use the Find function in
the Windows Start menu to search for ``.tmp,'' which will reveal
the location of all your temp files.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; By the way, don't confuse temporary system files with
``temporary Internet files'' that Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web
browser stores on your disk. Those are useful, because they make it
possible to load Web pages faster. Netscape also uses such files,
but refers to them as ``cache'' files.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Loading MSN Messenger
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Do you need an Internet account with MSN to use its Messenger
service? If you do not have to be a subscriber, how do you go about
getting MSN Messenger?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Internet message services like MSN Messenger and America
Online's Instant Messenger are free to anyone, not just people who
get their Internet access via MSN and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, all you have to do is sign up online at
 &LR; www.msn.com &LR;  or  &LR; www.aol.com &LR; , and download a small software
program if it isn't already on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   You should bear in mind that MSN Messenger users can't
communicate with AOL Instant Messenger users. The two companies
hate each other too much to cooperate. So you may have to use both
services to keep in touch with all your friends.
</P>
<P>
   NICE WORDS FOR ATHOME: During the past couple of years, I have
taken a shot or two at AtHome, mostly because of the slow service I
have received when my Internet cable went down. Recently, however,
I had a really good experience. After rebuilding a PC, I called
AtHome for some help configuring the service with a new internal
network card. I got a tech support fellow on the phone right away,
and he walked me through the procedure in five minutes. Couldn't
have been easier.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: If you find yourself printing a lot of stuff _
draft versions of documents, notes or information from the
Internet, for example _ don't waste your money on expensive typing
paper. Instead, buy a box of copy machine or multi-use paper. For
less than $20, you should be able to get 10 reams _ that's 5,000
sheets.

 Clinton legal fund raises $8 million  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of President Clinton have raised $8
million to help pay his legal bills from investigations of
Whitewater, the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Clinton Legal Expense Trust gave their
semiannual update on the fund to reporters Wednesday, saying the
number of contributors is increasing as the end of Clinton's
presidency nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that the results of our efforts have been
steady over the past year,'' said Anthony F. Essaye, executive
director of the trust. Most of the money is raised by sending
letters to potential contributors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trust raised $950,000 in the first six months of this year
from about 16,000 contributors, an average of about $59 each. There
were 187 contributions from Missouri residents and 87 from Kansas,
none more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the television and movie industry gave to the
Clinton fund, including producer Norman Lear, $10,000, and director
Rob Reiner, $1,000. Other contributors of $1,000 included Clinton
friend Vernon E. Jordan, former senator and Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas, and Caroline
Kennedy's husband, Edwin A. Schlossberg of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months of 1999, the trust raised $800,000. The
goal is to pay as much of an estimated $11 million in legal
expenses as possible before Clinton leaves office Jan. 20. The
trust is expected to cease raising money at that time, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye said he could not gauge what the effect on fund raising
or legal bills would be as a result of last week's report that
independent counsel Robert Ray has called a grand jury to consider
indicting Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens there is beyond our control,'' Essaye said. ``Our
objective is to raise as much money as we can.'' So far the fund
has paid $6.5 million in legal expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $8 million has been raised since the trust was formed in
February 1998. Contributions are capped at $10,000 each and are
only taken from individuals. No lobbyists, corporations, or
executive branch employees may give.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have been
under investigation for most of the last eight years for their
Whitewater real estate dealings in Arkansas. Clinton was impeached
by the House in 1998 for alleged perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from the Jones and Lewinsky cases. The Senate acquitted
him.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics of Clinton said his legal troubles were his own
making, the fund-raising drive is a legitimate way for supporters
to help relieve the Clintons of legal bills they cannot afford to
pay, Essaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel there should be an opportunity for the public,
if they wish, to enable a first family to leave office without an
enormous financial burden incurred while they are serving the
country,'' Essaye said.

 All should be aware of e-policy  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day across America, workers are fired for using their
companies' computer systems as their personal electronic
playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical Co. confirmed earlier this week that it was letting
about 40 employees go because they allegedly violated corporate
e-mail policy. A routine review of company e-mail accounts in
Houston discovered the violations, described as violent or sexually
explicit content. Fifty others were fired earlier this year at Dow
headquarters in Michigan for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dow is hardly the only employer to come down hard. In June,
American Century Investments in Kansas City fired 16 workers who
were accused of violating user policies on its e-mail and Web-based
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically have a zero tolerance rule,'' said Chris Doyle,
American Century's director of corporate public relations. ``We
have clear-cut guidelines, and when we discovered what we felt were
violations during routine server maintenance, we acted swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   In case any corporate computer user has been sleeping through
the e-mail and Web explosion of the 1990s, here's the deal:
</P>
<P>
   Three out of four employers told the American Management
Association this year that they use electronic surveillance or
otherwise monitor their employees' Internet and e-mail use.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Irv Belzer, who advises clients on e-mail
policies, emphasizes that employers own the information on their
computer systems and have the right to review it. They also can and
do take disciplinary action when they find violations of use
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, companies need to make their policies known. There
should be no lack of awareness or confusion among workers. A union
official, speaking about the dismissed Dow workers, contended this
week that some were unaware of the company's policy and others
didn't take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Know it. Believe it. People lose jobs because of random checks,
routine maintenance and co-worker complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And remember: Hitting the delete key alone doesn't protect
users. Computer experts can find files that users think they've
deleted.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of pornography, dirty jokes, excessive Internet
surfing or e-mailing, and unauthorized distribution of proprietary
information have all led to pink slips.
</P>
<P>
   Every wired company should have a written policy that every
employee signs. At minimum, the e-policy should say:
</P>
<P>
   The company owns the system and has the right to monitor its
use.
</P>
<P>
   No employee should consider his or her messages or files to be
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the delete key does not remove material from the entire
system.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail and Web access should not be used to exchange messages or
view files that co-workers may consider pornographic, lewd,
harassing, exploitative or embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail and Web access should not be used to solicit,
proselytize, promote or engage in any non-job-related causes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the policy should clearly lay out the disciplinary
process that will follow the discovery of violations.

SPRINT PCS UNVEILS UPGRADES TO WIRELESS WEB SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Sprint PCS on Wednesday announced a series of
business-oriented upgrades to its Wireless Web service that speed
up Internet access and link mobile workers to corporate computer
networks through their wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Called Wireless Web for Business, the enhanced services include
a single price for unlimited wireless Internet access and a series
of network-based computer software applications that link workers
to corporate e-mail, sales and service records, corporate
directories and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The new service, scheduled to be available next month, is
expected to give Sprint a leg up on the competition for highly
sought wireless corporate customers. That market is expected to
grow 1,000 percent in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago, we led the industry with the nationwide launch
of Sprint PCS Wireless Web,'' said Ronald T. LeMay, interim
president of Sprint PCS. ``Since that time, our national business
accounts have grown 285 percent. Now we're excited to build on the
tremendous consumer success of the Wireless Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the service and some computer programs already used by
some large companies, mobile workers will be able to access
customer records and phone logs, send and receive company e-mail,
make airline travel reservations and do other tasks that usually
would have to wait until they were back in the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view of this is that it's a great day for the road
warrior,'' said Paul Reddick, vice president for Sprint PCS product
management and development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sprint is improving Internet speed by using
software that compresses data. Currently, the company offers
service that runs at about one-quarter the speed of a
56-kilobit-per-second modem. Using new software and compression,
the system gives users the equivalent of 56K service, Reddick said.
</P>
<P>
   The service also makes it easier for laptop computer users to
connect to the Internet using their Sprint PCS phones and Sprint's
Wireless Web service, Reddick said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, Sprint PCS is offering a new pricing
plan for wireless Internet service _ $40 a month for unlimited
wireless Internet access for mid- and high-use phone customers. The
existing $10-a-month plan that allows customers to use their
regular monthly voice minutes for Internet use will remain for
consumers and other business users, Reddick said.
</P>
<P>
   The new service is a result of partnerships with some big
software companies: Lotus, Siebel Systems, Sabre Holdings Corp. and
others.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless Internet market is expected to reach about 885,000
business users by the end of this year. The Yankee Group, a Boston
telecommunications research firm, is projecting that the market
will grow almost tenfold _ to 8.2 million business users _ by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer wireless Internet market is expected to grow even
faster _ although it doesn't generate as much high-usage revenue.
According to the Yankee Group, about 390,000 consumers now use
wireless Internet service. That number is expected to reach 9.5
million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless Internet market is still new, but corporations are
just about ready to dive in, said Roberta Wiggins, director of
wireless data research for the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless is moving up the line on the list of corporate
priorities,'' she said. ``They're very aware of the opportunities
and the benefits of connecting mobile workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving software to speed up access will help draw more
customers by improving the customer experience.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, Sprint PCS had about 7.9 million customers.
The company has projected 10 million customers by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock, listed on the New York Exchange as PCS,
closed Wednesday at $47.88 a share, down $1.13.

 Infestation of armyworms hits KC area  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN BORMANN, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Don't be too quick to blame the stifling
temperatures for your wilted lawn. There could be another culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Feasting in anonymity on area lawns, particularly on the Kansas
side, are billions of fall armyworms with a ravenous taste for
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Masses of the green or black worms are chomping across lawns and
leaving hundreds of homeowners with nothing but shriveled roots in
their wake, area experts say. And the infestation is slowly
creeping into Missouri turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are just devastating a lot of area lawns,'' said
Dennis Patton, Johnson County extension horticulture agent. ``We've
been inundated with calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton and many lawn care experts call it the worst destruction
they've ever seen from the armyworm, largely because the mild
winter and, until recently, the mild summer have provided ideal
breeding conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The worms, no longer than an inch and a half, not only can
destroy lawns, but they also shoot right off the yech scale.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of one Johnson County home told their lawn care
service that after a morning walk, their shoes were covered in
green goo. Another insisted her yard was blanketed with mucus.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most doting lawn owners are susceptible. In fact, the
worms have shown a highly selective appetite so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little worms may not be very high on the evolution
scale, but they certainly know where a good buffet is,'' Patton
said.
</P>
<P>
   That tidbit of information came too late for Becky Ross of
Lenexa, a Johnson County master gardener. Her landscaping has
graced the pages of national magazines, but come fall she will be
reseeding, just like many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a master gardener, but it didn't do me much good,'' Ross
said. ``I've never heard of armyworms before in my life. We've had
birds in our yard _ now I think I know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said she noticed dry patches in the yard but assumed it was
the intense heat browning the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Dead grass is all that many homeowners will notice, but with
close inspection on bended knee, they're likely to see masses of
the worms. If not, many homeowners may not discover the damage
until fall, when lawns typically recover from summer stress. It may
be too late by then, Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   There is good news, though. The worms can be easily killed with
an insecticide, and they are only expected to feed for another week
or two. At that point, they'll burrow into the ground and transform
into their pupate stage, similar to a cocoon, for the winter. Come
spring, the pupae will become moths. However, unless there's a
repeat of this year's weather, chances are armyworms won't be as
abundant next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike grubs, which eat roots, armyworms feed on the grass
blades and expose the critical base to the intense heat. As
temperatures soar this week, lawn-care experts think the damage is
likely to kill many area lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Patton said as many as 100 worms per square foot have been
reported in the Wichita area, where homeowners have been battling
the worms for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction hasn't reached that level yet in the Kansas City
area, but 75 percent of the customers at the Grass Pad in Leawood
are asking for pesticides that kill the aggressive worms, said
manager Corby Predmore.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for help are also continual at TruGreen ChemLawn
branches in Shawnee and Kansas City. Agency employees said they
even found a few of the worms eating their way across the Shawnee
property where the business moved a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, if not impossible, to predict and prevent such
outbreaks, Patton said. It wouldn't be reasonable to expect
agencies to treat for the armyworms in a typical year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting an insecticide on a month ago would not have helped a
week ago,'' he said. ``Things just happen and for some reason,
bingo, we got it this year.''

PRICE CANDY CO.'S REMAINING ASSETS SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES, THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ Price Candy Co., a local institution for 87 years,
has melted into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Richmond factory and its assets were auctioned off
last week to pay off delinquent loans to Commerce Bank of Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce foreclosed on the factory in late April. Price Candy
closed its office and distribution center in Hunt Midwest
SubTropolis the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Among the assets auctioned off were Price Candy's trademarks,
real estate, inventory, packaging equipment and kitchen equipment.
An official with the auction company, Rabin Brothers of San
Francisco, called it ``a very good sale,'' although he was unable
to say how much the sale yielded.
</P>
<P>
   The sale marked the demise of a company founded by Charles Price
in 1913 in the old Jones Store building downtown. The company was
later owned by Price's son, Charles Price II, who became the U.S.
ambassador to the Court of St. James's in London during the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Price II was out of town this week and not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Price Candy went through a succession of owners in the past two
decades, remaining modestly profitable until the late 1990s. In
1982, Charles Price II sold it to a company run by Minnesota Twins
owner Carl Pohlad. Eight years later, Pohlad sold it to
Glico-Harmony Foods Corp. of Santa Cruz, Calif., a subsidiary of
Japanese confectioner Ezaki Glico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Glico-Harmony sold Price Candy to four New York
investors involved in the food industry. The four sought to change
Price Candy's marketing strategy, with apparently disastrous
results.
</P>
<P>
   Previously a small, boxed-chocolate manufacturer with sales
around $20 million, Price Candy under its new owners sought to
compete in the mass market and began distributing other
confectioners' products. The mass merchandising effort failed, and
starting two years ago the company began hemorrhaging red ink.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, Price Candy employed 150 workers at area
facilities. The company also had sales representatives in Chicago
and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The company made candy under three brand names: Price's Fine
Chocolates, Blum's of San Francisco and The House of Bauer. It was
also the exclusive importer and distributor of the Les Cygnes line
of Belgian chocolates and a distributor of the Guylian line of
Belgian chocolate shells.

LEITER GIVES WEARY METS JUST WHAT THEY NEED
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When the New York Mets lost by 15 runs on Tuesday
and had to summon an outfielder to pitch, they knew their bullpen
would be depleted the next day. Speaking after that game, Al Leiter
seemed puzzled when asked if he would have to pitch any
differently, to conserve pitches to last deep into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's expression seemed to ask if his questioner had noticed
what he has done all year. Leiter, the Mets left-hander, has been
consistently durable and effective; of course he would not deviate
from that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter worked eight innings in a 4-1 victory over the San Diego
Padres, allowing three hits and one run and matching a season high
with 12 strikeouts. When the Qualcomm Stadium public-address system
played The Cars' ``Just What I Needed'' in the seventh inning, it
seemed an appropriate anthem for what Leiter had given the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter improved to 14-5, and he lasted long enough that the Mets
had to use only one reliever, Armando Benitez, who recorded his
34th save. The Mets have an off-day Thursday, and they should have
a completely rested bullpen when they begin a three-game series
with the Arizona Diamondbacks at Shea Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Leiter's first seven pitches was a strike, and the
eighth, to Damian Jackson, wound up over the fence in left-center
for a home run. The bases were empty when he hit it, because Leiter
had picked off the leadoff hitter, Eric Owens, after walking him.
Leiter has nine pickoffs, tied with Arizona's Brian Anderson for
the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Jackson's home run, Leiter set down the next 14 Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were thin in the bullpen after Tuesday's 16-1 loss,
which robbed them of their dignity _ outfielder Derek Bell gave up
the final five runs _ and their bullpen depth. They considered
promoting a pitcher as protection against a short start by Leiter,
but they have only one reserve with options, Joe McEwing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Mets sent McEwing down, they could not have brought him
back for 10 days. ``McEwing is a pretty important part of the
group,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said, but he added,
``Hopefully, I won't regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not. In Leiter, the Mets had the right pitcher to give
a lengthy outing. Leiter is third in the National League in pitches
per start, averaging 112, and he is having a season that rivals
that of any other pitcher in the league besides Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If only Leiter could hit. He is batting .063, and twice he came
up with the bases loaded. In the fourth, he came up after Mike
Bordick grounded a single under the glove of the diving third
baseman, Phil Nevin, to drive in the Mets' first run. Had Leiter
simply struck out, Lenny Harris would have come up. But Leiter
bounced into a double play, ending the inning and keeping the score
tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had started to get to Matt Clement, the 26-year-old
right-hander who had baffled them twice this year. They went down
in the fifth, one-two-three, but two of those outs came on
highlight-worthy catches by Padres outfielders. And if the Mets
were not hitting Clement, they were laying off his sharp breaking
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Mike Piazza and Darryl Hamilton drew leadoff
walks. After an out, Benny Agbayani singled to load the bases, then
Clement hit Bordick, the second batter he hit with a pitch in the
game. The go-ahead run scored, and Leiter came up, chopping a bunt
back to Clement, who flipped home for a forceout. Catcher Wiki
Gonzalez threw to first and nearly doubled up Leiter, but the throw
hit Leiter and another run scored.
</P>
<P>
   Harris singled in another run, putting the Mets ahead, 4-1, and
Carlos Almanzar came in for Clement. He retired Bell on a pop-up,
ending the inning and extending a lengthy slump by Bell. In 50
at-bats since his dramatic, game-tying homer at Houston on Aug. 7,
Bell has five hits, a .100 average.

`SURVIVOR': DOG-EAT-DOG REALITY, BUT MUST-SEE TV
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS first 6 grafs for rewriting)  
 By CARYN JAMES  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last summer's cheery television phenomenon, ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' has been displaced this summer by a
hit with a more scheming world view. ``Millionaire'' is the
feel-good game show that says we're a happy country pulling
together, but ``Survivor'' sends a countermessage: Trust no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' put 16 people on an island and forced the group to
vote members off one by one, until last night's finale, when the
sole survivor won a million dollars. The strongest contestants
endure by banding together, but in the end were forced to vote
against one another. The island was a microcosm of dog-eat-dog
competition, staged at a safe distance. Just as murder mysteries
transform our fear of death into a playful entertainment,
``Survivor'' turns the competitive nightmare of contemporary life
into a benign game.
</P>
<P>
   The hype surrounding the show has generally glossed over the
deeper reasons for its success, but the fact that Richard Hatch
survived to win the million dollars at the end of Wednesday night's
finale speaks directly to why the series has touched a chord. He
coldbloodedly strategized from the start. It's no accident that he
was always identified as a corporate trainer, almost the embodiment
of cutthroat maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   As two finalists faced a jury of those they had cast off, one
said she was not so much for Richard as against Kelly Wiglesworth,
the runner-up and a former ally who had turned against her. Richard
was a snake, she said, but Kelly was a rat. Kelly herself had asked
in an aside to the camera in the final weeks, ``How do you stay
true to yourself and maintain integrity and still play this game?''
She answered her own question: ``You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The standard line about ``Survivor'' has been: It is a reality
game show featuring ordinary people, plus one scheming villain to
hiss at. But that is entirely backward. ``Survivor'' is as remote
from reality as its setting, Pulau Tiga (likely translation: Island
of the Product Placements) and as meticulously structured as a
novel by Agatha Christie (whose ``Ten Little Indians'' plot it
brilliantly mimics). And though its characters may be genuine to
their family and friends, to the average viewer they are as real as
Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   That visceral response to Richard's conniving wouldn't have
materialized if the show didn't work as pure entertainment. Even
the best orchestrated hype (which CBS had) isn't enough to account
for the endless chattering among viewers. ``Survivor'' drew a
gigantic audience with a combination of sports challenges and the
suspense of who gets kicked off the island: Agatha Christie goes to
the Olympics. (The island itself was as realistic and as hokey as a
haunted house.)
</P>
<P>
   And each episode was edited into a swift hour. ``Survivor''
never spent more than a few seconds watching someone eat rice.
``Elapsed time: 4 hours 11 minutes'' flashed on the screen after
the minutes spent in Wednesday night's contest about who could
stand the longest with a hand on a totem pole. Take away ruthless
editing, and you end up watching people feed the chickens, as they
have on CBS's tiresome ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   That totem pole contest, an ``immunity challenge,'' was part of
this game's most wickedly unpredictable feature. In each episode
one person won a contest and could not be voted out in that round;
so-called immunity was the wild card that made every rational
prediction moot. Kelly would have been gone weeks ago, but she won
four immunity challenges in a row to become one of the final two
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But only part of the series' constantly growing ratings came
from the suspense. The show got progressively more gripping as it
became progressively more psychological. What started out as a
sporting challenge (build a hut, eat a rat) turned into a
tantalizing mind game, driven largely by Rich.
</P>
<P>
   The truest voyeurism, after all, is looking into someone else's
thoughts, and that is what truly drove ``Survivor.'' The most
compelling moments were those in which the contestants spoke
directly to the camera, confidentially to us, letting us into the
secrets of their sometimes backbiting strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode Colleen sits in a tree, looks sweetly into the
camera and says she'll vote Richard off the island because he's too
bossy. (What an innocent.) In a later episode Richard, the supposed
villain, looks into the camera and says coolly, ominously of
Gretchen, ``She has to go because she is bright and is strong, and
she is a threat.'' Gretchen is gone that night. The message about
who wins in life is unmistakable. Of course the editors knew the
winner in advance: They clearly edited to focus on Rich and make
him the audience-drawing villain.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers selected these contestants shrewdly, to
cover the social spectrum, from Sean, a neurologist, to Susan, a
truck driver so tough her husband boasted in an interview, ``She's
a man in a woman's body.'' It was a dazzling stroke to bring the
contestants videos from home a few weeks ago. Viewers saw Gervase's
daughter toddling toward the camera and watched Jenna, the mother
of twin girls, cry when she heard her video had not arrived. Those
humanizing moments were the equivalent of up-close-and-personal
profiles of sports stars.
</P>
<P>
   We do not actually know these people any better than we know the
latest celebrity interviewed on ``Entertainment Tonight,'' of
course. The irony is that the success of ``Survivor'' has made
these real people less real to us, as they have taken on the
flattened images of celebrities. (And their post-``Survivor''
show-business plans are just starting.) Richard had already
achieved a measure of fame. Say ``the naked fat guy,'' and everyone
knows who you mean. And admit it: You secretly like him. That may
be the biggest, most revealing ``Survivor'' secret of all.

M'S FOLLOW RHODES TO RUIN AGAINST TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Apparently, there are still a few bugs in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Far from Tuesday's victory putting to rest whatever it is that
ails the Mariners, the club came out Wednesday night and showed
that the dog days of August are still barking up a storm.
</P>
<P>
   The night started with hordes of flying ants, then smaller
gnats, swarming the field and sending the fans at Comerica Park
running for cover. The night ended, for all practical purposes, in
the seventh inning, when the Tigers' offense swarmed the Mariners'
bullpen, every bit as pesky and every bit as nasty as the bugs of
sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes, the most reliable of the Mariners' relievers, was
dissected with precision once again by the Tigers. This time
Detroit got four consecutive hits off him, including a game-tying
triple by Juan Encarnacion that swung the momentum of the game
firmly in the Tigers' direction.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 6-5 Tigers win and Seattle's ninth loss in 10
games. Things seemed to have regained some level of normalcy for
the Mariners when starter Paul Abbott pitched six strong innings as
a follow-up to Tuesday's 8-4 Seattle win. But Rhodes' implosion
changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it Rhodes?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all my fault, not Arthur's,'' catcher Dan Wilson
said. ``He had good stuff. It's my job to call the pitches. It was
bad pitch selection on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Fastballs are Rhodes' stock in trade, and fastballs are what
Wilson asked for. With the fastball crackling, Rhodes got ahead of
three of the four batters he faced with two quick strikes. Getting
that third strike _ or anything else resembling an out _ didn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   So while the rest of his teammates were getting a bite to eat or
grabbing a shower, Wilson sat slumped in front of his locker in
game gray pants and a sweat-soaked, dark blue T-shirt. Based on
body language, you would have thought a pitch Wilson called for
cost the Mariners the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was all my fault,'' Wilson repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. As is the case with the Mariners' 70 wins this season,
it is a shared experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this whole 1-9 stretch is that we've hung
together,'' Abbott said. ``We've won with 25 guys, and we've lost
with 25 guys. Tonight we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Mariners lost was no reflection on Abbott, who carried
a 4-1 lead into the seventh inning. But Deivi Cruz doubled and took
third on a Brad Ausmus fly ball. That's when manager Lou Piniella
motioned for Rhodes, who had been ineffective in two recent games
against the Tigers. Wednesday night, he took ineffective to a new
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes got two strikes against Jose Macias, who then ripped an
RBI single on a 1-2 pitch. Wendell Magee singled and, after falling
behind 0-2, Encarnacion tripled, tying the game. Bobby Higginson
singled, giving the Tigers their first lead of the game. Later,
Jose Mesa would surrender a sacrifice fly that capped the five-run
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be frustrated?'' Rhodes said. ``I've been
throwing good all year. I've been effective all year. I threw some
good pitches tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``''I wasn't out of my pattern. I was going with my catcher
(Wilson). I can't be frustrated because of one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rhodes predicted a long night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one won't go away quickly,'' he said. ``This one will eat
at me all night, until tomorrow morning until I wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   One could guess that Wilson would feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Rhodes) got to 0-2 a lot,'' the manager said. ``He just
didn't put the hitters away.''
</P>
<P>
   But at one level, at least, Wilson said this loss was different
from any of the eight that comprised the losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't like any of those,'' Rhodes said. ``It was a
completely different feeling. We played well tonight. We just lost.
And that's a totally different feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, no different on the scoreboard. The Mariners
lost a chance to gain a game on Oakland, a 7-5 loser at Cleveland.
And giving away an opportunity to put ground between themselves and
Oakland gnawed at the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Even Abbott, who would have been justified at being upset at
seeing a win slip away from him, wasn't thinking along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being completely honest here,'' he said. ``I would have
been just as happy if we'd come back and won the game. That would
have been great with me, even if it means I don't get the win.
Oakland lost, and we had a chance to put some ground between us and
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Edgar Martinez was on the same wavelength. He
set a new career high with his 30th homer, a solo shot in the third
inning, but it seemed to mean little to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anyone in this clubhouse that is thinking about
personal numbers now,'' Martinez said. ``The statistics don't
count.''
</P>
<P>
   One statistic does _ wins. And that statistic has been
frustratingly elusive for the Mariners of late.

KOCHER'S INJURY COULD BE COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ken Kocher, the 311-pound anchor of the defensive
line, sprained his left ankle in practice Tuesday and it took less
than 24 hours for the Bruins to feel his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher, on crutches with his leg in a walking boot, was
conspicuous by his absence during Wednesday's scrimmage at the Rose
Bowl. The Bruins' second-team offense caved in defensive tackles
Rodney Leisle and Anthony Fletcher, creating huge holes for
third-string tailback Akil Harris, as it marched easily down the
field in its only crack at the first-team unit.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how much it will hurt if Kocher is on the sidelines in
the season opener against No. 3-ranked Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   While Kocher is holding out hope of playing against the Crimson
Tide in 10 days, coach Bob Toledo expects him to be out from two to
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he finds a faith healer he may play,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher might not be the only person who needs one.
</P>
<P>
   The junior is one of the best defensive tackles in the
conference and was certain to draw double teams. Now, Fletcher and
Leisle, who were sharing the other tackle spot, are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out Saturday how they get moved out,'' Toledo said
of Fletcher and Leisle, who will be backed up by Steve Morgan and
Sean Phillips. ``There's a reason why (Kocher) is first string. The
second string guys have to pick it up, but any time you lose key
people, it's going to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kocher said the injury occurred on the final play of practice
Tuesday when a teammate rolled on his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it sort of pop,'' he said. ``I tried to walk it off.
I'm not ruling out playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-a-days done: The two-hour scrimmage, which didn't pit the
first- team units against one another, concluded two-a-day
practices and the Bruins will now begin to prepare in earnest for
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the second-team defense gave up fewer big plays than in
Saturday's scrimmage at Drake Stadium was an encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage was held at the Rose Bowl to help the Bruins get
ready for the season opener. They worked on substitution
situations, the two-minute drill, kicking and punting, and had
coaches stationed in the press box and the sideline. The only thing
missing was the crowd and the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody in the stands,'' Toledo said. ``They're sore,
beat up, tired, their legs aren't there and they're thinking about
moving out of the dorms today. I think we're ahead of last year,
but we've got a ways to go. How much better we'll be I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Also missing from the first-team defense were end
Rusty Williams (thigh) and linebacker Ryan Nece (shoulder), the
latter participating in non-tackling situations. Tight end Gabe
Crecion (thigh) and receiver Brian Poli-Dixon (thigh) also saw
limited action.
</P>
<P>
   Bama names Zow: Alabama coach Mike DuBose announced that
incumbent Andrew Zow has won the starting quarterback job. However,
both Zow, a junior, and sophomore Tyler Watts will play against
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Williams returning?: Cornerback Julius Williams, who flunked out
of school this summer, said he will take extension classes this
fall and hopes to re-enroll in school for the winter quarter and
rejoin the team next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put myself and the team in an awkward situation,'' said
Williams, a junior who was expected to back up Jason Bell. ``I
messed up. I just feel bad that I put the team in a bad
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams must re-apply for admission. If he's accepted to
school, Toledo said he would consider accepting Williams back on
the team but noted that Williams ``dug himself a deep hole''
academically.

BROWN LOOKS LIKE GOLD FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For six innings Wednesday night, Kevin Brown made
Los Angeles Dodgers fans forget where they were.
</P>
<P>
   On a cool August night in a season that is slipping away, Brown
had everyone on their feet believing when he retired the first 18
batters he faced in a 5-1 victory over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the ace who has struggled the past month like the rest of
the team, shook off getting hit on the right index finger on a bunt
attempt in the fifth inning and looked like he might, just might,
throw the Dodger's first perfect game since Sandy Koufax 35 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it was going to happen with the way he was
rolling,'' second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. ``It would have
been great for all of us with how badly everything has gone this
year. It would have been something to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the victory, the Dodgers remain eight games back in
the National League West with 37 to play. But on this night, all
that mattered was Brown (11-5) did not allow a batter to reach base
until former Dodgers farmhand Peter Bergeron opened the seventh
with a sharp liner off the glove of third baseman Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to go out there and get a hit,'' Bergeron
said. ``Everyone knew he had a no-hitter. He was going right after
people, throwing strikes and getting ground balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos went on to score after doubles by Jose Vidro and Lee
Stevens, but it didn't stop the crowd of 31,337 from a standing
ovation. Brown, who pitched a no-hitter in 1997 at San Francisco
when he played for the Florida Marlins, left after allowing the
first two batters to reach base in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in the game, but my finger had started to
swell up the past few innings,'' said Brown, who had not won in
five starts. ``But I'm not going to blame that. You just go out
there every game trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The result Wednesday was eye popping, but Brown's catcher said
nothing surprises him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who could throw a no-hitter every time he
goes out,'' catcher Todd Hundley said of Brown. ``I've never caught
a no-hitter. I went 8 three times, with David Cone, Bret Saberhagen
and Frank Tanana. It would have taken a spectacular play by Beltre
to catch that ball. But that is the kind of play you need to have a
no-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Dodgers got all the runs they needed in the
fourth off right-hander Mark Thurman (3-4), who actually retired
the first 10 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three times in the fourth and two unearned
runs in the fifth after a throwing error by Thurman. But it was
Thurman's pitch that inning that struck Brown on the right hand
that almost ended the no hitter.
</P>
<P>
   On the same play back in May against the Mets, Brown suffered a
fractured right pinkie and spent two weeks on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who underwent surgery on his left
rotator cuff Tuesday, rushed to Brown behind home plate. But Brown
remained in the game and walked to first to begin another rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared because of what had happened before,'' Brown
said. ``It turned out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If fans thought they saw this game before, they were right. Only
the names and uniforms have been changed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, 1998, Brown, then a member of the San Diego Padres,
threw six perfect innings against the Dodgers at Qualcomm Stadium.
Eric Young then opened the seventh by reaching on an error,
Trenidad Hubbard walked and Eric Karros reached on an infield
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wound up scoring four runs, two each on RBI singles
by Bobby Bonilla and Grudzielanek. Brown retired the final seven
batters, but lost 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the game-winning hit in that game didn't I?''
Grudzielanek said. ``When Brownie is pitching like he did tonight,
he is the only one you remember.''

GALAXY BURNED BY FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. _ Those who missed the final episode of the
hit show ``Survivor' to attend Wednesday's U.S. Open Cup semifinal
between the Los Angeles Galaxy and Chicago Fire witnessed two of
the best teams in MLS provide enough drama for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   It had everything but a good ending for the Galaxy. With a cozy
7,124 packed inside Cal State Fullerton stadium, the Fire outlasted
the Galaxy after Josh Wolff scored in the 112th minute of the
second sudden-death overtime to beat the Galaxy 2-1. It was L.A.'s
second loss to the Fire in five days.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Chicago advances to the Sept. 22 Open Cup final
against either New York/New Jersey or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It was another heartbreaking loss for the Galaxy, which had a
late 1-0 lead and a man-advantage since the 51st minute after
Carlos Bocanegra was tossed for throwing Luis Hernandez to the
turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for losing that game,'' Galaxy defender
Greg Vanney said. ``We were up a man and a goal with 10 minutes to
play. It's almost a joke we let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 yellow cards in all and seven for the Galaxy in a
rough-but-spirited end-to-end match that could have gone either
way. But in the end it's the same old story for the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   All L.A. can do now is turn its attention to the MLS playoffs,
which start next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy took control in the 78th minute. Mauricio Cienfuegos
sent a cross to Hernandez, who chested it in front for Cobi Jones.
Barely ahead of the trap, Jones finished from seven yards out to
put L.A. ahead 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough. Vanney miss-timed a slide tackle, leaving Fire
striker Ante Razov alone in front of the Galaxy's net. The former
Galaxy forward took advantage, beating Matt Reis to the far post to
even the match at 1-1 in the 85th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility for us even going to overtime,'' Vanney
said. ``He should have never got behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the loss left the Galaxy even hungrier and hoping
it can meet Chicago in the first round of the playoffs, which is a
strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt we can beat this team or that
we should beat this team,'' Vanney continued. ``I hope we do see
each other in the playoffs. I think we're the two best teams in the
West and we definitely have something to prove against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire coach Bob Bradley admitted that these two teams bring out
the best in each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of respect between both teams,'' said Bradley.
``We've had good games with the Galaxy since we've been in the
league. Tonight there was incredible heart and determination on
both sides. But I give my team a lot of credit, they played their
guts out with 10 guys and they were rewarded by going to the
final.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening half, Vanney sent a ball deep in the box for
Sasha Victorine in the 26th minute. Victorine tried to head the
ball back for Luis Hernandez, but Thornton stepped in and
intercepted the short cross.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Jones sent a ball behind Chicago's defense for
Hernandez - barely ahead of the Fire's trap, but Thornton deflected
his shot away.
</P>
<P>
   Fire midfielder Hristo Stoitchkov nearly caught Galaxy
goalkeeper Matt Reis by surprise, drilling a 30-yard shot inches
over the left crossbar in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those first-half chances, neither team could do much.
Fire defenders Bocanegra and C.J. Brown did a good job containing
and pushing Victorine and Hernandez away from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Razov, who had three breakaways in the first half Saturday
against the Galaxy in Chicago, was a non-factor in the opening
half, marked tightly by Robin Fraser and Califf.

USC HOPES IT HAS THE ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC flies to New Jersey today, with 17 days of
football practice behind it, but on the eve of the Trojans' season
opener against Penn State, there still seem to be nearly as many
questions as when they opened training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the Trojans are drawing plenty of praise,
certainly enough to warrant being ranked 15th in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Carson Palmer is back. Tailback Sultan McCullough
gained 154 yards in a scrimmage last week. Wide receiver Kareem
Kelly has continued where he left off as the Pacific-10 Freshman of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, with nine starters returning, is formidable at
nearly every position. Along the defensive line, there's a healthy
Ennis Davis for the first time in two years. Linebackers Zeke
Moreno and Markus Steele are poised for dominating seasons. And the
secondary, despite missing Antuan Simmons, will have plenty of
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But what do the sum of all these better-than-average parts add
up to?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that not even USC coaches can answer, and one
reason the Trojans are so eager to start their season in the
Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things we need to find out. What's the
chemistry of this team when it gets behind? Or when they get ahead
by 21 points?'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``After the first two
or three games, we'll get a better feeling for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   At least USC will know more Sunday night than it did a year ago
at this time. Its 62-7 victory over Hawaii only raised expectations
for what turned out to be a disappointing 6-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we beat Hawaii last year, it was not the measure of us as
a team,'' Hackett said. ``We'll know (this year) after two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not stopping the preseason publications from going crazy,
with one already proclaiming USC will finish 12-0. As ridiculous as
that sounds, you could make an equally strong case that even with a
relatively easy schedule, a couple slip-ups and the Trojans are 8-4
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how many really thought they would be 6-6 last season?
Palmer's broken collarbone aside, USC blew a pair of 21-point leads
that helped send the season into a spiral.
</P>
<P>
   So here are the main concerns as the Trojans prepare to meet the
Nittany Lions on national television?
</P>
<P>
   1. Do they have a kicker? Has this glaring weakness been fixed?
Uh, maybe. Who knows? Junior David Newbury won the job, but he was
only 11 of 20 last season, and has had good-and-bad moments in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hackett believes Newbury has improved, there will be
lots of nervous expressions on the USC sideline when Newbury lines
up for his first field goal against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure he doesn't lose confidence early, don't expect
any 53-yard attempts in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   2. Can they run?: The coaching staff has been heartened by
McCullough's improvement, but like Newbury, it's only a hunch until
the season starts. There's also legitimate questions about whether
the other tailbacks - Malaefou MacKenzie, Petros Papadakis - will
remain injury free.
</P>
<P>
   3. Can they stop the run? This wasn't supposed to be a question
mark, with an experienced defense, but last week's shaky moments in
the scrimmage have made this a slightly worrisome issue.
</P>
<P>
   4. Are the Trojans mentally tough? Last year, USC blew a pair of
21-point leads, the third time that has happened in two seasons
under Hackett. With Palmer healthy, and a veteran leadership, it
shouldn't happen this season. But that's what everyone thought last
year.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. Players have been on the same page during
training camp, without the usual ego problems that have been
present in previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in training camp was amazing in terms of intensity
and focus,'' Palmer said. ``It really surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Has the offensive line improved? This has been a problem area
for four years running, but is supposed to better this year. As
long as you erase the six false starts in the first scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, the Trojans seem solid at nearly every
position, without a true weak link. Left guard Zach Wilson could
become a dominant player, and it eased some concerns that Faasea
Mailo nailed down the right tackle spot, because he started several
games there in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else concerning this team, however, none of it
will really make a difference until the team starts performing at a
high level in an actual game.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the coaches are just hoping that the signs of
improvement they think they saw in training camp will actually
translate into success on the field. Or at least a well-fought
effort against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what's important is to play well,'' Hackett said. ``We
need to set the standard for our season.''

AILING SHEFFIELD TO SERVE SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield, sidelined a second day with flu
symptoms, decided to drop the appeal on the five-game suspension
for his involvement in the May 16 brawl at Chicago's Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, so ill that doctors advised him to stay home
Wednesday, probably wouldn't have played today in the series finale
against Montreal. So with a doubleheader Friday in Chicago,
Sheffield can be back in the lineup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, second to the Cubs' Sammy Sosa with 40 home runs, was
scheduled to have his appeal heard Monday in Milwaukee by
commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a doctor so I don't know how long he would have been
out,'' Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``But
we need to head into September without this situation still
lingering. We have (37) games left and we need to start winning
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday, Sheffield had missed six games this season.
Tuesday's 14-6 victory over Montreal was the Dodgers' first win
without him. Sheffield's condition has improved, but Malone called
his agent Jim Neader to discuss having Sheffield serve his
suspension. The agent agreed and the appeal was dropped. Tom
Goodwin started in left Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's official: Ben Diggins, the hard-throwing University of
Arizona right-hander selected 17th overall by the Dodgers in last
June's draft, said he is glad to be signed after more than two
months of negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was pretty worried,'' said Diggins, who agreed to a
$2.2 million signing bonus. ``I had been drafted by St. Louis as a
sandwich pick and didn't sign. She thought I was going to get
blackballed if I didn't sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7, 240-pound Diggins was 10-4 with a 3.83 ERA in 17
games last season for the Wildcats. He began to tire in the second
half of the season and has not pitched since May. He will be
limited to throwing on the side at Class-A San Bernardino until the
instructional league begins in early October in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On the DL: The Dodgers bench got whacked pretty hard Tuesday
when shortstop Kevin Elster and F.P. Santangelo were placed on the
15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Elster went on the DL with a strained left
hamstring. The usually sure-handed Elster has made five errors in
the past month that led to six unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   To take his place on the roster, right-hander Mike Judd has been
called up from Triple-A Albuquerque. Judd made one start for the
Dodgers on July 14 and lost to Pittsburgh. Manager Davey Johnson
said the move was made as insurance for Friday's doubleheader in
Chicago. Erratic left-hander Carlos Perez will start the second
game after pitching in relief the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo injured the ulnar ligament in his left thumb diving
for a ball Tuesday night. He will have his hand in a cast for two
weeks and spend a third week doing rehab.

LASORDA'S MOTIVATIONAL SKILLS WILL BE KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Tom Lasorda was selected manager of the USA
Olympic baseball team, his motivational skills and ability to spark
public interest were said to be as valuable as his knowledge of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Those skills will come in handy now that Lasorda knows who he
will have playing for him next month in Sydney. The 28-man Olympic
roster was announced Wednesday with the 24-man active roster to be
determined before the team departs in September.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. is to bring home its first official gold in the
sport, it will have to overcome perennial power Cuba and
professional all-stars from Japan and Korea while using a group of
minor-league veterans and raw prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was already practicing how to sell the team without
speaking about its talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that we're gonna take a team over there that's going to
be exciting,'' he said. ``A team that's going to be representing
our country in the highest degree of class, dignity and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team that's gonna put forth all the effort and all the drive
that they have within `em. I believe it's going to be an exciting
Olympics for the United States baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee opted not to use any of the recently
retired major-leaguers such as Tim Raines, who had shown interest
in playing. However, the team has its share of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Pat Border, who was the MVP of the 1992 World Series
with the Toronto Blue Jays, is the team's oldest player at 37. He
has spent this season with Tampa Bay's Triple-A affiliate Durham
and is batting .276 with 12 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers outfielder Shawn Gilbert, 35, is another of the 12
players who have major-league experience, although he has spent
most of this season at Triple-A Albuqurque.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Travis Dawkins of the Reds organization, catcher
Marcus Jensen (Twins), outfielder Mike Neill (Mariners), Bobby Seay
(Devil Rays) and right-handed reliever Todd Williams (Reds) join
Gilbert as returning members from the 1999 Pan Am Games team that
finished second to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Pan Am team, the first U.S. baseball team to use
professionals, this team isn't expected to have much power hitting.
Outfielder Ernie Young, who is with Memphis of the St. Louis
Cardinals organization, has 30 home runs each of the past two years
at the Triple-A level, but the USA is looking for other ways to
win.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff features six pitchers who consistently throw
in the 90s, led by left-hander C.C. Sabathina, who is playing with
Akron of the Indians' organization, and right-handed reliever Shane
Heams from Toledo of the Tigers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Being limited to players who wouldn't be called up to the majors
when rosters are expanded in September left top minor-leaguers off
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Patterson, a 21-year-old center fielder who was the third
pick overall in the 1998 draft, was one such player. The Cubs
declined Patterson's invitation with the intention of promoting him
after his season ends at Double-A West Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the U.S. will count on rising stars such as Sean
Burroughs, the 20-year-old former Little League world champion from
Long Beach who is with the Padres Double-A affiliate Mobile.

PALMEIRO EXCELS AS ERSTAD REPLACEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Darin Erstad was not in the starting lineup Wednesday
for the fourth consecutive game because of a muscle strain in his
left ribcage. But Erstad, who took batting practice Wednesday for
the first time since the injury, is expected to return to the
lineup Friday in Anaheim when the club opens a series against the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia calls Erstad not only the most-important
hitter in his lineup, but the MVP of the league. However, the
Angels haven't missed him as badly as one might have thought. Going
into Wednesday's game, the Anaheim Angels were 2-1 without him.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro has started all four games, hitting leadoff and
playing left field, normally Erstad's spots. In the first three
games, Palmeiro went 6 for 13 and made one diving catch,
impressing, among others, Erstad himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tip my hat to him,'' Erstad said. ``I've always said he
could play every day anyway. I played along side him in Triple-A
and I know what he's capable of. It's hard to put value on who's
the MVP of the team. But to me, he's of the most valuable guys we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Palmeiro is hitting .321, having started 18
games in left field, 16 games in right and 14 as the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have guys injured, if I can alleviate the pressure of
guys returning earlier than they should, that's the satisfaction I
get,'' Palmeiro said. ``I want to let him know he doesn't have to
rush back.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's on-base percentage of .407 is equal to Erstad's and
behind only Tim Salmon's .408 on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our microwave,'' Scioscia said. ``Instant offense. He
gets on base and sets the table. He's a big asset not only because
of his defensive versatility but his offensive versatility. We can
use him one or two in the order, or eight or nine. He always puts
the ball in play. He's been great in any role we've put him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest decision: General manager Bill Stoneman talked to the
commissioner's office Wednesday and was told the decision on the
club's protest of Monday's game will be made either today or
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If by remote chance the Angels' protest is upheld, the next
order of business would be to determine when to play the game. Both
teams have an off-day Aug. 31, but if the Red Sox were to play that
day, it would exceed the league rule of playing more than 20
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   However, the labor agreement allows the players of the team
involved to vote on whether or not they would agree to exceed the
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Percival pain-free: Closer Troy Percival felt no pain and had
good velocity on his fastball in a rehab start for Single-A Lake
Elsinore on Tuesday night, and will make another rehab appearance
tonight for Lake Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, out since Aug.5 with an inflamed nerve in his right
elbow, is still struggling with his command, but is expected to be
activated Friday or Saturday. However, once he does come back,
Scioscia likely will ease Percival back into the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how he comes out of it, where he is,'' Scioscia
said. ``We have the option to put him back in an inning, but we can
afford to let him work his bugs out. The important thing is none of
the symptoms he had before, the numbness in his fingers and hands,
are there any more.''

DESPITE VAUGHN, ANGELS END TRIP WITH LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mo Vaughn hit his first home run in Fenway Park since
he left after the 1998 season, but it was the only run the Anaheim
Angels could muster against five Boston Red Sox pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 3-1 Angels loss Wednesday in the final game of
a nine-game East Coast road trip.
</P>
<P>
   The evening started with a three-hour, one-minute rain delay and
finished with the loss that left the Angels at 4-5 on the trip. But
they remain in a pennant race, trailing the American League
West-leading Mariners by 5 games and the wild card-leading Indians
by 3 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back at the road trip as a block of games,''
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Tonight we had a chance to win
the ballgame and we didn't get it done. Historically, going back
East we know we're in for some tough ballgames. We played three
tough teams and those teams don't give an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we went one game under .500, but we know one
twist or turn and it could have been better.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn went 5 for 13 in the series and had three of the Angels'
eight hits Wednesday. They had chances, but went 0 for 5 with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of opportunities to score and couldn't get the
key hit,'' Scioscia said. ``And obviously, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Red Sox runs came in on two-out hits, but they didn't
score after the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of offense spoiled a solid outing by starter Ramon
Ortiz (4-4). Ortiz gave up three runs and five hits in 7 innings,
the fourth time in his past five starts he has pitched at least
seven innings. But he still is being watched by Scioscia and
pitching coach Bud Black.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz can get overly excited, which often works against him. He
gets fidgety on the mound, reflected by his four balks, second most
in the league despite pitching most of the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked with Ramon between starts again,'' Scioscia said.
``His composure is very important as it correlates with his
success. He understands the importance of it. An asset for him is
going hard every pitch. But with that intensity, he has to temper
it, find a middle ground and get the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored an unearned run in the first inning, getting
a little help from the wet grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach was on first base with two outs when Carl Everett
singled to center. But the ball skipped on the wet grass past
center fielder Garret Anderson for an error, allowing Daubach to
score and Everett to reach second.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored two more in the third, both runs scoring with
two outs. Daubach singled home Jose Offerman and Everett followed
with a single, moving Daubach to third. Troy O'Leary then made it
three consecutive singles, knocking home Daubach for a 3-0 Red Sox
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game things didn't go right for him, with the
errors, but he settled down and pitched a terrific ballgame,''
Scioscia said. ``It was the kind of outing we're looking for from
Ramon. As he gets more experience that's the kind of outing he'll
give us more consistently.'' Vaughn's homer leading off the fourth
inning was a tape-measure blast to center estimated at 430 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit a lot of balls like that in this ballpark, to dead
center field,'' Vaughn said. ``That's the only thing I remember,
it's not meaningful because it came against Boston. It's just, I've
seen that trajectory before.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox starter Tomo Ohka lasted only 5 innings, but allowed
only the homer by Vaughn and four other meaningless hits.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck, Rheal Cormier and Rich Garces set up Derek Lowe, who
pitched the ninth for his 29th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a solid road trip,'' Vaughn said. ``We're still
right there.''

 &HT;    FOX IS `BREATH OF FRESH AIR,' BUT FEW EXPECTING MUCH(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Activists on both sides of the immigration fence are
referring to the U.S. visit by Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox
Quesada as a golden opportunity for a new dialogue. But few expect
any real developments.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the first opposition candidate to wrest the Mexican
presidency from the long-entrenched Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, today comes to Washington to meet with President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fox will go to Dallas to meet with Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush. He spent the early part of the
week in Canada, where he met with Prime Minister Jean Chretien, as
well as bankers and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the visits, Fox revealed more details of proposed
immigration and development plans to reporters in Mexico. The
initiatives included gradually opening the U.S.-Mexican border,
establishing a fund through the North American Free Trade Agreement
that would resemble the European Union's $35 billion-a-year
development fund and allowing Mexican drug-trafficking suspects to
be extradited to the United States for trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say he's a breath of fresh air,'' said Frank
Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a
policy think tank. ``We've had some excellent people working on
these issues through the years, but they always seem to get pushed
to the side by the trade discussion. Fox is going to elevate the
migration debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Garcia, of the Tucson-based, pro-immigrant Coalicion de
Derechos Humanos, agreed. But she is wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, when we began to hear some of the things he was
saying throughout the campaign we were pretty shocked,'' Garcia
said. ``They're some of the things we've been saying all along. I'm
happy Fox is engaged in this kind of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Garcia said her group's optimism and support for Fox is
not unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where we sit we blame both governments for the lack of
progress on this issue through the years,'' she said, adding that
Mexico did little for emigrating workers under the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want tighter immigration controls welcome that Fox is
pushing the issue to the forefront, but say his agenda conflicts
with U.S. goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a good opportunity,'' said David Ray, spokesman
for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. ``But Mr. Fox
seems to think we have a common interest in immigration. While
Mexico thinks that more immigration is in its best interests, most
Americans think that less immigration would be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said Mexico needs to get a handle on its endemic corruption
problems before talking about economic development.
</P>
<P>
   His Arizona counterpart, Bob Park, was more combative, saying
Fox was ``way, way, way out of line'' in his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should simply butt out,'' Park said. ``Fox doesn't need to
come up here to tell us what our immigration agenda should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Park also was pessimistic about prospects for reform in a
government many consider corrupt to the core and expressed doubts
about Fox's ability to deal with Mexican drug-trafficking cartels
or even to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much power and too much money involved in the
drugs,'' Park said. ``He'd have to make some drastic and dramatic
changes, and I don't think he'll live long enough to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox last week outlined several initiatives in news conferences
and interviews.

   ``We must be better friends, we must be better neighbors, we
must be better partners,'' he said about the often-troubled
relationship between the two nations. ``By building up walls, by
putting up armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every
border state is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas he advanced was the prospect of someday
abandoning the borders separating all three North American nations,
a prospect that alarmed Washington pundits and activists alike.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox hinged the proposal on a platform of greater economic
parity between the United States and Mexico and suggested
establishing a development fund to first ramp up Mexican economic
growth so both nations would be on more even ground. A similar fund
helped cut immigrant flows from poor to rich countries of the EU,
Fox contended.
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 Mexicans emigrate illegally to the United States
each year, and about 3 million of the 7.1million Mexicans in the
United States live here illegally, according to figures from the
Center for Immigration Studies.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects Fox's visit to lead to any major policy moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that we're on the verge of our own elections and our own
change of national leadership, there's probably a sense of `let's
see what the next president and the next Congress believes,''' said
Arturo Vargas, of the National Association of Latino Elected
Officials.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE COMING CELLULAR CRUNCH
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 27.

   WASHINGTON _ Once the knock on Southern California was too much
bad air and not enough water. But soon crowded Californians, among
others, could suffer even more from a scarcity of spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated visitors to the Democratic National Convention got a
glimpse of the future when they sought, in large numbers, to use
their ``roaming'' cell phones in Los Angeles. What they often got
was the cellular equivalent of freeway gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Spectrum governs the wireless world. The federal government
gives it away to TV and radio licensees. The feds also gobble up
huge chunks for military communications, satellite services and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has
auctioned off pieces of available spectrum, seeking to earn
billions of dollars for the taxpayers. Unhappily, some buyers
overpaid and went broke. These dormant allocations, now tied up in
Congress and in the courts, are like fallow fields reclaimed by the
bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Come September, the FCC plans to try again, putting up for bid
some of the sweetest spectrum around. At one time, the regulators
hoped to raise $50 billion from the coming sale, which would match
the current record, raised by the German government this month.
</P>
<P>
   Such a choice parcel of wireless real estate is just what's
needed to build out what the telecoms call 3G networks. These
third-generation mobile systems already enjoy a firm grip on the
airwaves in Europe and parts of Asia. They enable cell phones to
surf the Internet at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch. In most large markets, these wavelengths
are already in use. In regulatory jargon, the FCC sale is ``on the
encumbered basis.''
</P>
<P>
   That means winning bidders must find ways to coax the TV
stations that occupy those slices of the UHF band (channels 60 to
69) to give up their frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Congress nor the FCC, knowing where their political
bread is buttered, show any interest in getting the broadcasters to
move elsewhere or to go off the air. Unhappily, the pickings on the
remainder of the band have become a lot slimmer after Congress in
1996 reserved the remaining (14 to 59) UHF slots for digital
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington-Baltimore region, down a notch from the
largest urban markets, 34 of these 45 UHF channels are already
allotted. All major stations here transmit separate VHF and UHF
signals, usually airing identical fare. And nobody seems in a hurry
to give the VHF channels back to the feds by 2006, as called for
under the original deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have led the telecommunications revolution in the world
because we encouraged innovation and competition,'' says Reed
Hundt, a former FCC chairman. ``The spectrum shortage,'' he adds,
``threatens that policy when it comes to wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 85 percent of U.S. households watch UHF stations on either
cable or satellite, lawmakers could ease the crunch by letting
broadcasters go off the air but still retain their current local
``must carry'' cable rights.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely result: nobody budges, the new FCC auction proves
a bust and Europeans surge even further ahead of Americans on the
mobile phone front.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cohen brings sanity to Defense debate
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen has brought a welcome moment of
sanity to a presidential campaign shouting match about miliary
spending and readiness that was threatening to get wildly out of
hand. With luck, Cohen's comments will discipline the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are legitimate and, anyway, inevitable. Defense has
figured in every presidential campaign since World War II. (And
before, for that matter, when an isolationist Congress was
resisting President Franklin Roosevelt's efforts to prepare for the
inevitable.)
</P>
<P>
   The partisan wrangling has as often distorted as it has
illuminated the issues. John Kennedy was elected on fear-mongering
claims of a missile gap between us and the Soviets that didn't
exist. Richard Nixon tried to panic the nation over the fate of two
meaningless islands _ Quemoy and Matsu _ off the China coast. Jimmy
Carter was denied re-election as supposedly the wimp of the western
world when in fact his administration began development of many of
the gee-whiz weapons that would star in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan played the defense issue like a master fiddler
with a Stradivarius, to mixed results. His anything-goes military
budgets helped to spend a decaying Soviet economic system and its
stressed military into deserved oblivion but left us with record
deficits we'll be decades paying off, if we ever do.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has picked up Reagan's old Strad but he's no
Reagan. He's sawing out squeaks with his claims that the U.S.
military is in such sorry shape that two of its divisions couldn't
even be deployed should the need arise and that the armed services
are a sink of lousy morale.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military is the world's most richly funded. It has no
close competitor in skill, technology or firepower. The Joint
Chiefs of Staff say all the divisions are ready. And now Cohen has
weighed in, though reluctantly as a Republican himself and
carefully, in ways to keep his office and the Pentagon politically
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense secretary notes that military budget declines began
with Reagan and continued _ and were at their steepest _ under
President Bush. Military spending has turned up in recent years,
and President Clinton approved the biggest military pay increase in
a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has supported, at Vice President Gore's specific urging,
a $127 billion increase over 10 years. Re-enlistments have turned
around and are rising again.
</P>
<P>
   A fair argument can be made that the Clinton administration was
slow to sober up from the heady days when both parties were living
it up on the post-Cold War ``peace dividend.'' Cohen and the joint
chiefs, although acknowledging the upturn, argue that still more is
needed to meet our increasingly complex superpower obligations.
</P>
<P>
   There's room aplenty there for candidate Bush to challenge the
Clinton administration record, without partisan overkill that
misleads voters and, perhaps dangerously, rattles our allies and
heartens our enemies.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Sitting in anticipation of a Big One
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 27, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Jack's in San Francisco; I'm down here, at the appendage
of the United States. We talk often, about earthquakes and
hurricanes. I always tell my West coast friend that living in an
earthquake-prone area is more comfortable than being in a
hurricane-prone one because earthquakes don't visibly creep up on
you, day-by-day, mile-by-mile.
</P>
<P>
   With an earthquake, it's BOOM!, and that's it (except for the
aftershocks.)
</P>
<P>
   While an earthquake always is on his mind, a hurricane not only
haunts me but is made more disturbing by the fact that today's
technology can spot one slipping off the African coast, thereby
initiating a day-by-day, hour-by-hour tracking that consumes and
escalates several weeks of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't come with an earthquake. Certainly there's
anticipation of both, but you can see the hurricane working its way
toward you.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when weather forecasters didn't have satellites
to find embryonic zephyrs of wind and rain below the Azores. Now
they pipe that information to rabid TV news departments that begin
immediate tracking and remind people to stock up on batteries,
water, tuna fish and the like _ even before they have any idea of
whether the storm will reach the western hemisphere, or toddle off
toward Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   People deal with hurricanes in one of two ways: wisely and not
so wisely.
</P>
<P>
   When then Hurricane Debby began approaching Hispaniola and Cuba,
it appeared a sure shot that she eventually would take a slap at
South Florida. Then, the people who are not so wise flooded
supermarkets and building supply stores looking for bottles of
water, canisters of propane, plywood -- anything that is necessary
to protect life and property during and after a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The lines were immense and the pickings slim.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who, like the wise little piggy who built his house
of bricks, did our hurricane supply purchasing at the very start of
hurricane season, June 1, sat back and observed the frustration and
dismay of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm off to the store,'' a daughter-in-law called in,
``anything I can get for you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a thing my dear, I did my Christmas shopping early.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Debby jilted the Miami area (on the eighth anniversary of
the day the monster Hurricane Andrew jolted it) and the lines have
subsided. Debby could become someone else's problem but, now, even
the Miami procrastinators are stocked up in case an Ernesto,
Florence, Gordon or Helene comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ernesto will start up somewhere, maybe in the Atlantic,
perhaps in the Caribbean, and we will begin the hour-by-hour
tracking, tuning to our weather telecasters who tell us not to
panic but to go out and get that canned tuna fish. Well, we all
have it now.
</P>
<P>
   Jack, over in San Francisco, doesn't have to deal with this,
doesn't have an earthquake season, just has to sit and wait for
something sudden to whack him and his property.
</P>
<P>
   We wonder which is worse. As a Hurricane Andrew victim, I
believe watching these monster storms descend upon us is as
terrible as it can get. Jack, a 1989 earthquake survivor, feels the
other way. He doesn't like the idea of his house coming down on him
suddenly, without warning.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose there's argument for both and there's certainly fear
of both. But at least earthquake-prone citizens don't have to
listen to rabid local TV anchors who, when a tropical depression
off Africa's west coast is still closer to Cairo than it is to
Miami, proclaim as their opening news headline: ``Alberto inches
closer to South Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto, by the way, is the one that got closer to Iceland.

 &HT;    MEXICO SEES FLOOD OF CENTRAL AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS HEADING FOR
AMERICAN DREAM
 &HT;    (1100&AMP;ADDS)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    With chart information attached at end of story.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Tapachula is a city in
Mexico's southern Chiapas state, about 18 miles from the Guatemalan
border.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Aug. 27 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene Lopez, 15, said she
was willing to do anything if she could just get to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take care of babies,'' the
teenager from El Salvador said earnestly, her eyes as wide as
saucers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez never made it to her dream cities of Houston or El
Paso. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all high school girls
_ were unceremoniously dumped just inside Mexico by a smuggler
they'd paid to take them north. And it wasn't long before
immigration authorities in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state,
picked them up and put them in a detention center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents knew we were doing this. Our grandmother gave us
money,'' said Claudia Lopez, 16, who huddled nervously with the
other girls inside a cell, waiting for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going somewhere where with jobs we could
afford to buy food,'' Claudia said. ``We didn't know this would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While United States officials wage their own battle against
illegal crossings, Mexican officials in Chiapas _ which borders
Guatemala _ say they're grappling with a 30 percent surge in
seizures of Central Americans and other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 54,000 migrants were caught just in Chiapas here
between January and June, compared to about 37,700 during the same
period last year. The vast majority are Central Americans on their
way to the United States to escape low wages and societies still
devastated by civil war and 1998's Hurricane Mitch, according to
Javier Jimenez, regional director of the Mexican National Migration
Institute here, in this a city on the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of urgency about them,'' Jimenez said. ``The
U.S. economy is what offers them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers charging thousands of dollars are getting into the
action, leading migrants on increasingly perilous journeys in their
quest to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In April, seven people died after 250 migrants were found locked
inside suffocating train cargo holds in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In May, authorities found 309 illegal immigrants jammed inside a
convoy of four trucks traveling from Chiapas to Matamoros, on
Mexico's northern border. The migrants, ten of whom had to be
hospitalized, said their goal was to reach Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Guatemalans bound for the United States, including
two children, drowned when a motorboat they were in capsized off
the coast of Oaxaca, another southern Mexican state.
</P>
<P>
   A greater number of South Americans are also traveling through
southern Mexico en route to America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the United States,'' was the dream destination of
Luis Cayano, a 23-year-old Peruvian who'd been locked inside a
one-room holding cell here for more than a month, awaiting news on
who would pay for him to be deported to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Cayano, who has some college education, said he spent several
thousand dollars on bus fare and bribes to corrupt officials in
various countries as he made his way north. His mother had used her
house as collateral for a loan from a bank and he felt responsible
now to somehow get to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dream of going to the United States, you have to
give it a go,'' Cayano said. ``We are willing to risk a lot to get
there, even our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the Central Americans flooding Mexico, Salvadoran
Francisco Antonio Ramirez wanted to get to Los Angeles, where he
heard he could make more money than he ever imagined. Mexican
officials caught him at a bus station near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a cost-benefit analysis, it's probably worth more
for me to try to get to the United States than stay at my job in El
Salvador,'' the 26-year-old father of two said.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of tears, he said he'd saved and borrowed about
US$900 for his journey from his home in San Miguel, El Salvador.
Back home, in a country rife with crime, he was earning the
equivalent of US$110 a month repairing highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pittance,'' he said. ``We lived through a terrible war.
And now what little you earn gets stolen by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduran Carlos Castillo, 18, said he earned so little at a
T-shirt assembly plant back home _ about US$40 a week _ that his
family also thought it worth him trying his luck at getting to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation in Honduras,'' said Castillo, a
fresh-faced youth who was placed in the holding cell with the
startled look of a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hoping to join his uncle somewhere in Texas, but
he couldn't remember exactly where. He was supposed to call and get
the name of the city once he had traveled deeper into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, which hit Central America almost two years ago,
left its worst path of destruction in Honduras, Castillo's
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people were killed and 70-to-80 percent of
agricultural production was destroyed, along with 33,000 homes. The
U.S. government offered more than $103 million in emergency food
and disaster recovery. About 10 percent of another $291 million to
rebuild roads, health infrastructure and businesses was spent by
this June, according to the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy. We endured non-stop rain and wind. People
went for days without food. All that left big losses. You have to
look hard for ways to survive. So the hurricane had a huge impact
on us,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the migrants waiting to be shipped back home,
Castillo shrugged when asked if he would attempt the trip again.
</P>
<P>
   Most Central Americans caught in Chiapas are deported over the
border to Guatemala, where they travel freely without visas under a
multilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Those crossing illegally into Mexico sometimes walk through
tropical terrain or pay to be ferried across the Suchiate River,
which divides Chiapas from Guatemala. Once inside Mexico, the
migrants take buses or jump on trains heading north, climbing on
top of boxcars or hanging off the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials man roadblocks near the southern border to
check travelers' documents, and patrol the banks of the Suchiate
River. But because of shortages in manpower, the Suchiate appears
in some places to be a virtual no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   An astonishingly bustling trade is carried out daily on the
river, whose banks are lined on both sides with shacks selling food
and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Just a football-field away from an international checkpoint in
Hidalgo, Chiapas, a couple dozen rafts crafted from inner tubes and
wooden planks ply the river, carrying people and loads of
groceries. Guatemalans use the rafts so they can avoid having to
pay tariffs on their purchases at an official checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customs' officials appear unable to stop the illegal
crossings. About the most they do is watch with binoculars and try
to stop drug shipments from coming in, said Neri Corada, one of the
reed-thin men and boys who push the rafts through the river with
long poles.
</P>
<P>
   In an impoverished region where everyone is fighting to survive,
tolerance prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sacred river provides a source of work for us,'' said
Corado. ``Imagine what we would do if it were not here.''

   BEIJING _ Ding Meiyuan likes to go out in a nice dress and feel
pretty, but those thoughts will have to wait at least another
month. She is preparing for the Olympics, and at 227 pounds, her
biggest concern is that she'll lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me now, eating is first; training is second,'' she said
after a workout one afternoon recently.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old fisherman's daughter is the women's
weightlifting world champion in the super-heavyweight division, 75
kilograms and over. Some say that makes her the world's strongest
woman. But she is not the heaviest.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the slimmest of all her competitors,'' said Wei Di, who
heads the weightlifting program. ``The rest of them weigh at least
265 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's weightlifting will make its debut as an Olympic sport
next month at Sydney. With world records in four of the seven
weight classes, China's team is heavily favored to win several gold
medals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women on China's national team come from peasant
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese women are good at enduring hardships,'' Wei said.
``For those from the countryside, this is a path to a better
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding grew up in a fishing village near the port city of Dalian
in northeastern China. Like many on the team, she started training
when she was just 12, after a coach decided she had the right body
type and convinced her to enroll in a state-run sports school,
which is where almost all Chinese Olympic athletes are trained.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years on the Liaoning provincial team, she moved up
to the national team at age 15. At 19, she won three gold medals
and broke two world records at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok.
Last November, she won the world championship in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only Chinese woman picking up medals in Bangkok.
She and her teammates won all seven weightlifting gold medals and
broke world records seven days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Liaoning Daily newspaper, the women's
weightlifting team has not shown its true strength in international
competitions for fear of dominating the sport too heavily and
jeopardizing the chances of it becoming an Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Ding's strongest rival is Agata Wrobel, the 19-year-old world
record-holder from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American team, ``there's one kid who's pretty good,''
said Zhang Wenxi, the women's weightlifting coach.
</P>
<P>
   At 17 and 300 pounds, Cheryl Haworth of Savannah, Ga., is the
U.S. national champion and America's best chance for a women's
weightlifting medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can maybe get a bronze,'' Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
   Since China has been allotted just four slots for women's
weightlifting, Zhang and Wei say they are still deciding on the
final line-up, which will be announced August 27. Everything from
competitors' performances to menstrual cycles are being factored
into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the team to win gold has been building. With
recent injuries and doping scandals in swimming, diving and track
and field _ high-profile events for which China had high Olympic
hopes _ women's weightlifting is one of the few events China feels
confident about.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese state-run media have been talking about a gold medal
sweep for all four women. Zhang says he feels secure about at least
three golds.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic medals also come with financial rewards in China's
state-sponsored sports system. Gold medalists will receive 80,000
yuan, or almost US$10,000, which is the equivalent of 20 years'
income for many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But sports is starting to get commercial sponsorship too. For
example, all athletes who win medals will be required to wear
clothing from Chinese manufacturer Li Ning during the medal
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The weightlifting team, so far has not attracted much corporate
backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are not very interested in weightlifting,'' Wei
said. ``We hope after these Olympics we'll get more support.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, they have to get the gold.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team works out three to five hours a day at a
Beijing gym. Ranging in age from 19 to 26, they repeatedly hoist
barbells to their chests and over their heads. For several hours
each week, they also do mental exercises, which Zhang says involves
deep breathing and recalling their best performances from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The team has experts in Chinese medicine monitoring each athlete
and giving them pills made of ginseng and deer antler to enrich
their blood and energy levels.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Ding lifts more than 30,000 pounds a day. To sustain
her, she eats four meals a day and snacks as much as she wants to.
Her arms are big, but her thighs are massive.
</P>
<P>
   At first, building bulk was hard on her psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be skinny,'' she said. ``I weighed only 40 kilograms
(88 pounds).''
</P>
<P>
   After getting big, ``I didn't like to go outside because I
thought I was too fat. I felt like everyone was looking at me,''
she said. ``But now, doing this sport, I have to be like this.
After I stop training I'll lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   One thought keeps her going when she longs to be thin again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about when I'm in Australia getting my medal,
listening to China's anthem, how other girls won't be able to do
this,'' Ding said.

 &HT;    Scientists prove it's not the cheeseburgers; it's lack of sleep
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I will turn 45 in a few days. I am
alarmingly healthy, far more than I deserve, though I have the
normal aches and pains, as well as that male thickening of the
middle. Nothing terribly gross, but I'm carrying 10 pounds extra
that just won't go away. I go through spasms of exercise and good
resolutions. Lately, I've been walking two miles early most
mornings, doing 175 situps, only eating one cheeseburger a week,
drinking light beer and staying out of the breakfast to-go line at
McDonalds on consecutive days. What can I say? I'm a health nut.
</P>
<P>
   It has had absolutely no effect on the dun-loppin', as my late
father-in-law called it, because the belly roll lops over your
belt. I suppose brisk exercise makes me feel better, though I can't
really tell because I'm too sleepy at 6 a.m. And it sure does make
me hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a story in the Journal of the American Medical Association
says the belly roll is not my fault. It's because I don't get
enough sleep. I am going through the change of life.
</P>
<P>
   A medical study of 149 healthy men showed that as they enter
mid-life, most lose the ability to sleep deeply. That means they
generate a lesser amount of growth hormones, which leads to reduced
production of muscle and an increase in fat.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific term is somatopause, the male version of
menopause. And the age at when all this hormonal weirdness kicks in
is, you guessed it, 45. I can't wait for the hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that as I've gotten older, I don't sleep as long or
as well, though it doesn't particularly bother me. Six or seven
hours of sleep is plenty most days. It is also true that I thrash
around in my sleep, wake up several times a night and have been
banished to the couch on many occasions because I allegedly snore
like a freight train. This is an allegation I've never been able to
confirm since I'm asleep while snoring, though there are a number
of earwitnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And given my modest stature, it's quite obvious that my growth
hormones quit working at about the age of 13, when I had my final
growth spurt to hit five-feet, six inches. As I head down the back
side of middle age, I will begin to shrink so that by the time I'm
90, assuming I'm still around, I'll be sitting on telephone books
to see over the steering wheel. At the rate it's going, I will be
as wide as I am tall and will do a lot of yawning by my ninth
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The wire story from which I got this information says doctors
are developing medication that induces deep sleep, which in turn
allows the body to produce the growth hormone. I'm going to get
this stuff, being a firm believer in better living through
chemistry. It's entirely possible that, besides actually being able
to sleep for more than four straight hours, these miracle drugs
could induce a growth spurt in me. By age 50 I could be
six-feet-tall, which means I would be nearly as tall as the rest of
the people in my house, also known as the land of giants. And a
modest 10 pounds of extra weight doesn't show up as much on someone
who's six-inches taller than me.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I really don't want to be taller. After more than 30
years of viewing the world from the same height, I'm not interested
in changing my perspective. That is the same reason I don't have
surgery so I wouldn't have to wear glasses. I know many people
who've had the surgery and swear by it. But I am so used to wearing
glasses that not having to do so would drive me nuts. I would not
know what to do with my hands, which now occupy spare moments
pushing glasses back up my nose and polishing the lenses.
</P>
<P>
   There's something peaceful about lying down in bed and taking
off your glasses. The world suddenly becomes blurry and indistinct
and retreats into the background, as if you've turned down a dimmer
switch and draped gauze over everything. It's a peaceful feeling.
I'm convinced sleep would come even harder if I could actually see
without glasses, because the world would remain in sharp focus, far
too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, then I would be able to find my way to the refrigerator
for a midnight snack, and that certainly wouldn't help the weight
problem.

 &HT;    Who's the better populist: Gore or Bush?
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ His daddy taught school before going to
Congress, Democrat Al Gore told the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles last week. His mom worked her way through law school
waitressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I visit a school and see a hard-working teacher trying to
change the world one child at a time, I see the face of my
father,'' Gore said. ``When I see a waitress working hard and
thanking someone for a tip, I see the face of my mother.

</P>
<P>
   He'll stand up to ``big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the
pharmaceutical companies, the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about populism, stupid. We the people against the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia:
</P>
<P>
   ``In Midland, Texas, where I grew up, the town motto was `The
Sky's the Limit.' And we believed it. There was a restless energy,
a basic conviction that, with hard work, everybody could succeed
and everybody deserved a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense of community was just as strong as that sense of
promise. Neighbors helped each other. There were dry wells and
sandstorms to keep you humble, lifelong friends to take your side
and churches to remind us that every soul is equal in value and
equal in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This background leaves . . . an outlook. Optimistic. Impatient
with pretense. Confident that people can chart their own course in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   We the people can make it together.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush didn't mention their Harvard degrees. Both want to
identify with as many up-from-the-dirt Americans as possible _
because whoever does it best wins.
</P>
<P>
   The late Lee Atwater, who directed former President George
Bush's successful presidential campaign in 1988, thought a populist
message was critical.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater said after the election he was glad Democrat Michael
Dukakis didn't hit a populist theme until the final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they developed that theme at the (Democratic National)
convention (in July) rather than spending the entire time
denigrating George Bush, they would've probably done a lot
better,'' Atwater said.
</P>
<P>
   He believed a populist message worked best on the swing vote
between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have always got to nail Republicans as the party
of the fat cats, the party of upper class and privilege. And the
Democrats will maintain that they're the party of the common man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans, of course, argue that the Democrats are the
party of . . . the Harvard elite liberals who're not in touch with
the mainstream of the country,'' Atwater said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up managing 20 state campaigns in the South, and in
every one of them, when we hit that (populist) theme properly, we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush officed near Atwater during that 1988 campaign.
By 1992, Atwater was dead of cancer. And President Bush lost
re-election to a populist-styled campaign by Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove introduced Atwater to the elder Bush in 1973. Rove is
now George W.'s closest adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater, Rove said, would say Al Gore's anti-big business
approach is ``pinched populism.'' Atwater thought ``elitist big
government that looks down on the attitudes of ordinary people was
the most vulnerable object of populist discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Rove said, believes that ``people have less confidence in
the answers from Washington, but more in answers that come from
family, community, church, neighborhood and local institutions of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has charged Gore with engaging in ``class warfare.'' But
Gore, who has jabbed Bush as a lackey of the powerful, seems
unworried his own proposals on behalf of ``working families'' will
be read negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels that his positions are those that are on the side of
working families,'' said spokeswoman Maria Meier. ``And he's
willing to talk in detail about his plans for health care, shoring
up Social Security, providing targeted tax cuts, putting
prescription drugs under Medicare. And those are the things that
people care about the most.''
</P>
<P>
   So who's the better populist? Let the people decide.

 &HT;    Maintain proper tire air pressure to beat the heat
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Unless you have been under a rock or on a deserted
tropical island, you have heard of Firestone's tire recall.
Hopefully, regardless of what brand of tire your vehicle wears, you
have heeded warnings to maintain the proper air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling across many Southern states this summer, I have
noticed a marked increase in the population of interstate
alligators _ you know, those carcasses of big truck tires in the
middle of the road. I blame the increase on one thing: heat.
</P>
<P>
   So why is proper tire inflation so important in the summer heat?
</P>
<P>
   An underinflated tire actually drags across the road surface,
and that builds up heat. You may have seen a slow-motion replay of
a dragster's rear tire when it is going through its burnout
process. You will notice that the tire side wrinkles as the tire
rotates.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the driver is trying to do. Hot tires become
soft and gluelike for the driver's less-than-10-second run.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive heat on passenger-car tires also makes them soft, but
for more prolonged driving, that means tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us don't take the road surface temperature into
consideration when it comes to our tires. We should. Go to a NASCAR
race on practice and qualifying day, and you will see tire
engineers probing the tire's tread surface and the racetrack
surface as well to determine their temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for the track surface to exceed 130 degrees
when the air temperature is in the low 90s. With many areas now
facing summer heat near the three-digit mark, it is safe to assume
that our road surfaces are much hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Speed also increases tire temperatures. The faster tires rotate
against the road surface, the more heat they build up.
</P>
<P>
   So what can we do help protect ourselves from tire failure
during these hot summer months?
</P>
<P>
   We can't control the weather, and road surface temperatures are
out of our control, but we can consider slowing down and
maintaining our tires' proper air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,
experts determined that some 82 percent of American drivers claim
to check their tire pressure regularly. That is good.
</P>
<P>
   What is bad is that most of them don't know what the proper
inflation is. Some 46 percent cited the tire pressure marked on the
sidewall of their tire as the proper pressure. But that number
indicates the tire's maximum pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your tires should be inflated to the vehicle manufacturer's
recommendation printed on the driver's side door sill placard or in
the owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   It is very important that you always check when your tires are
cold, after the vehicle has been sitting for at least a few hours.
Checking air pressures on hot tires will give you false readings.

 &HT;    Sparkling shop a mechanic's paradise
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A natural extension of my job as an automotive service
technology instructor is to match the student to a position that
will provide an advantageous union between the student and the
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the shortage of qualified auto mechanics, this might
seem an easy task. I find it just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Our office receives several phone calls a week with pleas from
prospective employers to send them students. Unfortunately, many of
them have unreal expectations of the skills and recourses
(primarily tools) an automotive tech student possesses.
</P>
<P>
   The constraints of a six-quarter automotive program provide
barely enough time to cover the theories and repair techniques. To
achieve continuity in training, system training aids _ such as air
conditioning training units, engines on stands and fuel injection
boards _ are incorporated into shop instruction practices, with
only limited exposure to live work on real cars.
</P>
<P>
   Can students explain how a system works and diagnose it? Yes.
Can they find these components on several makes and models of
vehicles? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the majority of the job offers are full time, requiring
the student to withdraw from the automotive program before
completing it.
</P>
<P>
   The students, on the other hand, are often appalled by the
``less than fast food'' starting pay offered by some of these
repair shops because of their apprentice-level status.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, I often find myself seeking workable, and
hopefully long-lasting, employment arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to check out
iMotors.com's new auto reconditioning facility. My tour of the vast
establishment enabled me to get a pretty good picture of the
mechanical side of its operation.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based iMotors.com is a used-car brokerage service.
The company takes orders over the Internet for used cars, then
buys, reconditions and delivers them. The Stockbridge facility is
one of its reconditioning centers.
</P>
<P>
   As the foreman walked me through the mechanical/body and
paint/trim shop, he explained that the company only deals with 1-
to 5-year-old vehicles. Vehicles with major problems (engine,
transaxle, drivetrain, frame, body or interior) are rejected. If
only minor repairs are needed (maintenance, brakes, door dings,
upholstery, trim), the vehicle is moved to the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   The repair/reconditioning building is a huge arena of bright
shop lights reflecting off spotless floors. The top-notch
diagnostic and repair equipment is supported by environmentally
friendly parts-cleaning and chemical use/recycling stations.
</P>
<P>
   I could only think that after years of working in shops with
poor to barely adequate lighting and equipment in various phases of
degradation, I'd entered a mechanic's paradise. From a mechanic's
perspective, the shop and the company's approach to vehicle repair
are phenomenal. The atmosphere provides incentives for recruiting
and retaining skilled service personnel. The working conditions are
certainly conducive to employee contentment, a key element to
instituting a team focus. The technicians are not paid flat rate,
where speed takes precedence over quality.
</P>
<P>
   Master technicians work with and train the less experienced
people. The goal is to achieve a right approach. What more could a
teacher ask than to be able to find a working environment that
echoes her own philosophy?

 &HT;    Wiggy's first storm
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I've known many porch cats. They are drawn to the
hedge at our home and the fact that it generally doesn't take too
much wheedling for some cat chow and water to make it out the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Porch cats come and go, some nameless. Then there were others:
Oopsie, with one eyelid that didn't work right. Snowball, who
became a fat farm cat when we found a family with a barn for her.
There was skinny Spice, a veritable teen who gave birth to three in
a discarded box in our driveway. When fire ants stormed, we hustled
the mom and newborns inside. Two of the kittens have stayed to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not unusual a few weeks ago to see a new set of eyes
in the hedge. The eyes? Well, OK, unusual: one powder blue, one
tan.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all that is strange. The kitten is snow-white except
for this: A black toupee-like swath combed back from his forehead,
parted perfectly down the middle. He also has a black hyphen right
below his nose. He looks like Oliver Hardy with all the air taken
out, and minus the derby hat.
</P>
<P>
   We're on a first-name basis now. Our youngest son named him
Wiggy. But our interaction has been fleeting. As with most American
families, we don't spend that much time on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggy is probably a summer old, all ears and tail. Legs astound
him, particularly his own. Truly, spring is in his step. Startle
him with a door and he bounces around like one whose pogo stick
won't stop.
</P>
<P>
   This cat having composure that brims over at half tea-cup, I was
curious how Wiggy might react the other night when Waco got its
first bonafide storm in a century, or at least in a summer.
</P>
<P>
   Natural commotion
</P>
<P>
   Storms are sensitive subjects at our house, particularly in our
back yard. Thunder is our dogs' least favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the dogs came inside with the first drum roll. The
air heaved and sweated. The trees made ``come over here'' gestures.
The rain came.
</P>
<P>
   I stationed myself on the porch. Wiggy emerged from the hedge.
</P>
<P>
   I watched to see if the kitten would react to the thunder and
the flash of sabers rattling above. Nope. He was watching me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look. Rain,'' I pointed out to Wiggy. He looked at my hand
instead and climbed in my lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lay some of that skin on me, man,'' he said in body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, kitten,'' I gestured. ``Check it out. There's nothing
like that first real storm in months, the smell, the spray, the
earth worms gargling.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE THE MERRIER
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily my wife came out. Wiggy bounced over. ``It's a
party,'' he gestured.
</P>
<P>
   Becky checked out the storm. Wiggy checked her out.
</P>
<P>
   Her hands unnaturally idle, my wife grabbed a broom to sweep the
porch. Wiggy knew this diversion was meant for him alone. He
grabbed and gnawed, sliding and scampering as he chased the broom's
bristles, or vice versa. At the edge of the porch he hid under a
skateboard and pawed at the broom.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly my son Robert appeared. Robert checked out the storm.
Wiggy checked out Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggy pawed at Robert's shoe laces a while. Then Rob unfurled a
draw string from an old pair of trousers. The kitten leaped after
it and danced on hind legs. The kid laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The rain kept pouring. Becky gathered the kitten into her arms
and remarked that his fur was misted. What do you think, cat? Wait
'till you sample raindrops on roses.
</P>
<P>
   It was a porchful of us for several minutes, all looking up.
Then the storm subsided, to where the only clatter was from the
gutters. Robert and his mom went back in. He left the draw string
on the porch for the kitten's amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggy was occupying himself with it when I went inside. I think
Wiggy thinks rain is a great concept.

have the normal aches and pains, as well as that male thickening of
the middle. Nothing terribly gross, but I'm carrying 10 pounds
extra that just won't go away. I go through spasms of exercise and
good resolutions. Lately, I've been walking two miles early most

 &HT;    Maintain proper tire air pressure to beat the heat
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Unless you have been under a rock or on a deserted
tropical island, you have heard of Firestone's tire recall.
Hopefully, regardless of what brand of tire your vehicle wears, you
have heeded warnings to maintain the proper air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling across many Southern states this summer, I have
noticed a marked increase in the population of interstate
alligators _ you know, those carcasses of big truck tires in the
middle of the road. I blame the increase on one thing: heat.
</P>
<P>
   So why is proper tire inflation so important in the summer heat?
</P>
<P>
   An underinflated tire actually drags across the road surface,
and that builds up heat. You may have seen a slow-motion replay of
a dragster's rear tire when it is going through its burnout
process. You will notice that the tire side wrinkles as the tire
rotates.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the driver is trying to do. Hot tires become
soft and gluelike for the driver's less-than-10-second run.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive heat on passenger-car tires also makes them soft, but
for more prolonged driving, that means tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us don't take the road surface temperature into
consideration when it comes to our tires. We should. Go to a NASCAR
race on practice and qualifying day, and you will see tire
engineers probing the tire's tread surface and the racetrack
surface as well to determine their temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for the track surface to exceed 130 degrees
when the air temperature is in the low 90s. With many areas now
facing summer heat near the three-digit mark, it is safe to assume
that our road surfaces are much hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Speed also increases tire temperatures. The faster tires rotate
against the road surface, the more heat they build up.
</P>
<P>
   So what can we do help protect ourselves from tire failure
during these hot summer months?
</P>
<P>
   We can't control the weather, and road surface temperatures are
out of our control, but we can consider slowing down and
maintaining our tires' proper air pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety,
experts determined that some 82 percent of American drivers claim
to check their tire pressure regularly. That is good.
</P>
<P>
   What is bad is that most of them don't know what the proper
inflation is. Some 46 percent cited the tire pressure marked on the
sidewall of their tire as the proper pressure. But that number
indicates the tire's maximum pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your tires should be inflated to the vehicle manufacturer's
recommendation printed on the driver's side door sill placard or in
the owner's manual.
</P>
<P>
   It is very important that you always check when your tires are
cold, after the vehicle has been sitting for at least a few hours.
Checking air pressures on hot tires will give you false readings.

 &HT;    Sparkling shop a mechanic's paradise
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A natural extension of my job as an automotive service
technology instructor is to match the student to a position that
will provide an advantageous union between the student and the
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the shortage of qualified auto mechanics, this might
seem an easy task. I find it just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Our office receives several phone calls a week with pleas from
prospective employers to send them students. Unfortunately, many of
them have unreal expectations of the skills and recourses
(primarily tools) an automotive tech student possesses.
</P>
<P>
   The constraints of a six-quarter automotive program provide
barely enough time to cover the theories and repair techniques. To
achieve continuity in training, system training aids _ such as air
conditioning training units, engines on stands and fuel injection
boards _ are incorporated into shop instruction practices, with
only limited exposure to live work on real cars.
</P>
<P>
   Can students explain how a system works and diagnose it? Yes.
Can they find these components on several makes and models of
vehicles? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the majority of the job offers are full time, requiring
the student to withdraw from the automotive program before
completing it.
</P>
<P>
   The students, on the other hand, are often appalled by the
``less than fast food'' starting pay offered by some of these
repair shops because of their apprentice-level status.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, I often find myself seeking workable, and
hopefully long-lasting, employment arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to check out
iMotors.com's new auto reconditioning facility. My tour of the vast
establishment enabled me to get a pretty good picture of the
mechanical side of its operation.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based iMotors.com is a used-car brokerage service.
The company takes orders over the Internet for used cars, then
buys, reconditions and delivers them. The Stockbridge facility is
one of its reconditioning centers.
</P>
<P>
   As the foreman walked me through the mechanical/body and
paint/trim shop, he explained that the company only deals with 1-
to 5-year-old vehicles. Vehicles with major problems (engine,
transaxle, drivetrain, frame, body or interior) are rejected. If
only minor repairs are needed (maintenance, brakes, door dings,
upholstery, trim), the vehicle is moved to the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   The repair/reconditioning building is a huge arena of bright
shop lights reflecting off spotless floors. The top-notch
diagnostic and repair equipment is supported by environmentally
friendly parts-cleaning and chemical use/recycling stations.
</P>
<P>
   I could only think that after years of working in shops with
poor to barely adequate lighting and equipment in various phases of
degradation, I'd entered a mechanic's paradise. From a mechanic's
perspective, the shop and the company's approach to vehicle repair
are phenomenal. The atmosphere provides incentives for recruiting
and retaining skilled service personnel. The working conditions are
certainly conducive to employee contentment, a key element to
instituting a team focus. The technicians are not paid flat rate,
where speed takes precedence over quality.
</P>
<P>
   Master technicians work with and train the less experienced
people. The goal is to achieve a right approach. What more could a
teacher ask than to be able to find a working environment that
echoes her own philosophy?

 By BOB SIKORSKY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dear Bob: You genuinely have an appreciation for the care and
feeding of automobiles, so here's my story.
 &HT;    When I leave for work in the morning, I coast my 1986 Ford truck
down the hill from my house to the highway three-quarters of a mile
away, and then 6 miles to the freeway. So, after a cold start, my
truck gets a bonus of a no-load situation to the highway, followed
by 6 miles at 55 mph, and 60 mph on the interstate to my
destination. I never have the vehicle idling in the garage, since I
can idle down the hill.
 &HT;    I also religiously change oil in all my vehicles. I plan on
keeping them for a long time to come.
 &HT;    _ Chris Aiken, Spokane, Wash.
 &HT;    A: All well and good. For sure, going down a hill in the morning
might be considered a bonus as far as engine work and cold-engine
fuel economy are concerned. But you should NEVER coast and idle
down any hill. Freewheeling or coasting (vehicle in neutral, engine
idling) is dangerous because no engine braking is available.
 &HT;    It doesn't matter whether you are idling in your garage or while
coasting down the hill, cold idling is still one of the most
wear-intensive engine operations.
 &HT;    You'd be much better off, and safer too, by simply placing the
truck in gear and letting it go down the hill with the engine under
high vacuum. This is much more fuel efficient and lubricates the
engine much better than if the truck were just idling.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dear Bob: I own a 1988 Mercury Grand Marquis with 88,000 miles.
I bought it new but since then I've gone through four gas tanks.
 &HT;    The first one went at about 40,000 miles, the second at 57,112
miles, and the third at 77,580 miles. I don't have the mileage for
the fourth.
 &HT;    Something is causing this problem as the leak is always in the
same place _ over the exhaust pipe.
 &HT;    Clearly, Ford should find out why I have had to replace so many
tanks but they refuse to look into the causes.
 &HT;    I have written the Highway Traffic Safety Administration and my
congressman, but with no luck.
 &HT;    What else can I do?
 &HT;    _ Carmen Orlando, Methuen, Mass.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A. I talked to a Ford safety representative who in turn
consulted the company's experts on fuel systems and tanks, and all
insist they'd never heard of such a problem. It is not something
Ford has seen on any of their vehicles, so they think it must be
specific to your vehicle only.
 &HT;    If you care to have the matter investigated further (AND I
assume you do), you can call Mike Vaughn at Ford Motor Co.
(313-337-2786) and supply him with your vehicle's identification
number (VIN) and your name and address. Ford will check into the
vehicle's history of repairs and take it from there. Let me know
what happens.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Dear Bob: An owner of a Volvo 760 Turbo wondered why the
air-conditioner fan cut off when the engine was under load. You
advised him it was normal for his car as it uses a cutoff switch to
disengage the AC during heavy acceleration. I would also suggest
the vacuum system be checked for a missing or improper connection.
 &HT;    Many of your readers will remember vacuum windshield wipers that
would quit during acceleration due to lack of engine vacuum. Some
of today's cars use engine vacuum to operate various dampers that
route hot or cold air to the defroster, dash and floor vents.
 &HT;    When the engine is under load and the vacuum is low, the vents
close but resume functioning again when engine vacuum returns to an
appropriate level.
 &HT;    _ Jack Reefer, Harrisburg, Pa.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A. Thanks for your input. AC cutoff switches, by stopping the
cold air, ease the load on the engine and promotes better fuel
economy when accelerating or going up a hill.
 &HT;    But, your vacuum suggestions have merit. Readers who have cars
without the AC cutoff switch should keep them in mind. This
on-again-off-again (depending on the amount of engine vacuum
available) cold air routine may simply be normal for their vehicle.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Bob Sikorsky, a national-award-winning journalist who has
written several best-selling automotive books, is a consultant in
that field and a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers and
of the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers. Questions
or comments of general interest should be addressed to Bob

&HT;     AMERICANS ARE FEASTING ON THE UNKNOWN

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARTHA R. HERBERT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Today the vast majority of foods in supermarkets
contain genetically modified substances whose effects on our health
are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   As a medical doctor, I can assure you that no one in the medical
profession would attempt to perform experiments on human subjects
without their consent. Such conduct is both illegal and unethical.
Yet manufacturers of genetically altered foods are exposing all of
us to one of the largest uncontrolled experiments in modern
history.
</P>
<P>
   In less than five years these companies have flooded the
marketplace with thousands of untested and unlabelled products
containing foreign genetic material. These genetically modified
foods pose several very real dangers because they have been
engineered to create novel proteins that retard spoilage, produce
their own pesticides against insects, or allow plants to tolerate
larger and larger doses of weed killers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite claims that these food products are based on ``sound
science,'' in truth, neither manufacturers nor the government has
studied the effects of these genetically altered organisms or their
new proteins on people _ especially babies, the elderly, and the
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Can these products be toxic? Can they cause immune system
problems? Can they damage an infant's developing nervous system?
</P>
<P>
   We need answers to these questions, and until then genetically
altered ingredients should be removed from the food we eat.
</P>
<P>
   As a pediatric neurologist, I especially worry about the safety
of modified foods when it comes to children. We know that the human
immune system, for example, is not fully developed in infants.
Consequently, pediatricians have long been concerned about early
introduction of new proteins into the immature gut and developing
body of small children.
</P>
<P>
   Infants with colic are often switched to soy formula. Yet we
have no information on how they might be affected by drinking
genetically engineered soy, even though this product may be their
sole or major source of nutrition for months. Because these foods
are unlabeled, most parents feed their babies genetically altered
formula whether they want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   Even proteins that are normally part of the human diet may, when
introduced too early, lead to auto-immune and hypersensitivity or
``allergic'' reactions later.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies suggest that the epidemic increase in asthma (it
has doubled since 1980) may have links to early dietary exposures.
The behavior problems of many children with autism and attention
disorders get worse when they are exposed to certain foods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as more unlabeled and untested genetically engineered foods
enter the market, there is no one monitoring how the millions of
people with immune system vulnerability are reacting to them and
the novel proteins and fragments of viruses they can contain. In
fact, without labeling, there is no possible way to track such
health effects. This is not sound science, and it is not sound
public health.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
say there is no reason to test genetically modified foods, because
they are no different from the products of old-fashioned plant
breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that chicken genes are being put in apples and genes
from fish are being used in strawberries. Yet because of the way
genes are inserted into unrelated organisms, they have the
potential to disrupt other areas of essential genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   We have no idea what these effects may be, or what form the
disruptions may take. We don't know because no one has studied
these questions in depth, and biotech corporations are not required
to conduct thorough health analyses as a precondition for putting
genetically engineered products on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the question of antibiotic-resistance genes.
Biotech corporations put these genes into genetically modified
foods as ``markers'' to see if the alien genetic material has
successfully penetrated the cell's defense system. If the sample
resists an antibiotic, the gene has invaded the new organism.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers use this technique purely for convenience,
cavalierly ignoring the potential health risks from breeding more
virulent antibiotic-resistance germs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists know that in nature antibiotic resistance genes can
pass from one organism to another. If such genes take up residence
in our bodies, many of the currently available drugs such as
ampicillin, an often-used antibiotic, could become useless.
</P>
<P>
   Before we produce and market untested genetically altered foods,
we need to conduct a complete, thorough, long-term, and independent
evaluation of all of these novel organisms. And we need to label
foods containing altered genes. As pediatricians often advise
parents, ``better safe than sorry.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With chiseled features and a well-honed body _ which he's
displayed in more than a few films _ Wesley Snipes says he didn't
know he was a sex symbol until he got into movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had women come up to me and say, 'When are you going to
do something in which you take off your clothes again?' he says
with an ingenuous smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Claude (Van Damme) and all of them might want to do that
kind of stuff ... But I'm not that anxious to put my booty on the
screen anymore,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   In his current appearance in the action-thriller, ``The Art of
War,'' from his Amen Ra Films production company, Snipes doesn't
undress or even have a love scene with the heroine played by
Asian-American actress Marie Matiko.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy I play has no time to get it on with a woman,'' he
points out. ``It's like, 'Yo, the man is on the run.' He's too busy
saving himself to end up in the sack at some hotel! That would be
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who plays a covert agent for the United Nations, goes
underground after he's falsely accused of murdering the Chinese
ambassador. As the plot thickens with international intrigue, he's
placed in constant jeopardy _ and in the middle of some
death-defying action scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Stunt coordinator Michael Scherer says Snipes enthusiastically
participated in everything from martial arts combat to jumping from
buildings. ``Sometimes he scared the bejesus out of me because he'd
get right in there,'' Scherer confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Snipes allows that he was often in a little peril. ``But that's
OK, I don't mind it,'' he says. ``I've been working with most of my
stunt men for 10 years and they know how far I'll go. We know each
other's styles and rhythms.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this movie he was a producer. So, when he wanted to take
too big a chance on a stunt, they'd remind him that if he got hurt
the whole production would be shut down. ``And I'd end up having to
pay everybody to sit around!'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got my attention!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Snipes first signed on to ``The Art of War,''
originally developed for Asian action star Jet-Li, he made sure
that he'd be doing some of his favorite things: martial arts and
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also wanted to beef up 'The Art of War,' which is the
title of an ancient handbook written by a very powerful Asian
general, Sun Tsu,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principles he lays down to win a war still apply today _
and my character embraces them,'' he continues. ``Then, you add the
action and, oh man, it's icing on the cake!''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes doesn't deny that being an action hero, and scoring with
audiences, in such thrillers as ``Passenger 57,'' ``Drop Zone'' and
the hugely successful ``Blade,'' has given him the clout he wants
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get into the business to do action,'' he reveals.
``I'm a classically trained actor, and I love the more dramatic
stuff whether it's on Broadway or in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doing films like 'The Art of War' has afforded me the
opportunity to do other projects that have more heart and
sensitivity. So I'm not knocking it!''
</P>
<P>
   Describing action scenes, he said he doesn't like ``straight up
formula stuff. I do fights that are right to the core, right to the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, nobody thinks about hitting a guy in the side of
the thigh. But it works. Pow! You hit him there and he's going to
stop what he's doing for at least a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes, who has studied martial arts as well as capoeira
(Brazilian dance-fighting), draws on his own street sense to keep
his screen fights authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the Bronx,'' he says. ``The Bronx teaches you to
survive. It's like, 'Bring it on!'''
</P>
<P>
   And he added: ``If you took me on, it wouldn't be easy. That's
part of my image. People don't mess with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Snipes was less a fighter than a performer when he
was in his teens. He enrolled in Manhattan's High School for the
Performing Arts where he flirted with the idea of becoming a dancer
or singer. Instead he decided on acting because it came easy to
him.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother abruptly moved the family to Orlando, Fla.,
Snipes completed high school while teaming up with friends to form
``Struttin' Street Stuff,'' a traveling puppet troupe that
performed in parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything. We created the puppets, we painted them, we
wrote the scripts,'' he remembers. ``I was just a whippersnapper
but I learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes readily concedes he also learned a lot from the
performance that opened the doors to his career _ an appearance in
Michael Jackson's ``Bad'' video. ``I was amazed by Michael's level
of concentration,'' he recalls. ``I thought if I could achieve
that, then people might react to me like they were reacting to
Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the tabloid headlines that dogged his rise to fame _
including his celebrated arrest in Florida after a high-speed chase
on his motorcycle, Snipes admits, ``No one can train you to be
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of
privacy? You have to be disciplined. You go back to what works.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes readily admits the biggest influence on his life and
career was his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom told me something very simple _ 'Whatever you do, try
to be the best at it,''' he reveals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me study and read _ read, read, read. I remember
having a library card when I was about seven. It was mandatory that
I go to the library. My mom helped lay a foundation for me that I'm
now reaping with my success.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she gets the benefit, too. I get to send her around the
world. It's like, 'You want to travel, Mom? Go ahead. Wherever you
want.' It's a great feeling being able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes shared the thrill of his star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame with his mom. ``I thought someone was joking,'' he says.
``Nobody's nominated me for an Academy Award or even a People's
Choice. I didn't really think I was in the running. But it was a
hell of a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many cats from the Bronx have that kind of
experience!'' he chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not on location Snipes is usually at home in Malibu.
He shares custody of his son Jelani, 11, with his ex-wife, April,
from whom he was divorced in 1990. ``It's tough to be a good
father, and I'm definitely not cut out to be a stay-at-home dad,''
he says candidly, ``But Jelani and I have some nice times together,
and he would probably like to have me around a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Snipes pauses to consider how he'd define what's behind his
screen image. ``If I end my career tomorrow,'' he says finally, ``I
don't want people saying, 'Oh, he's just an action guy, a sex
symbol ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be thought of as an actor.''

   &UR; BY TIMOTHY NOAH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's acceptance speech at last week's Democratic convention
contained an unremarked reference to Watergate. Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents taught me that the real values in life aren't
material but spiritual. They include faith and family, duty and
honor, and trying to make the world a better place. I finished
college at a time when all that seemed to be in doubt, and our
nation's spirit was being depleted. We saw the assassination of our
best leaders. Appeals to racial backlash. And the first warning
signs of Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore graduated from Harvard in June 1969. The Watergate break-in
occurred in June 1972. What ``first warning signs'' is Gore talking
about?
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign hasn't answered our query about this, but
perhaps Gore is talking about the Nixon White House's role in
unseating Sen. Albert Gore Sr. in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to take some explaining, but the Watergate
connection is real _ and (is Gore sneaky enough to have intended
this?) splatters a little mud on his Republican opponent's own
family legacy!
</P>
<P>
   In ``Inventing Al Gore,'' Bill Turque writes that the night Gore
pere lost, Gore fils wept:
</P>
<P>
   ``He despaired at the sinister turn the country had taken. The
Kennedys were dead, King had been murdered in Memphis, and good men
like his father had been brought down by what he called, fresh from
his study of modern media at Harvard, the `subliminal smut' of
Nixon and his agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Turque details several links between the Nixon White House and
Bill Brock, the Republican Senate candidate who unseated Gore pere.
Harry Treleaven and Kenneth Reitz, two key Nixon campaign aides,
worked for Brock's campaign, and their efforts to portray Gore pere
as a crypto-Yankee elitist got an assist from Nixon chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman, who wrote a memo urging the Brock campaign to go
through the society pages of The Washington Post to find the menus
of dinners Gore pere attended (``The Frenchier the better'').
</P>
<P>
   The specific Watergate link was $200,000 in illegal campaign
contributions funneled to Brock's campaign from a secret campaign
fund maintained by Jack Gleason, a former official in Nixon's
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The slush fund was called Operation Townhouse and became the
subject of one of the Watergate investigations; in 1974, Gleason,
Nixon aide Harry Dent, and Herbert Kalmbach, Nixon's private
attorney, all pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges for failing to
follow (then quite minimal) federal disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt one of the reasons my father was defeated was
that the Nixon dirty tricks team funneled millions (sic) of dollars
of illegal money into the 1970 campaign,'' Gore fils told Stephen
Braun of The Los Angeles Times earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore fils couldn't have known about Operation
Townhouse at the time _ according to Charles Ruff, the prosecutor
on the case (and later White House counsel to Bill Clinton), the
existence of Operation Townhouse remained unknown until 1973 or
1974. But Gore fils would have known about Treleaven and Reitz's
Nixon connection, and the subsequent revelations probably jibed
with previous suspicions he had about involvement by the Nixon
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Townhouse is one of the more obscure grottos of
Watergate _ ``a peripheral Watergate matter,'' in the opinion of
Stanley Kutler, author of ``The Wars of Watergate.'' Furthermore,
Gore's feelings about his father, who was not exactly a boy scout,
were somewhat complex.
</P>
<P>
   There's a zany passage in ``Earth in the Balance'' in which Gore
complains that the ``Ptolemaic'' system of the family dethroned God
and substituted a ``dominant, all-powerful father,'' and that the
result was dysfunction and ``psychic numbness'' for all of Western
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's outrage about his father's 1970 defeat has always
seemed genuine, and his political career has always been at least
partly about redeeming that painful loss. So ``the first warning
signs of Watergate'' makes sufficient emotional and historical
sense for Gore to have included it in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   What's harder to figure is whether Gore also intended the
phrase, ``first warning signs of Watergate,'' to be an exquisitely
subtle dig at the Bush political dynasty. Albert Gore Sr. wasn't
the only future political patriarch to lose a Senate race in 1970;
another was George Herbert Walker Bush, who waged an unsuccessful
campaign that year against Lloyd Bentsen in Texas. And like Brock,
Bush pere was a beneficiary of ... Operation Townhouse!
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1988 Washington Post campaign profile by Walter
Pincus and Bob Woodward, Bush's 1970 Senate campaign received about
$100,000 from Operation Townhouse. Gleason claimed to have
delivered $6,000 of that personally to Bush. Bush denied receiving
it.
</P>
<P>
   Pincus and Woodward also reported that Bush wrote W. Clement
Stone one of his famous thank-you notes (and sent a carbon copy to
Gleason) 10 days after Gleason forwarded the Bush campaign $10,000
from Stone. Here is how Bush's note began:
</P>
<P>
   ``It has come to my attention that you sent down a fantastically
generous contribution to my campaign. Thanks ever so much. ... I
really believe we will win, and I'm most grateful to you for your
help.''

&HT;     EARLY LESSON FOR COLLEGE FRESHMEN: AVOID EXTRA POUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because Mom's not there to tell you not to eat a quart of
ice cream doesn't mean that you can. Self control is the name of
the game when it comes to avoiding the Freshman 15, those extra
pounds first-year college students acquire so easily when they
leave home.
</P>
<P>
   Although colleges still provide an abundance of food at every
meal, nutritionally, the dorm dining has changed for the better in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a fried food offering, we also offer a baked
or broiled version,'' said Callie Stacey, director of resident
dining and catering services at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.
``We also don't put butter or anything extra on vegetables when we
cook them, and we plan menus so there's always a low-fat offering
for an entree.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacey said cafeteria workers post signs that include the
calorie, cholesterol, fat, sodium and fiber content for each item
offered at each meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wellness in You,'' another program offered by Sodexho
Marriott, which runs the dining services at Union, offers meals
that stay within the national guidelines for calories, cholesterol
and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the focus on healthier eating in college dorms,
some first-year students come home for Christmas heavier than when
they left.
</P>
<P>
   The sedentary lifestyle of studying coupled with the lack of a
physical education requirement means some coeds are less active
than they were in high school. Add an evening snack routine to
studying and toss in the empty calories from even a little beer
drinking and you have the recipe for weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Reimann, a sophomore at George Washington University in
Washington, D.C., would not admit to gaining weight but said,
``Let's put it this way, I didn't lose any.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonding happens when it's midnight and you're all eating
macaroni and cheese or Ben &AMP; Jerry's together,'' Reimann said.
``Those are the times when you make friends.''
</P>
<P>
   This social interaction _ combined with the fact that some
schools serve food continuously instead of at preset meal times _
makes it easier for students to eat more, more often, Reimann said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freshman 15 isn't an inevitable consequence of college.
Nutritionists suggest the following strategies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Control your portion sizes. Whether you serve yourself at a
buffet line or the plate is filled for you, don't eat more than a
standard serving. These are:
</P>
<P>
   Meat: A piece the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta and other starches: A serving about the size of a computer
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bread: One slice.
</P>
<P>
   Casseroles and mixed entrees: A portion a little larger than the
size of a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check for nutrition information. Try to average no more than
30 percent of your calories from fat; no more than 300 milligrams
of cholesterol and no more than 2,400 milligrams of sodium daily.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snack on vegetables and fruit. Try to eat five to seven
servings a day. If the cafeteria offers fresh fruit at breakfast,
take a piece or two with you to snack on during the day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the most of the salad bar. But concentrate on leafy green
vegetables, beans and sprouts. Avoid mayonnaise-coated salads and

   (Anne Applebaum writes a column for the London Sunday
Telegraph.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Objectively speaking, you wouldn't think a small mishap like a
sunken submarine could possibly hurt Vladimir Putin. After all, the
man has greater problems: an unwinnable guerrilla war in Chechnya,
bombs going off in central Moscow, a dysfunctional economy that is
staying afloat only thanks to high oil prices, a recalcitrant
bureaucracy, a declining population.
</P>
<P>
   By some reckonings, the Kursk tragedy isn't even the most
serious problem afflicting his navy: After all, it represents only
one dysfunctional submarine, and some 180 others have been taken
out of service in the past decade. Many of those remaining are
virtually deserted, some reportedly without security, their nuclear
reactors intact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it almost seems as if the Kursk disaster was specifically
designed to hit President Putin precisely where he is most
vulnerable. This isn't just a matter of timing _ post-Moscow bomb,
Putin on holiday, Chechen war faltering _ or the Kremlin's slow
reaction to events, as many have stressed.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that since Putin was first named
prime minister and heir apparent to President Boris Yeltsin a year
ago, he has _ while talking about economic reform and other sundry
things of appeal to the West _ won acclaim in Russia primarily
thanks to his frequently stated desire to rebuild both Russia's
international military prestige and its imperial image.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Putin's popularity began to rise last year with
the re-invasion of Chechnya and continued, when he was still only
acting president, with some loose talk about multiple nuclear
warheads and an announcement that Russia would reverse its vow
never to use nuclear weapons first.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Boris Yeltsin, then still president,
stomped out of an OSCE summit in Turkey, banging a figurative shoe
on the table, refusing to listen to criticism of the Chechen war,
showing the West _ and the Russians _ that he was no longer a
capitalist lap dog.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, both Yeltsin and Putin slowly stepped up pressure on
people who made the military uncomfortable, and not just, as has
been well documented, on journalists who reported unfavorably on
the second Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly notable, in the light of this week's events, was
the jailing and prosecution of the Russian journalist Aleksander
Nikitin, who dared to publish, in cooperation with the Norwegian
environmental group Bellona, a report describing in great detail
the polluting potential of Russia's northern fleet, including its
nuclear submarines. Although Nikitin was acquitted, new hearings
are scheduled in the Russian Supreme Court in September.
</P>
<P>
   Since being elected to office, Putin's image hasn't changed: On
the contrary, he has had himself photographed flying military
planes and inspecting military installations, all to the sound of
public applause. Even as the Chechen war has faltered, he has
relied heavily on the support of the ``power ministries,'' the
military and the security services, to help him win bureaucratic
and military battles in Moscow, so far with success. Nor has Putin
withdrawn from his promise to make Russia into a military power
once again.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that Russia has fallen behind the West in
military capability, a group of Putin's top advisers recently
published a report _ ``A Strategy for Russia'' _ in which they
argued, among other things, that Russia should remain a superpower,
comparable if not equal to the United States, and thereby maintain
its international political position and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing their analysis, Putin has declared that his goal is for
Russia to rebuild its conventional forces and to expand Russia's
reach: There has been talk, for example, of sending the Russian
navy back to the Mediterranean, a part of the world it has not been
seen in for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, in the light of the disaster of the sunken Kursk,
all of that looks far more theoretical than it did even a week ago.
As Norwegian and British ships raced to the rescue, the
remilitarization strategy began to look not merely hollow, but
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good example of problems sparked when you're trying to
pretend to be a great power,'' Larry Korb, a former U.S. assistant
defense secretary, told Reuters, somewhat condescendingly, this
week. ``If you send a new but poorly maintained car on the road and
you don't teach your son or daughter to drive it, you're going to
have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian newspapers wrote much the same: ``The tragedy of the
Kursk proved that it is not just evil but criminal to build up
unfounded illusions about Russia's defense ability,'' editorialized
Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in this affair, it had occurred to me that the correct
analogy for the Kursk accident might be the explosion of the
Challenger space shuttle: a similar lesson in the dangers of
hubris, a warning about the limits of technology, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the events unfold over the last week, however, I see
that that analogy was wrong: No American politician ever staked his
prestige on the success of space technology in the way that Putin
has staked his claims to legitimacy and to popularity on the
success of the Russian armed forces. The Kursk contains far more
potential for destroying not only Putin but also the broader
program of the military and the security services which he
represents.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, like Britain earlier this century, is in fact at a
turning point in its post-imperial evolution. It can go on
``pretending to be a great power,'' competing with the United
States in rhetoric and bombast with only a tiny percentage of the
funding _ $5 billion vs. $300 billion annually) _ sending ships to
the Mediterranean and conducting elaborate military exercises like
the one the Kursk was engaged upon, or it can recognize that its
imperial days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Putin can salvage something from this crisis, so to speak, only
if he is intelligent enough to use it as an excuse to retrench, to
focus on Russia's ailing economy, to promote real reform rather
than the ersatz capitalism of recent years, to start thinking about
the plight of ordinary Russians rather than the fate of ``Mother
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Putin could cut Russia's military expenditure and
military ambitions. Russia's annual budget expenditure, after all,
is a quarter the size of Holland's. Although it would take a brave
leader to reduce Russia's armed forces to Dutch levels, to do so
may be Russia's last chance at retaining Holland's international
influence.
</P>
<P>
   If he refuses _ if Russia continues to aspire to a superpower
status it cannot afford _ expect more disasters, more silence and
stonewalling, and more tragedies like that of the Kursk.

A WINNER IN `LOVE &AMP; SEX'

Our rating: 3 stars

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a tip from Woody Allen, writer-director Valerie Breiman
based much of her debut feature, ``Love &AMP; Sex,'' on a funny
relationship _ that's funny ha-ha and funny insane, like
everybody's _ she once had.
</P>
<P>
   The results aren't ``Annie Hall'' calibre, but they are
remarkably more recognizably human than what passes for most movie
romantic comedy. ``Love &AMP; Sex'' is impolite, messy, obsessive and
embarrassing. It seems like love, in other words, not to mention
like everyone's other favorite subject.
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen, the strapping Dutch model last seen playing it
cool in ``X-Men,'' carries the film with a protean emotional
bewilderment and delightfully awkward physicality as Kate. A writer
for one of those monstrous women's magazines that are always making
up authoritative articles on what works with men, Kate one day gets
sick of all the fabrication and thinks back about where she's
personally gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several quick vignettes _ her father-figure period with a
married guy during college, the cute-but-dumb action movie actor
liaison _ bookend the central disaster of her love life. His name
is Adam (``Swingers''' Jon Favreau), a painter of grotesque psyche
scapes. He started out all cuddly overconfident, stuck by her
through an unplanned pregnancy and devastating miscarriage, then
let his sexual paranoia _ Kate had a lot more experience going in _
scuttle what was shaping up as a pretty good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after they broke up, things really got intense.
</P>
<P>
   Breiman approaches the usual ``Why are guys so weird and can't I
keep one?'' neurotics with a beguiling, shambling earthiness. The
film's title is not deceptive; when at a loss for how to express a
worrisome feeling, Kate unerringly goes carnal with often
uproarious consequences. Just one small but telling example: Of all
the jokey tongue-kissing that we've been subjected to in this
summer's comedies, this movie's kisses are the only ones that
actually make you chuckle instead of wince because they're
expressions of character rather than cheap grossout displays.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Love &AMP; Sex'' has its share of pat gags,
like Adam's playmate parade of rebound bimbos who are each younger,
dumber and blonder than the last. But Breiman has a way of using
obvious jokes as springboards for smarter humor, and in much the
same way she can stretch standard contemporary rom-com dialogue
into very specific, personal revelation.
</P>
<P>
   All of this gives ``Love &AMP; Sex'' a shaggy, lived-in kind of
feeling. Very enjoyable ambience _ and if Breiman can recapture it
in future projects that she hasn't necessarily lived out, she'll be
a formidable voice in film comedy indeed. &QL;

LIFE OF A RAMBLIN' GUY

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a wonderfully telling scene toward the end of ``The
Ballad of Ramblin' Jack'' where folk legend Ramblin' Jack Elliott
tries to take his daughter to the house where she grew up. Driving
around Mendocino backroads in his beat-up RV, Jack eventually gives
up, saying the house must be there somewhere, but finding it will
have to wait until another day.
</P>
<P>
   That Ramblin' Jack couldn't find his old house doesn't come as
much of a surprise given how seldom he hung his cowboy hat there.
That his only daughter, Aiyana, barely knew him is kind of a given,
too, and that gulf between father and child is at the heart of this
compelling documentary. Aiyana Elliott, a New York University
graduate making her directorial debut here, has crafted an
extraordinary portrait of an American original as well as a
beautiful story of a daughter trying to come to terms with her
distant father.
</P>
<P>
   Ramblin' Jack isn't known to many people outside the folk music
scene, but his influence on popular music is substantial. He's an
unlikely cowboy, being born Elliott Charles Adnopoz, the son of
Jewish doctor in Brooklyn. But Jack, as we can clearly see from
early home movies, was born with the spirit of wanderlust, and at
15, he ran away from home to join the rodeo. Thus began a lifetime
of living up to the nickname he gave himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack was 19, he heard Woody Guthrie on the radio for the
first time and soon determined to meet the legend. He visited
Guthrie's Coney Island home and quickly became a member of the
household. Jack loved Guthrie's honest sound and working-man spirit
and began emulating his hero, causing Guthrie to observe, ``Jack
sounds more like me than I do myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, after becoming one of the folk music scene's
most influential figures, it was Jack's turn to become the teacher,
mentoring a young Bob Dylan. Now Jack was the subject of imitation,
with Dylan being billed as ``the son of Jack Elliott'' before his
first concert at Gerde's Folk City in New York.
</P>
<P>
   These triumphs, along with the singer's long periods of
obscurity, are shown through an amazing wealth of archival footage.
Jack's love for freedom and spontaneity served him well, but came
with a price _ four broken marriages and a perpetual state of
financial disarray. As friend Kris Kristofferson notes: ``The story
of Jack's life is other people having hits for things he was
responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ramblin' Jack'' is more than a straight biopic. As
daughter Aiyana spends two years traveling with her father, she
comes to the disturbing realization that proximity does not equal
intimacy. And watching her father glad-hand and befriend every
stranger he comes across, Aiyana becomes frustrated, complaining
that she's ``never had an actual conversation'' with him, even
though she's his daughter !ital!and she's making a movie about him.
This conflict _ and its ultimate resolution _ gives ``Ramblin'
Jack'' a universal poignancy and makes it one of the best
documentaries of the year. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack; (unrated; suitable for all
audiences). &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Aiyana Elliott; written by Aiyana
Elliott and Dick Dahl. Released by Lot 47 Films. &QL;

`STAND BY ME' COMES TO DVD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Short fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King's reputation as a frightmeister overshadows what
sets him apart from others who mine the horror field: his ability
to bring the real and familiar of our everyday lives and
experiences into his stories.
</P>
<P>
   His semi-autobiographic novella ``The Body'' shows how well he
can do this even without the supernatural shocks. Turned into the
1986 film ``Stand by Me,'' which comes out for the first time on
DVD on Tuesday, the book tells the story of four 12-year-old boys
in Oregon in 1959, who set out to find a dead body that they heard
was in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told as a remembrance by one of the grown boys,
Gordie (played by Wil Wheaton, voiced by Richard Dreyfuss). Gordie,
now a writer, reflects on their trip together after hearing that
one of the other boys, Chris (River Phoenix), has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   In a story about youths at a crossroads in their lives, it is
difficult to not be somewhat nostalgic (particularly considering
the framing of the story). But the portrait of the four boys is as
dark as it is light, and under the direction of Rob Reiner, the
film avoids falling into a sentimental trap.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the summer before junior high, the boys sense that they
will be going separate ways once school starts and their worlds
expand. Until then, the four had been inseparable, secure in their
insular world, but differences between them _ class and personality
_ would inevitably pull them apart. The journey then becomes one
from the end of childhood to the beginning of adulthood, and along
the way we catch a glimpse of their hopes, childishness, fears and
dreams in a way most of us can understand.
</P>
<P>
   What helps this coming-of-age tale, though, is the honesty in
the performances of the boys. Phoenix, as the tough but vulnerable
Chris, is the most memorable. But there is an added poignancy now
to his performance. Like Gordie thinking about Chris, while
watching Phoenix with all his youthful potential, you can't help
thinking about his loss to drugs in 1993. The other two _ the
psychologically battered Teddy (Corey Feldman) and the pudgy
scaredy-cat Vern (Jerry O'Connell) _ are quite good, too.
Ironically, O'Connell has grown up to look like quite a stud _
playing the romantic interest in a number of films, including
``Scream 2,'' which only goes to prove that things do change when
you grow up.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Movie with heart: Mel Gibson's 1995 Oscar-winning film
``Braveheart'' probably got too many accolades in a weak year, but
there's no question that the superstar approached the project with
a surplus of elan. The gory battle scenes alone are worth the film,
which is at heart an old-fashioned epic. (A special DVD edition
arrives on Tuesday with commentary from Mel.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on the story of Scottish hero William Wallace, the story
does take some liberties with history. Princess Isabel (Sophie
Marceau) was a child at the time and Marceau _ needless to say _ is
more developed than that. Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks (King
Edward I of England) is properly vile (Longshanks was a
particularly despicable monarch), and Angus McFadyen as the
waffling Robert the Bruce proves that he's an underappreciated
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it's Gibson's charm that either wins you over or
not. The added features on the DVD (Mel enjoyed the battle scenes)
are fun, though. &QL; 
---- &QL; 
``Stand By Me'' (Columbia) is $29.99 for the DVD, and includes
commentary by Reiner, a featurette with interviews with King and
Reiner, a Ben E. King music video and a making-of documentary. The
special edition DVD of ``Braveheart'' (Paramount) is $29.99. It
includes commentary by Gibson and a behind-the-scenes documentary. &QL;

   Memo to Hollywood: Enough with Sun Tsu, already. If we had a
dollar for every time some feature film or TV movie superficially
used the Asian general's ancient handbook ``The Art of War,'' we
could make our own movie and do Sun Tsu right. That, or we'd just
buy ownership of the rights and refuse permission anytime some
idiot producer came calling.
</P>
<P>
   We mention this because another brainless, Tsu-inspired action
movie is rolling into theaters, probably prompting the old general
to roll over in his grave or urn or wherever his mortal remains
rest. Titled _ you guessed it _ ``The Art of War,'' it manages to
thoroughly obliterate its Tsuian premise (``appearances are
everything _ in politics and deception'') by being numbingly
obvious at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Tsu might have believed that wars could be won without ever
having to fight, but action movies _ the mediocre ones typically
lacking, as they do, such cunning _ need to rely on good,
old-fashioned combat techniques. Canadian director Christian Duguay
shows flashes of ability to choreograph solid action scenes, but
because of poor pacing and chunky editing, he never manages to make
his movie's brain-rattling explosions and graphic violence coalesce
into a genuinely thrilling experience.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's story involves the half-baked conspiracy behind the
violent efforts to stop a trade agreement between the United States
and China. Wesley Snipes plays a United Nations covert agent trying
to figure out who's behind the plot and why there are so many dead
Chinese people littering the streets of New York. Helping him is a
pretty U.N. interpreter (Marie Matiko), who _ feisty one moment,
subservient the next _ seems to suffer from a personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Matiko isn't the only who suffers at the hands of the screenplay
by Wayne Beach (who wrote Snipes' ``Murder at 1600'') and former
cameraman Simon Davis Barry. When not awkwardly stealing from Sun
Tsu, the script has its characters spouting a never-ending parade
of cliches, apparently hoping that one of them sticks and becomes a
catchphrase. Let us just say that'll be the day, and then let
sleeping dogs lie.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Archer, Donald Sutherland and Maury Chaykin collect what we
hope were substantial paychecks for their work here, although it is
nice watching Archer playing something other than the dutiful wife.
(She's Snipes' boss at the U.N.) As for Snipes, he seems to have
succeeded where Jean-Claude Van Damme couldn't, becoming a B-movie
action hero during down time for the genre. We're trusting his
paycheck was sizable, too.
</P>
<P>
   ____ &QL; 
The film: ``The Art of War''; rated R (strong violence, strong
language and nudity). &QL;

CHEERLEADING FILM DELIVERS _ HONEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe sitting through so many incompetent Hollywood movies this
summer dulls critical faculties. Yet the more I think about ``Bring
It On,'' the more I feel justified in having enjoyed it from start
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a cheerleader comedy, you say. There's only been one
good cheerleading film in mankind's history, that Texas murdering
mom thing on cable ... and that was more about a murdering mom.
More commonly, whenever pompons appear in a movie, such as in the
current ``Replacements,'' they represent the cranial content of the
film's creators.
</P>
<P>
   So, liking this thing is kind of embarrassing. And some guys
just aren't going to get behind a movie about cheerleaders, no
matter how witty its comedy, surprisingly solid its plotting and
character work, and its copious exposure of teen-age midriffs.
There are several words for those kinds of men, but in this case
we'll just call them fools.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, ``Bring It On'' indeed boasts all of those virtues and
many more, among them the best coming-of-age story a major studio's
stumbled onto since ``Clueless'' and _ I gulp here _ absolutely
thrilling cheers.
</P>
<P>
   There, I said it. And I don't care! Being respected was nice
while it lasted, but these days respect seems a fair tradeoff for
that increasingly rare experience of a full-out good time at the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, one of the smartest moves in Jessica Bendinger's
marvelously juggled script is its constant acknowledgment of just
how little respect the average person naturally bears for the
insufferably peppy. She constantly plays into our prejudices while
sneakily accruing detail upon detail about just how much talent and
hard work it takes to rise to the top of the competitive
cheerleading pyramid. This narrative strategy disarms skepticism to
the point where we can fully appreciate the athletic artistry of
complicated cheer routines.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see, then, why the cheer squad at San Diego's
cheekily named Rancho Carne High is the school's pride and joy.
Five-time national competition winners, they outshine the fumblebum
football team at every game.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of her senior year, all bubbleheaded, newly
anointed cheer squad captain Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) can
apply her limited reserves of serious thought to is maintaining her
upscale alma mater's stellar reputation as America's handstand
Harvard. But a series of calamitous events confirm her
superstitious notion that dropping some stupid sacred baton at
cheer camp cursed her (``Cheerleading urban legends?'' an appalled
confidant says, eyes a-rollin', upon hearing the troubled
confession).
</P>
<P>
   But adversity turns Torrance's brain bubbles into thought
balloons. She has to pump her imagination, tax her people skills,
develop both political savvy and social consciousness, confront her
doubts and locate her true confidence _ all while still mainly
caring about winning the nationals. In other words, Torrance must
become a real leader, and it's hard to think of any actress who's
charted such a thorough journey to maturity while maintaining the
crack comic timing and girlish hysteria Dunst displays here.
</P>
<P>
   And she can jump, too.
</P>
<P>
   So can Dunst's equally entertaining co-stars. Eliza Dushku from
TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' adds delectably judged mockery as
a punkish gymnast transfer who can't believe she's got to work with
these spirited squealers. Gabrielle Union and Natina Reed, Shamari
Fears and Brandi Williams of the pop group Blaque express nicely
modulated anger and pride as the East Compton Clovers, an
inner-city squad that, Torrance learns, to her horror, her
predecessor has been ripping off for years. The male contingent is
represented by Jesse Bradford's supportive skeptic and Ian Roberts'
hilarious, Bob Fosse-inspired choreography Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, director Peyton Reed, making his feature debut
following some Disney TV movies and Comedy Central sketch shows,
handles the racial conflict here as adroitly as he balances farce
and precision acrobatics. Pacing and tonal management is expert
throughout, even if the film could have done without the kooky,
cliched teen argot some adult obviously made up. Minor characters
sometimes transcend stereotypes, sometimes don't, and the sex
jokes, while underplayed in comparison to most recent raunchfests,
are predictably immature.
</P>
<P>
   But a few flaws don't prevent ``Bring It On'' from winning you
over. Go girls.  &QL;

  Trying to shed her bad-girl persona, Eliza Dushku brings on the new
roles 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Popularity. It can be a double-pointed stake.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Eliza Dushku has got that lesson down. The Boston-bred
actress has certainly seen her pop-culture profile spike in the
last two years as her recurring role as Faith _ a vampire-slayer
gone bad _ on the ``Buffy'' and ``Angel'' television shows has made
her a teen icon. Her movie career is heating up, too, with a
co-starring role in the cheerleading comedy ``Bring It On'' as the
latest example.
</P>
<P>
   But success comes with complications. The darkly attractive,
smokey- voiced Dushku, a college professor's exuberant daughter who
shares an L.A. home with one of her big brothers, is already having
to counter ``bad girl'' stereotyping. And while fans of the WB's
horror dramas have mostly been idolizing, there are the few, she
acknowledges, ``who are so far into the fantasy aspects of the show
that they get in my face with, `Who do you think you are, trying to
start something with Buffy? You think you're tough?' And I'm like,
'No! I'm just an actress.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the letters from prison are lovely, too, let me tell ya,''
she adds with a nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On,'' of course, is all about the popularity issue in
its purest, most ritualized form. The film stars Kirsten Dunst as
the new captain of a championship high school cheerleading squad
and Dushku as Missy, a transfer student who only joins the pep
contingent because the school doesn't have a program for her real
specialty, gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character of Missy was really important for the movie
because she represents the audience's point of view about
cheerleading,'' explains ``Bring It On'' director Peyton Reed.
``She comes in very skeptical of that world and very cynical, and
Eliza has a certain tough, tomboyish quality that was the furthest
thing away from a cheerleader, which was perfect for that role. But
of all the actors, she was the one that really, really dug in and
bonded with all the others during cheer training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually the kid who made oaths on the sideline with my
best friend that we'd never be cheerleaders,'' admits Dushku, who
followed noteworthy juvenile appearances in such films as ``True
Lies'' and ``This Boy's Life'' with a high school-finishing
education break. ``But doing it for this movie, I learned so much.
That sounds kind of cliched, but I had never been part of a team
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gave me a whole new respect for not just cheerleading
as a sport, but for the people involved and their devotion. I mean,
it takes so much; you need to know dance and gymnastics, and it's
pretty admirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku (her Albanian-derived name rhymes with ``push'') spent
four weeks at cheer boot camp to train for the production. Real
competition cheerleaders, who also appear as members of assorted
teams in the movie, helped get the actors up to acrobatic,
enthusiasm-oozing speed. Dushku is duly proud that her resulting
performance in the film only required one stunt-doubled shot:
Missy's audition for the squad that included multiple gymnastics
flips.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the trust games in the world can't build confidence
where only experience will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got hurt; the guys caught us every time,'' she says.
``But I grew up with three older brothers who I never knew would
catch me when they threw me up in the air or not, so for the first
week or two I was always holding onto the guys' scalps. They were
like, 'Ouch! You've gotta let go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging some similarities between the movie and her
action-packed TV gig, Dushku is quick to note that most of the
fighting on ``Buffy'' and ``Angel'' involves highly trained
stuntpeople _ hence the reluctance to take on viewers who want to
show her how tough they are. Call it a modern actress's dilemma; in
previous generations, it was only macho stars like John Wayne and
Clint Eastwood who had to answer challenges to their make-believe
images.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dushku longs for the days of female delicacy or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do anything my brothers could do, better or
as well,'' she reveals. ``Times are changing, obviously. When I was
younger, little girls couldn't play tag football with the boys,
they were supposed to play with dolls. But it's an equality thing
now, acknowledging that women are strong and can be fierce and
don't have to live under the stereotype that they can't break a
nail.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new culture is, of course, just as quick to churn out
other stereotypes. Dushku understands that typecasting has to be
undercut before it has a chance to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy playing Faith, because the bad girl can be a
very interesting character who's too often played very
black-and-white,'' she observes. ``I enjoy playing bad girls in a
way that surprises people and I play them well, but it's in no way
the only role I would want to play, or that I have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I don't play the bad girl in 'Bring It On.' But I'm
not a blond-haired blue-eyed girl, so I'm still kind of thought of
in that way. Right now, I don't mind it because contrast and
conflict is interesting to me. But in the future, I'll probably
want to be a good girl at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Checking the career near-term, it looks like a one-out-of-three
score. Dushku plays the party animal from the wrong side of the
tracks in the upcoming supernatural thriller ``Soul Survivor'' and
a New York gang girl in the Francis Coppola-produced ``Taking on
the Neighborhood.'' She describes her role in the high school
comedy ``The New Guy,'' however, as ``the norm, sweet character in
this movie full of comic madness.''
</P>
<P>
   But while she's savvy enough to pay some attention to career
management, Dushku generally approaches acting with a refreshing
lack of neurosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound cocky or anything, but the truth is that
acting was never my passion and it isn't even now,'' she says. ``I
do love it, but I just choose roles on the basis of doing things
I've never done before and, hopefully, will learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   Dushku's attitude is apparently inherited. It was one of her
brothers, Nate, who first caught the bug; she got her initial
commercial job from tagging along with him to an audition. But
neither kid was the product of stage-mothering. Quite the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 10, my mother wouldn't even come home to drive me
to my first open call,'' she recalls with a laugh. ``When they
called for my first L.A. screen test, she said 'No, I don't want
that kind of life for my daughter.' My stepfather was like, 'Judy,
it's a free trip for you and Eliza. You guys can go to the beach!'
Then she was like, 'Oh, yeah.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was partially mom's idea to take the two-year
school-finishing break back home (grades had been sliding), but
also a desire on Eliza's part to live the last stretch of her
childhood as normally as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But her celebrity preceded her. As we said, popularity can stab
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was immediately labeled 'The Movie Star' and not invited
into a lot of the cliques that had been created in the first half
of high school,'' she recalls. ``No one in school likes actresses,
and they give you a hard time. Part of it's cool, though, because
you get so glorified when you're working. Everyone on the set is
always flattering you, so going back to high school and having to
fend for yourself kind of balances everything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was hard,'' she admits. ``I came home many days, like,
sobbing crying. They made fun of everything: my clothes, my body,
my perceived attitude. But you get through it; I'm alive to tell
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alive and kicking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In fashion circles, Regis Philbin is a miracle story.
</P>
<P>
   Here's this 65-year-old, gray-haired host of ``Live With Regis''
who's never been known for having any sense of style _ good or bad
_ and suddenly everybody wants the shirt off his back.
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   And his tie to match.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, good ol' !ital!Reege, the guy who spent 15 years upstaged
by Kathie Lee Gifford's hair and skimpy clothes, has become a
pop-culture icon, fashion plate, not to mention a hero of the
menswear business as the dapper host of the blockbuster TV game
show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're talking about his monochromatic shirt-and-tie
ensembles that have become his trademark on that slick,
dramatically lighted prime-time show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter that the dark shirt with matching tie _ once linked
to the Mafia _ has been seen on runways for years by everybody from
Giorgio Armani to Hugo Boss to Calvin Klein ... or that Tom Cruise,
Nick Nolte and Tom Hanks have worn them to Hollywood soirees for
years,'' comments the tart-tongued fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it couldn't be me who made it famous, let's hear three
cheers for Regis. He's a great guy,'' Blackwell adds.
</P>
<P>
   So, fashion fans, it's Regis and his new Regis for Van Heusen
shirts that have joined the list of other look-like-a-million-bucks
fads, along with the pashmina stole and platinum jewels.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles on Wednesday to personally introduce the
nationwide launch of the new Regis collection (just two days before
his 66th birthday), Philbin seems to be enjoying his new-found
fashion fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I worked here in L.A. years ago, I wore (TV anchor) Jerry
Dunphy's hand-me-downs, so look at the stuff now, come and talk to
me,'' he says to a crowd of hundreds at Macy's at the Fashion
Square in Sherman Oaks, before signing photographs, ties and
shirts. Earlier in the day, Regis _ dressed in the flint shirt and
tie and three-button charcoal gray jacket and trousers _ appeared
at the Robinsons-May in Westside Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Regis from `The Tonight Show With Joey Bishop,' and
this is the best he's ever looked,'' says Mary Desjardins, 62, of
Northridge, who visited the Sherman Oaks store and bought a gray
shirt-and-tie ensemble for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Russo, spokeswoman for the Regis for Van Heusen company,
says they offered Philbin his own line of clothing as soon as they
saw the show's phenomenal success. ``And his final answer was 'yes'
to Van Heusen's suggestion of dramatic monochromatic shirts and
ties that !ital!pop on the dark set,'' Russo says.
</P>
<P>
   Russo wants to assure shoppers the Regis shirts and ties are
just like those worn by Philbin on the game show. The cotton shirts
come in black, cobalt, blue bay (light blue), antique tan,
eggplant, flint and basil, and the silk tie colors match those
hues. Each month through spring 2001, Van Heusen plans to introduce
new colors, such as loden, chicory and hunter green, Russo says,
adding that the shirts will be more iridescent and the ties more
textured.
</P>
<P>
   Van Heusen is projecting retail sales of $50 million by the end
of the year and retailers already confirm the style is an amazing
hit. Robinsons-May fashion director Milinda Martin says the style
has an ageless appeal. ``What's strange is that, unlike other
fashion trends, there's no age factor. Customers in their 20s and
up are buying it, unlike most fashion trends that appeal only to
the young,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   And the proof is in the sales reports. According to Martin,
``Even before we got the Regis collection from Van Heusen,
customers came in asking for the look, and it's accounted for 65
percent of the sales of our dress shirts and 35 percent of our
neckwear, which is a huge indicator of the trend's popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Regis ensembles seem to be richer than others.
According to Martin, the antique tan combo is the best-seller for
Robinsons-May stores, while it's the burgundy and navy blue shades
that have been the most popular sellers at the Van Heusen store in
the Camarillo Outlet, according to salesman Tony Whaley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the navy shirt for my husband. He picked it out _ we
didn't know it was Regis' favorite,'' said Deirdre Wilson, 43, of
Woodland Hills. ``Men's fashion hasn't changed much in years, and
this new look is so refreshing. But it probably won't make my
husband dress up more.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Plamondon, 53, of Granada Hills bought a navy shirt for
himself at Macy's on Wednesday. ``I'm a stockbroker, so I usually
dress up, but I'm going to be the first in the office with the new
Regis look. I really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that he admires Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I hope I look that good when I'm 66,'' Plamondon says
with a laugh. ``He's a Joe-on-the-street kinda guy with a
great-looking wife and a seven-digit paycheck, and I think he'll
influence everybody to dress up more.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kissel, fashion editor of the Robb Report _ an
international men's luxury lifestyle magazine _ agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the everyman. He's not buff like Bruce Willis, and he
appeals to couch potatoes whose only introduction to fashion is the
TV show. I mean, he's an older guy, and he's suddenly looking smart
and sharp,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think the monochromatic look is appealing to the masses
because it's easy. You don't have to worry about which print goes
with which stripe,'' he adds. ``And while I can't say I love the
look, I'm a real strong supporter of anything that helps the men's
fashion industry. And maybe before the end of the next TV season,
Regis will give a few pointers on socks, which should always match
your pants, not your shoes _ or your ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hall, co-host of E!'s ``Fashion Emergency'' and spokesman
for the Fashion Association based in New York, also praises the
``Millionaire'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, tone-on-tone is a wardrobe crutch,'' says Hall, ``But
I've always liked the look because it has a professional appearance
with a fashion edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also observes that while the Regis collection is definitely
an evening look that goes well with a dark suit, it can be worn out
to lunch without a jacket. And it even looks good with jeans and a
black leather jacket, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a lot of mileage to a wardrobe (nobody remembers
exactly what you wore the last time they saw you), and now Van
Heusen's new Regis collection makes it incredibly easy and
affordable,'' he comments. ``I mean, a couple of years ago when the
trend started, you had to spend a lot of time matching the texture
and sheen of a tie to a shirt and now it's all done for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who's been a guest on several talk shows, but never
Philbin's, has high hopes for fashion's newest star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime something is popularized by television, it has
authority, and I'm rooting for Regis to bring back office dress
codes.''

A WELSH TALE OF TRAGIC LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alternately dour and hyper-tragic, the Oscar-nominated Welsh
film ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' is intriguing most of the time despite
its flailing narrative swings. That's largely due to fine
performances all around, a generally insightful script by director
Paul Morrison and a juxtaposition of ethnic genres that, while
nurturing the conventions of each, makes fascinating formations out
of their collision.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ``Romeo and Juliet'' once again, and like most
versions it reaffirms the concept's durability.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen Welsh mining movies before. You've seen Jewish
immigrant movies before. But this is the first Jewish immigrants in
a Welsh mining village romance, and it covers the hybrid
possibilities pretty thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1911, a strike is brewing, and Gaenor (soulful ingenue Nia
Roberts), the daughter of a pious, narrow-minded miner's family, is
feeling pretty pinched. She was engaged some time ago, but the
marriage was called off when her betrothed had some undescribed
accident in the coal pit, leaving her neither a virgin nor very
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Newly arrived Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd, star of the British
``Horatio Hornblower'' TV series) meets Gaenor while selling fabric
door-to-door. Though his Orthodox family members on the other side
of town have done little to disguise their Russian origins (the
film's dialogue shifts between English and subtitled Yiddish and
Welsh), Solomon aspires to assimilation and speaks the King's
tongue perfectly. Gaenor thinks she's English. He thinks she's
something. She reciprocates.
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon is so worried about revealing his true ethnicity
that he claims his name is Sam and that his father is a railway
engineer, rarely home and thus unable to be introduced to his new
girlfriend. Although Gaenor displays no trace of anti-Semitism,
Solomon's fears are understandable. Prejudice is evident everywhere
in the community, and when economic times get tough (as they always
do in British mine country, or movies set there anyway) the local
minister goes so far as to stir up a scapegoat pogrom against the
new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another reason for Solomon's deception: his parents
are just as bigoted as Gaenor's, as their actions prove when
evidence of his romance with the gentile becomes undeniable.
Ostracism, forced separation, perhaps even martyrdom comes to test
the lovers' commitment. Twenty years later, in America, this would
all be the stuff of a vulgar but benign comedy called ``Abbie's
Irish Rose.'' But in this time and place, it's tragedy of truly
biblical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   As overwrought as it gets, however, ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' boasts
behavioral accuracy down to its pettiest characters, an
appreciation of how two long-oppressed ethnic groups maintain their
dignity through (often unforgiving) faith and a convincing portrait
of everyday life as it's lived by both cultures. And while modern
audiences may rightfully despise the small-mindedness that causes
Solomon and Gaenor so much difficulty, the movie accurately places
some responsibility for their fate on unwise choices the couple
make together and individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solomon &AMP; Gaenor'' may go overboard on the grim melodrama at
times, but it more often displays emotional, social and ethical
intelligence of a high order.

JACK OF HEARTS
</HEADLINE>
  Daughter captures Elliott's ramblin' ways on film and builds a bond
with the man she's only starting to know 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aiyana Elliott always had it in her mind that she would make a
film about her folk singer father, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, one day.
She just didn't figure it would be her first movie.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year that she graduated from New York University's
film school, a host of her father's friends and contemporaries,
people like Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, folk
singer Townes Van Zandt and country's John Denver, died. And Aiyana
realized that if she was going to tell the remarkable story of the
cowboy singer who acted as folk music's bridge from Woody Guthrie
to Bob Dylan, she'd better make it her first priority.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting labor of love, ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack,''
came after Elliott spent two years traveling down America's back
roads with her father, trying to find out what makes him tick. She
admittedly didn't have a clue because she never has really known
her father. He lived up to his nickname during her formative years,
and even as adults, Aiyana admits that she had never enjoyed an
``actual conversation'' with Jack until after the documentary
premiered this year at the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a struggle to talk to him, and that's been
baffling and hurtful to me because my dad has such a natural gift
with people,'' Aiyana, 31, says. ``The challenge has always been to
get him to share that gift with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a large way, that's what ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack''
is about _ a daughter trying to bond with her charming, but
distant, father. That personal aspect gives the documentary a
universality that made it a hit with audiences at Sundance (the
movie won the special jury prize for artistic achievement) and at
subsequent film festivals. Moviegoers' enthusiasm has, in turn,
finally helped the Elliotts communicate for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey we've taken since completing the film _ sharing
the movie with audiences and talking about it with them and each
other _ has brought us a long way,'' Aiyana says. ``It has totally
improved our communication. In fact, in recent weeks, we've started
to talk more and more freely and kind of gotten to know each other.
I'm sure the problems we have communicating will persist in certain
ways, but it feels to me that we've begun a great new chapter in
our relationship. It has been a wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jack about that, though, and you're likely to get a more
veiled response, not because he doesn't feel the same way but
because _ well, he's Ramblin' Jack Elliott. And as friend Kris
Kristofferson says in the movie, Ramblin' Jack earned his name as
much for his storytelling as his wandering ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the movie 10 times, and each time I see it, I get
more and more little laughs out of it,'' Jack, now 69, says. ``I
see more funny things that I didn't think were funny before. But I
don't ever get used to seeing myself. I'm too ugly to be able to
tolerate looking at myself that much. But there's parts that are
beautiful and I'm amazed by that and tickled by that and fascinated
by that. I don't ever get tired of watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack'' mixes current interviews and
concert performances with extraordinary archival footage to present
a portrait of a man who's truly one of a kind. Born Elliott Charles
Adnopoz, the son of a Brooklyn doctor, Jack rebelled from an early
age against his parents' expectations (when his mother saw him in
concert for the first time, she remarked, ``Look at those hands.
What a fine surgeon he would have made'') and the confines of city
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the footage of him as a little boy and it's amazing to
see how much his personality was already formed,'' Aiyana says.
``His love of adventure and the West and his desire to explore the
world are all fully there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack ran away from home at 15 and joined a traveling rodeo. He
soon fell in love with cowboy songs and folk and roots music, and
became fast friends with Woody Guthrie after showing up at
Guthrie's Coney Island home one day. Elliott learned much from
Guthrie (Guthrie once said that ``Jack sounds more like me than I
do''), but his flat-picking style of guitar playing was all his
own.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, it was Elliott's turn to teach, acting as a
mentor to a young Bob Dylan. In fact, at Dylan's first concert at
the legendary New York folk venue Gerde's Folk City, a sign was
posted outside reading: ``Now appearing: The Son of Jack Elliott.''
</P>
<P>
   However influential, Elliott has never aspired to be a star,
although he hasn't necessarily desired the periods of obscurity
that have distinguished his long career, either. He has received
some recognition late in the game, including a Grammy for his 1995
folk album ``South Coast.'' In 1998, President Clinton gave him the
National Medal of Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The film includes footage of Elliott receiving that award as
well as fascinating, never-before-seen clips from the Guthrie
family's private collection and raw material from filmmakers D.A.
Pennebaker (who made the Bob Dylan documentary ``Don't Look Back'')
and Bobby Neuwirth. Elliott's favorite scene revolves around an
appearance on the Johnny Cash Show, where he had to simultaneously
tune and play his guitar during a duet with the Man in Black.
</P>
<P>
   After fashioning a two-hour film from the 100 hours of material
she shot and the 50 hours of archival footage, Aiyana kept the
movie from her father until its January premiere at Sundance. The
reason? Self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad is somebody, if left to his own devices in a room with
this movie, could easily convince himself that it is a terrible
indictment of his own character,'' Aiyana says. ``He's paranoid
that way. But seeing it with an audience helped give him some
perspective on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it ever. Jack calls the movie ``great'' and appreciates the
attention it has given his music. And even though he recently
married (for the fifth time) and, for the first time, truly has a
home to call his own, Jack Elliott is ramblin' more than ever these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a dramatic explosion, but I'm getting a lot
more gigs,'' Elliott says. ``And I still like performing in front
of a live audience, providing that the audience is alive. And they
seem to be these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Aiyana: ``Wavy Gravy called my dad the Lee Strasberg of the
Lone Prairie, like a Method folk singer. I think people respond to
that. He's just up there telling a story, but he does it in a way
unlike anybody else. There's nobody else like him, I can tell you
that.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Managers used to have only two choices when it came to getting
employees from distant locations together to discuss information:
Send them by plane, train or automobile to meet in person, or set
up an audio conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another alternative. A Web conference _ essentially
an audio conference with visuals _ enables managers to communicate
visual information to a group and yet never ask them to leave their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   To launch a Web conference, the manager who's organizing it just
asks interested parties to log onto a URL. at the same time,
participants dial into an audio conference. (Putting out both audio
and visual information simultaneously on computers is possible but
still considerably more primitive and unreliable.)
</P>
<P>
   What the participants see is a screen that the meeting
coordinator controls. He or she can present visual information in
any format, from streaming video to PowerPoint slides to notes in
Word. Other optional features include chat lines, group white
boards and note-taking devices.
</P>
<P>
   As with any relatively new technology, there are glitches. First
is the Web itself. It can go down at the user end, be maddeningly
slow or annoy users with its sometimes sophomoric interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Web conferencing technology is still imperfect. The more
complicated the visuals, the slower and jerkier they can appear.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, to be successful in this new genre, the meeting
organizer must coordinate the smooth delivery of the visuals with a
successful audio conference. Either one of these tasks can be
daunting for the average stressed-out businessperson. Doing both at
once may be beyond the grasp of many.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these hazards, the use of Web conferencing is
spreading rapidly. For example, brokerage houses are beginning to
use it to hold analysts' briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a quarterly basis, they used to do a teleconference and now
they'll do a Web-based meeting. The presenter will send out a slide
show and the audio to maybe 300 to 400 analysts and investors
around the country,'' says Mike Archer, president of PresentPLUS, a
Web conferencing company based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those people will not interact very much,'' Archer adds.
``They won't use any of the interactive tools that are available
even in a Java (Web) format. It's one-way communication.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other companies are beginning to do training with
smaller groups of employees using Web conferencing with interactive
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Web conferencing is so inexpensive,'' Archer says,
``Hewlett-Packard and Rockwell Automation both do training shows
twice a month. That way, even though the information is not
terribly critical, they can get it out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Reed Hoke III, publisher of Direct Marketing, identifies
another use for Web conferencing: ``The small businesses that I
deal with belong to direct marketing clubs that sponsor regional
meetings with phenomenal speakers,'' he says. ``But people can't
get there. This technology is going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales presentations similarly become much more cost-effective
when delivered over the Web, if only because salespeople can reach
many more customers without leaving the office. It remains an open
question as to how many new customers can be brought in using the
relatively impersonal Web format, but the Web can be used to
communicate regularly with well-established customers.
</P>
<P>
   The economics are often compelling. For somewhere around $5,000
per site per hour-long event, companies can set up fully
interactive rooms for their employees to hear the latest strategic
thinking or fiscal year plans.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Web conferencing may never completely replace the
dynamics of a face-to-face meeting. The technology is still in its
adolescence and has its awkward moments. Links go down, screens are
small, the video can be blurry depending on the available bandwidth
and the quality of the equipment. Moreover, we humans are animals,
and we learn to trust each other by getting physically close
together.
</P>
<P>
   But after contemplating the time or expense involved in yet
another round of travel to distant places for a meeting with work
colleagues, remember that there is an alternative to the meeting
... and it's virtual.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At most companies, giving or getting a performance appraisal has
all the appeal of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers often loathe doing appraisals. If they thought they
could get away with it, they'd skip the repulsive chore entirely,''
observes a new study of best-practice performance management by the
American Productivity &AMP; Quality Center, or APQC, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are finding ways to abolish formal these
unpopular evaluations. Even so, most organizations grit their teeth
and plow ahead, if only because they feel a need for some way of
assessing employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the results and outputs that a reliable
performance appraisal system can deliver,'' APQC says.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is changing on the appraisal front. In the past,
performance appraisals were often treated as a charade in which
employees, like the children of Lake Wobegon, were all rated above
average.
</P>
<P>
   No more. According to the APQC, best-practice companies now
believe that ``too few employees are terminated each year for poor
performance,'' and so are focusing their performance-management
systems specifically on weeding out noncontributors. These
companies are also beginning to single out star performers for pay
increases and other rewards not available to the majority of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, performance-appraisal systems are now likely to
have teeth _ and employees are increasingly likely to be graded and
ranked like students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents managers with a dilemma, and not just
because assessing job performance is harder than grading answers on
a math test. The most successful work environments are those in
which people feel a sense of teamwork _ ``we're all in this
together'' _ and do whatever is required at the moment rather than
sticking to rigid job descriptions. Stratification and rankings
don't exactly encourage this collaborative attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the fear of losing your job because you're rated in
the bottom tenth. If politics creeps into the rankings _ and it may
_ the resentment will fester like mold on last week's vanilla
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a manager to do? One solution is to work with the
company's human resources department to ensure that the appraisal
system is perceived as fair.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the APQC says, many companies actively solicit
employee involvement in shaping the system, and then make a point
of surveying employees to assess its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A second solution: Make sure the employees' performance reviews
focus on variables within their control. People are responsible for
their attitudes and work habits. They can't be held accountable for
performance problems caused by poor training, inadequate equipment
or conflicting instructions from management.
</P>
<P>
   Putting teeth in performance appraisals won't necessarily make
them more popular. So long as they're perceived as fair, though, it
may make them more effective.

<P>
   Managers used to have only two choices when it came to getting
employees from distant locations together to discuss information:
Send them by plane, train or automobile to meet in person, or set
up an audio conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another alternative. A Web conference _ essentially
an audio conference with visuals _ enables managers to communicate
visual information to a group and yet never ask them to leave their
offices.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   To launch a Web conference, the manager who's organizing it just
asks interested parties to log onto a URL. at the same time,
participants dial into an audio conference. (Putting out both audio
and visual information simultaneously on computers is possible but
still considerably more primitive and unreliable.)
</P>
<P>
   What the participants see is a screen that the meeting
coordinator controls. He or she can present visual information in
any format, from streaming video to PowerPoint slides to notes in
Word. Other optional features include chat lines, group white
boards and note-taking devices.
</P>
<P>
   As with any relatively new technology, there are glitches. First
is the Web itself. It can go down at the user end, be maddeningly
slow or annoy users with its sometimes sophomoric interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Web conferencing technology is still imperfect. The more
complicated the visuals, the slower and jerkier they can appear.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, to be successful in this new genre, the meeting
organizer must coordinate the smooth delivery of the visuals with a
successful audio conference. Either one of these tasks can be
daunting for the average stressed-out businessperson. Doing both at
once may be beyond the grasp of many.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these hazards, the use of Web conferencing is
spreading rapidly. For example, brokerage houses are beginning to
use it to hold analysts' briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a quarterly basis, they used to do a teleconference and now
they'll do a Web-based meeting. The presenter will send out a slide
show and the audio to maybe 300 to 400 analysts and investors
around the country,'' says Mike Archer, president of PresentPLUS, a
Web conferencing company based in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those people will not interact very much,'' Archer adds.
``They won't use any of the interactive tools that are available
even in a Java (Web) format. It's one-way communication.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other companies are beginning to do training with
smaller groups of employees using Web conferencing with interactive
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Web conferencing is so inexpensive,'' Archer says,
``Hewlett-Packard and Rockwell Automation both do training shows
twice a month. That way, even though the information is not
terribly critical, they can get it out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Reed Hoke III, publisher of Direct Marketing, identifies
another use for Web conferencing: ``The small businesses that I
deal with belong to direct marketing clubs that sponsor regional
meetings with phenomenal speakers,'' he says. ``But people can't
get there. This technology is going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales presentations similarly become much more cost-effective
when delivered over the Web, if only because salespeople can reach
many more customers without leaving the office. It remains an open
question as to how many new customers can be brought in using the
relatively impersonal Web format, but the Web can be used to
communicate regularly with well-established customers.
</P>
<P>
   The economics are often compelling. For somewhere around $5,000
per site per hour-long event, companies can set up fully
interactive rooms for their employees to hear the latest strategic
thinking or fiscal year plans.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Web conferencing may never completely replace the
dynamics of a face-to-face meeting. The technology is still in its
adolescence and has its awkward moments. Links go down, screens are
small, the video can be blurry depending on the available bandwidth
and the quality of the equipment. Moreover, we humans are animals,
and we learn to trust each other by getting physically close
together.
</P>
<P>
   But after contemplating the time or expense involved in yet
another round of travel to distant places for a meeting with work
colleagues, remember that there is an alternative to the meeting
... and it's virtual.

<P>
   At most companies, giving or getting a performance appraisal has
all the appeal of a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers often loathe doing appraisals. If they thought they
could get away with it, they'd skip the repulsive chore entirely,''
observes a new study of best-practice performance management by the
American Productivity &AMP; Quality Center, or APQC, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are finding ways to abolish formal these
unpopular evaluations. Even so, most organizations grit their teeth
and plow ahead, if only because they feel a need for some way of
assessing employees' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the results and outputs that a reliable
performance appraisal system can deliver,'' APQC says.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is changing on the appraisal front. In the past,
performance appraisals were often treated as a charade in which
employees, like the children of Lake Wobegon, were all rated above
average.
</P>
<P>
   No more. According to the APQC, best-practice companies now
believe that ``too few employees are terminated each year for poor
performance,'' and so are focusing their performance-management
systems specifically on weeding out noncontributors. These
companies are also beginning to single out star performers for pay
increases and other rewards not available to the majority of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, performance-appraisal systems are now likely to
have teeth _ and employees are increasingly likely to be graded and
ranked like students in high school.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents managers with a dilemma, and not just
because assessing job performance is harder than grading answers on
a math test. The most successful work environments are those in
which people feel a sense of teamwork _ ``we're all in this
together'' _ and do whatever is required at the moment rather than
sticking to rigid job descriptions. Stratification and rankings
don't exactly encourage this collaborative attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the fear of losing your job because you're rated in
the bottom tenth. If politics creeps into the rankings _ and it may

  Everyone's crazy about a sharp-dressed man

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
host Regis Philbin talked about his sudden fame as a fashion plate,
his new line of Regis shirts and ties by the Van Heusen Company,
and his off-camera style.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have single-handedly changed the shirt-and-tie business,
and men of all ages want to dress like you on your game show. Is it
a little frightening to suddenly be a fashion idol pursued by the
fashion press or are you loving every second?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not frightening _ it's terrifying. I'm no fashion icon.
I just got lucky with a television show that's running three or
four nights a week on prime time. I couldn't have foreseen it and I
couldn't control it, but here it is, my collection, and I'm proud
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you make a conscious effort to look different than you do
on your morning talk show? Or to set yourself apart from other game
shows?
</P>
<P>
   A: The monochromatic look was the dress code for the original TV
show in Britain. However, my staff on `Live' comes in to review
what I wore the night before on `Millionaire,' and they usually
like what they see but once in a while an odd color will spark a
revolt. (For instance) I was requested not to wear the gold tie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Among your monochromatic shirt-and-tie ensembles worn on
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which is your favorite color and
why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like the dark blue ensemble the best ... and think darker
colors look best on me. And I feel most men would feel the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were in the contestant's seat, which color do you
think would be the luckiest for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it would be blue. Blue is traditionally considered the
best color to wear on television. And I notice most men in the hot
seat wear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do contestants ever ask (or show up) in your shirt-and-tie
ensembles? Are they allowed to copy your look or do the fashion
police keep their dress casual?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think they are encouraged to be casual, but once in awhile
someone slips through in full regalia. I like to see that. Why
should I be the only one wearing a shirt and tie?
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you describe your personal fashion stance away from
the studios? Are you a khakis kind of guy? Is there a cowboy hat in
the closet, or is the elegant `Millionaire' look really you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a khakis kind of guy, but I like the formal
(`Millionaire') look a lot and wear it in my personal life on
numerous occasions. But there's no cowboy hat in the closet (he
chuckles).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Van Heusen approached you about having your own line
of shirts and ties and that you give a lot of input, from the
collar points to the amount of sheen in the ties, but who provides
those elegant pinstripe suits and dark three-button jackets?
</P>
<P>
   A: For the past 10 years, Beau Brummel, a store in the Soho area
of New York, has been providing my wardrobe for both shows. I rely
on them to tell me where fashion is going, and we consult. So as
fashion changes, so may the `Millionaire' look. It's a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you admit fashion is always changing, and so might your
wardrobe. Will we ever be wowed with Reege in plaid or maybe a
blazer and ascot? Or black leather?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a word, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think the success of your new show and image will give
casual Fridays a kick in the pants?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it will encourage men to dress better and if they do,
I think they'll feel better. I never realized it myself, but I'm
glad the dressier look came along because it does make a
difference. &QL; 
---Want Regis Philbin's suit, too? Call the Beau Brummel store at
(212) 219-2666. Those pin-striped designs he favors are priced from
$995 to $1,295. &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fashion circles, Regis Philbin is a miracle story.
</P>
<P>
   Here's this 65-year-old, gray-haired host of ``Live With Regis''
who's never been known for having any sense of style _ good or bad
_ and suddenly everybody wants the shirt off his back.
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   And his tie to match.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, good ol' !ital!Reege, the guy who spent 15 years upstaged
by Kathie Lee Gifford's hair and skimpy clothes, has become a
pop-culture icon, fashion plate, not to mention a hero of the
menswear business as the dapper host of the blockbuster TV game
show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're talking about his monochromatic shirt-and-tie
ensembles that have become his trademark on that slick,
dramatically lighted prime-time show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter that the dark shirt with matching tie _ once linked
to the Mafia _ has been seen on runways for years by everybody from
Giorgio Armani to Hugo Boss to Calvin Klein ... or that Tom Cruise,
Nick Nolte and Tom Hanks have worn them to Hollywood soirees for
years,'' comments the tart-tongued fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it couldn't be me who made it famous, let's hear three
cheers for Regis. He's a great guy,'' Blackwell adds.
</P>
<P>
   So, fashion fans, it's Regis and his new Regis for Van Heusen
shirts that have joined the list of other look-like-a-million-bucks
fads, along with the pashmina stole and platinum jewels.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles on Wednesday to personally introduce the
nationwide launch of the new Regis collection (just two days before
his 66th birthday), Philbin seems to be enjoying his new-found
fashion fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I worked here in L.A. years ago, I wore (TV anchor) Jerry
Dunphy's hand-me-downs, so look at the stuff now, come and talk to
me,'' he says to a crowd of hundreds at Macy's at the Fashion
Square in Sherman Oaks, before signing photographs, ties and
shirts. Earlier in the day, Regis _ dressed in the flint shirt and
tie and three-button charcoal gray jacket and trousers _ appeared
at the Robinsons-May in Westside Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Regis from `The Tonight Show With Joey Bishop,' and
this is the best he's ever looked,'' says Mary Desjardins, 62, of
Northridge, who visited the Sherman Oaks store and bought a gray
shirt-and-tie ensemble for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Russo, spokeswoman for the Regis for Van Heusen company,
says they offered Philbin his own line of clothing as soon as they
saw the show's phenomenal success. ``And his final answer was 'yes'
to Van Heusen's suggestion of dramatic monochromatic shirts and
ties that !ital!pop on the dark set,'' Russo says.
</P>
<P>
   Russo wants to assure shoppers the Regis shirts and ties are
just like those worn by Philbin on the game show. The cotton shirts
come in black, cobalt, blue bay (light blue), antique tan,
eggplant, flint and basil, and the silk tie colors match those
hues. Each month through spring 2001, Van Heusen plans to introduce
new colors, such as loden, chicory and hunter green, Russo says,
adding that the shirts will be more iridescent and the ties more
textured.
</P>
<P>
   Van Heusen is projecting retail sales of $50 million by the end
of the year and retailers already confirm the style is an amazing
hit. Robinsons-May fashion director Milinda Martin says the style
has an ageless appeal. ``What's strange is that, unlike other
fashion trends, there's no age factor. Customers in their 20s and
up are buying it, unlike most fashion trends that appeal only to
the young,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   And the proof is in the sales reports. According to Martin,
``Even before we got the Regis collection from Van Heusen,
customers came in asking for the look, and it's accounted for 65
percent of the sales of our dress shirts and 35 percent of our
neckwear, which is a huge indicator of the trend's popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Regis ensembles seem to be richer than others.
According to Martin, the antique tan combo is the best-seller for
Robinsons-May stores, while it's the burgundy and navy blue shades
that have been the most popular sellers at the Van Heusen store in
the Camarillo Outlet, according to salesman Tony Whaley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the navy shirt for my husband. He picked it out _ we
didn't know it was Regis' favorite,'' said Deirdre Wilson, 43, of
Woodland Hills. ``Men's fashion hasn't changed much in years, and
this new look is so refreshing. But it probably won't make my
husband dress up more.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Plamondon, 53, of Granada Hills bought a navy shirt for
himself at Macy's on Wednesday. ``I'm a stockbroker, so I usually
dress up, but I'm going to be the first in the office with the new
Regis look. I really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that he admires Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I hope I look that good when I'm 66,'' Plamondon says
with a laugh. ``He's a Joe-on-the-street kinda guy with a
great-looking wife and a seven-digit paycheck, and I think he'll
influence everybody to dress up more.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kissel, fashion editor of the Robb Report _ an
international men's luxury lifestyle magazine _ agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the everyman. He's not buff like Bruce Willis, and he
appeals to couch potatoes whose only introduction to fashion is the
TV show. I mean, he's an older guy, and he's suddenly looking smart
and sharp,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think the monochromatic look is appealing to the masses
because it's easy. You don't have to worry about which print goes
with which stripe,'' he adds. ``And while I can't say I love the
look, I'm a real strong supporter of anything that helps the men's
fashion industry. And maybe before the end of the next TV season,
Regis will give a few pointers on socks, which should always match
your pants, not your shoes _ or your ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hall, co-host of E!'s ``Fashion Emergency'' and spokesman
for the Fashion Association based in New York, also praises the
``Millionaire'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, tone-on-tone is a wardrobe crutch,'' says Hall, ``But
I've always liked the look because it has a professional appearance
with a fashion edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also observes that while the Regis collection is definitely
an evening look that goes well with a dark suit, it can be worn out
to lunch without a jacket. And it even looks good with jeans and a
black leather jacket, he adds.

   ``It gives a lot of mileage to a wardrobe (nobody remembers
exactly what you wore the last time they saw you), and now Van
Heusen's new Regis collection makes it incredibly easy and
affordable,'' he comments. ``I mean, a couple of years ago when the
trend started, you had to spend a lot of time matching the texture
and sheen of a tie to a shirt and now it's all done for you.''

   GLOBAL-WARMING-HARVARD-BUSINESS-REVIEW _ In December 1997,
global warming began to assume a prominent position on business
executives' agendas. That's when representatives of 160 nations,
convened by the United Nations in Kyoto, Japan, adopted a plan that
would limit the amounts of greenhouse gases being released into the
atmosphere. If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol will require industrial
nations to dramatically reduce emissions of those gases by 2012.

  Everyone's crazy about a sharp-dressed man 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Sidebar to `Looks like a million.' Short fact box below.) 
By BARBARA De WITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
host Regis Philbin talked about his sudden fame as a fashion plate,
his new line of Regis shirts and ties by the Van Heusen Company,
and his off-camera style.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have single-handedly changed the shirt-and-tie business,
and men of all ages want to dress like you on your game show. Is it
a little frightening to suddenly be a fashion idol pursued by the
fashion press or are you loving every second?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not frightening _ it's terrifying. I'm no fashion icon.
I just got lucky with a television show that's running three or
four nights a week on prime time. I couldn't have foreseen it and I
couldn't control it, but here it is, my collection, and I'm proud
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you make a conscious effort to look different than you do
on your morning talk show? Or to set yourself apart from other game
shows?
</P>
<P>
   A: The monochromatic look was the dress code for the original TV
show in Britain. However, my staff on `Live' comes in to review
what I wore the night before on `Millionaire,' and they usually
like what they see but once in a while an odd color will spark a
revolt. (For instance) I was requested not to wear the gold tie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Among your monochromatic shirt-and-tie ensembles worn on
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which is your favorite color and
why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like the dark blue ensemble the best ... and think darker
colors look best on me. And I feel most men would feel the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were in the contestant's seat, which color do you
think would be the luckiest for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it would be blue. Blue is traditionally considered the
best color to wear on television. And I notice most men in the hot
seat wear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do contestants ever ask (or show up) in your shirt-and-tie
ensembles? Are they allowed to copy your look or do the fashion
police keep their dress casual?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think they are encouraged to be casual, but once in awhile
someone slips through in full regalia. I like to see that. Why
should I be the only one wearing a shirt and tie?
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you describe your personal fashion stance away from
the studios? Are you a khakis kind of guy? Is there a cowboy hat in
the closet, or is the elegant `Millionaire' look really you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a khakis kind of guy, but I like the formal
(`Millionaire') look a lot and wear it in my personal life on
numerous occasions. But there's no cowboy hat in the closet (he
chuckles).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Van Heusen approached you about having your own line
of shirts and ties and that you give a lot of input, from the
collar points to the amount of sheen in the ties, but who provides
those elegant pinstripe suits and dark three-button jackets?
</P>
<P>
   A: For the past 10 years, Beau Brummel, a store in the Soho area
of New York, has been providing my wardrobe for both shows. I rely
on them to tell me where fashion is going, and we consult. So as
fashion changes, so may the `Millionaire' look. It's a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you admit fashion is always changing, and so might your
wardrobe. Will we ever be wowed with Reege in plaid or maybe a
blazer and ascot? Or black leather?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a word, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think the success of your new show and image will give
casual Fridays a kick in the pants?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it will encourage men to dress better and if they do,
I think they'll feel better. I never realized it myself, but I'm
glad the dressier look came along because it does make a
difference. &QL; 
---Want Regis Philbin's suit, too? Call the Beau Brummel store at
(212) 219-2666. Those pin-striped designs he favors are priced from
$995 to $1,295. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The high-profile court cases over Amazon's patent on its
one-click shopping process and Priceline's patent on its reverse
auctions have propelled the notion of patenting business methods
into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, however, a new phenomenon. Businesses have always been
free to patent their methods. Companies have, for instance,
patented the way they sell airline tickets and the way they manage
moneymarket accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But in an information economy, in which entire business models
can be embedded in digital code, attempts to use patents as
competitive weapons have intensified. So have the attendant
controversies.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on this contentious topic, Q. Todd Dickinson,
director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, talks about the
myths and realities of business patents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What constitutes a patentable business model?
</P>
<P>
   A: We distinguish between a business model, which is a general
vision or strategy, and a business method, which is a specific way
of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   In law, there's a four-part test for patentability of a business
method, as there is for any invention. The way of doing business
has to be useful. It has to be new. It can't be so incremental that
it would be obvious to a skilled practitioner. And in the
application process, disclosure of the innovation has to be so
complete that fellow practitioners can understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are we seeing a rush to patent business methods now?
</P>
<P>
   A: For a couple of reasons. First is the court opinion on State
Street Bank vs. Signature Financial that was handed down about two
years ago, which definitively stated that software that governs
business methods can be patented as long as it produces some
concrete, useful and tangible result. That ruling made companies
much more aware that they could patent software- based business
methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there's been a general rise in software
patents of all types, fueled in part by the burst of innovation
generated by the Internet. That being said, though, let me put it
in context. We issued about 161,000 patents last year. Some 600
were software-related business methods. I expect we'll issue
another 1,000 such patents this year. That's a fairly modest amount
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you concerned that patenting business methods will
ultimately dampen innovation?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is not the first time that argument has been raised. It
was raised over telephony. It was raised in the chemical industry
when companies applied for patents on various monomers and
copolymers. And it was argued originally in relation to patenting
any kind of software at all. But in all those cases, innovation in
the general industry actually increased.
</P>
<P>
   Patents give their owners rights to their innovations _ for 20
years from the date they file the application, currently. But then
patent owners must make their innovations public, which lets other
people build on them.
</P>
<P>
   Historically _ and I would argue it's no different now _ that
can give small companies and entrepreneurs some parity with large,
powerful business concerns, rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about complaints in some quarters that companies are
getting patents for business methods that aren't really new?
</P>
<P>
   A: The patent office does not issue patents for old business
methods simply made electronic. it is partly our responsibility to
find evidence of existing methods _ what the patent office calls
prior art _ to make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   We have a very good collection of software prior art in a range
of disciplines, including business, and we continue to expand that
collection. We held hearings last year to make sure we were getting
access to prior art that exists outside of the patent process,
particularly as it relates to software.
</P>
<P>
   But people have pointed out that, in the past, when a lot of the
software was released, prior art was not available. And even now,
we don't have a consolidated, comprehensive database _ a one-stop
shop _ of prior art for software that embodies business methods, as
we do in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   In chemistry, for example, there's the Chem Abstracts, and in
medical technology there's Medline. If some party would develop
that, it would be a great help.
</P>
<P>
   But remember, too, that applicants must understand that they are
legally required to disclose all relevant prior art themselves. if
they do not, they risk invalidating their patent.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing

<TEXT>
<P>
   The possibility that the Earth's surface temperature is rising
caught the public's attention during the brutal summer of 1988. But
it wasn't until December 1997 that global warming began to assume a
prominent position on business executives' agendas. That's when
representatives of 160 nations, convened by the United Nations in
Kyoto, Japan, adopted a plan that would limit the amounts of carbon
dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases being released into
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol was accepted by representatives of the
industrial nations, but in most cases the full legislative bodies
each have to ratify the protocol. If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol
will require industrial nations to dramatically reduce emissions of
those gases by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe that human activity is contributing to an
increase in the Earth's average surface temperature. Scientists
also agree that an increase of as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit is
likely to cause more severe storms, floods and droughts and to
accelerate the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol also sounded a warning to business leaders.
If large-scale reductions of emissions are mandated by law, many
manufacturers will have to dramatically change the way they
operate. They will also have to contend with shifts in demand, as
energy-efficient products overtake those that have long been
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin? A good place to start is to look closely at the
risks _ and the opportunities _ associated with shifts in the
weather, potential regulatory changes and the battle over public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   BAD WEATHER AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Most of the extreme effects associated with climate change have
yet to emerge. Nevertheless, companies whose assets are directly
affected by the weather must start planning now.
</P>
<P>
   For example, insurance companies should adapt their predictive
models to ensure that their prices are accurate and to prevent
large financial losses because of payouts after unexpectedly severe
storms.
</P>
<P>
   To value waterfront properties correctly, real estate companies
will have to keep up with the latest thinking on changes in flood
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that sell seeds, risk management may mean
developing crops that can deliver higher yields in drier
conditions. For timber operations, it may mean spending more on
fire and pest management: Drier conditions increase the risk of
fire and make young trees weaker and more vulnerable to insect
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, companies in a variety of industries may
experience shifting demand for their products as climate change
affects more people. For example, if tropical diseases migrate into
more industrialized nations, which is likely as temperatures rise,
pharmaceutical companies may see their markets expand.
</P>
<P>
   ANTICIPATING REGULATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be decades before people in Munich or
Minneapolis have to worry about tropical diseases, regulations
designed to curb climate change are already being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, government likely will impose additional taxes on
fossil-fuel consumption and require that cars and appliances use
less energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such regulatory programs will change asset values. Fleets of
trucks that get particularly low gas mileage will suffer. The
programs will also increase the value of goods and services such as
renewable-energy technology, process-control equipment and
telecommunications services _ for example, teleconferences that
substitute for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As government regulatory schemes take shape, companies should
speak up and support programs that give them flexibility in
deciding how to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A command-and-control approach _ in which all sources would be
required to make proportional reductions in carbon-dioxide
emissions, regardless of the cost or difficulty _ could cost six
times as much as market-based solutions, according to the White
House Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, most businesses have not actively promoted market
approaches as an alternative to command and control.
</P>
<P>
   One market approach is to tax emissions of greenhouse gases.
Companies could then decide if it's more efficient to pay the tax
or invest in reducing emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution would be to set up a system of tradable
permits. Under such a system, the government allocates emissions
permits that companies can then buy and sell. Businesses that would
have to pay huge sums to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases
could instead buy permits from companies that are able to make the
required operating changes more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever regulatory systems emerge, some companies stand to make
money from the changes. Makers of industrial process controls, such
as Honeywell and ABB, may be among the big winners. They are
already investing in sophisticated thermostats, equipment that
generates electricity more efficiently and other products and
services whose value will increase in a world of higher-cost
energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why companies that make energy-efficient
products may support new regulations. But it's less clear why a
company such as General Motors has advocated government policies
that may make driving more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   GM and other large automakers such as Ford see climate change as
an opportunity to gain advantages over their less technologically
sophisticated rivals. That's why they are investing in cars that
run on a combination of gasoline and battery power and in fuel
cells. As the cost of driving conventional automobiles rises, Ford
and GM will dominate a new market and freeze out smaller
competitors for whom the required investments will be too great.
</P>
<P>
   Like automakers, energy companies stand to be hit hard by any
new policies that arise from the anticipation of global climate
change.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has been a leader in supporting international efforts
to slow climate change. It has even announced voluntary cutbacks of
its own carbon dioxide output _ cutbacks similar to those required
under the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, BP Amoco believes that taking a leadership
position gives it a distinctive identity in the eyes of government
officials, scientists and environmental groups. That may mean
better access to government-controlled oil deposits and more
operating flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the company's experiments with emissions trading
are likely to give it clout at the negotiating table when
international regulatory frameworks are being devised. It will also
stimulate the company's employees to think more imaginatively _
and, in turn, feel valued.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLIMATE OF PUBLIC OPINION
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only thing more unpredictable than the weather is
public opinion. But good publicity can pay big dividends: As the
intensity and level of public interest increase, companies known to
have made early efforts to tackle climate change will have seats at
the negotiating table when regulations are being debated.
</P>
<P>
   For strategic reasons, some companies have chosen to be quiet
about their efforts. Honeywell and ABB would gain advantages from
more stringent emissions regulations, but they've had to be
cautious in their public statements on global warming. Some of
their biggest customers are fossil fuel and electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
   While good PR buzz on preventing or preparing for climate change
has its appeal, smart companies know it's simply bad business
practice to make investments, relocate resources or change
strategies solely for the sake of appearance. That's why David
Allen, who oversees BP Amoco's solar energy investments, is careful
to emphasize that the company's foray into solar ``is not just a
public relations sop. We would not do that. If you just paint
something, then people will in due course see it as paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to think steadily and consistently about a topic as
complicated as climate change is a tough test of management acumen.
Some executives are meeting it head-on. Those who are not should
wonder why they aren't _ and so should their shareholders.

<P>
   For example, insurance companies should adapt their predictive
models to ensure that their prices are accurate and to prevent
large financial losses because of payouts after unexpectedly severe
storms.
</P>
<P>
   To value waterfront properties correctly, real estate companies
will have to keep up with the latest thinking on changes in flood
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that sell seeds, risk management may mean
developing crops that can deliver higher yields in drier
conditions. For timber operations, it may mean spending more on
fire and pest management: Drier conditions increase the risk of
fire and make young trees weaker and more vulnerable to insect
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, companies in a variety of industries may
experience shifting demand for their products as climate change
affects more people. For example, if tropical diseases migrate into
more industrialized nations, which is likely as temperatures rise,
pharmaceutical companies may see their markets expand.
</P>
<P>
   ANTICIPATING REGULATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be decades before people in Munich or
Minneapolis have to worry about tropical diseases, regulations
designed to curb climate change are already being proposed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, government likely will impose additional taxes on
fossil-fuel consumption and require that cars and appliances use
less energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such regulatory programs will change asset values. Fleets of
trucks that get particularly low gas mileage will suffer. The
programs will also increase the value of goods and services such as
renewable-energy technology, process-control equipment and
telecommunications services _ for example, teleconferences that
substitute for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   As government regulatory schemes take shape, companies should
speak up and support programs that give them flexibility in
deciding how to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A command-and-control approach _ in which all sources would be
required to make proportional reductions in carbon-dioxide
emissions, regardless of the cost or difficulty _ could cost six
times as much as market-based solutions, according to the White
House Council of Economic Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, most businesses have not actively promoted market
approaches as an alternative to command and control.
</P>
<P>
   One market approach is to tax emissions of greenhouse gases.
Companies could then decide if it's more efficient to pay the tax
or invest in reducing emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution would be to set up a system of tradable
permits. Under such a system, the government allocates emissions
permits that companies can then buy and sell. Businesses that would
have to pay huge sums to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases
could instead buy permits from companies that are able to make the
required operating changes more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever regulatory systems emerge, some companies stand to make
money from the changes. Makers of industrial process controls, such
as Honeywell and ABB, may be among the big winners. They are
already investing in sophisticated thermostats, equipment that
generates electricity more efficiently and other products and
services whose value will increase in a world of higher-cost
energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why companies that make energy-efficient
products may support new regulations. But it's less clear why a
company such as General Motors has advocated government policies
that may make driving more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   GM and other large automakers such as Ford see climate change as
an opportunity to gain advantages over their less technologically
sophisticated rivals. That's why they are investing in cars that
run on a combination of gasoline and battery power and in fuel
cells. As the cost of driving conventional automobiles rises, Ford
and GM will dominate a new market and freeze out smaller
competitors for whom the required investments will be too great.
</P>
<P>
   Like automakers, energy companies stand to be hit hard by any
new policies that arise from the anticipation of global climate
change.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has been a leader in supporting international efforts
to slow climate change. It has even announced voluntary cutbacks of
its own carbon dioxide output _ cutbacks similar to those required
under the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, BP Amoco believes that taking a leadership
position gives it a distinctive identity in the eyes of government
officials, scientists and environmental groups. That may mean
better access to government-controlled oil deposits and more
operating flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the company's experiments with emissions trading
are likely to give it clout at the negotiating table when
international regulatory frameworks are being devised. It will also
stimulate the company's employees to think more imaginatively _
and, in turn, feel valued.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLIMATE OF PUBLIC OPINION
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only thing more unpredictable than the weather is
public opinion. But good publicity can pay big dividends: As the
intensity and level of public interest increase, companies known to
have made early efforts to tackle climate change will have seats at
the negotiating table when regulations are being debated.
</P>
<P>
   For strategic reasons, some companies have chosen to be quiet
about their efforts. Honeywell and ABB would gain advantages from
more stringent emissions regulations, but they've had to be
cautious in their public statements on global warming. Some of
their biggest customers are fossil fuel and electricity companies.
</P>
<P>
   While good PR buzz on preventing or preparing for climate change
has its appeal, smart companies know it's simply bad business
practice to make investments, relocate resources or change
strategies solely for the sake of appearance. That's why David
Allen, who oversees BP Amoco's solar energy investments, is careful
to emphasize that the company's foray into solar ``is not just a
public relations sop. We would not do that. If you just paint
something, then people will in due course see it as paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to think steadily and consistently about a topic as
complicated as climate change is a tough test of management acumen.
Some executives are meeting it head-on. Those who are not should
wonder why they aren't _ and so should their shareholders.

<P>
   In fashion circles, Regis Philbin is a miracle story.
</P>
<P>
   Here's this 65-year-old, gray-haired host of ``Live With Regis''
who's never been known for having any sense of style _ good or bad
_ and suddenly everybody wants the shirt off his back.
</P>
<P>
   Literally.
</P>
<P>
   And his tie to match.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, good ol' !ital!Reege, the guy who spent 15 years upstaged
by Kathie Lee Gifford's hair and skimpy clothes, has become a
pop-culture icon, fashion plate, not to mention a hero of the
menswear business as the dapper host of the blockbuster TV game
show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're talking about his monochromatic shirt-and-tie
ensembles that have become his trademark on that slick,
dramatically lighted prime-time show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter that the dark shirt with matching tie _ once linked
to the Mafia _ has been seen on runways for years by everybody from
Giorgio Armani to Hugo Boss to Calvin Klein ... or that Tom Cruise,
Nick Nolte and Tom Hanks have worn them to Hollywood soirees for
years,'' comments the tart-tongued fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it couldn't be me who made it famous, let's hear three
cheers for Regis. He's a great guy,'' Blackwell adds.
</P>
<P>
   So, fashion fans, it's Regis and his new Regis for Van Heusen
shirts that have joined the list of other look-like-a-million-bucks
fads, along with the pashmina stole and platinum jewels.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles on Wednesday to personally introduce the
nationwide launch of the new Regis collection (just two days before
his 66th birthday), Philbin seems to be enjoying his new-found
fashion fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I worked here in L.A. years ago, I wore (TV anchor) Jerry
Dunphy's hand-me-downs, so look at the stuff now, come and talk to
me,'' he says to a crowd of hundreds at Macy's at the Fashion
Square in Sherman Oaks, before signing photographs, ties and
shirts. Earlier in the day, Regis _ dressed in the flint shirt and
tie and three-button charcoal gray jacket and trousers _ appeared
at the Robinsons-May in Westside Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Regis from `The Tonight Show With Joey Bishop,' and
this is the best he's ever looked,'' says Mary Desjardins, 62, of
Northridge, who visited the Sherman Oaks store and bought a gray
shirt-and-tie ensemble for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Russo, spokeswoman for the Regis for Van Heusen company,
says they offered Philbin his own line of clothing as soon as they
saw the show's phenomenal success. ``And his final answer was 'yes'
to Van Heusen's suggestion of dramatic monochromatic shirts and
ties that !ital!pop on the dark set,'' Russo says.
</P>
<P>
   Russo wants to assure shoppers the Regis shirts and ties are
just like those worn by Philbin on the game show. The cotton shirts
come in black, cobalt, blue bay (light blue), antique tan,
eggplant, flint and basil, and the silk tie colors match those
hues. Each month through spring 2001, Van Heusen plans to introduce
new colors, such as loden, chicory and hunter green, Russo says,
adding that the shirts will be more iridescent and the ties more
textured.
</P>
<P>
   Van Heusen is projecting retail sales of $50 million by the end
of the year and retailers already confirm the style is an amazing
hit. Robinsons-May fashion director Milinda Martin says the style
has an ageless appeal. ``What's strange is that, unlike other
fashion trends, there's no age factor. Customers in their 20s and
up are buying it, unlike most fashion trends that appeal only to
the young,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   And the proof is in the sales reports. According to Martin,
``Even before we got the Regis collection from Van Heusen,
customers came in asking for the look, and it's accounted for 65
percent of the sales of our dress shirts and 35 percent of our
neckwear, which is a huge indicator of the trend's popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Regis ensembles seem to be richer than others.
According to Martin, the antique tan combo is the best-seller for
Robinsons-May stores, while it's the burgundy and navy blue shades
that have been the most popular sellers at the Van Heusen store in
the Camarillo Outlet, according to salesman Tony Whaley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought the navy shirt for my husband. He picked it out _ we
didn't know it was Regis' favorite,'' said Deirdre Wilson, 43, of
Woodland Hills. ``Men's fashion hasn't changed much in years, and
this new look is so refreshing. But it probably won't make my
husband dress up more.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Plamondon, 53, of Granada Hills bought a navy shirt for
himself at Macy's on Wednesday. ``I'm a stockbroker, so I usually
dress up, but I'm going to be the first in the office with the new
Regis look. I really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that he admires Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I hope I look that good when I'm 66,'' Plamondon says
with a laugh. ``He's a Joe-on-the-street kinda guy with a
great-looking wife and a seven-digit paycheck, and I think he'll
influence everybody to dress up more.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kissel, fashion editor of the Robb Report _ an
international men's luxury lifestyle magazine _ agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the everyman. He's not buff like Bruce Willis, and he
appeals to couch potatoes whose only introduction to fashion is the
TV show. I mean, he's an older guy, and he's suddenly looking smart
and sharp,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think the monochromatic look is appealing to the masses
because it's easy. You don't have to worry about which print goes
with which stripe,'' he adds. ``And while I can't say I love the
look, I'm a real strong supporter of anything that helps the men's
fashion industry. And maybe before the end of the next TV season,
Regis will give a few pointers on socks, which should always match
your pants, not your shoes _ or your ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hall, co-host of E!'s ``Fashion Emergency'' and spokesman
for the Fashion Association based in New York, also praises the
``Millionaire'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, tone-on-tone is a wardrobe crutch,'' says Hall, ``But
I've always liked the look because it has a professional appearance
with a fashion edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also observes that while the Regis collection is definitely
an evening look that goes well with a dark suit, it can be worn out
to lunch without a jacket. And it even looks good with jeans and a
black leather jacket, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a lot of mileage to a wardrobe (nobody remembers
exactly what you wore the last time they saw you), and now Van
Heusen's new Regis collection makes it incredibly easy and
affordable,'' he comments. ``I mean, a couple of years ago when the
trend started, you had to spend a lot of time matching the texture
and sheen of a tie to a shirt and now it's all done for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who's been a guest on several talk shows, but never
Philbin's, has high hopes for fashion's newest star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime something is popularized by television, it has
authority, and I'm rooting for Regis to bring back office dress
codes.''

  Everyone's crazy about a sharp-dressed man 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Sidebar to `Looks like a million.' Short fact box below.) 
By BARBARA De WITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
host Regis Philbin talked about his sudden fame as a fashion plate,
his new line of Regis shirts and ties by the Van Heusen Company,
and his off-camera style.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have single-handedly changed the shirt-and-tie business,
and men of all ages want to dress like you on your game show. Is it
a little frightening to suddenly be a fashion idol pursued by the
fashion press or are you loving every second?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not frightening _ it's terrifying. I'm no fashion icon.
I just got lucky with a television show that's running three or
four nights a week on prime time. I couldn't have foreseen it and I
couldn't control it, but here it is, my collection, and I'm proud
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you make a conscious effort to look different than you do
on your morning talk show? Or to set yourself apart from other game
shows?
</P>
<P>
   A: The monochromatic look was the dress code for the original TV
show in Britain. However, my staff on `Live' comes in to review
what I wore the night before on `Millionaire,' and they usually
like what they see but once in a while an odd color will spark a
revolt. (For instance) I was requested not to wear the gold tie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Among your monochromatic shirt-and-tie ensembles worn on
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which is your favorite color and
why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like the dark blue ensemble the best ... and think darker
colors look best on me. And I feel most men would feel the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were in the contestant's seat, which color do you
think would be the luckiest for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it would be blue. Blue is traditionally considered the
best color to wear on television. And I notice most men in the hot
seat wear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do contestants ever ask (or show up) in your shirt-and-tie
ensembles? Are they allowed to copy your look or do the fashion
police keep their dress casual?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think they are encouraged to be casual, but once in awhile
someone slips through in full regalia. I like to see that. Why
should I be the only one wearing a shirt and tie?
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you describe your personal fashion stance away from
the studios? Are you a khakis kind of guy? Is there a cowboy hat in
the closet, or is the elegant `Millionaire' look really you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a khakis kind of guy, but I like the formal
(`Millionaire') look a lot and wear it in my personal life on
numerous occasions. But there's no cowboy hat in the closet (he
chuckles).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Van Heusen approached you about having your own line
of shirts and ties and that you give a lot of input, from the
collar points to the amount of sheen in the ties, but who provides
those elegant pinstripe suits and dark three-button jackets?
</P>
<P>
   A: For the past 10 years, Beau Brummel, a store in the Soho area
of New York, has been providing my wardrobe for both shows. I rely
on them to tell me where fashion is going, and we consult. So as
fashion changes, so may the `Millionaire' look. It's a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you admit fashion is always changing, and so might your
wardrobe. Will we ever be wowed with Reege in plaid or maybe a
blazer and ascot? Or black leather?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a word, no.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think the success of your new show and image will give
casual Fridays a kick in the pants?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it will encourage men to dress better and if they do,
I think they'll feel better. I never realized it myself, but I'm
glad the dressier look came along because it does make a
difference. &QL;

<P>
   Imagine if half the children and adults in your city wore
hearing aids. No doubt everyone would be appalled that so many
people had defects in such an important sense, and would probably
be clamoring for scientists to find out what had gone wrong and if
anything could be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   But look around you right now. Most people will probably be
wearing glasses or contact lenses because of defects in an even
more important sense, vision.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many otherwise healthy people can't see much beyond the
end of their nose has been a mystery for centuries. But now, at
last, scientists are beginning to understand what causes
nearsightedness, or myopia. They're even testing a drug that they
hope will keep children's vision from deteriorating, and an
anti-myopia pill for children could be just a few years away.
</P>
<P>
   The progress comes not a moment too soon, because myopia rates
are rising alarmingly. A large 1996 study in the United States
found that about 60 percent of 23-to-34-year-olds had myopia,
compared with only about 20 percent of people over the age of 65.
The problem is especially severe in parts of Asia. The Singapore
National Eye Center, for example, estimates that myopia afflicts
more than 80 percent of the country's 18-year-old men.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could mean real trouble. Eye specialists know that
myopia can be more than just a nuisance that keeps people hunting
for their lost glasses. People with severe myopia _ who need lenses
with a focusing power of more than 6 dioptres _ run a greater risk
of glaucoma and retinal detachment later in life. Degenerative
myopia is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United
States, Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As most shortsighted people know, myopia usually starts in
childhood and gets progressively worse through adolescence. A
treatment that could stop the deterioration could help prevent
severe myopia and its complications, even though it probably would
not let people throw away their glasses altogether. But you can't
stop myopia from getting worse without understanding how it
develops in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, genes play a part. According to one study, children
with two nearsighted parents are more than six times as likely to
become myopic as children with one myopic parent or none at all.
Identical twins are more likely to have similar eyesight than
fraternal twins. However, geneticists have yet to find the genes
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, many researchers think genes govern only a
susceptibility to myopia, which some environmental factor must
trigger. The biggest contender is near work such as reading, or
sitting at the computer or too close to a TV screen. Many
epidemiologists blame the rising tide of myopia on the increased
amount of time children spend on these activities rather than
playing outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always see that the prevalence of myopia is greater in the
near-work population,'' says Neville McBrian of the University of
Melbourne. Studies have found that children's myopia progresses
more rapidly during term time than the summer vacation In places
where people do less close work, such as rural Nepal and the upper
Amazon regions of Brazil, only about 1 percent of the population
has myopia.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not clear why close work has such a profound effect
on eyesight, but the answer probably involves the way the eye copes
with poorly focused images. As astronomer Johann Kepler first
explained almost 400 years ago, in myopia, light rays don't focus
on the retina at the back of the eye. Instead, they meet at a point
farther forward and continue past each other to create a blurred,
or defocused, image on the retina. Corrective lenses bend the light
rays to push the focal point back onto the retina, creating a clear
image. But a child's eye can also compensate for its defocus by
changing shape as it grows.
</P>
<P>
   Even though scientists still don't know exactly what causes
myopia or what effect corrective lenses have on the process, they
are already testing a drug that promises to moderate or even
prevent the condition. The drug is a new and improved version of
that old standby atropine _ the belladonna that Renaissance women
used to make their pupils dilate to darken their eyes. Among other
actions, atropine relaxes the muscle that focuses the eye. For many
years, people thought myopia resulted from strain to this muscle
during close focusing, so atropine was suggested as a treatment for
myopia as early as 1811.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were using the right drug for the wrong reason,'' says
Ian Flitcroft at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin.
Few now believe that this muscle has anything to do with myopia _
but still, experiments show that atropine stops myopia in its
tracks. But atropine has serious drawbacks that make it unsuitable
for everyday use. Because it relaxes the muscle that focuses the
eye, children who take atropine eyedrops have to wear reading
glasses for close work. Atropine also dilates the pupil, making the
children extremely sensitive to light. So researchers decided to
look for other drugs that might offer the same benefits without as
many side effects.
</P>
<P>
   They turned to a drug called pirenzepine that has been used for
years to block the production of gastric juices as a treatment for
ulcers. Pirenzepine eye gel is now undergoing clinical trials in
children aged 8 to 12 in the United States, the first drug to be
tested here against myopia. There are 24 children in the trial so
far, which is being run by Valley Forge Pharmaceuticals in Irvine,
Calif. Another 150 children will be included in 10 additional
centers. Starting in August, the drug will also get tested in 250
children in Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan. The
researchers will follow the children for a year, and move into
larger trials if this trial shows it works as well in humans as it
does in animals. The drug could reach the market in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Because pirenzepine has been used as a drug before, it has an
excellent safety record. ''Millions of people have taken billions
of doses of it,'' says John Parrish of Valley Forge
Pharmaceuticals. The eye gel should have no major side effects in
children, since the dose of pirenzepine will be lower than in a
pill.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would have to treat their children every day for a
decade or more. And even then, the drug won't reverse any myopia
that has already developed. Also, since scientists don't know
exactly how the drug works, we don't yet understand what it will do
to visual performance in the long run, McBrian warns. But for
parents, he acknowledges, ''it's really difficult for them not to
jump on that bandwagon.'' It may be especially appealing to parents
with severe myopia who are worried about their young children whose
eyesight seems to be deteriorating rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Part of pirenzepine's appeal is that parents don't have a lot of
other options for preventing myopia in their children. (Laser
surgery can usually correct myopia permanently, but it sometimes
leads to complications and its long-term effects are still
unknown.) Taking breaks from near work every 30 minutes or so might
help, as might holding the book well away from the eyes _ at least
as far away as your elbow when you make a fist and hold it to your
nose, eye specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   A good light source may also help, because the eye can
accommodate to near work better in bright light. On the other hand,
there's little evidence that eye exercises, pinhole glasses, and
other gimmicks advertised on the Internet will do much good.
''Certainly no controlled studies have been done on any of that
stuff,'' says Karla Zadnik of Ohio State University in Columbus,
who calls it ''just plain out-there, loony stuff''.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs like pirenzepine seem like the best bet for the future,
even though we're not quite sure how they work. But as time goes on
and scientists unravel the chemical signalling between different
parts of the eye that influences eye growth, they might be able to
design drugs that interfere with those signals to block or perhaps
even reverse myopia, ensuring perfect vision for life. If that
happens, future generations will go to museums and marvel at the
glasses and contact lenses locked up in a display case. They won't
be able to understand how so many of us lived so casually with
defective sight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   An ore prospector might think he was nearing the mother lode.
For buried within the gray and white matter in your head, stashed
safely inside nuggets of protein, is a surprising quantity of
metal. In fact, the human brain contains about 6 milligrams of
copper, enough to print a small circuit board. Zinc, iron and
manganese are just as plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   While we've known about metals in the body and brain for
decades, it's only recently that scientists have stopped viewing
them as just ''trace elements'' and started to ask what on earth
they're doing there. ''Calling copper or zinc in the brain trace
metals is quite silly,'' says Ashley Bush, a research psychiatrist
at the Genetics and Aging Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital in
Charlestown. ''The brain concentrates metals better than any other
tissue in the body.'' But to what end?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, our brain doesn't work properly without metals.
Many neurons release zinc, copper or iron to help transmit signals
across synapses. In fact, cyanide kills by soaking up copper at the
synapses. And young rats fed diets low in iron learn poorly, while
elderly people with zinc deficiencies seem to be at greater risk of
developing senile dementia. Metals are also integral to the way
brain cells defend themselves. When bound to antioxidant proteins,
copper and iron neutralize dangerous free radicals by mopping up
electrons. And cells sometimes release zinc to help fight
infections.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, metals have revealed a more sinister side
_ a yin to their antioxidant yang. A growing number of researchers,
Bush among them, now suspect that mishandling metal in the brain is
responsible for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's or
Parkinson's diseases. If he's right, it will completely alter the
way scientists think about these diseases and how they go about
trying to cure them. ''I think there will be a sea change,'' says
Bush. But it won't be easy to prove.
</P>
<P>
   It all began early in Bush's career, when he was studying one
very visible problem with the Alzheimer's brain _ senile plaques.
These clumps of protein accumulate outside diseased neurons in the
parts of the brain that control higher cognitive functions such as
judgment and memory. He happened to spot that the primary
constituent of plaque, a small protein called Ab, binds to zinc and
copper, and that the brains of patients who had died of Alzheimer's
contained three to four times as much copper, zinc and iron as
normal, mostly concentrated in the plaques.
</P>
<P>
   To find out whether metal had anything to do with plaque
formation, Bush and his colleagues mixed Ab protein with metal ions
in the lab, and left it to form clumps. Then they added a chelator,
a chemical that soaks up metals. ''The stuff dissolved almost
immediately, as fast as we could measure it,'' Bush says. They
tried the same experiment on mashed post-mortem brain from an
Alzheimer's patient. Again the plaques vanished like sugar in warm
water.
</P>
<P>
   For years, plaques had seemed the most logical cause of
Alzheimer's dementia. Dozens of labs showed that Ab was toxic to
neurons, and people genetically predisposed to get Alzheimer's,
such as those who carry the ApoE4 gene, develop more plaques at a
younger age. Mice engineered to produce large amounts of human Ab
developed most of the symptoms of Alzheimer's, including plaques.
And now Bush's work suggested that metals might help the plaques
form.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon became clear to him that this wasn't the whole
story. In some cases, patients with the greatest dementia turned
out to have few plaques.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1986, Colin Masters, a pathologist at the University of
Melbourne, proposed that Alzheimer's might be caused instead by
oxidative stress _ surplus electrons knocking about and damaging
cells. Six years later, Miguel Pappolla's group at the University
of South Alabama in Mobile found abnormal amounts of antioxidant
proteins in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, particularly around
plaques. Now Masters, Pappolla and others see plaques more as a
monument to the brain's battles with oxidative stress than as a
source of damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaque is like a tombstone,'' Pappolla says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in December, an international team of researchers
including Bush and Masters reported how the two lines of research
might dovetail. They found that when the Ab protein binds to
copper, it can create oxidative havoc producing lots of hydrogen
peroxide and killing cells.
</P>
<P>
   This immediately begs a question. Our cells produce Ab all the
time, and copper is readily available too. So if this tiny protein
is so risky, why do we have it at all _ and why doesn't everybody
get Alzheimer's? Bush believes the answer is that it only becomes
dangerous when chemical conditions in the cell allow it to grab too
much copper. Normally Ab would be safe, or even beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of Alzheimer's emerging from this is a snowball
effect. We have Ab all over our bodies our entire lives, but at
some stage it begins to accumulate in the brain. Perhaps some of it
fails to load zinc properly and does some oxidative damage. In
response, neurons make more antioxidants, including Ab. These,
especially the long form, spread more oxidative injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a vicious cycle,'' Bush says. ''Once Ab moves
from being an antioxidant to a pro-oxidant, it can then initiate
its own generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But what starts the snowball rolling? One possibility is acid.
Oxygen starvation can produce a condition called acidosis, as
anaerobic metabolism kicks in. The same phenomenon causes sore
muscles when you exercise hard. As a person ages, events that can
cause mild acidosis in the brain become more frequent _ mild
strokes, temporary drops in heart output, infections and even head
injuries. And when the pH drops, zinc hardly binds to Ab at all.
''This is our number one hypothesis,'' says Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic predispositions to Alzheimer's could fit into this
picture well. ApoE, for example, is a copper-binding protein.
Little is known about the metal-binding role, except that it seems
to help protect cells from oxidative damage by excess copper.
ApoE4, the form associated with familial Alzheimer's, is the worst
at binding copper.
</P>
<P>
   All this is bound to make people wonder if they should get rid
of their copper pots. And it's sure to revitalize the debate about
aluminium and dementia. But that's not necessary, Bush says.
Experiments on lab animals show that a meal high in iron or zinc
has no effect on the amount of these metals in the brain, despite
high levels in the blood. The blood-brain barrier keeps them out.
</P>
<P>
   What might make a difference, Bush and Brown agree, is long-term
exposure to high levels of metal, but there is currently little
evidence for or against this. If it's true, the risk is slight.
Even in the regions of Slovakia where people were continually
exposed to high levels of manganese, the rate of disease was still
only one in a thousand.
</P>
<P>
   But the theory does not mean that preventing and treating
neurological diseases might be as easy as soaking up metals. A
copper chelator made by Prana Biotechnology in Melbourne is now in
the first phase of clinical trials, after promising results with
mice. Antioxidants such as vitamin E are already thought to slow
the onset of Alzheimer's, but chelators go to the source of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence linking metals to several other diseases is also
beginning to trickle in. Iron deposits have been found in the
nigral cells that die in Parkinson's disease. And iron seems to
cause the Parkinson's protein a-synuclein to aggregate. And
cataracts form when the lens protein alpha-crystallin becomes
crosslinked, possibly by copper-generated superoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, if Bush is right, approaches to Alzheimer's
treatment based on the idea that plaques cause the disease won't
work. For example, the antibody against Ab made by Elan
Pharmaceuticals near San Francisco makes plaques in mouse brains
vanish. But if they're just a tombstone that may not matter. Still,
Bush realises his work isn't going to change these strategies
overnight. ''I hope Elan's approach works,'' he says. ''It's
logical, whereas the idea that an antioxidant can also be bad for
you is counterintuitive.''n  &QL;

<P>
   The secrets of a dog's extraordinary sense of smell have been
unlocked. And it's good news for Fido, because the discovery could
lead to mechanical sniffer dogs replacing the real thing for
dangerous tasks such as detecting land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Settles, a mechanical engineer at Penn State University in
University Park, says the military asked him and his colleagues to
investigate the sniffing powers of man's best friend. The Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency was working on land mine
detection, says Settles, ''and asked if we could understand how a
dog can do what it does so well''.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, Settles took pictures of dogs smelling various
scents. As dogs breathe, they draw in cooler air, which is then
warmed by their bodies and exhaled. Using a technique called
Schlieren photography, which records how gases of different
temperatures refract light, the researchers obtained images showing
the air currents produced by the noses of the sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
   They found that a dog's astounding olfactory success comes
partly from its ability to divert exhaled air away from a target
scent. When a dog exhales, it moves its nose so that the air is
deflected through slits on the side. As a result, the exhaled air
flows backward, away from the smell. This prevents the scent being
confused with exhaled air, and sets up a current that pulls new air
across the target, launching odor molecules into the air. When dogs
inhale they shift their noses into an entirely different shape to
draw in a large volume of air. Settles is submitting the results to
The Journal of Experimental Biology.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their work has helped motivate ours,'' says Joel White, a
neuroscientist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. White is part
of a team working with the Penn State researchers to develop an
artificial nose that is just as good at detecting land mines as
canine sniffers.
</P>
<P>
   White says Settles' results are helping them redesign their
device, so that it mimics the way a dog samples air. The machine
''breathes'' air in and out, instead of drawing it straight
through. Because its sensors remove most of the odor molecules from
the air it draws in, the machine can use the exhaled air as a
baseline. The contrast between this baseline and the inflowing air
is what allows the system to detect a particular smell.
</P>
<P>
   White says his group's artificial nose has successfully detected
mines in a test field. Now he is working on improving it _ and it
still has some catching up to do, as its canine competitor is
between 10 and 50 times more sensitive.  &QL;

<P>
   Most predatory animals are elementary mathematicians it seems. A
Japanese scientist suggests that math can explain how stalking
predators, from cheetahs to jumping spiders or praying mantises,
maximize their chances of a kill by attacking at just the right
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeo Yachi from the Center for Ecological Research at Kyoto
University in Otsu, wondered how predators decided when to attack,
considering that each day the same animal may have to hunt
different kinds of prey, in groups of varying sizes, across
ever-changing types of vegetation cover.
</P>
<P>
   According to his mathematical model, predators follow a basic
rule at each step of the hunt: they simply weigh the merits of
getting closer to the prey against losing the element of surprise.
When the risk of being noticed by prey outweighs the advantage of
proximity, the predator attacks. ''Using this simple rule to make
decisions the predator can cope with diverse hunting situations,''
says Yachi, whose research will appear in a forthcoming issue of
Evolutionary Ecology Research.
</P>
<P>
   How long an animal has been stalking _ whether it's hours or
seconds _ does not affect its decision to attack or hold off. This
minimizes the information a predator has to process during the
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The model's predictions fit the results of earlier experiments
done on jumping spiders, Yachi says. Jumping spiders attack an
adult house fly from afar, presumably to maintain the element of
surprise. But they get a lot closer before attacking a house fly
maggot, which naturally enough is less likely to bolt. And under
camouflage, the spiders get closer to their prey before attacking.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yachi, more support for the model comes from the
behavior of scale eaters, predatory fish that dart in to snatch the
scales of other live fish. The scale eaters are smaller than their
prey and if noticed they escape rather than attack, a behavior that
the model again predicts.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few exceptions to the rule though, says Yachi. ''The
model cannot be applied to coursing predators, such as wild dogs,
wolves, and hyenas, because their hunt does not rely on the merit
of surprise.  &QL;

<P>
   Q: Could you discuss the impact on stock price when a heavily
shorted stock begins to rise?
</P>
<P>
   A: To many investors, short-sellers are evil.
</P>
<P>
   They try to profit from falling stock prices, preying on
companies and making stocks fall even further.
</P>
<P>
   That's one opinion. But short-sellers can also cause a stock to
rise if they're forced en masse to buy back the shares they sold
short.
</P>
<P>
   Meet what's called the short squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, an investor borrows stock from a broker and
sells those shares into the market with the understanding that the
shares must be bought back at a future date and returned to the
broker.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock falls, the investor buys back the stock at a
cheaper price, making money on the trade. If the stock rises, the
investor has two choices: Wait for the stock to come back down,
leaving the short-seller exposed to potentially greater losses, or
buy it back and realize a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people will short a stock for other reasons _ to
hedge or offset a long position, for instance. (The various reasons
for shorting were covered in a recent column on short interest,
which represents the total number of shares that have been sold
short and not yet repurchased.)
</P>
<P>
   However, the shorts who are trying to make money on a stock's
falling price often get accused of unsavory tactics aimed at
pushing a stock lower.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Conseco's (CNC on the New York Stock Exchange) current
campaign against the short-sellers who are betting that the
insurance company's stock will continue to fall. The company has
publicly said it thinks short-sellers and others have been
spreading false information about the company's debt financing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Conseco shareholder Irwin Jacobs is taking on the
shorts in advertisements urging other stockholders to forbid
brokers from lending their shares to the shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Short-sellers can indeed have a negative impact on a stock. Some
short-sellers do disseminate negative information about companies
over the Internet or elsewhere. Just read the message boards out
there. But others are just trying to do what every investor wants
to do: make money. They just take the mantra, buy low and sell
high, and reverse it, sell high and buy low.
</P>
<P>
   A rising amount of short interest in a stock can send the
message to other investors that some people think a stock is
overvalued or that something is wrong with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' says one fund
manager. Investors who are long a stock as well as potential buyers
get nervous when they see the shorts going after a stock. These
tacit admonitions can push shareholders to sell and dissuade other
investors from buying, sending a stock's price lower.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of a stock that's heavily shorted starts to rise,
you can see the opposite happen. Numerous short-sellers can be
forced to start buying shares to cover their positions, which can
drive the stock price higher and higher.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of events can cause this so-called short squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   When you short a stock, you have to borrow shares from someone
who actually owns them. A brokerage firm acts as the middleman in
the exchange, but ultimately the shares must be returned to the
rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   When the stockholder wants those shares back, the short-seller
might be forced to go into the market and buy them in order to
return them to their owner.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the brokerage firm, as the intermediary, will be
able to find more shares to loan the short-seller, who won't have
to repurchase the shares. But if a stock is hard to borrow, such as
a new or thinly traded issue, the short-seller might be forced to
go into the market and buy those shares. (If the short is
dillydallying, the broker can buy the shares directly to return to
the shareholder and pass on the cost to the short-seller.)
</P>
<P>
   More buying creates additional demand for the stock, which can
cause its price to go higher.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco shareholder Jacobs is pushing for just this sort of
squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a corporate raider from the fabulous '80s, has been
urging Conseco stockholders to prevent their brokers from lending
their stock to the short-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   If Conseco shareholders demanded their shares back en masse, the
people who are short the stock could be forced to buy it in mass
quantities. That buying would probably help this stock, which has
fallen 25 percent since the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   A short squeeze can also happen when a heavily shorted stock
starts to rise, and short-sellers start buying to close their
positions and cut their losses. The higher the price goes, the more
money the short loses. At some point, the short-seller will
probably give in and buy. ``We get nervous when we are down 30
percent,'' says the fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Buying begets buying, creating a snowball effect. Short-sellers
buying shares to cover their positions push the price higher and
force more shorts to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for a short squeeze is one reason that some
investors watch rising short interest. When a stock's short
interest exceeds 20 percent of the number of shares that trade,
some people believe the stock is ripe for a short squeeze, which
means a nice pop in price.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, these price jumps are usually short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Once the short-sellers finish their buying, the stock should
return to where it was.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite-telephone venture Iridium filed for bankruptcy
last August, but the shares of its publicly traded entity, Iridium
World Communications, unexpectedly jumped a few months later thanks
to a short squeeze. That run-up provided some investors with a nice
short-term pop, but it didn't bring the company or the stock back
to life: Iridium in March announced it would shut down.

<P>
   MARTINEZ, Calif. _ Prosecutors have filed murder charges against
two men and a woman suspected of killing three others and tossing
their dismembered bodies into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-page criminal complaint filed by Contra Costa County
authorities Wednesday accuses brothers Glenn and Justin Helzer and
their housemate, Dawn Godman, of killing Ivan and Annette Stineman
and Selina Bishop, daughter of blues guitarist Elvin Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors listed 21 ``overt acts'' linking the Helzers and
Godman to the crimes, including a written plan of action.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also gives the dates and locations of a
cross-county shopping spree for the items allegedly used to extort
money from, kill and ultimately dismember their victims.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, prosecutors say the Helzers and Godman took
stepping stones and rocks from their own back yard to weigh down
the duffel bags filled with body parts that were deposited in the
delta.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, after Glenn Helzer was arrested, prosecutors say he
tried to sell his story for $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Justin Helzer's lawyer asserted for the first time
that his client was innocent of murder, and that brother Glenn
Helzer might have suffered from a ``severe mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Harold Jewett said he had not
decided whether to seek the death penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly . . . anybody who was directly involved with the
brutal murders and desecration of the victims' bodies would deserve
to be considered for the death penalty,'' Jewett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Helzers and Godman also have been linked to the shooting
deaths of Jennifer Villarin, Selina Bishop's mother, and James
Gamble, her mother's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Contra Costa County prosecutors linked the defendants to those
deaths in their criminal complaint, but have not filed murder
charges in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe the Stinemans were killed in a $100,000
extortion attempt, and that Bishop, Villarin and Gamble may have
been killed to cover up the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Helzer, 30, was the Stinemans' former stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Villarin and Gamble were found shot dead Aug. 3 in Selina
Bishop's studio apartment in Woodacre, in western Marin County. The
dismembered remains of the other three victims were discovered in
nine duffel bags in the Mokelumne River in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Helzers and Godman were arrested Aug. 7, charged with auto
theft and a few drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office Wednesday added 13 more counts _
three counts each for murder; two counts for robbery and false
imprisonment; and one each for conspiracy, extortion, residential
burglary, auto theft, possession for sale of the drug known as
ecstasy and possession of a hallucinogenic mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Helzer's lawyer, Bill Veale, said that Glenn Helzer had
developed a ``severe mental illness,'' and that his client was
innocent of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin Helzer has never killed anybody, hurt anybody or
(stole) from anybody,'' Veale said. ``I think we will establish
that in court.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Helzer's lawyer, Suzanne Chapot, did not comment.

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    FEARS FOR EARS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin.
 &HT;    To check the spread of those genes, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency requires that farmers intersperse fields of
genetically modified crops with islands of non-modified plants. The
idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable to Bt
toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole population
susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths. In fields containing refuges of
non-modified plants, resistance genes were less likely to be spread
through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants _ some high and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LONELY PLANETS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The planets beyond our solar system keep getting weirder and
weirder. First came word of Jupiter-sized worlds that roast
improbably close to their parent stars. Now astronomers Phil Lucas
of the University of Hertfordshire and Patrick Roche of Oxford
University say they have spotted planets that travel alone through
the dark coldness of space.
 &HT;    The researchers found these solo travelers by training the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope's Fast Track Imager on a group of
very young stars in the Orion nebula, 1,500 light-years from Earth.
Among this crowd, the camera picked out the feeble infrared glow of
150 objects too small and cool to be stars. Thirteen of them appear
to be planets, Lucas says.
 &HT;    He estimates they have masses roughly eight times that of
Jupiter, which implies that they are huge bodies with deep
atmospheres.
 &HT;    Lucas and Roche suspect these planets grew directly out of a
cloud of cold gas and dust _ not from a disk surrounding an infant
star, the way normal planets do.
 &HT;    ``We can't rule out the possibility that some might have been
flung out of a solar system, but it looks like they have always
been free-floating,'' Lucas says.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIKE WATERLOO FOR CHOCOLATE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Could the day come when the only chocolate bars are in museums?
 &HT;    South America's cacao growers are warily watching the spread of
witches'-broom fungus, which infects seed pods and sends out
evil-looking orange shoots. It has slashed Brazil's cocoa
production by more than 25 percent in the past five years.
 &HT;    Crowded cacao plantations encourage the rapid spread of the
witches'-broom fungus, and fungicides don't work well amid the
heavy rains of the tropics.
 &HT;    Robert Lumsden of the U.S. Agricultural Research Service in
Beltsville, Md., is leading an effort to fight fungus with fungus _
Trichoderma, which attacks witches'-broom and other cacao pests.
 &HT;    Field trials in Peru and Brazil show that Trichoderma fungi are
effective and harmless to the trees. But the genetic uniformity of
commercial cacao groves still leaves them vulnerable to future
attacks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MR. SANDMAN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    William C. Dement knows that failing to get enough sleep is more
than a minor nuisance. It causes malaise, poor concentration,
moodiness, ill health and accidental deaths.
 &HT;    During more than four decades of pioneering research, Dement
codiscovered REM sleep, founded Stanford University's Sleep
Disorders Clinic and Research Center and witnessed countless
examples of the ways the body malfunctions when deprived of proper
rest.
 &HT;    Here, Dement talks about his research and his personal crusade
against sleep deprivation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How bad is the problem of sleep deprivation in the United
States?
 &HT;    A: Very bad. Everybody is sleepy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Doesn't the brain compensate for lack of sleep?
 &HT;    A: I don't think it does. Think of going to sleep as a balance.
There is so much weight on the sleep side and so much on the awake
side. Caffeine, pain, excitement, activity _ these things push the
balance in the awake direction, but the sleep-deprivation side may
keep getting heavier until nothing can oppose it.
 &HT;    There is new MRI research that suggests some areas of the brain
get more active, maybe in an effort to take up the slack. But that
may also just be an effect of sleep deprivation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will we ever have a cure for people who can't sleep?
 &HT;    A: Insomnia is quite a few different things. The insomnia that
arises out of stress or tragedy, things like that, we'll certainly
be able to treat. To cure all insomnia would be like being able to
have healthy sleep whenever you wanted. We can't do that yet.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What do you think about using melatonin to control sleep?
 &HT;    A: If you take the recommended dose of melatonin and it helps
you, fine. There are worse things people do _ drinking yourself to
sleep, or trying to get alert with cocaine.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will there ever be a pill that delivers alertness on demand?
 &HT;    A: Not one you could absolutely depend upon, no matter how sleep
deprived you were.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will we ever understand why we need to sleep?
 &HT;    A: I'm confident of that. The biggest breakthrough was the
isolation of the narcolepsy gene in dogs. One abnormal gene causes
the quintessential sleep disorder. It suggests we're almost there.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why do we dream?
 &HT;    A: The brain is so active during REM sleep, it's almost as if it
has to do something. While you're awake you could ask, ``Why am I
conscious?'' Well, you are awake, so why are you dreaming when
you're asleep? Because the brain created the dream world, and we
have no choice but to live in it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Would you want to be able to live without sleeping?
 &HT;    A: We're so accustomed to a beginning and an end, that to have
consciousness going on forever would be hard. Maybe we could be
really happy with one hour of sleep, to end the day and begin the
next one.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    I was hovering outside the lab last week, desperately trying to
recall why I happened to be there at that moment, when I remembered
I'd come to retrieve the book ``Memory: From Mind to Molecules,''
by Larry Squire and Eric Kandel.
 &HT;    All of us experience such moments of absentmindedness on
occasion. Indeed, remembering which chore needs your attention or
where you put the car keys can often be a hit-or-miss proposition.
 &HT;    So why do we recall so precisely the details surrounding an
assassination, marriage proposal or the birth of a child? And what
goes on in the brain to imprint memories in the first place?
 &HT;    Neuroscientists haven't fully answered these questions, but
they've had tantalizing glimpses of how the process of remembering
something works.
 &HT;    One thing they've learned is that information gets stashed in
two very distinct types of memory on its way to permanently lodging
in yet a third kind of memory.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 1
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Stare at the concentric circles, then shut your eyes, paying
close attention to the afterimage.
 &HT;    The faithful shapes and colors you see for an instant are the
first stage of memory _ sensory storage _ which gets its name from
its nearly perfect reproduction of sensory information flowing into
the brain.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 2
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Scan these icons from left to right, glancing at each one once.
Turn away and list as many as you can.
 &HT;    You probably remember icons on the right best because the second
stage of memory, working storage, has so little capacity that
images viewed early in a sequence can get pushed out to make room
for those arriving later. Psychologists call this retroactive
interference.
 &HT;    You might have also noticed that icons at the beginning of the
list stayed with you better than those in the middle. That's
because proactive interference causes data already in working
memory to hinder the storage of information coming in later.
Because the first images in working memory suffer only retroactive
interference, they're retrieved better than the unfortunate icons
in the middle, which get hammered both proactively and
retroactively.
 &HT;    With this constant war between proactive and retroactive
interference, how does working information ever find its way into
the third kind of memory, long-term storage?
 &HT;    Neuroscientists believe that working memories are stored as
sustained electrical discharges in nerve cells that respond to
sensory information. These electric echoes keep sensations around
for several seconds after the events producing them have gone away.
 &HT;    If the neural reverberations are strong enough, they can
actually alter the physical structure of nerve cells and in the
process create permanent memories.
 &HT;    Neurons change in this way either through repetition _ for
example, writing down someone's phone number over and over again _
or by association with strong emotions that crank up the brain's
electrical volume and produce vivid recollections of major life
events.
 &HT;    The process is analogous to etching a groove in a piece of
hardwood either by scratching many times with a dull knife or
taking one good whack with a meat cleaver.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    EXPERIMENT 3
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Take a break for a few minutes. When you come back, we'll learn
something about long-term memory.
 &HT;    Welcome back. Now, see how many of these icons you recognize
from Experiment 2.
 &HT;    You probably got most of the repeated icons even though they
were all from the middle of the list in Experiment 2 and therefore
buffeted by both proactive and retroactive interference.
 &HT;    The reason is that there are two ways of measuring long-term
memory: recall and recognition. Recall memory actively dredges up
specific information, whereas recognition memory only passively
acknowledges whether a thing has been seen before.
 &HT;    Brain researchers aren't certain why, but information makes the
perilous transition from working memory into long-term recognition
far easier than it does to long-term recall.
 &HT;    If you try this experiment again a few days from now, you'll
still be able to recognize icons from the original group, which
means they've lodged in long-term memory and have changed the very
structure of your brain. In a literal sense, you are what you read.

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    FEARS FOR EARS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin.
 &HT;    To check the spread of those genes, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency requires that farmers intersperse fields of
genetically modified crops with islands of non-modified plants. The
idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable to Bt
toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole population
susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths. In fields containing refuges of
non-modified plants, resistance genes were less likely to be spread
through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants _ some high and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LONELY PLANETS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The planets beyond our solar system keep getting weirder and
weirder. First came word of Jupiter-sized worlds that roast
improbably close to their parent stars. Now astronomers Phil Lucas
of the University of Hertfordshire and Patrick Roche of Oxford
University say they have spotted planets that travel alone through
the dark coldness of space.
 &HT;    The researchers found these solo travelers by training the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope's Fast Track Imager on a group of
very young stars in the Orion nebula, 1,500 light-years from Earth.
Among this crowd, the camera picked out the feeble infrared glow of
150 objects too small and cool to be stars. Thirteen of them appear
to be planets, Lucas says.
 &HT;    He estimates they have masses roughly eight times that of
Jupiter, which implies that they are huge bodies with deep
atmospheres.
 &HT;    Lucas and Roche suspect these planets grew directly out of a
cloud of cold gas and dust _ not from a disk surrounding an infant
star, the way normal planets do.
 &HT;    ``We can't rule out the possibility that some might have been
flung out of a solar system, but it looks like they have always
been free-floating,'' Lucas says.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIKE WATERLOO FOR CHOCOLATE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Could the day come when the only chocolate bars are in museums?
 &HT;    South America's cacao growers are warily watching the spread of
witches'-broom fungus, which infects seed pods and sends out
evil-looking orange shoots. It has slashed Brazil's cocoa
production by more than 25 percent in the past five years.
 &HT;    Crowded cacao plantations encourage the rapid spread of the
witches'-broom fungus, and fungicides don't work well amid the
heavy rains of the tropics.
 &HT;    Robert Lumsden of the U.S. Agricultural Research Service in
Beltsville, Md., is leading an effort to fight fungus with fungus _
Trichoderma, which attacks witches'-broom and other cacao pests.
 &HT;    Field trials in Peru and Brazil show that Trichoderma fungi are
effective and harmless to the trees. But the genetic uniformity of
commercial cacao groves still leaves them vulnerable to future
attacks.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MR. SANDMAN
 &HT;    
 &HT;    William C. Dement knows that failing to get enough sleep is more
than a minor nuisance. It causes malaise, poor concentration,
moodiness, ill health and accidental deaths.
 &HT;    During more than four decades of pioneering research, Dement
codiscovered REM sleep, founded Stanford University's Sleep
Disorders Clinic and Research Center and witnessed countless
examples of the ways the body malfunctions when deprived of proper
rest.
 &HT;    Here, Dement talks about his research and his personal crusade
against sleep deprivation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How bad is the problem of sleep deprivation in the United
States?
 &HT;    A: Very bad. Everybody is sleepy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Doesn't the brain compensate for lack of sleep?
 &HT;    A: I don't think it does. Think of going to sleep as a balance.
There is so much weight on the sleep side and so much on the awake
side. Caffeine, pain, excitement, activity _ these things push the
balance in the awake direction, but the sleep-deprivation side may
keep getting heavier until nothing can oppose it.
 &HT;    There is new MRI research that suggests some areas of the brain
get more active, maybe in an effort to take up the slack. But that
may also just be an effect of sleep deprivation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will we ever have a cure for people who can't sleep?
 &HT;    A: Insomnia is quite a few different things. The insomnia that
arises out of stress or tragedy, things like that, we'll certainly
be able to treat. To cure all insomnia would be like being able to
have healthy sleep whenever you wanted. We can't do that yet.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What do you think about using melatonin to control sleep?
 &HT;    A: If you take the recommended dose of melatonin and it helps
you, fine. There are worse things people do _ drinking yourself to
sleep, or trying to get alert with cocaine.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will there ever be a pill that delivers alertness on demand?
 &HT;    A: Not one you could absolutely depend upon, no matter how sleep
deprived you were.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Will we ever understand why we need to sleep?
 &HT;    A: I'm confident of that. The biggest breakthrough was the
isolation of the narcolepsy gene in dogs. One abnormal gene causes
the quintessential sleep disorder. It suggests we're almost there.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why do we dream?
 &HT;    A: The brain is so active during REM sleep, it's almost as if it
has to do something. While you're awake you could ask, ``Why am I
conscious?'' Well, you are awake, so why are you dreaming when
you're asleep? Because the brain created the dream world, and we
have no choice but to live in it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Would you want to be able to live without sleeping?
 &HT;    A: We're so accustomed to a beginning and an end, that to have
consciousness going on forever would be hard. Maybe we could be
really happy with one hour of sleep, to end the day and begin the
next one.

FOR STADIUM NAMES, IT'S A NEW ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know what you are thinking: What kind of name is CMGI Field?
</P>
<P>
   Sports stadiums should be named after beer companies or car
companies or airlines, businesses with names you recognize that
make products you can touch and understand.
</P>
<P>
   Well get over it. This is a new century, and we have a new
economy. This is the way it is going to be from now on.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI joins a growing list of technology companies that have
their name on sports facilities: Qualcomm, PacBell, Ericsson, and
our personal favorite, PSINet Stadium in Baltimore. Compared to
PSINet Stadium, CMGI Field practically sounds like poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Like their old-economy counterparts, the new guys on the block
want the recognition and the branding benefits that come with
sticking their logos on something as tangible as a sports arena. In
fact, for the new guys, who compete in crowded, cutthroat markets,
the chance to become household names may well be worth the $5
million or $7 million or $10 million a year they are spending for
naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   And these guys have the money. Do they ever.
</P>
<P>
   Pop quiz: Name the two Massachusetts companies with the greatest
stock market value. Answer: EMC Corp. and Sycamore Networks.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, a Hopkinton, Mass. company that makes computer storage
systems, is currently worth more than $200 billion. Sycamore, a
Chelmsford, Mass. start-up that makes telecommunications gear, is
worth $40 billion. Never mind that Sycamore has been a public
company for less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a 70 percent decline in its stock price this year, a
reflection of the market's skeptical view of Internet businesses,
CMGI is worth $11 billion. At that level, it is worth more than
Raytheon or Staples or most of the other traditional companies you
can name.
</P>
<P>
   When CMGI's stock was at its peak, chief executive David
Wetherell was personally worth about $5 billion. Today, his net
worth is down to $1.4 billion. We're betting he'll still be able to
afford a seat and a hot dog at the new CMGI Field.
</P>
<P>
   You may say: Hold on a minute. These stock market values are
insane. CMGI has lost $730 million in the last three quarters.
These companies can't possibly be worth this much. And you may be
right. But the stock market looks to the future, not to the past,
and investors are betting that the race to the future will be won
by some of today's technology leaders, including CMGI.
</P>
<P>
   Call us old-fashioned, but we will miss some of the old-economy
names that used to dominate the sports world. When Gillette
sponsored the Friday night fights or Budweiser sponsored your
city's baseball team, you knew what you were dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   How many of us know what PSINet or Qualcomm actually do? Even by
new-economy standards, CMGI is a tough company to figure out. With
investments in more than 70 separate companies, CMGI has more
affiliates than the Patriots have players.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how CMGI describes itself:
</P>
<P>
   ``CMGI represents the largest, most diverse network of Internet
companies in the world, including both CMGI operating companies and
synergistic investments made through its venture-capital affiliate,
CMGI (at)Ventures. CMGI leverages the technologies, content and
market reach of its extended family of companies to foster rapid
growth and industry leadership across its network and the larger
Internet economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Got all that?
</P>
<P>
   The old-economy giants also had a stability you could count on.
Gillette has been making razors in South Boston since the turn of
the 20th century. Budweiser is as durable as a Clydesdale.
</P>
<P>
   Will we be able to say the same about CMGI? The company has been
around in its current form only since 1994. In that time it has
bought and sold companies, changed strategies, and moved with
Internet speed to take advantage of shifting tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone say for certain that CMGI will even be around in
2002, when CMGI Field is slated to open? Technology companies can
have short shelf lives. They can be bought by domestic or foreign
competitors. Their technology can become obsolete. Remember Digital
Equipment? Or they can run out of cash. We're not making any
predictions about CMGI, merely pointing out some of the risks
involved in making a deal with a new-economy partner.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all of us will learn to live with CMGI Field, just
as we have learned to live with the FleetCenter. As far as we know,
the Patriots will still play football the same way on the same fall
afternoons, and you will still be able to scream and cheer and
drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   Last time we checked, no one had yet figured out a way to
deliver beer over the Internet.

REALITY CRAZE PURSUES ROGER ON THE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Roger, a stranger in Berlin. There he is changing money at
the airport. There he is snapping a picture at the Brandenburg
Gate. There he is blending in with the crowd. But Roger isn't just
another tourist: He's a fugitive with a $10,000 bounty on his head.
He's being pursued by a professional manhunter, and his moves are
being monitored on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Run, Roger, run.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the scenario of some Cold War spy thriller; it's a
game being played right now on the streets of Berlin. Called
RealityRun (and chronicled on www.realityrun.com), the game offers
the latest twist in reality entertainment. Roger, said to be a
Dutch gym teacher who describes himself as ``very fast and
flexible,'' must survive undetected in Berlin for 24 days,
completing arcane tasks and eluding his would-be captors. He is
wearing a microphone, and Berlin residents can call a 900 number to
hear his voice and guess his whereabouts. They can also watch him
on the Internet when he retreats to his ``nest,'' a lair equipped
with Web cams where he is allowed to relax for two hours a day.
Anyone providing information that leads to his capture pockets the
$10,000; amateur sleuths can also collect if they successfully
confront Roger in public. If nobody finds him, Roger gets the cash.
</P>
<P>
   This stunt is hot news in Berlin, where radio jocks and
television crews are tracking Roger with the purple passion of
sportswriters chronicling a close pennant race. ``Berlin Hunts
Roger!'' scream the headlines. ``$10,000 Bounty!'' The Web site is
reportedly receiving 600,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some folks are also asking the requisite questions
about the rise of voyeurism and the fall of civilization. One story
quoted a German spokesman for Amnesty International who dismissed
the game as ``undignified for human beings.'' And in the RealityRun
chat rooms, skeptical netizens are doing a reality check of their
own. ``There is no Roger. It's just a marketing stunt,'' wrote one
user. ``Ich bin nicht ein Berliner dumkopf.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the game insist that Roger is for real. They see
the game as a kind of postmodern Iron Man contest modeled after
Steven King's novel, ``Running Man.'' Alexander Skora, the game's
inventor, is a triathlon athlete who scoffs at reality-based
programs like ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother.'' ``They are
boring,'' says Skora, a 29-year-old lawyer. ``It's people doing
time. Blah, blah, blah. People become famous for doing nothing, but
the reality runner has to be creative and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's be real. For all the postmodern mumbo jumbo, the game
is about two things: money and sex. The money part is obvious. The
organizers aim to create a RealityRun franchise, repeating the game
in a new city every two months and staging a final contest in New
York next spring. Visitors to the Internet site can vote on the
next city. (Boston isn't listed, but write-ins are accepted.) They
plan to take a cut of any earnings Roger and future Reality Runners
make as a result of their instant celebrity. ``We're going to
market the star potential of the participants, and we'll get a
piece of everything they do,'' says Alan Wolan, a New York
entrepreneur who is funding the game. ``Why shouldn't we? We make
them famous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the sex appeal, consider: In his disguise, Roger cuts a
dashing figure in a black cape, fedora, and boots. (Costume by
Zorro?) In the profile released by the producers, he allegedly
describes himself as ``an active heterosexual'' who was once
arrested for nudity in Greece. Last week he was required to sneak
into a women's restroom and take a photograph outside a stall.
After the photo was posted on the Web, folks scoured Berlin for the
sexy someone in the slinky black sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of having fun is making a lot of money, but there is also
a sexual aspect to it,'' says Wolan, CEO of GoGard, a postcard
advertising company. ``He's being hunted. There is a sensual
connection . . .'' A pause. ``I wanted to use the word erotic, but
I thought that would scare you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Au contraire. We asked for an interview. Skora called Roger on a
cellphone and acted as an intermediary. ``I keep on moving,'' Roger
says. ``I am not sitting anywhere longer than 15 minutes at a time.
People are looking at me quite differently.'' Is he stressed? ``I
am under enormous pressure, but if I show that, people will react
to that. I am being open. I am smiling.'' He says he had to beat a
hasty retreat from a restaurant after flirting with a waitress who
got suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is on. Run, Roger, run.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hottest movie on the Internet now is a three-minute short
called ``405: The Movie.'' Think LA freeway. Think disaster. Think
comedy. And there you have it, a clever short by aspiring
filmmakers Jeremy Hunt and Bruce Branit. The whimsical film stars a
DC-10, a hapless driver, and a clueless old lady.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers posted the short piece on the Internet in June,
and it spread like crazy. (You can see it at www.405the movie.com
or www.ifilm.com.) Shortly after the film's release, they were
signed by Creative Artists Agency; they quit their day jobs at a
special effects shop two weeks later. More than a million people
have downloaded the film. ``It's been an amazing two-month ride,''
says Hunt. ``We're meeting the entire town.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to love this scrappy duo _ except for the folks
at American Airlines. The airline's name and logo are on a jet that
makes an emergency landing in the film. ``We would have preferred
that they had made it a generic or fictitious airline instead of
using ours,'' says American spokesman John Hotard, who said the
company plans to contact the filmmakers. As for Hunt and Branit,
they're not too worried. ``This thing has gotten much bigger than
we intended,'' says Branit. As far as they're concerned, there's
still something special in the air.

CHOOSING SPAM OVER CENSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've pretty much made my peace with spam _ those annoying
unwanted e-mails from folks trying to sell you something. The stuff
just doesn't bother me as much as it used to, even though I get
more of it than ever.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned to chuckle at messages that offer me the chance to
retire rich at age 35 _ eight years too late, guys. FedEx me a time
machine and try again. Meanwhile, I'll just delete this crapola
with the flick of a finger . . . there! That wasn't too bad. And
maybe the next batch will be even sillier.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody's as even-tempered as I am, though. One
Californian's outrage over spam has launched him on a crusade
that's now being waged in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good chance you've never heard of Mail Abuse
Prevention System LLC (MAPS) of Redwood City, Calif., even if
you're affected by its actions. MAPS was founded in 1997 by Paul
Vixie, a man who hates unsolicited e-mail. He set up a list of
Internet addresses that originated the offending messages. Then he
automatically blocked all mail from these sources.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's Internet service providers liked the idea, and
asked to use Vixie's system, which he called the Realtime Blackhole
List (RBL). This led to the foundation of MAPS, a nonprofit
organization that has sworn eternal enmity to spam in all its
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, MAPS estimates that about 20,000 Internet users and
service providers rely on the Blackhole List to block spam. This
includes some of the biggest outfits in the business, such as
Microsoft Corp.'s free e-mail service Hotmail. And yet, MAPS is
still run by a handful of people, who decide for themselves what
counts as spam. If you offend their sensibilities, you go on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   And what does it take to offend them? A handful of complaints.
Three will do.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many people griped to MAPS about getting e-mail from
Harris Interactive Inc., known for its Harris Poll public opinion
surveys. Harris polls over the Internet, sending questions to
people randomly selected from a list of 6.6 million e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A number of sites provide their membership lists to Harris.
Users are warned about this during the signup process, and can
choose to opt out of the Harris list. But it'd be easy not to
notice the warning. Next thing you know, you're getting unexpected
questions about how you plan to vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   That must have happened to the unlucky trio who complained to
MAPS, which responded by blackholing Harris. Now millions of e-mail
recipients, including those who really do want to be polled, no
longer can receive the questionnaires. That's because these people
use service providers that subscribe to the RBL, which deletes mail
from Harris.
</P>
<P>
   My ISP doesn't subscribe to the list; I know because I get
Harris Poll e-mails. I've never responded to them, but I don't mind
getting them. And I'm not sure I want some guy in California
denying them to me, or to millions of others who don't even realize
their mail's being blocked.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Harris has filed a federal lawsuit against MAPS
and a number of Internet providers who use it. ``They have too much
power, and they apply it arbitrarily,'' says Harris spokesman Dan
Hucko. ``They're basically acting as censors, and that's just
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The MAPS people say there's no First Amendment right to send
unwanted e-mail. MAPS and the ISPs own their e-mail servers, and
can choose which messages to accept or reject. ``Being on the RBL
just means I think you're friendly or neutral to spam, and I don't
choose to exchange packets with you,'' says the list's manager,
Kelly Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   To get back into Thompson's good graces, Harris must send a
confirmation e-mail to every new person it signs up, and must send
such mail to the 6.6 million members it already has. These are good
ideas, and Hucko says that Harris is considering them.
</P>
<P>
   It may have no choice. The judge recently refused to issue a
restraining order against MAPS, and there's much merit to the
organization's case. Surely ISPs are entitled to reject some kinds
of incoming mail. On the other hand, should the final say reside in
the hands of a few self-appointed Web cops?
</P>
<P>
   Though I've grown used to spam, I wouldn't miss it if it went
away. That could happen under a proposed federal law that recently
passed the US House by an almost-unanimous vote. Rather than ban
spam, the law would make it easy for consumers to sue the spammers.
A few fat financial judgments against these clowns would be more
effective than MAPS's vigilante tactics, and not nearly as creepy.

NEW FLEETBOSTON HIRED GUN WILL RUN INVESTMENT GROUP FROM N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FleetBoston Financial Corp. is making a high-stakes bet that a
Wall Street veteran can spice up performance and growth in its $125
billion investment group _ from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Keith T. Banks, 44, joins Fleet after 16 years at white-shoe
investment house J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., where he last served as head of
US equities. He will be CEO and chief investment officer at the
newly renamed Fleet Asset Management. And his pay package will
rival FleetBoston CEO Terrence Murray's.
</P>
<P>
   The hire, after a difficult 18-month search, shows the lengths
to which banks and other second-tier players in the investment
business must go to attract senior talent.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Fleet is not asking Banks to move to Boston. He
will spend much of his time here, however, particularly at the
outset, as he gets to know some 1,000 employees in the department,
from research analysts and traders to portfolio managers. The group
manages money for two mutual fund families, Galaxy and Columbia,
plus about $50 billion for institutions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Banks has a temporary office on Sixth Avenue in New York. By
January, he will assume offices in the IBM Building near Central
Park, when Fleet's investment banking unit, Robertson Stephens,
moves to larger quarters.
</P>
<P>
   He will be paid $20 million to $25 million over the next three
years, industry sources said, probably including stock awards.
That's substantially more than his predecessor, Tom O'Neill, was
making at that job, according to Fleet's latest proxy statement.
And it's not far from the $5 million that Murray, the CEO, earned
in 1999, plus $15 million in restricted stock that vests over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty darned substantial,'' Alex Thomson, an executive
recruiter with Whitehead Mann Pendleton James in Boston, said of
Banks' pay package.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is clearly looking to get a big bang for its buck.
Investment management revenue in the first six months of this year
rose 8 percent from a year ago, to $480 million. Faster-growing
fund groups, such as Putnam Investments and MFS Investments, are
growing by double-digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business has enormous growth potential,'' said Charles K.
Gifford, Fleet's president. ``We absolutely intend to be a top-tier
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks indicated the business could grow substantially from this
point, with the right product lineup and performance. He wants to
beef up research and consider more aggressive equity products,
including sector funds, analyst-run funds, and hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now everything is on the table,'' said Banks, who
started with J.P. Morgan in 1984 as a chemical and textile analyst.
``First and foremost, I'm an investor.''
</P>
<P>
   A thin lineup of growth options has hurt Fleet's Galaxy family
of mutual funds over the last few years, as investors have flocked
to high-risk, high-return portfolios, according to an analysis by
Financial Research Corp., a Boston consulting firm. ``The
combination of the lack of aggressive growth product offerings and
the continuing merger activity at the corporate level have made
sales growth difficult for the firm,'' FRC said in its second
quarter report. what about 1784 funds?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Banks takes the top job at the investment group after
more than a year of upheaval. Fleet's purchase of BankBoston led to
many staff changes and to the elimination of BankBoston's former
1784 funds, which were merged into Fleet's Galaxy funds. Fleet's
five broker-dealers were reorganized under its Quick &AMP; Reilly
brokerage unit. The bank is also integrating its Columbia
Management fund unit, in Portland, Ore., into the asset management
group.
</P>
<P>
   While Fleet Asset Management's headquarters is still officially
Boston, Banks cleary plans to go talent hunting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not fish in the whole pond?'' Banks said, noting that,
``There is an absolute war for talent.'' While Boston is a hub of
investment management, it's not easy, Banks admitted, for banks to
go up against the likes of Fidelity Investments and Putnam when it
comes to recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be pretty effective in New York at attracting
people,'' he said. On top of providing strong investment
performance, he said, the best way to attract customers is,
``having the highest quality people and (the most) recognized
people you can get.'' Competitive pay is important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who previously ran investments at Fleet, left the
company to run his own Navigator hedge funds, a highly lucrative
business. Hedge funds are unregulated funds that can invest with
fewer restrictions than mutual funds. Managers typically pocket 20
percent of the returns they reap for clients.
</P>
<P>
   This job will be a challenge for Banks, industry watchers said.
At Morgan, he oversaw $85 billion of equity assets. Now he'll be in
charge of a larger pool of money, three offices and all the
operations of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Banks appears confident that he can deliver results for Fleet
shareholders and customers. And he'll be eating his own cooking, he
said. Though it wasn't a requirement of the job, he said, he'll be
moving a portion of his own assets into Galaxy funds. ``Much to the
chagrin of that fund manager,'' he joked.

 &HT;    GENDER IMBALANCE HURTS THE TECH INDUSTRY, FEMALE EXECS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 27.

<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Despite the astonishing growth of high-paying
jobs in the tech world, the number of young women entering
computer-related careers is small _ and shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   While women now account for slightly more than half of U.S.
Internet users, they are barely visible in the ranks of computer
scientists, engineers and programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter to the economy, or to society, if women sit
out the tech revolution? Would anything be different if women held
half of the tech jobs available?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes'' was the emphatic answer from a pair of the tech word's
leading female executives, who last week joined a sea of white guys
at the Aspen Summit, an annual conference on the digital revolution
sponsored by the Progress &AMP; Freedom Foundation, a non-profit
research group.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that if women played a larger role in the
technology-driven sector of the economy, it would be much
healthier, with more stable companies, fewer labor shortages, lower
costs and higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``My political side says women are no different (from men), but
they are,'' said Esther Dyson, chair of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers, a new international agency charged
with setting policy for the Internet's infrastructure. ``Whether
it's nature or nurture, they have different concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of their different perspectives, women would help
stabilize an industry that has become too chaotic, Dyson said. For
example, she said, one of the top concerns of many young male
techies is to become a chief executive officer as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how this industry works right now, there are
too many companies where some guy just decided he wanted to be CEO,
so he went out and did something that was redundant,'' she said,
referring to the wild proliferation of dot-com businesses in the
late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those me-too companies are collapsing, dragging
down the tech stock market and vaporizing capital. ``It's great to
see the outpouring of entrepreneurship, but at the same time, there
is this arrogance that says 'I'm going to do it,' as opposed to
saying, ``Gee, someone is already doing it _ let me help them do it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   A more female-influenced industry also might be better at
understanding consumers' needs, said Julie Shimer, a vice president
for 3Com Corp. and general manager of its consumer business. ``The
engineering pressure right now is very technology-gee-whiz focused,
but there's not much on 'Why would I want to do this? How would I
use it responsibly?','' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If half of all engineers were female, ``I think technology would
be easier to understand, and it would be targeted more at women and
children,'' Shimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said ``friendlier'' products also could reduce business
costs because companies ``might spend less money on tech support,''
she said, referring to the legions of workers who answer customers'
questions about puzzling products and services.
</P>
<P>
   But female perspectives are lacking because, outside of the
National Football League, few enterprises are as male-dominated as
the tech world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that while women
represent 51 percent of the population, they make up only 26
percent of the computer scientists and 9 percent of the engineers
working today.
</P>
<P>
   But even those ranks soon will thin as the pipeline of female
tech majors dries up. Only about 25 percent of computer science
bachelor's degrees will go to young women this year, down from 37
percent at the peak in 1984, according to the American Association
of University Women (AAUW). And at the high school level, girls
represent only 17 percent of the computer science ``advanced
placement'' test takers.
</P>
<P>
   While women's participation in computer science has been
decreasing, many girls a master's degrees in business
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, women are swarming over U.S. campuses, where they now
outnumber males 56 percent to 44 percent, according to the U.S.
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   So why are they shunning the tech world?
</P>
<P>
   An AAUW study found that girls regard computer-related jobs as
``boring'' and ``lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said that perception is fostered by the entertainment
media, which tend to use ``geeky guys'' to portray lonely computer
workers. ``Girls get a wrong message,'' Dyson said. ``Programmers
often work together and trade ideas. It's some of the more
interesting work because they are solving problems. You're not
doing the same thing again and again. It's very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAUW study found that girls also say teachers make computers
seem boring by focusing on the technical properties of hardware,
rather than on innovative uses of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the AAUW study showed girls are turned off by idea of
working extremely long hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer industry, ``some people do work a lot,'' Dyson
said. ``But I think that, frankly if you had more women in it,
you'd have more people to hire and nobody would need to work quite
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if more young women were entering tech fields, the
industry would be better able to restrain its runaway labor costs.
A survey of nearly 5,000 college students last spring found that of
those planning to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer
science or engineering, 51 percent expect a starting salary offer
of between $51,000 and $70,000 a year, according to CollegeHire, an
Austin, Texas-based high-tech recruiting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing solely on paying higher salaries, tech
executives would do well to concentrate on making the workplace
friendlier to people who want to maintain a home life, Dyson said.
Such changes would also help the industry attract more young men,
who also have started avoiding computer-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of U.S. undergraduates earning computer and
information science degrees declined from a high of 41,889 in 1986
to just 24,768 in 1997. The Information Technology Association of
America says technology-driven companies have about 800,000 jobs
now open or projected to be open through the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick fix to the labor shortage, the industry has been
hammering Congress to nearly double the current cap of 115,000 on
the visas that allow high-skilled foreigners to work here for up to

</P>
<P>
   But long-term, a better solution would be to make the computer
lab feel less like a stay-up-all-night fraternity house. Providing
more humane working hours, child-care help and vacation time would
attract far more people, both male and female, to the industry.

ELDERS' EFFORT LEADS TO DRUG PRICING LAW 
</HEADLINE>

   The 25 seniors from Maine weren't thinking revolution when they
boarded a Greyhound bus in Portland two years ago. They didn't have
a political agenda as they made the five-hour trip to Montreal. And
they certainly didn't give presidential politics a thought as they
made a mad dash to a Canadian pharmacy the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   They just wanted cheaper prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saved almost $100 that day,'' said Viola Quirion, 77, of
Waterville, as she recalled the adventure in which she and others
took advantage of Canada's regulated prescription drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Their bus ride bolstered a movement that ended with Maine
becoming the first state to enact a drug price control law, which
went into effect last week. The law made national headlines and
unleashed a political storm. Similar bills are developing in many
states, waiting to emerge during the winter legislative season.
</P>
<P>
   Drug pricing is a powerful issue affecting the pocketbooks and
the health of about 13 million seniors without prescription drug
coverage. Annual spending on drugs for each American senior grew
from $559 in 1992 to $1,205 in 2000, a 116 percent increase,
according to a national study. By 2010, that figure is expected to
jump 133 percent, to $2,810.
</P>
<P>
   Most people never feel the cost of drugs because their health
insurance handles it. But Medicare, the federal program that
insures the elderly, does not cover prescriptions. And those
without insurance _ an estimated 40 million people _ must pay or go
without.
</P>
<P>
   But going without can be painful, especially in old age.
Prescription drugs are playing an increasingly vital role in health
care, keeping in check dozens of chronic conditions that, left
untreated, could ruin the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, presidential candidates Al Gore and George W.
Bush have promised to tackle the issue, and their different
approaches could influence elderly voters in the presidential
election. Five bills on the issue have been introduced in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drug companies are making record profits, but their
marketplace is growing increasingly competitive. Most ideas for new
drugs fail in the laboratory. A single blockbuster drug, like
Prozac or Lipitor, can make or break a company. The companies argue
that current prices are justified by the billions of dollars they
spend on research. But even they support some forms of drug
coverage for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   So how did this political snowball start in Maine? Blame it on
Canada, which sets drug prices at levels it considers fair to
patients and pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Quirion's band of bus riders were, in fact, latecomers to
cross-border drug shopping. Maine and Canada share almost 800 miles
of border, and along it are dozens of paired towns, like Calais in
northeast Maine and St. Stephen in New Brunswick. Residents of
Calais have long made the short, easy trip to pharmacies in St.
Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main factors behind why Maine was first is our
proximity to Canada,'' said Maine's governor, Angus King, an
Independent. ``When you live in Kansas you can't drive 50 miles to
get cheaper prescriptions like we can. You don't notice the price
differential there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the issue came up, Mainers took to it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The law that King signed in May allows the state to gather the
325,000 residents without drug coverage, to group them with Maine's
200,000-person Medicaid population, and to negotiate drug prices
with pharmaceutical companies. The companies regularly give
discounts to high-volume purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Maine law gives the state a big stick in negotiations.
If officials do not get the discounts they are looking for, they
can set the prices they want after July 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The law angered drug makers. The pharmaceutical giant SmithKline
Beecham announced this month that it would no longer ship pills to
Maine. A week later, a coalition of drug makers filed suit against
Maine, asserting that the law is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   King, whose administration is preparing to negotiate drug prices
in the fall, is undeterred. ``Maybe they don't want to talk except
in court, and that's unfortunate,'' he said. ``But if this is
successful, every state in the union is going to do it in, like, 18
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirion did not hear of the Canadian option from her fellow
Mainers. It was a group of elderly Minnesotans visiting Waterville
for a conference on aging who let her in on the secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us about how much money they saved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quirion had worked for 40 years in quality control at a Maine
shirt factory before retiring nine years ago. Her income is largely
Social Security, about $1,000 a month, and her health insurance is
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   She takes a drug called Prilosec, which keeps her chronic
stomach problems in check. Without it she cannot digest food. And
she takes Relafen for her arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, a three-month supply of the drugs costs about $600.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, it costs about $400.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good thing,'' Quirion said. ``So we decided to
do it once a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the trip spread. On the second run, last year, the
seniors had their own bus, donated by local unions, and 35 seniors
from other parts of New England. They also had a special guest.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wallace, a reporter for the CBS News show ``60 Minutes,''
had heard of the trip, and decided to bring a television camera
crew along. When the show hit the airwaves, the reaction was
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got telephone calls and mail from all over,'' Quirion said.
</P>
<P>
   Maine state Senator Chellie Pingree, a North Haven Democrat,
took note. She had fallen into the issue accidentally. During her
second term, the Republicans had taken control of the Senate and
had relegated her to a legislative graveyard shift, a subcommittee
on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Pingree noticed that when she mentioned the issue of high drug
prices, pharmaceutical lobbyists were at her door the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys just don't move,'' she said in an interview last
week from the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, where
the knitting store owner was something of a minor star.
</P>
<P>
   But she saw the groundswell of interest as presidential
contenders and academics began raising the issue last year.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of group purchasing intrigued her. Why not gather
all the people without insurance to form a big buying block? The
idea had been around for decades. Most HMOs, government agencies,
and large companies get discounts because they buy so many drugs
for their group members.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than negotiate with companies, Pingree decided to
calculate the savings a big buying group would deserve and to fix
the prices by law. The bill passed the Maine House on April 14 and
the Senate two weeks later. But the governor had concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am generally more sympathetic to market-based solutions,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew a hot issue when he saw one. So rather than veto the
bill, he convened a rare negotiating session with Pingree and her
colleagues. What emerged was a plan to form a Maine buying block
and negotiate prices with the drug companies rather than set the
prices outright.
</P>
<P>
   Pingree and her colleagues insisted on a backup plan. If the
companies did not play fair, the state would set prices. King
signed the bill, and Maine found itself a national leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say there's a great deal of interest. I've talked
to governors all over the country,'' King said, noting that the
chief executives of New Hampshire and Connecticut have a strong
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry filed suit against the law three
days before it went into effect. It argued that the law violates
the Constitution's commerce clause, which prohibits states from
regulating business that crosses state lines. The companies are
asking a federal judge in Maine to suspend the law until the
constitutional issues are resolved. With several other states
likely to attempt to pass similar laws soon, the industry is
anticipating a multifront legal war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that a number of states are considering bills
modeled on Maine's. It would be a bad decision for other states,''
said Marjorie Powell, assistant general counsel for Pharma, the
pharmaceutical trade group that filed the suit.
</P>
<P>
   But all the talk of constitutional battles and presidential
elections does not move Quirion. She thinks more about her fellow
Mainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people in central Maine who lost their jobs.
They have no insurance and don't have any prescription drug
benefits,'' she said. ``We're fighting for them, too.''

 &HT;    GENDER IMBALANCE HURTS THE TECH INDUSTRY, FEMALE EXECS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 27.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Despite the astonishing growth of high-paying
jobs in the tech world, the number of young women entering
computer-related careers is small _ and shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   While women now account for slightly more than half of U.S.
Internet users, they are barely visible in the ranks of computer
scientists, engineers and programmers.
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter to the economy, or to society, if women sit
out the tech revolution? Would anything be different if women held
half of the tech jobs available?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes'' was the emphatic answer from a pair of the tech word's
leading female executives, who last week joined a sea of white guys
at the Aspen Summit, an annual conference on the digital revolution
sponsored by the Progress &AMP; Freedom Foundation, a non-profit
research group.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that if women played a larger role in the
technology-driven sector of the economy, it would be much
healthier, with more stable companies, fewer labor shortages, lower
costs and higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``My political side says women are no different (from men), but
they are,'' said Esther Dyson, chair of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers, a new international agency charged
with setting policy for the Internet's infrastructure. ``Whether
it's nature or nurture, they have different concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of their different perspectives, women would help
stabilize an industry that has become too chaotic, Dyson said. For
example, she said, one of the top concerns of many young male
techies is to become a chief executive officer as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how this industry works right now, there are
too many companies where some guy just decided he wanted to be CEO,
so he went out and did something that was redundant,'' she said,
referring to the wild proliferation of dot-com businesses in the
late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those me-too companies are collapsing, dragging
down the tech stock market and vaporizing capital. ``It's great to
see the outpouring of entrepreneurship, but at the same time, there
is this arrogance that says 'I'm going to do it,' as opposed to
saying, ``Gee, someone is already doing it _ let me help them do it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   A more female-influenced industry also might be better at
understanding consumers' needs, said Julie Shimer, a vice president
for 3Com Corp. and general manager of its consumer business. ``The
engineering pressure right now is very technology-gee-whiz focused,
but there's not much on 'Why would I want to do this? How would I
use it responsibly?','' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If half of all engineers were female, ``I think technology would
be easier to understand, and it would be targeted more at women and
children,'' Shimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said ``friendlier'' products also could reduce business
costs because companies ``might spend less money on tech support,''
she said, referring to the legions of workers who answer customers'
questions about puzzling products and services.
</P>
<P>
   But female perspectives are lacking because, outside of the
National Football League, few enterprises are as male-dominated as
the tech world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department estimates that while women
represent 51 percent of the population, they make up only 26
percent of the computer scientists and 9 percent of the engineers
working today.
</P>
<P>
   But even those ranks soon will thin as the pipeline of female
tech majors dries up. Only about 25 percent of computer science
bachelor's degrees will go to young women this year, down from 37
percent at the peak in 1984, according to the American Association
of University Women (AAUW). And at the high school level, girls
represent only 17 percent of the computer science ``advanced
placement'' test takers.
</P>
<P>
   While women's participation in computer science has been
decreasing, many girls are flocking to other fields that require
intensive study of math and science. For example, women now make up
about 40 percent of students pursuing medical degrees and master's
degrees in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, women are swarming over U.S. campuses, where they now
outnumber males 56 percent to 44 percent, according to the U.S.
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   So why are they shunning the tech world?
</P>
<P>
   An AAUW study found that girls regard computer-related jobs as
``boring'' and ``lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson said that perception is fostered by the entertainment
media, which tend to use ``geeky guys'' to portray lonely computer
workers. ``Girls get a wrong message,'' Dyson said. ``Programmers
often work together and trade ideas. It's some of the more
interesting work because they are solving problems. You're not
doing the same thing again and again. It's very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAUW study found that girls also say teachers make computers
seem boring by focusing on the technical properties of hardware,
rather than on innovative uses of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the AAUW study showed girls are turned off by idea of
working extremely long hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer industry, ``some people do work a lot,'' Dyson
said. ``But I think that, frankly if you had more women in it,
you'd have more people to hire and nobody would need to work quite
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if more young women were entering tech fields, the
industry would be better able to restrain its runaway labor costs.
A survey of nearly 5,000 college students last spring found that of
those planning to graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer
science or engineering, 51 percent expect a starting salary offer
of between $51,000 and $70,000 a year, according to CollegeHire, an
Austin, Texas-based high-tech recruiting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing solely on paying higher salaries, tech
executives would do well to concentrate on making the workplace
friendlier to people who want to maintain a home life, Dyson said.
Such changes would also help the industry attract more young men,
who also have started avoiding computer-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of U.S. undergraduates earning computer and
information science degrees declined from a high of 41,889 in 1986
to just 24,768 in 1997. The Information Technology Association of
America says technology-driven companies have about 800,000 jobs
now open or projected to be open through the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick fix to the labor shortage, the industry has been
hammering Congress to nearly double the current cap of 115,000 on
the visas that allow high-skilled foreigners to work here for up to
six years.
</P>
<P>
   But long-term, a better solution would be to make the computer
lab feel less like a stay-up-all-night fraternity house. Providing
more humane working hours, child-care help and vacation time would
attract far more people, both male and female, to the industry.

your sex appeal, you need to start treating people right.''

 THE RIDE IS GETTING SUITE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ATTLEBOROUGH, Mass. _ On the right, we have Arthur Longa's
two-floor, colonial-style house. On the left, we have his Allegro
Bus diesel motor home.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz: Which one _ the house on the right or the RV on the
left _ has all-maple kitchen cabinets, leather couches, and tile
floors? Which one has two-zone heating and air conditioning?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It's the recreational vehicle, worth $180,000 and 39
feet long. It also has a living room that expands 3 feet in width
at the push of a button, two televisions and a VCR, and a CD player
that holds eight discs. And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered the province of retirees, RVs are going upscale
and finding a younger, hipper following. Longa, a 40-year-old
father of two, is part of a groundswell of RV enthusiasm that is
putting a new face on a classic piece of Americana. In recent
years, 35- to 54-year-olds have for the first time surpassed the
over-55 crowd in ownership of RVs. And sales are at a 20-year high;
last year, manufacturers shipped $10.4 billion worth of RVs to
dealers, compared with just $1.2 billion in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom, enthusiasts say, is not just a product of the
high-flying economy. They see RV mania as a sign of a gathering
backlash against today's hyped-up, stressed-out lifestyle. An RV,
they say, represents a return to a slower, more relaxing mode of
travel, redolent of the byways and back roads of a gentler era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted my children to see more of America than a fly-in,
fly-out kind of a trip,'' said Longa, who rented RVs for several
years before purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Brunswick, Maine, is hosting the annual convention
of the Family Motor Coach Association, where manufacturers show off
the latest advances in mobile home technology and devotees swap
secrets of living the good life on the road. Organizers expected
6,000 RVs to make the pilgrimage. Consider it a show of force.
</P>
<P>
   It's an indication that, even in an age when air travel is
ubiquitous, when many families can afford expensive vacations,
Americans still find liberation behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time in my life that I really feel free,'' said
Janet Smith, an RV devotee who rents and sells the vehicles at Trip
Makers Inc. in Walpole. She believes that many families are turning
their backs on ``jet-setting'' vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Longa's is one of them. ``The RV is very exhilarating and
free,'' he said. ``I don't have to pull into the airport and wait
for someone else to get me there. I can get there myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, parents who have bought or rented RVs say they
finally found a way to get away from the constant din of soccer and
piano lessons, bills, and leaky faucets. In an RV, they say, they
have managed to achieve family bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very, very busy. This was a way to put a pause in the
sentence,'' said Joan Wallace-Benjamin, president of the Urban
League of Eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace-Benjamin rented an RV a few years ago for a
cross-country trip with her two sons and husband, Milton Benjamin,
president of the Massachusetts Community Development Finance
Corporation. On long stretches of road, the family passed the time
with books-on-tape and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good way for us to bond and get to know one
another,'' said Wallace-Benjamin, who added that her family would
love to go again next summer. ``In the process, we decided we
really do like our kids. We don't just love them; they're
interesting people.''
</P>
<P>
   And the children, separated from their friends and forced to
talk to their parents for days on end, apparently enjoy the time as
much as the adults. One mother, Karen Boynton of Plymouth, reported
that her 16-year-old son offered to pay for a weekend at a
campground out of his allowance.
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of MTV's ``Road Rules,'' a long-running
reality show that features a Winnebago, RVs are gaining a certain
measure of cachet with youth. Mini Cost Auto Rental, a Newton
agency, rented 25 RVs to fans of the band Phish for a New Year's
Eve concert in Florida that generated a two-day traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Younger renters and buyers are exactly what RV manufacturers
want. In the past three years, the Recreational Vehicle Industry
Association has spent $20 million in print and television ads
promoting their products, with much of the campaign aimed at baby
boomers and families with young children. The association has been
so successful that it is planning to double its spending for
another three-year campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The association says one of the best lures is gadgetry, which
can push the cost of an RV to the million-dollar mark. Of the motor
homes shipped in 1999 (separate from travel trailers and other
smaller RVs), 77 percent had at least one ``slide-out,'' a
mechanism that expands floor space at the push of a button. Other
options include satellite television, Internet access, and washers
and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amenities are very important,'' said Jeffrey Gladstone,
37, a Boston investment analyst who lives in Franklin. ``I see
people miserably crawling out of their tents, and they look over at
me, drinking a cup of coffee and looking for the remote control.
That says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone recently purchased a 27-foot travel trailer that
attaches to his pickup truck. He's planning to upgrade next year to
a full motor home, and perhaps drive cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone, his wife, his 7-year-old son, and 10-year-old
daughter have gone away every weekend since they bought the RV in
April, including trips to Maine, Connecticut, and Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Unwinding at home is not good enough, Gladstone said. ``You have
to get away. If you sit on your lawn, you look down and you see
weeds, and then you get stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger, and often more affluent, market for RVs is also
influencing the camping options available across the country. Bay
View Campgrounds in Bourne, for example, has three swimming pools,
a video game parlor, and courts for tennis, basketball, and
volleyball, along with daily activities for children.
</P>
<P>
   These campgrounds make it appealing for families like
Gladstone's to take short weekend trips. And they sometimes serve
as surrogate neighborhoods. Ron Norfolk of Freetown, for example,
doesn't feel safe letting his children ride bicycles on the busy
street at home. But at Pinewood Lodge Campground in Plymouth, where
he spent last week, they can.
</P>
<P>
   Even high gasoline prices seem to have done little to dampen RV
enthusiasm. Shipments of the biggest vehicles _ Class A motor homes
_ are down 5 percent since last year, but are otherwise higher than
any time in the last two decades. Overall, RV sales are soaring to
record highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch it suck up gas,'' Gladstone said, ``but I weigh the
enjoyment, and it's not really an issue.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Linux is not pretty _ at least not in its
natural state. But lately the upstart operating system has been
getting a facelift, and Nat Friedman likes the look of it.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and his colleagues at Helix Code Inc. are performing
the surgery. Their Helix Gnome software masks the drab, complex
text interface of Linux behind rich and colorful images that let
users control Linux by clicking a mouse, just as they do with
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-million people have already downloaded Helix Gnome
from the company Web site since it was released on the Internet in
March. Among the small but influential clique that runs Linux
software on their personal computers, Helix Gnome is on its way to
being the gold standard.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not bringing in any gold. Like Linux itself, Helix
Gnome is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software itself is a commodity,'' Friedman says. ``We hope
to make no money off the software.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other Linux firms, Helix Gnome expects to get users
hooked on a variety of add-on services to bring in some bucks.
Quite a lot of bucks, says Will Roseman, cochairman of Linux Global
Partners, a New York venture capital firm that has invested $2.2
million in Helix Code. Roseman predicts quarterly earnings in the
$30 million range by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about any of this technology,'' says
Friedman with refreshing candor. After all, Gnome's been around for
a couple of years, the brainchild of a team of programmers led by
Mexican software designer Miguel de Icaza. Nor is Gnome the only
effort to create a user-friendly interface for Linux. Its
best-known rival is the KDE Project, launched by programmer
Matthias Ettrich in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   De Icaza began Gnome in 1997, largely because the KDE Project
originally contained some ``closed'' code that belonged to a
commercial software company. This code has since been removed, but
the change came too late for de Icaza.
</P>
<P>
   A disciple of the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, de
Icaza rejected on principle the idea of giving any commercial firm
control over the contents of a Linux system. All the code, he
believed, should be ``open,'' freely available in its raw form for
anyone to modify. This was the guiding principle of the Free
Software Foundation's GNU project to create open software programs.
(GNU stood for GNU's Not Unix). De Icaza made his new interface
part of the GNU project, and named it the GNU Network Object Model
Environment, or Gnome.
</P>
<P>
   De Icaza's devotion to open software doesn't mean he's opposed
to making money. He even interviewed for a job at Microsoft Corp.,
when MIT computer science student Friedman was working there as a
summer intern. De Icaza didn't get the Microsoft job, but he and
Friedman hit it off, and decided to found a company to improve upon
and commercialize Gnome.
</P>
<P>
   Helix Code was incorporated in October, and began by staffing up
with top Linux coders. ``We knew everyone in the Gnome community,''
Friedman says. ``So recruiting and hiring for us was just a game .
. . we hired the best developers from a community of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   The team set to work, adding a number of sophisticated new
applications to the basic Gnome interface. One of them, Evolution,
may raise a few eyebrows at Microsoft headquarters. It's a dead
ringer for Microsoft's popular Outlook personal information manager
_ only it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Another top priority at Helix Code is built-in software that
will connect a user to the company's Internet servers. That way, a
user can automatically download bug fixes, code updates, new
features, and more.
</P>
<P>
   A whole lot more, if Friedman gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The updater for us is sort of the seed for the beginning of
service offerings,'' he says. Once you get people regularly logging
in to a Helix Code server for upgrades, you get regular
opportunities to sell them stuff.
</P>
<P>
   How about an add-on that lets you order airline tickets from
inside your Evolution program, with arrival and departure times
automatically loaded into your schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Or you could dump your new digital photos onto your hard drive,
click a button, and have the pictures relayed to a photo processing
firm that would print them on glossy paper and mail them to
Grandma.
</P>
<P>
   You could also have the server send you a message the next time
Courtney Love is playing in town. The concert date would
automatically appear in your schedule. Friedman figures people
might pay $5 a month for such a service.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible revenue stream could flow from customized
versions of Helix Gnome, tailored to the needs of specific
businesses. And of course, there's the model of Linux firms like
Red Hat, which make their money by providing service and support
for users.
</P>
<P>
   All these profit options depend on getting Helix Gnome on as
many Linux desktops as possible. The company got good news on that
front at last week's LinuxWorld trade show in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the nation's top computer makers, including Compaq
Computer Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp., and Sun
Microsystems Inc., have joined with Helix Code in a new consortium
to support continuing development of Gnome. The deal doesn't mean
these companies have specifically endorsed Helix Gnome, but it
furthers the goal of making Gnome the standard user interface for
Linux computers.
</P>
<P>
   And not just Linux. Sun Microsystems plans to use Gnome on its
Unix-based computers, the most popular Unix machines in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's dirt cheap and relatively easy to switch from standard
Gnome to Helix Gnome. So expanding the universe of Gnome users is a
boost for Helix Code's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Helix Gnome is a hit with the Linux cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every conference I go to, people are using it,'' boasts
Friedman. ``So there's a kind of immortality there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, immortality is more fun when there's money in it.

ROYAL SCOTSMAN: STATELY HOME ON RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ Would I succumb to claustrophobia? I'm the
sort who can't comfortably get through the catacombs, or even climb
the Bunker Hill monument. The confined space thing creeps me out.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I recently signed on for a four-night trip on the
Royal Scotsman, an ornate train that meanders through the Highlands
of Scotland. The ``State Rooms'' measure 10 1/2-by-6 1/2 feet and
the shower stalls are so small that my elbows bumped the sides as I
was trying to wash my hair. No chance of falling over in the shower
if the train lurched.
</P>
<P>
   Space is a luxury. It's about the only one the Royal Scotsman
doesn't have. The service is superb, as is the food, which is a
near-miracle given the conditions under which it's created. The
train's decor is opulent, dominated by plaid _ no surprise in the
land of tartan. The staff wear plaid pants or pleated skirts.
Certain nights on the trip, designated as formal, give gentlemen
guests the chance to wear plaid, too: They're requested to don
either dinner jackets or kilts. My Jewish husband, lacking a clan
tartan, threatened to have a kilt made up in a Star of David
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The train is essentially a British country house on wheels:
Think ``The Shooting Party,'' without the bedroom-swapping
hanky-panky. (Or maybe I just missed that.) ``Murder on the Orient
Express'' also came to mind. Although the crime rate on the train
was nil, the delicious sense of possibility was there.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Scotsman experience starts before you board the train,
in the elegant Balmoral Hotel next to Edinburgh's Waverley Station,
from which the train departs. Sitting in a dark, clubby,
leather-and-mahogany lounge, you fill out forms that ask about
personal preferences. Under the ``Food and Beverage'' category, I
wrote ``as much champagne as possible,'' which turned out to be no
problem on board, although there's probably a nationwide shortage
of bubbly now.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I tried to walk from the hotel to the train, and
were gently informed that we'd be driven in a procession of proper
British black taxis instead, even though the walk would have taken
two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to become accustomed to the way you're going to be
treated for the next four days,'' said our guide, a Mary Poppins
nanny type. The pampering continued as a kilted piper played while
we trod on a red carpet to board the garnet-colored train. We were
directed by a Jeeves equivalent to the observation car, which was
graced with giant bouquets including thistles, a traditional symbol
of Scotland. There were also overstuffed sofas whose ends sprouted
tiny triangular tables on which to place drinks: The car is so
narrow that coffee tables are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century style of the Scotsman conjures up Queen
Victoria tootling up to her beloved Balmoral on her royal train.
The modern version is richly outfitted with brocades and velvets,
mostly jewel-toned, and wood-paneled walls with ornate inlaid
moldings outlining panels of pale golden burl. Coved ceilings in
the public rooms are covered in embossed white paper; ceiling fans
whir overhead, the only form of air conditioning on the train and
all that's generally needed in the cool Scottish climate. Windows
in the train actually open. I'm so used to hotel windows that don't
that this in itself was impressive, and went a long way toward
alleviating any sense of being cooped up. Besides, the Highland air
is wonderfully breathable.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of peace and privacy prevails as you watch the rugged
countryside go by, with its ruined castles and fields of wild
lupine and gorse. On the tour I took (there are several different
ones), the route was essentially a giant loop around Scotland's
most picturesque parts, beginning and ending in Edinburgh. The
train stables at night, so no movement disrupts guests' sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling alone with nature, I was standing stark naked one
morning, looking out of the window, when suddenly the train pulled
up at a village station and there were fully clothed people looking
back at me.
</P>
<P>
   The individual cabins (20, to accommodate 36 travelers) are
cleverly designed to maximize space and minimize the effects of the
moving train. As soon as you unpack, your luggage is whisked away
by the staff so it's not in your way. Built-in twin beds have
storage drawers underneath, in between, and overhead. There's an
armoire as well. There actually is enough room for the wardrobes of
people who never wear the same thing twice. All the doors have
hooks at the top to secure them in either open or shut positions,
so they don't swing or sway when the train does. Shelves are all
boxy compartments, so nothing falls off. The rooms have no phones;
I found the absence of constant ringing and voice mail a relief.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the train's general manager, Stephen Coupe, is part
baronet-type host, part butler. He acknowledges that passengers
cede a certain control on board: ``We're telling you what you have
to eat and drink, and what your schedule is, and you have to like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes sure you like it. I found not having to make decisions
quite relaxing. Coupe, while outwardly serene at all times, can't
have relaxed for a second. Various airlines had lost the luggage of
several passengers, and Coupe spent hours on the phone (he's got
one) tracking it down. When one guest lost an earring on the floor
of a cashmere shop during one of the daily off-train excursions, he
tracked that down, too, and had it forwarded to the London hotel
where she would be staying next. He oversees the annual
redecoration of the train during the off-season: The Scotsman
doesn't run in winter. The tab for last year's refurbishment was
$500,000, but Coupe dreams of spending even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like mixer taps in the bathrooms,'' he says wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   We all need a Coupe in our lives, I started to think, a
major-domo who makes things run smoothly. ``Service is our number
one priority,'' he says, and the service behind the scenes is as
impressive as what you do see. Take bath towels. There are fresh
ones for every passenger, every day. With no laundry facilities on
board, I wondered where the dirty ones were stashed. (In the
luggage area underneath the Royal Scotsman bus that takes guests on
their daily excursions, it turns out.) The towels are washed only
when the Scotsman returns to Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain theatricality to this travel experience, the
illusion that you're journeying on your own private train. The
staff of 20 eager-to-please young people don't wear name tags, just
as they wouldn't if they were working in your own stately home.
There are no bills to sign for meals or drinks; even the champagne
is included in the hefty price of around $1,000 a day per person.
There is just one sitting at meals, so no one's ever waiting,
everyone can linger, and the dining rooms don't feel like
restaurants. Even the toiletries in the bathrooms are on a
residential scale: Eight-ounce shampoo bottles instead of dinky
little hotel-size ones.
</P>
<P>
   The limited space of the cabins encourages orderly living. Two
people getting dressed in the cabin at the same time requires
choreography as intricate as a tango. If you don't hang up your
clothes or fold them in a drawer, they start piling up on the floor
like snowdrifts. There's no room to walk around. If I had the
money, I'd send my teenage son on the train, just to teach him what
a closet is for.
</P>
<P>
   Some people prefer spas for their self-indulgence, and there is
an advantage in that a spa gives you a shot at losing weight, which
the Scotsman certainly doesn't. The food is sublime, turned out by
two chefs who work in a tiny kitchen with a window onto the
corridor, so guests can watch them toil. (There used to be three
chefs, but there wasn't room for them all to maneuver in the small
space at the same time.) The chefs bake bread twice a day, and
create such extravagant dishes as roast sea bass with Jerusalem
artichokes, foie gras parfait, and roast squab with asparagus, all
complemented by excellent wines selected by Coupe. For an American,
the train's breakfast is actually the most adventurous meal, with a
different smoked fish each morning along with lamb kidneys and
black pudding, which is pig's blood sausage. (Nearly every other
breakfast-like substance is also available, and there were people
on my tour who opted for the yogurt and muesli.)
</P>
<P>
   Daily excursions in the luxuriously equipped bus (drinks, fruit
baskets, restroom) tended to be food- and drink-centered, too.
There was a private tour and tasting at the Strathisla Distillery,
where you learn how single malt Scotch is made. There was a visit
to the Inverawe Smokehouse, whose jolly owner, Robert
Campbell-Preston, gave a fish-smoking demonstration and then
invited us into his gabled manse for wine and samples of smoked
venison and eel, as well as the traditional salmon. (We were able
to consume only about half of this lavish buffet. I asked what
happened to the leftovers. They go, it seems, to the
pets-in-residence, Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.)
</P>
<P>
   There was a visit to Kinloch Lodge on the Isle of Skye, where
Claire Macdonald, Scotland's version of Julia Child and the wife of
Lord Macdonald of Macdonald, the 34th high chief of Clan Macdonald,
offered one of her famous cooking demonstrations. Giving out
recipes for rack of lamb with pinhead oatmeal and cracked black
pepper crust, she also cheerfully gave us a piece of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need full-fat foods in your diet,'' she said adamantly,
advocating exercise to offset them. ``People eating reduced fat
diets are leading pathetic lives. You can't look a cow in the eye
if you buy skim milk. It's filthy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For four delightful days, I followed Lady Macdonald's advice. I
don't know if I gained weight. There aren't any scales on the Royal
Scotsman. There isn't room.

FIBERGLASS INSULATES EVEN WHEN IT'S WET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am having my attic and the house insulated. What is better
to use: fiberglass or cellulose?
</P>
<P>
   R.D., North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Both fiberglass and cellulose are good insulators, with
cellulose having a slightly higher R factor, which is a measurement
of the ability of the insulation to stop the loss of heat. The
higher the number that goes with an R factor, the better the
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think that it is a matter of what is the better
insulation, but one's personal preference. The handyman prefers
fiberglass, whether it is blown in the walls or laid on the attic
floor. Fiberglass is inert, and once it is secured in the walls or
on the floor, it does not pose a health hazard. It is fire
resistant, although any kraft paper that is used with the
insulation as a vapor barrier is not. Fiberglass doesn't lose its
insulating ability if it gets wet, and when it does, it tends to
dry out faster than cellulose.
</P>
<P>
   Cellulose, while a good insulator, is organic, and loses some of
its value when it gets wet and takes a long time to dry out. It is
treated with chemicals to make it fire resistant, but no one has
proved to me how long those chemicals are effective.
</P>
<P>
   The only time cellulose is superior to fiberglass is when it is
wet-blown. This is usually done only in commercial applications.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My kitchen cabinets are a white painted metal, 60 years old.
I would like to paint them a different color. Is that practical?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BABOIAN, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is definitely practical, and while new paint will perk up
the kitchen, new handles can, too. The handyman did this with some
steel cabinets (they were all the rage shortly after the war) in
Connecticut nearly 40 years ago. I can't say how long the paint
lasted, but it stood up nicely for me for some years.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, do not paint the interior of the cabinets; they
probably don't need it and you can save yourself a lot of tedious
work. Do paint both sides of the doors, however.
</P>
<P>
   Take off the hardware if you can, although the hinges might be
riveted instead of screwed or bolted on. Sand all surfaces to be
painted to reduce gloss and roughen the finish. Wash with a strong
solution of detergent and water.
</P>
<P>
   When painting, always apply thin coats. Apply a prime coat of
latex enamel undercoater, finish with two coats of a semigloss
latex enamel. Or, for a high shine and top durability and
washability, two coats of a semigloss or high-gloss oil-based,
indoor-outdoor enamel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I like the new vinyl lattice, but I can't find it in dark
brown. It only comes in white, dark green, light brown, and gray.
These colors would not work on my house.
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA SILBERMAN, Gloucester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know if any company makes dark brown lattice. You can
paint vinyl lattice and vinyl everything else, but I would not; it
would be iffy, and if it started to peel or chip, you'll have a
pretty ugly mess. I suggest this: Buy pressure-treated lattice and
stain it with a dark brown semitransparent stain. Just one coat is
needed and you can repeat, with one coat, in five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We love our new smooth-top electric range, but there are two
problems: It has a stain that nothing seems to take out. I used the
special cream that comes with the stove for cleaning, without
success. What can I use? Also, the pots do not stay flat on the
smooth top, resulting in uneven heating. What can I do about that?
</P>
<P>
   ZELDA SOKAL, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's interesting. The handyman and his wife just got a
smooth-top range, and while we also love it, we have had problems
similar to yours. We did not have a stain that would not come out,
but that may be due to the fact that the handyman has taken off all
stains, some of them very stubborn, with careful use of Brillo or
SOS pads (not too heavy, of course, but not too light, either.)
There may be a taboo on using Brillo and other steel-wool products,
but that is mainly because we Americans tend to do a job with
maximum power and no holds barred. A moderately restrained
steel-wool cleaning will not hurt the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is typical with people who get new smooth-top
stoves: Their old pots and pans, no matter what quality, are
slightly warped and do not have full contact with the glass. The
only answer is to buy new kitchen ware, heavy-duty and of high
quality. You do not have to replace all the kitchen wear, just
enough to do good cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman's wife lucked out. Our kitchen wear was of high
quality, a wedding gift from her grandmother back in 1956. After
some years, it did get a bit distorted, but Mrs. Handyman inherited
a larger, heavier sauce pan from her mother. This one has stayed
flat and works perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   I am thinking of putting a metal trivet on the burner area and
the distorted pan on that, but this would reduce efficiency and
would tend to scratch the glass.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     PETTYS' NASCAR STREAK NEARS AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LEE SCHEIDE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As streaks go, not even Cal Ripken had a chance to touch this
one.
</P>
<P>
   When NASCAR was born in 1948, Lee Petty was one of the founding
members, coming out of the North Carolina backwoods to win three
driving titles in 15 years, along with the first Daytona 500 in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   He passed the torch to son Richard, who became the most prolific
NASCAR Winston Cup driver in history, winning seven championships
and 200 races.
</P>
<P>
   During Richard's reign as ``The King,'' his son, Kyle, joined
the family business, keeping the streak alive. And when Richard
retired after the 1992 season, Kyle was left to carry the family
banner into battle each week in Winston Cup ovals around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as dominant on the track, Kyle brought his own flair
to the series, his pony-tailed hair reaching the middle of his
back, the earring catching the eye. His own man, Kyle drove for the
famed Wood Brothers and then Felix Sabates before returning to the
roost in 1997 to run his own team _ and to prepare the world for
the next generation, his son Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Always smiling like his father, Adam had the desire of his
grandfather, and those in the inner circle of NASCAR knew that a
contender had just stepped into the ring. After all, he'd already
found his way to Victory Lane, being hoisted on grandfather
Richard's shoulders at less than a year old after Richard won the
1981 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Groomed through go-kart, American Speed Association and Busch
Grand National Series races, Adam attempted and qualified for his
first Winston Cup race in April, at Texas Motor Speedway.
Ironically, father Kyle couldn't make the field for his son's first
race, putting him in the unfamiliar role of observer.
</P>
<P>
   Had he known then the price his family was about to pay, no
price tag would have been too high to get Kyle into a car that day.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, on April 5, Lee Petty died, several weeks
after stomach surgery. The patriarch of the family had been ill, so
his death, while sudden, wasn't unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's, on May 12, in New Hampshire, knocked the family to its
knees.
</P>
<P>
   As Kyle and Adam's sister, Montgomery Lee, were flying to Europe
for an equestrian event, Adam's car hit the Turn 3 wall at full
throttle, causing severe head trauma that killed the 19-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   The town of High Point, N.C., rallied around Kyle; his wife,
Patti; Montgomery; and their other son, Austin. NASCAR circled its
wagons, protecting the entire Petty family during its time of
grief. Sprint, the chief sponsor on Adam's Busch car, parked its
car until Kyle was ready to put another driver in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Kyle wasn't ready to put anyone else in his son's seat
except himself. So when the team returned to the track, Kyle was
behind the wheel, sitting in Adam's seat, finding ways to keep
Adam's memory alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for me to stay close to him,'' Kyle has said
time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at Bristol, Kyle will drive the Sprint car in the
Busch race, then hopefully pilot the Hot Wheels car Saturday
evening in the Winston Cup race. He's done it hundreds of times,
but Saturday's race is significant, because when the checkered flag
drops on the winner, it also will signal the end of Kyle's Winston
Cup season for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The next weekend, at Darlington, Steve Grissom will drive the
Hot Wheels car, making it the first start in NASCAR history that a
Petty, while healthy, hasn't been in a race. That's 2,172 races
over 52 years of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Kyle will honor the memory of his son by driving the
remaining Busch Series races, then moving the Sprint car up to
Winston Cup competition next year. The plan had been for Adam to be
driving in 2001; now his father will take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Petty Enterprises, headed by Kyle, will field three
Dodge Intrepids, with John Andretti in the familiar No. 43, and a
new driver and sponsor for the No. 44. Kyle will pilot the No. 45,
backed by Sprint, starting a new streak for the Pettys. But things
can never be the same for the Pettys _ or NASCAR _ who had hoped to
use Adam's infectious smile and youthful attitude to drive into the
next two or three decades.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dick Gregory won't go home.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lil, has been putting up with it for 41 years now.
Just like their 10 children. And now, Gregory has cancer. And he
still won't go home.
</P>
<P>
   Word has been seeping out. Dropping into the ears of those
movement veterans. Those two words _ the movement _ still have a
poetic ring, but when the civil rights movement was in full swing,
it could be downright scary. In Mississippi and Alabama and other
places, places where fear could hang in the air like a piece of
lynch rope, places where dogs were barking not for food but for
feet, buttocks, anything on a scampering body.
</P>
<P>
   There were people who left home for the movement and the next
time their mama or daddy saw them, they had their eyes closed, in a
casket. ``People from the movement been catching up to me who I
thought were dead,'' Gregory says.
</P>
<P>
   He once ran for mayor of Chicago. He was under the impression
that Chicago goons were going to kill him. He believed Richard
Daley, the mayor then, knew about the plot. Or alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
   He once ran for the White House. He was arrested by US Treasury
agents for printing and distributing fake American currency with
his picture on the bills as campaign literature.
</P>
<P>
   When he told Lil about his lymphoma, she broke down, cried and
cried. ``I said to her, `If you think I'm going to leave you back
here for your high school sweetheart, you are out of your mind. As
much whiskey as I drank, as many cigarettes as I've smoked, I'm not
going to leave this earth before you.' '' Lil dried her eyes. Put
the tears inside her chest.
</P>
<P>
   Lil Gregory, who lives in Plymouth, Mass., knows the movement
owns her husband. The way oxygen owns the human body. He's ever
gone from home, out there, protesting. In Memphis, Shreveport, Los
Angeles. It's as if Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King and all the
others who were blown away won't let Dick Gregory go.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, cancer can snatch a life _ a child's, a grown-up's _ just
like that. It can snatch the life of an icon of the movement just
like that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have told Gregory that the lymphoma is 75 percent
contained. Gregory's selected course of treatment right now is
herbs, although radiation remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bother it,'' he says of his cancer. ``It won't bother
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever took him through those days and nights of Mississippi
and Alabama and jailings and CIA agents following him _ or were
they? _ will serve him just fine now, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   He's 130 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bony as a toy.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be starting another fast in October. ``I'm going to start
a fast on my birthday where I'm not going to eat any more solid
food the rest of my life till we solve this problem of police
brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, another fast.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly what the doctor ordered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's 4:30 in the morning. Dick Gregory is on his daily 5-mile
walk around Rock Creek Park, gliding through the inky dark. ``All
the muggers and robbers are asleep,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Richard Claxton Gregory 67 years ago. He used to be
a stand-up comic. And quite a famous one.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory grew up running cross-country in St. Louis, long
afternoons in sweet autumn light. ``It was lovely,'' he says. ``The
great thing about running the long distance is you run at your
integrity. Running made me forget I was poor.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran and ran, around the winos on the street, right to the
race track. ``When I was little, if I'd heard Bob Hope was running
across country to help hungry people, I'd have slept with a
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't running, he watched movies. The movies and all
their fantasies scarred his growing up. ``Whenever there was pain
in the movies, there was also some glamour.'' But the scar was
complex. ``The women I saw in the movies I didn't want,'' he says.
``Beulah the maid. Butterfly McQueen. The epitome of black love I
didn't see. So, locked in a little child's memory bank is a woman
who doesn't look like his aunt or mama.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, he'd scan church pews and see old men and women with
arthritis, with pain, and they were uncomplaining. Recognizing the
pain of others made him feel righteous.
</P>
<P>
   A scholarship came from Southern Illinois University. He quit
before graduation. In Chicago, the lapsed runner discovered he had
a funny bone. He started doing stand-up.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Chicago, he met Lil Smith, a secretary. Dating
led to passion. ``No son of mine will ever get a girl pregnant and
not marry her,'' Gregory's mother had always told him. Lil got
pregnant. ``That's how I got married,'' he recalls. ``It was no
glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   They honeymooned _ if you can call it that _ on a Greyhound bus,
going to St. Louis to live with his sister. Then he hit the road to
do comedy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a gig at the Playboy Club in Chicago. Frozen-food
executives, a lily-white audience, made up the crowd. They howled.
``It was the first time they had seen a black comic who was not
bucking his eyes, wasn't dancing and singing and telling
mother-in-law jokes,'' says Gregory. ``Just talking about what I
read in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine wrote him up. ``Jack Paar had me on his show, and
from then on, I was out of the box,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Faint light is squeezing through the trees of Rock Creek Park.
``Here's how life is,'' Gregory says into the ebbing dark. ``You
start out in darkness and keep moving. This is what they mean when
they say, `Joy cometh in the morning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later he's back in the house he uses in Washington
that belongs to a friend of Marion Barry, the former mayor. You
see, before his years as mayor and the crack cocaine, the
adulterous affairs, the jail stint, Barry was in the movement, down
in Mississippi. Brave as hell. Gregory's got bags laying around the
house, a leather bag full of clothes, smaller ones with pills,
vitamins, concoctions. He's rootless. Without office or staff.
Hotel lobbies make for fine office space, though. In Washington,
Gregory does a lot of radio. ``All the embassies are here. The FBI.
The CIA. They listen to me,'' he believes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the movement unfurled, Gregory, like so many, went to
Mississippi, to Greenwood, whiskey jumping in his blood like
grasshoppers. He'd get right in the face of redneck sheriffs and
rednecks without badges. ``I'd cuss 'em out. I got it from the
movies. Watching Alan Ladd, Humphrey Bogart.''
</P>
<P>
   Jail didn't bother him either. He'd nap. ``I learned long ago
that when `right' goes to jail, the jail becomes the prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he went to Moscow because he thought black soldiers
were being harassed for dating white women. A UPI reporter tapped
him on the shoulder _ something about movement workers. Missing. In
Mississippi. ``I went to the airport and got on a plane. Flew from
there to Paris. Paris to New York. New York to Jackson. That night
I was there, in Mississippi, talking to Sheriff Rainey, putting my
finger in his face, saying, `You know you did it. And we're going
to get you!' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Lawrence Rainey was one of those later arrested by FBI agents
in connection with the murder of the three civil rights workers
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner.)
</P>
<P>
   Politics seemed like a good challenge-the-system idea to
Gregory, so he started running. First for mayor in Chicago. ``They
told me Daley was so outraged. Just the fact that a nigger would
dare run against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks laughed. But he saw the drama unspooling out across
the nation's landscape. ``Carl Stokes, who ran for mayor of
Cleveland, said to me, `My wife said, ``Why don't you run for
mayor? That comedian's running against Daley in Chicago.'' ' ''
</P>
<P>
   He ran for the White House. ``For a little white child sitting
at home watching a black man say, `I'm a presidential candidate and
this is why I think you should vote for me,' well, it plants a
seed. A little seed.''
</P>
<P>
   When he printed fake American currency with his picture on the
bills, the Treasury Department was hardly amused. He was arrested
for forgery and later released, but not before garnering wide
publicity. ``When that story hit I was in demand,'' he says.
``People called me up and said, `I'll get some of your literature.'
'' He got 1 1/2 million votes. ``I woke up with power.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote an autobiography. Actually, he's no writer, and
joyfully admits it. ``I just dumped my head in a tape recorder.''
The book is called ``nigger'' _ lowercase n. At a rally in
Birmingham, Ala., staring out into a sea of black and white faces,
he held his book aloft and said, ``All of you white folks should
take a `nigger' to bed tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Richard Pryor, there was Dick Gregory.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper critic referred to the autobiography as
``powerful, ugly, and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day,'' says Gregory, ``100 years from now, folks will get
that book and dissect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's mother died while he was in college. His autobiography
is dedicated to her: ``Dear Momma _ Wherever you are, if ever you
hear the word `nigger' again, remember they are advertising my
book.''

   He kept moving. Stopping for the funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King didn't go home. Least not to wife Coretta.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm didn't go home. Least not to wife Betty.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schwerner didn't go home. Least not to wife Rita.
</P>
<P>
   Dead in the movement. Eyes watching God.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Gregory had a dream. In that dream there was a lot of fire.
The fire had engulfed Chicago. When he awoke from the dream, he had
decided to leave Chicago with the family.
</P>
<P>
   They moved to Massachusetts, to a farm in Plymouth, in 1973. Lil
had to raise the kids. There was plenty of money, boom times for
the Gregorys. He was making $20,000 a week. ``I gave a lot of it to
the movement,'' he confesses.
</P>
<P>
   He did get a Rolls-Royce. But time can evaporate money. ``My dad
knew how to make money,'' says son Christian, ``but not how to keep
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rolls was repossessed. It's a long story. The short version:
He was behind in the payments. The Rolls man called and his words
were on the funky side: ``Someone of your stature shouldn't be
behind in car payments.''
</P>
<P>
   They lost the farm in 1992. Another long story. The short
version: Some investments went bad; they were behind on the
payments; mortgage lenders aren't swayed by sad stories.
</P>
<P>
   Lil moved off the farm and into the town of Plymouth. Her
husband stayed out in the world, moving and moving.
</P>
<P>
   And he began running and marathoning again. Like he did in
childhood. But now it was for different reasons. Against hunger,
poverty, apartheid. ``You're running for something other than to
beat somebody's child,'' he says. After some races he'd wake up
dehydrated. He looked like a cadaver. But his eyes were sweet with
contentment. Lil caught up to him on the news, through phone calls.
Worried herself sick, but never worried her love for him one
millimeter from her heart.
</P>
<P>
   He ran cross country once. The whole country, weaving down
roads. Lil thought he had lost his mind. ``After you do your first
50, ain't nobody there,'' he says. ``Then you hear the wind
talking: `Nigger, who do you think you are? Ain't nobody out here.
I'm going to inflict on you what you've inflicted on other mother's
children. Even when you walked up and slapped people on the butt
and said `Good luck,' you didn't mean it. I'm getting ready to do
to your butt what you did to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when Gregory gets back to Washington, Keith Silver
drives him around. Silver's been in the movement for years. ``The
only thing bad about him is he goes on these fasts,'' Silver says.
``I hope he doesn't for the next 30 days. I want to eat. I'm
sitting next to him at these banquets and they don't bring me any
food because they think I'm fasting too. And I say, `Whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, I'm eating over here!' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And through all this _ the protests, the rallies, the walking,
the running _ what of the 10 children? Mostly, they've only had
Lil, their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never in my psyche that I'm going to be a great
father,'' Gregory says. ``Mine was: I'm going to be a great fighter
for the liberation, whatever it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, he was at a rally in Atlanta, sitting onstage next to
businessman Bertram Lee. Gregory started whispering to Lee about
money woes, the children's school fees. Lee wrote him an $18,000
check. Then activist Hosea Williams arrived, bloodied from a local
protest. Williams started preaching; more money was needed for the
movement. ``I gave him my check,'' says Gregory. ``Damn the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lil blows out the birthday candles. Lil talks to the children
about broken love affairs. Lil checks on the grandchildren.
``People ask me about being a father and not being there,'' Gregory
says. ``I say, `Jack the Ripper had a father. Hitler had a father.
Don't talk to me about family.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's father, now dead, was estranged from his mother for
years. ``I don't even know if I went to the funeral,'' he says.
``Ask Lil.''
</P>
<P>
   His children seem to have adjusted to a famous and absent
patriarch. Not a one in jail. Not a one on drugs. College degrees
everywhere. ``Children adapt quickly,'' says Michele, the oldest
daughter. ``It seemed normal that he was supposed to be out of the
house. Years later we probably would have appreciated it if he
would have been home more.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian, a chiropractor who lives in Washington, sees his
father the most. ``He's been so busy being Dick Gregory,''
Christian says, ``he has forgotten about Richard Claxton.'' It is
said with more than a little affection.
</P>
<P>
   There are still IRS debts. There was the financial calamity that
befell his Bahamian diet product. At one time, Christian had
400-pound converts to the diet program on the beach down in Nassau,
marching them as part of the regimen. ``It was like a circus. I had
a whistle,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Lil acknowledges their lifestyle is odd. Her husband can swing
through Massachusetts for an event and won't even have time to stop
home. In and out. The movement's raging. ``I know other people look
at it and say, `Boy, this is kind of strange.' But it works for
us,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rewards, she says: the children, her travels all
over the world with him. And sometimes, there's just the hell that
can be love.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be angry from the sense of abandonment,'' says
Christian, who believes his father hasn't gotten his just rewards
from the movement for sacrifices made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's forgotten and not respected, never even had a tribute
from these civil rights organizations,'' says Cathy Hughes, who
owns radio station WOL in Washington, where Gregory sometimes
offers his commentary. Hughes starts ruminating about her
friendship with Gregory, and before long she herself starts up.
``They wanted him dead,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mafia. The government. He was going after the drug
dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Gregory may finally be at the cusp of mainstream nods.
Southern Illinois University will be inducting him into its
Athletic Hall of Fame in September. Then there's a tribute to
Gregory in the nation's capital planned for Oct. 9, at the Kennedy
Center, hosted by the National Council of Negro Women.
</P>
<P>
   And so he keeps moving, steeped in the glory and pain of the
movement, right through to today's headlines. Sometimes there's so
much in his brain that he tries to get out _ so much curiosity,
governmental shenanigans, declassified FBI and CIA documents,
reopened Mississippi murder investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It's night now, and Gregory is in a cavernous room in a
Washington hotel. Willie Edward Gary, a big-time lawyer out of
Florida, is being feted. And there's Jesse himself up on stage.
Yes, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, from the movement, giving the
invocation. Gregory is in the middle of the ballroom, filled with
3,000 people, swaying on his heels. Jesse says something about
Mississippi, and that black boy found hanging from a tree there.
Investigators, including the FBI, concluded it was a suicide,
unrequited love. But Jesse is up on stage saying the investigation
must go on, that there are doubts. And Gregory beams. Gary is
calling dignitaries to the stage _ entertainers, congressmen _ and
toward the end he says, ``And my good friend, Dick Gregory.'' And
there goes Gregory, tired, striding across stage gently, like
someone who has risen from the table of the Last Supper with that
Jesus beard of his. He'll be taking off soon for Connecticut. ``The
movement don't owe me nothing. I owe everything to the movement,''
he had said in that Rock Creek morning darkness. After Hartford,
there's something on the West Coast. Lil's at home in an empty bed,
loving him as if he were there, beside her. And now Dick Gregory is
on stage, swaying sweetly, clapping his hands like he's in church.
The smile on his face is beatific.
</P>
<P>
   Damn the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Joy cometh in the morning.

WHAT`S THE HONDA S2000 LIKE? IT'S AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, what's it like?
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere I parked the Honda S2000, the high-revving, hunched,
hot sports car of the moment, somebody asked that question.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'd say, it's like driving a motorcycle _ without the bugs
in your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   This is a magical machine. Consider: When you want horsepower,
you feed those horses from two sources, RPMs and torque. Honda's
response: We don't need no stinkin' torque. Instead, they are
cranking a remarkable 240 horsepower (and even that is limited by
emissions regulations) out of only 2 liters of engine. Torque? A
paltry 153 lb.-ft.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a screaming machine that's all howling horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   So thank God for the rainbow tachometer that spreads its
crescent across the top of the gauges behind the steering wheel.
Watch it climb, lightning fast, past 5,000 RPMs to 6,000, where the
engine takes on a more powerful tone, past 7,000, where it gets
downright guttural, and up to near 9,000, where it's screaming
again.
</P>
<P>
   Want to pass on the highway? Drop from sixth to third gear and
stomp it. Whatever you may have been listening to on the radio will
be lost in the whine, but the act of passing will take but seconds.
You swear this car asks to be abused because to be driven, its
engine must be wound out.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from stop, you have to be careful to wind the engine to
a healthy scream or you run the risk of stalling. Once it gets
rolling, however, the responsiveness seems without limit.
</P>
<P>
   And all this is tucked into what I consider a classic throwback
to the earlier days of sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is up front. It's rear-wheel drive. The body is
stiff. The short rear deck covers a trunk that has barely enough
room for two small travel cases. The sloping nose looks almost '60s
English until you look at the S2000 from the front and its bulging
fenders, not apparent from the side view, give it away as a modern
muscle roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the seats are firm and legroom is ample. There's even a
dead pedal for the driver's left foot, though this car is so much
fun to drive, you find yourself using that foot for shifting up and
down just because you can.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the red Start Engine button located on the dash to the
left of the wheel, but was confused by the audio control setup. It
seemed strange that, in addition to controls on the audio system
itself _ at center dash _ Honda chose to put another set on the
dash to the left of the wheel. Either way is a reach, so what is
gained? If you're going for redundant audio controls, put them on
the steering wheel where they are more convenient and a boost to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you won't want to be distracted searching for audio
buttons when you're driving the S2000. You are fully involved if
you're driving it the way it is meant to be driven.
</P>
<P>
   Its stiff body is controlled by front and rear suspensions that
both incorporate unequal length control arms, coil springs, and
anti-roll bars. Steering is electric power assist rack-and-pinion.
Brakes are vented 11-inch discs all around.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a car that displays virtually no lateral roll, is
stiff and steady on straightaways, and is knifelike in sharp
corners. In fact, it cuts so sharp there is some sense of
understeer, though not in a disconcerting way. And with all those
RPMs and rear-wheel drive, you can induce oversteer if you want it
to play with, and sometimes, using the rear wheels to help steer
can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   And the tight, clicking six-speed shifter in the S2000 makes it
virtually impossible to not have fun driving this car. It is as
fine a shifter as I've ever used.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, however, is in learning to drive by sound. That's not
an uncommon trick. What is uncommon, is doing it to sounds you
likely have never heard coming from an automobile before (except at
certain race tracks).
</P>
<P>
   That's because the engine puts forth a furious wail and you
swear you are about to blow it up _ until you look at the arcing
rainbow and see you are only at 5,000 RPMs. It is not until you hit
Six Grand that the VTEC two-stage valve-timing system, with two
sets of exhaust and intake cams, kicks in for maximum boost and
you've reached into the heart of this remarkable four-cylinder
engine. Screaming around for more than a week, it delivered about
24 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   It's very loud. It's very quick. It's very stiff. And it's a
whole lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The soft ledges built into the front doors for elbows. If the
car isn't going to roll in the corners, you are. They give great
support in turns.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The tonneau cover for the convertible top. I never could get
the whole thing snapped down. It stayed in the trunk.

YEARNING FOR THE MOVIE CAR _ UNTIL ANOTHER COMES ALONG 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems so long ago, yet only two months have passed since I
fell in love with Eleanor in Los Angeles. I confess, there have
been others since.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor was the 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 KR that Nicholas Cage
drove in the movie ``Gone in 60 Seconds.'' She's history.
</P>
<P>
   First came the new 911 Turbo Porsche I drove in the Black Rock
Desert in Nevada. Fast and dangerous and edgy as you wanna be.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just this month, there was a brief fling with a 1962
Mercedes 300 SL roadster. This 3-liter straight-6 is the descendant
of the famous Gull Wings, which began as race cars in 1952 and went
street legal in 1954. It cranked out 215 horsepower, had a top
speed of 159 miles per hour, and, at $10,000 in 1962, was not a
cheap date.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you this because, after Eleanor appeared in a column
about famous cars from movies and television, you readers swamped
me with mail. The cars I missed. The cars you've loved.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much that you argued with my choices, among them
Steve McQueen's 1968 Mustang GT 390 from ``Bullitt,'' the 1974
Dodge Monaco 440 cop car that Aykroyd and Belushi drove in ``The
Blues Brothers,'' Paul Le Matt's 1932 Ford five-window coupe from
``American Graffiti,'' or Kowalski's 1970 Challenger R/T Hemi from
``Vanishing Point.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that you had loves of your own; love built of
adolescent fantasy or adult yearning for that certain car.
</P>
<P>
   Your list seemed weighted toward the '70s era, one reader wrote,
but I give you bonus points for the Pacer from ``Wayne's World.''
(And to you, dear reader, a rousing chorus of ``Bohemian
Rhapsody.'') So you and your roommates improved on my list, adding
the A-Team's van, the T-Bird of ``Thelma and Louise,'' but warned
me, ``don't even get me started on James Bond.'' (Hey, I prefer
cars that start when it's wet.)
</P>
<P>
   Corvette Enthusiast wrote to say he was disappointed that no
'Vettes made the list and asked, how about the Corvettes that
rotated each season during the run of ``Route 66''?
</P>
<P>
   Good point and it reminds me I should have included the
Harley-Davidson Sportster from ``Then Came Bronson.'' ``Route 66''
with a motorcycle and no designated road.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wrote to say his wife missed Suzanne Somers's
white Thunderbird from ``American Graffiti.'' If ever a car (and
its occupant) symbolized longing _ though I'm not sure if the
longing was for the car or the blonde at the wheel _ that
Thunderbird, I must agree, heads the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Mary &AMP; Crazy Larry'' another reader wrote after I
praised that film's 1969 Charger R/T 440, I thought I was the only
one who remembered that gem. Others to put on the list, he
continued: the 1954 Sunbeam-Talbot Alpine Roadster, predecessor to
the 1959-67 Tiger. Grace Kelly drove it in ``It Takes a Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on this man's list: The 1964 Aston Martin from
``Goldfinger'' (somebody got him going on James Bond), Columbo's
1960 Peugeot 403 Carbriolet, and the three Mini Cooper S's from
``The Italian Job.''
</P>
<P>
   I was faulted for missing the 440 Six-Pack Barracuda that Ken
Wall drove on the ``Wise Guy,'' and Christopher George's Shelby
Mustang from ``The Immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Sunbeam Alpine that Maxwell Smart drove on
``Get Smart,'' asked another. Now there's a guy way ahead of his
time. Top down in a roadster, distracted, talking on the
predecessor to the cell phone, Smart's famous shoe phone.
</P>
<P>
   And so we fall in love, or like, with the cars we see on screen.
Sometimes it is because we want to own the car. Sometimes it is
because the car represents something far larger: escape, freedom,
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   But love is often in the air. Thelma and Louise, fleeing bad
marriages, loved each other all the way to the edge of the Grand
Canyon. I don't know if Maxwell Smart loved Agent 99, but I do know
that Columbo loved Mrs. Columbo and Paul Le Matt loved his
five-window coupe.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite love story from a reader? Dan Levin tells this tale:
</P>
<P>
   My favorite movie car is the steel-blue Austin Healey roadster
that Ava Gardner drove at the end of ``On the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Atomic war had all but destroyed life on earth. Gardner's
husband, Gergory Peck, a submarine captain, is heading north with
his crew on a mission that spells certain doom. Gardner snakes the
Healey along a winding coastal road, top down, desperate for one
last and longing glimpse of the sub before it disappears forever.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbed Levin right by the heart strings, it is easy to see.
Healys became to Levin, he admits, the world's most beautiful cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but love can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   That love lasted, he writes, ``until that day I saw a 1963,
British racing green Jaguar XKE headed up Mt. Vernon Street with
its top down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sic transit gloria mundi, Dan writes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm no scholar of Latin, but I assume that means: Love 'em
and leave 'em.

LEARNING TO WEASEL WITH EASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I called Jeanne Martinet, author of ``Artful Dodging:
Painless Techniques for Avoiding Anyone Anytime,'' she said she
couldn't talk or she'd be late for her massage.
</P>
<P>
   This particular ploy, the massage dodge, can be found on page 66
of ``Artful Dodging'' (St. Martin's Griffin, $11.95). As Martinet
pointed out before she hung up, it's a good dodge because just
about anybody would drop whatever they're doing in favor of getting
a massage.
</P>
<P>
   Martinet promised to call back, and she did. Not calling back is
one of the Seven Dodging Sins, set forth in chapter one, The Ethics
of Evasion. Even dodgers have their standards, sort of. (There are
ways to get credit for calling back yet manage to avoid actually
speaking with the person in question. See chapter nine,
Telecommunication Tricks).
</P>
<P>
   Martinet believes that dodging is the grease that makes the
squeaky wheel of life move a bit more smoothly. Unfortunately, the
little white lie, which, she writes, ``used to be an accepted sign
of good breeding and a sensitive nature'' is now in disrepute. For
many people, the word ``dodger'' evokes the image of ``a sniveling,
sneaking snake in the grass.'' But, as Martinet writes, most of the
world's dodging is done by nice, normal people, even if they don't
like to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Martinet has written several books on social interaction,
including, ``The Art of Mingling,'' a popular handbook that has
earned its author the nickname Miss Mingle. That book gave her the
idea for ``Artful Dodging,'' because, she said, ``Most people
seemed to think the most interesting part of it was about how to
escape people.''
</P>
<P>
   She also felt that the knack of the graceful dodge was in danger
of dying out. ``People know how to say no, they just don't know how
to say no nicely,'' she said. ``They think it's almost spiritual to
be totally honest and direct, but that is so selfish. Sometimes you
have to sacrifice your own need to tell the truth to avoid hurting
someone else's feelings. Tell me a lie even if I can't believe it.
At least it means you're trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodging isn't serious lying. It's not inflating your resume or
failing to RSVP or breaking promises, all of which are dodging
no-nos's in Martinet's book. Artful dodging is done for good
reasons, among them self-defense, face-saving, protecting your
privacy, avoiding boredom, saving time, preserving what remains of
your sanity.
</P>
<P>
   The dodge can be as simple and classic as claiming to be sick,
or saying you were stuck in traffic or using your kids as an excuse
(``The baby-sitter canceled at the last minute.''). Martinet
provides an encyclopedia of excuses, ranging from semi-standards
like the doggie dodge (`I'd love to come but my dog is sick''), to
more inventive gambits like nihilism (``I'm sorry, I just don't see
the point of anything anymore''), and UFO sightings (``You may not
believe this, but I saw this huge group of people by the side of
the road looking up at the sky . . .'').
</P>
<P>
   The really ambitious may work their way up to daredevil dodging.
These are advanced techniques that require a lot of nerve and
energy, such as offensive dodging, in which you try to make
yourself so obnoxious that the other person will want to avoid you,
permanently. Martinet writes that offensive dodging isn't her
style, but that some people like it. ``It's proactive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinet's dodging days may be over since she wrote this book.
``Nobody ever believes a word I say anymore,'' she said. ``I can't
get out of anything.''

PUZO'S FORMULA HAS A FEW TWISTS, TURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
OMERTA 
By Mario Puzo. 
Random House, 316 pp., $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early reviewers have given scant respect to ``Omerta,'' the
final novel by Mario Puzo, author ofone of the great American
myths, ``The Godfather.'' That hasn't stopped Hollywood from
snapping up the film rights, nor has it kept the book off the
bestseller lists. And reviewers should have been more cautious _
``Omerta'' is full of examples of what happens to people who don't
show respect. A bought judge is sent a ribboned box suitable for
holding a pair of long silk gloves; inside is a pair of severed
arms. Retribution is swift, fatal, final, and merciless. Readers
begin ``Omerta'' at their own peril:They should not plan to
accomplish anything else until they finish it.
</P>
<P>
   Puzo died in July 1999, leaving behind the manuscript of
``Omerta,'' which he had been working on for three years. Random
House is publicizing the book as the concluding volume of a ``Mafia
Trilogy'' that began with ``The Godfather'' and continued with
``The Last Don.'' On the second page, there is a reference to the
Mafia families of the earlier two books; this book presents a
third, the family of Don Raymonde Aprile, and at a different moment
in the American history of the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   The RICO anti-crime legislation has been passed, and Don
Raymonde realizes that his time is over. He has gradually divested
himself of the overtly illegal aspects of his business and intends
to concentrate on banking. But there are interests that do not wish
him to do so, and they resort to extreme measures _ Don Raymonde is
assassinated on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral. His children
inherit his 10 private banks, but also the enmity of those who want
the banks for their own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who stands between Don Raymonde's children and
an unhappy fate is Astorre Zeno, brought up by Don Raymonde as a
brother to them. Astorre is a merchant in macaroni, with a singing
voice turned a little goofy by a neck wound imperfectly concealed
by a thick gold chain and medallion. Don Raymonde's children don't
know that their childhood playmate's father was one of the great
dons of Sicily, and that Astorre has been brought up in the old
ways, which he must now adapt to a new set of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   There are many twists and turns in the plot, which moves between
past and present, from California to New York, Washington, D.C.,
and Sicily; the bad guys include a drug lord, a rival don, corrupt
police, a pair of assassins who are identical twins, and, of
course, an FBI that is all too eager to cooperate with its target
and enemy. There are many ingeniously satisfactory executions and
murders more elaborate than a curious offstage one Puzo mentions,
in which an overambitious mobster apparently commits suicide in the
trunk of his own car. And there are some alluring and dangerous
females _ Don Raymonde's daughter is a newer stereotype, a feisty
feminist lawyer opposed to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   To say more about the plot would be unfair; the end is
predictable, and so are some of those twists and turns _ Puzo
sometimes helps himself to some of his best earlier ideas _ but
there are also some new climbs and drops on the road, and some
scary chasms off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   The story in ``Omerta'' is complete, but the book doesn't feel
finished; parts of it read like an outline Puzo intended to fill in
later. Puzo tells a perfectly serviceable story, but the book keeps
suggesting ways it could easily have been further developed. Puzo
sets situations up to give the story resonance and then doesn't
really use them _ one of Don Raymonde's sons, for example, is
stationed at West Point; another is a television executive. Both
circumstances contribute to the machinery of the plot, but the
younger Puzo would have made something of the parallels, and the
divergences, between the Mafia, the media, and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Too much of the dialogue is stiff, artificial, and preachy, and
the narrative voice isn't consistent either, but there is still
some zest in the telling; a delight in the sights, sounds, tastes,
and smells of Sicily; and a clearly communicated belief in honor.
Occasionally Puzo reminds you that he was once a novelist with
literary ambitions and accomplishments; even ``The Godfather''
wasn't primarily intended to be a commercial venture. ``Omerta''
touches on themes that are bigger than it is and that Puzo didn't
have the time or the stamina to realize.
</P>
<P>
   But even when he falls back on formula, it's a satisfying
formula. After all, he invented it.

ATLANTIC MONTHLY GETS A NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not conjure up the jaggy Gen-X sensibility of ESPN The
Magazine or Wired, but the September issue of The Atlantic Monthly
doesn't evoke images of a tradition-bound New England literary
journal either. Charles C. Mann's cover story on the war over
Internet music piracy (or more egalitarian distribution, depending
on your view) is garnished with a colorful, eye-catching
techno-graphic of ``The Heavenly Jukebox . . . From Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Michael Kelly's magazine. The political columnist and
former New Republic editor, who became The Atlantic's editor after
David Bradley bought it from Mort Zuckerman last fall, is reshaping
a magazine that in recent years was more respected than read. This
week, he's preparing to show advertisers a 32-page prototype of a
major redesign slated for January. He's hired Robert Vare, formerly
of The New Yorker, as senior editor to ride herd on the magazine's
longer pieces. And on Sept. 1, Benjamin Schwarz, former executive
editor of World Policy Journal, joins the staff to edit an expanded
``back of the book'' section on literature and arts.
</P>
<P>
   Relying liberally on his Rolodex (he is still editor-in-chief of
The National Journal), Kelly has also secured Atlantic Monthly
commitments from a number of high-profile writers, including:
Weekly Standard senior editor David Brooks; author Richard Ben
Kramer; former New Republic executive editor Margaret Talbot;
Washington Post reporter Hanna Rosin; National Journal White House
correspondent Carl Cannon; National Journal media critic William
Powers; and Alan Wolfe, director of the Center for Religion and
American Public Life at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a concern when Kelly took the helm from William
Whitworth, it was that he might re-route The Atlantic toward
politics, transforming it into a New Republic with longer word
counts. Thus, an eyebrow or two was probably raised by James
Fallows's July cover story on Al Gore's pit-bull debating
technique, highlighted by a striking illustration of Gore with an
ominously bared fang. (Before Kelly was fired at The New Republic,
his view of Gore didn't exactly jibe with that of his boss and
longtime Gore friend, Marty Peretz.)
</P>
<P>
   But thus far, Kelly's remained true to his promise to edit an
``eclectic magazine.'' The May cover story challenged the idea that
it is girls, more than boys, who are at risk in our educational
system. The June cover piece took a look at Unabomber Ted
Kaczynski's strange college daze at Harvard, and August featured a
way-off-the-beaten-path piece on the beach in India where brave men
tear apart discarded sea vessels. Coming in October _ a Wolfe cover
story about the drive for higher educational standards at
evangelical colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only true serious weakness in Bill Whitworth's Atlantic
was the covers,'' says former Atlantic editor Robert Manning. Under
Kelly, ``there's been a definite change, an improvement in the
covers,'' he says. ``From what I've seen, he's off to a very good
start.''
</P>
<P>
   The January redesign should reveal whether Kelly's got a second
act as well.
</P>

   At least one of the contenders to buy The (Quincy, Mass.)
Patriot Ledger and The (Brockton, Mass.) Enterprise is now a former
contender. Kirk Davis, president of Fidelity's Community Newspaper
Company, says it dropped out of the bidding as ``our focus has
shifted from acquisitions to product development and customer
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   With final bids reportedly in, the remaining candidates are
thought to include Boston Herald publisher Patrick Purcell, the
Journal Register Co., and, according to a report in the Herald, a
Maryland company that publishes shoppers. None of the parties would
comment on their plans, including one potential suitor whose name
recently surfaced in the rumor mill, the Dallas-based Belo company,
which owns The Providence Journal.

   The bosses at Boston magazine are apparently in no hurry to
anoint a new editor to replace Craig Unger. For one thing, the
trains are running on time these days under a makeshift management
team headed by former art director _ now newly named ``creative
director'' _ Joseph Heroun. (One former staffer who's just returned
is editor-at-large Sean Flynn.)
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the magazine's planning process has been
sharpened under this unusual in-house leadership committee,
associate publisher Dan Scully says: ``If you're keeping score,
it's unorthodox method one, traditional method nothing.''

   Former Detroit News editor and publisher Robert Giles may have
seen his successful candidacy for Harvard Nieman Foundation curator
become ensnared in controversy due to smoldering resentments over
the Detroit newspaper strike. But he's already demonstrating
impressive institutional clout in his new post.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation just announced that Ignacio Gomez, a Colombian
investigative journalist forced to flee to the United States in
fear of his life, has been added to this year's Nieman class,
thanks to Giles's former employer. Giles, a former senior vice
president of the Freedom Forum _ a foundation devoted to free press
and free speech issues _ convinced his old bosses to foot the
$35,000 bill for Gomez's stay at Harvard.

   The Newspaper Guild local at the Boston Globe is helping Globe

for using, without attribution, other accounts for a column on the
fates of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Both union
president Robert Jordan and Globe spokesman Richard Gulla confirm
the filing of Jacoby's grievance, which is expected to generate
meetings soon between union and newspaper officials.

   Tonight at 8, Showtime debuts ``Bash,'' a nearly two-hour filmed
version of Neil LaBute's controversial 1999 stage trilogy, ``Bash:
Latterday Plays.'' Calista Flockhart (``Ally McBeal''), Paul Rudd
(``Reaching Normal'') and Ron Eldard (``ER'') star, but if you're
looking for light-hearted entertainment, you better skip this.
</P>
<P>
   LaBute is the writer of, among others, the caustic film ``In the
Company of Men,'' and his rather bleak view of humankind offers us
grim confessions of the suffocation of a baby, an affair between a
student and a teacher, and a fatal gay-bashing _ the latter by a
Mormon, no less. Like early Elvis Costello songs, LaBute focuses on
revenge and guilt, especially the latter, and his work can be an
acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its grimness, this was also an acclaimed production,
compellingly acted. It's another bit of edgework for Showtime,
which is trying to get a bigger piece of HBO's turf as a cable
network that dares.

LOYALIST VS. LOYALIST: THE DEPTHS OF AN ULSTER STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With the arrest of a Protestant paramilitary leader,
Johnny Adair, police in Northern Ireland hoped they had defused a
feud among rival pro-British loyalist groups that had left bodies
in the street over the past week and that had exposed a worrisome
consequence of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   While it was convenient to blame Adair, whose nickname is ``Mad
Dog'' and who has a reputation for popping steroids, for the surge
in violence in Belfast, the outbreak of shootings and street
fighting has its roots in a feud among Protestant guerrillas that
goes back 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is a turf war between the two main armed
loyalist groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defense
Association, over the spoils of criminal rackets in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But at a more fundamental level, the feud is an inevitable
result of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalists, like Irish republicans, are sharply divided on what
the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 will bring. Most in the Ulster
Volunteer Force say the historic compromise means an eventual union
of Northern Ireland with Britain. Most in the Ulster Defense
Association assert that it has made a united Ireland inevitable _ a
prospect they dread.
</P>
<P>
   Irish republicans, especially the Irish Republican Army, are
similarly divided. While the bulk of republicans say politics is
the only way forward, a fundamentalist core still clings to the
dream of ending British rule in Northern Ireland by force. The
fundamentalists have been planting bombs in London and across
Northern Ireland trying to wreck the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Although loyalists have been killing one another for years over
petty rivalries and drug deals gone bad, it was not until they
torched Gusty Spence's house the other day that it became clear
just how bitter the internecine rivalry has become.
</P>
<P>
   Augustus ``Gusty'' Spence is the founder of the loyalist
paramilitaries. It was he who told a ragtag bunch of angry
working-class Protestants 35 years ago that they were the
successors to the original Ulster Volunteer Force, which took up
arms 80 years ago to resist the British government's inclination to
solve the Irish question by granting the island independence.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's recruits singled out and killed ordinary Roman
Catholics in Belfast to instill fear, and to quash talk of a united
Ireland. It was Spence who shot and killed John Patrick Scullion, a
28-year-old Catholic from West Belfast. Scullion's murder in 1966
is regarded as the first in what came to be known as the Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following three years, loyalists picked off other
Catholics here and there, their fury stoked by a civil rights
movement demanding equal rights for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   It was their campaign of terror that brought British troops onto
the streets of Northern Ireland in August 1969. The loyalist
campaign also revived the IRA, which had laid down its guns a
decade before, saying its goal of driving the British from Northern
Ireland and uniting with the Republic of Ireland was hopeless. In
1969, the IRA was reborn as the protectors of Catholic
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic, then, that it was the spiraling loyalist-on-loyalist
violence that brought British troops back onto the streets of
Belfast this week for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace process launched by the Good Friday accord,
nearly all paramilitary prisoners have been released over the past
two years. The loyalist prisoners returned to a community at war
with itself. Those who support the peace process and those who
don't are killing each other over their differences, as well as
over petty jealousies, rivalries, and who gets to shake down the
fish-and-chip shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committing hara-kiri,'' said David Ervine, who became
politicized in prison under Spence's tutelage and emerged
determined to find a political solution to the conflict he once
thought could only be solved by force.
</P>
<P>
   Ervine's colleague, Billy Hutchinson, has survived repeated
assassination attempts, the most recent a few days ago when shots
were fired at his house. On Monday night, after two loyalists were
shot to death in their car in West Belfast, Hutchinson acknowledged
that the feud has been simmering for years, but made it clear that
he blamed Adair for the recent surge.
</P>
<P>
   Adair, a shaven-headed man who revels in the ``Mad Dog'' moniker
bestowed upon him by the tabloids, is the Belfast commander of the
Ulster Defense Association. His group, while larger in numbers, has
never matched the Ulster Volunteer Force in discipline and
ideology, which fed an inferiority complex that has manifested
itself in murderous ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Adair took a previously undisciplined group
of gangsters and transformed them into one of the most ruthless
death squads ever seen in Northern Ireland. It was Adair's ability
to kill scores of Catholics, including many members of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, that many believe influenced the Irish
republican leadership to wind down the war and seek a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The police put Adair in prison on what even republicans consider
trumped-up charges, and there he soon established himself as one of
the leading loyalist proponents of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   But many now believe that was only a cynical tactic aimed at
securing his release from prison. Once on the street, police say,
Adair plunged back into the underworld of loyalist racketeering,
where the line is blurry between protecting and exploiting one's
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one man is the cause of all this trouble,'' said
Hutchinson, whose embrace of the peace process is often misread as
pacifism. ``You know the IRA is sitting back, laughing, watching
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is. On Monday night, a leading IRA man in Belfast
chuckled as he watched television coverage of the feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loyalists have turned on themselves because they don't
know how to manage the peace process,'' he said. ``The bulk of
loyalism is scared, and in that vacuum a gangster like Adair will
prosper. Loyalists are scared because they know the game is up.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the situation is that Johnny Adair and his ilk find
themselves agreeing with the IRA that the process will lead to a
united Ireland. Hutchinson and the bulk of the Ulster Volunteer
Force believe the opposite: that the the Good Friday Agreement will
make Northern Ireland a more attractive place to live, so that even
the bulk of Catholics will want it to remain part of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Adair off the street might help in the short term, as it
did a half-dozen years ago when the police arrested him, briefly
ending a series of sectarian murders. But another charismatic
loyalist, Billy Wright, stepped into the void and led a dissident
group of loyalists away from the negotiating table, murdering
Catholics in an attempt to goad the IRA back to war even after
Wright was murdered by republican dissidents in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Peace process or not, on the streets where Billy Hutchinson grew
up, scores are settled in the neighborhood, not in the courts to
which loyalists profess loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has changed dramatically these last 10 years,
but old habits die hard _ as will more loyalists, on the mean
streets of Belfast and beyond.

   High-fives all around for the Fox Family Channel. The late,
lamented NBC series ``Freaks and Geeks,'' which lasted only one
season, pops up just a few months later on the cable channel, which
tonight at 8 debuts a weekly double-episode run.
</P>
<P>
   The show, created by Paul Feig, offers a terrifically real look
at high school life on the outside of social cliques, circa 1980.
The right music, clothes and attitudes ground the stories of sister
and brother Lindsay and Sam Weir, sensitively played by Linda
Cardellini and John Daley, two Michigan teens just trying to
survive high school. Lindsay is a brain who's started hanging out
with the freaks; Sam is just a geek, but a smart one. From this you
get an idea of what Feig's Michigan teen life was like; the series
draws very much on his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   If you liked ``The Wonder Years,'' in particular, but also
``That '70s Show'' or the movie ``Dazed and Confused,'' give this a
chance. Included in the run will be three episodes NBC never aired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: On and on and on and on ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' ABC at 8: Regis Philbin
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show,'' Fox at 8: Really, you should be watching
``Freaks and Geeks'' (see above). You've already seen the one where
Eric and Donna get caught in an intimate encounter in the Vista
Cruiser, right? Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ABC at 9: Greg's attempt to find himself
leads to a hot-sheet motel. Hmmm. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Source Hip-Hop Music Awards,'' UPN at 8: We're told the
show will go on, despite the massive brawl that ended last week's
taping with pepper spray and hospitalizations after only a few
awards had been handed out. Li'l Kim did perform, but still, if
this lasts two hours, it may be a shoo-in for next year's Emmy for
editing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Shoot Me,'' NBC at 9:30: Victoria Principal guests as an
ex-wife of George Segal's Jack. These two old pros are fun to watch
together. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Open Tennis update, CBS at 12:35 a.m. From Flushing, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip,'' pay-per-view, various times: Frankie Muniz of
``Malcolm in the Middle'' stars in this PG-rated,
heartstring-tugging story of a boy and his Jack Russell terrier,
based on the Willie Morris book. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane also
star.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Daria: Is It Fall Yet?'' MTV at 7:30: Excellent animated
series gets a 90-minute showcase for its mordant take on adolescent
life. Included is Daria's stint as a counselor at the ``It's OK to
Cry'' self-esteem summer camp, and that alone should make it worth
watching. But there's also a new twist. Daria is dating, and
actually has to cope with happiness. It's one thing she may not be
able to deal with in her usual sarcastic fashion. Good for teens
and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Real World,'' MTV at 10: For once, the title is actually
deserved, as the roommates get a trip to South Africa bringing them
face to face with some realities of the apartheid era. Oh, and they
rappel down a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beggars and Choosers,'' Showtime at 10: More satirical
intrigue behind the scenes of a fictional TV network. Tonight, a
hit show jumps ship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATE NIGHT TALK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' CBS at 11:35: Ricki Lake.

ANGUISH OVER THE KURSK IS WIDELY SHARED

 By FLORA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Flora Lewis  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   PARIS _ It is important for Russians to know, in their anguish
and anger, how much most everybody else sympathized over the
tragedy of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warship, built to attack, but among the once and
perhaps still supposed foe, there was no gloating or sense of
superiority, which Moscow's military establishment seemed to fear.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, what disdain was felt in the west was for the
demonstration of the automatic way the old Soviet habits of lying
and secrecy still seem to dominate in a moment of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident that people in Russia feel the same way. Their
government has lost a great deal more by delayed reaction and
awkward cover-up than by the accident itself, still unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   What impact that may have on future Moscow behavior is hard to
foresee. It matters that at least on this painful occasion, there
is a common concern among Russians and westerners alike for the
right to know.
</P>
<P>
   We will probably never find out for sure whether a quicker
response, a willingness to accept foreign help from the start
instead of a proud rejection would actually have saved some lives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither fear of loss of face nor fear of loss of some kind of
military secret could have justified the refusal to rush all the
useful expertise available so long as there was any chance of
finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shared agony of hoping and waiting for rescue and
need to be kept informed that showed how much people on two sides
of the shredded Iron Curtain now recognize they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days before the Kursk went down, the Concorde crashed
in flames outside Paris. Both represented modern marvels of
technology, tangible assertions of prestige that are not
particularly practical and prove, after all, not to be invulnerable
either.
</P>
<P>
   But an airplane accident, awful as it may be, happens in a flash
and there is time only to grieve afterwards. The submarine sat
there in the freezing sea, men pounding on the hull begging to be
saved and gradually gasping away life. There was time to feel the
terror.
</P>
<P>
   And it should leave a heightened awareness of what it means to
agree that the Cold War is over, that there is no longer any point
in maintaining the posture that what is bad for one side is good
for the other.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides need honesty from their leaders. It is
almost as much in the interest of the west as for the Russians that
a police state mentality doesn't manage to restore repression.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the need of making clear the human warmth of condolence
and the political requirement of valid information, there is the
problem of the result of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   It is normal and understandable that the relatives of those who
died would like the bodies recovered, though burial at sea is an
honorable old tradition. But whether that effort is made or not, it
is necessary to make sure the nuclear reactors are permanently
sanitized.
</P>
<P>
   At the relatively shallow depth of the submarine wreckage, there
is a risk of rusting containers releasing radioactivity. That is
already a serious danger in the area of the Kola peninsula, which
the Russians have long been using as a dumpling ground for old
nuclear engines to the grave distress of their Norwegians
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It is time that more serious attention be paid to Norwegian
warnings. They do know what they are talking about because they
have been watching this as closely as still intense Russian secrecy
makes possible, and they have a great deal of underwater expertise,
as their divers demonstrated in opening the Kursk hatch, because of
maintaining North Sea oil rigs.
</P>
<P>
   The cost, the difficulty and the long dangerous delays in
dismantling the various components of nuclear warfare are not yet
widely understood. This is the aftermath of the nuclear arms race
and it is monstrous.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be kept in mind in considering the possibility of a
national missile defense as proposed in the U.S. provoking a new
arms race, partly with China, partly with Russian modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Disarming is not a simple matter of throwing away weapons. It is
an extremely intricate and expensive task, for which the U.S. is
wisely helping Russia a bit in financing, but there is a lot more
to do. It is urgent and can buy a lot more security per dollar
spent than some of the extravagant Pentagon ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With the new millennium, there has been a tendency to lose
memory of the lessons imposed by the Cold War and what a burden it
was. The disaster of the Kursk is a reminder that the opportunity
to work together for a peaceful world must be seized and that it is
normal for human emotions to be shared. &QL;

   LARS VON TRIER: PRINCE OF DARKNESS. From W magazine. One color
slide. By all accounts, the making of Lars Von Trier's latest
picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical melodrama ``Dancer in the
Dark,'' was an excruciating experience. The story centers on Selma
(played by pop singer Bjork), a Czech immigrant living in the
Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s who is losing her sight due to
a hereditary disease. She works in a factory, saving up for an
operation that will protect her son from the same fate. But after a
friend betrays her and steals the money, the world caves in on her:
Selma winds up charged with murder. However, the real melodrama
took place off-camera between Von Trier and Bjork, who nearly quit
the film. (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape
the experience.) An interview with the controversial filmmaker.

   LARS VON TRIER: PRINCE OF DARKNESS. From W magazine. One color
slide. By all accounts, the making of Lars Von Trier's latest
picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical melodrama ``Dancer in the
Dark,'' was an excruciating experience. The story centers on Selma
(played by pop singer Bjork), a Czech immigrant living in the
Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s who is losing her sight due to
a hereditary disease. She works in a factory, saving up for an
operation that will protect her son from the same fate. But after a
friend betrays her and steals the money, the world caves in on her:
Selma winds up charged with murder. However, the real melodrama
took place off-camera between Von Trier and Bjork, who nearly quit
the film. (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape
the experience.) An interview with the controversial filmmaker.

 By AARON GELL 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    He may be the enfant terrible of the international film circuit,
notorious for his unguarded remarks, his crusade to put
overindulgent filmmakers on a creative austerity program, his
crippling phobias and, most of all, for his films themselves _
brutal, beautiful, shattering tragedies that tend to leave
audiences either sobbing or cursing his name.
 &HT;    But today, sitting in an office at Zentropa, his sprawling
film-production facility housed in a former army base on the
outskirts of Copenhagen, Lars Von Trier is in good spirits.
 &HT;    The primary reason is out in the parking lot: a spiffy,
cherry-red Alfa Romeo Spider convertible.
 &HT;    ``Ah, doesn't it look new!'' Von Trier remarks. Moments later,
we're flying down a nearby expressway.
 &HT;    ``I won't go very fast,'' promises the director as he nudges the
car into fifth and fumbles with the stereo, adding, ``It's just ...
the acceleration is so very nice.''
 &HT;    Overhead, the sun suddenly pushes its way through a thick carpet
of Scandinavian clouds, and the Beach Boys' ``I Get Around'' drowns
out the hum of the engine. Von Trier is beaming.
 &HT;    Given his well-known political leanings (he used to belong to
the Danish Communist party), to say nothing of his long history of
severe panic attacks, the Alfa Romeo is a bit out of character.
It's actually on loan as some sort of promotional gesture by the
automaker, which is apparently harboring a true subversive in its
marketing department.
 &HT;    ``My first wife would never have allowed this car,'' Von Trier
says. ``But my new wife is very nice. She thinks having a sports
car is a basic human right.''
 &HT;    So does Von Trier, who cheerfully tosses the keys to anyone who
asks to take it for a spin.
 &HT;    Besides, the director has earned a little fun. By all accounts,
the making of his latest picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical
melodrama ``Dancer in the Dark,'' was an excruciating experience.
 &HT;    Like 1996's ``Breaking the Waves,'' ``Dancer'' centers on a
dreamily naive, willfully self-sacrificing young woman. Selma, a
Czech immigrant living in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s,
is losing her sight due to a hereditary disease. She works in a
factory, saving up for an operation that will protect her son from
the same fate. But after a friend betrays her and steals the money,
the world caves in on her: Selma winds up charged with murder.
Meanwhile, she daydreams of movie musicals.
 &HT;    It's operatic stuff by any standard, but as most everyone knows
by now, the real melodrama took place off-camera between Von Trier
and his lead actress, the Icelandic pop star Bjork, who very nearly
quit the film.
 &HT;    (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape the
experience and tore at her costume in a frenzy.)
 &HT;    ``We had some difficulties collaborating,'' Von Trier says
slowly. Asked what the trouble was about, he says, ``It was just
that for her it was extremely tough to do it. She felt trapped and
claustrophobic and betrayed and whatever.'' He adds that since
Bjork, who composed the film's music, is accustomed to having total
creative freedom, serving his vision proved difficult.
 &HT;    ``Usually, she's in charge,'' he says. ``But if she's in my
story, I have to stop her all the time. That's direction, that's
where the word comes from, right? I'm pointing the direction, and
this is not very pleasant if you go right and I want to point
left.''
 &HT;    Although it was her first role, Von Trier says, Bjork
immediately took to his improvisational approach.
 &HT;    ``She was so extremely good at it,'' he says. ``I felt like a
lion tamer, and she was my best lion. She could do all kinds of
tricks if she wanted, but otherwise, rraaarrgh!''
 &HT;    It seems that Bjork, who declined to comment for this article,
came to associate Von Trier with a different sort of creature.
After the film wrapped, she gave cast and crew members little
animal figurines as gifts. The director got a rat.
 &HT;    Von Trier sighs. ``I'm sure I've been an asshole,'' he says,
``but I've also been extremely pressed, right? This was a very big
production for us. At a certain point, if she had walked out, we
would have been extremely bankrupt. And my four children would have
had to sleep outdoors. This is something that is not really
artistic to talk about, but it's a fact of life.''
 &HT;    The resulting film, which caused a sensation at Cannes and
earned the elfin singer the Best Actress award, is like nothing
ever seen before, a gorgeous musical fantasy crossed with an almost
medieval tale of exquisite suffering. Von Trier says that as with
``Breaking the Waves,'' his aim was to bring a sense of
authenticity to the unfashionable genre of melodrama.
 &HT;    ``My mother and father were Communists and cultural radicals,''
he explains, ``so they thought a story like this was the worst _
opium for the people. Since this was so forbidden when I was young
and people became so angry, I thought there had to be some good
qualities there.''
 &HT;    People still get angry around Von Trier. Detractors accuse him
of cheap sentimentality, even misogyny for the tortures he inflicts
on his female protagonists. He doesn't seem to mind a bit.
 &HT;    Since he regards it as the artist's role in society to, as he
says, ``take you by the hand and lead you somewhere you didn't want
to go on your own,'' a bit of resistance seems only natural.
 &HT;    ``I have tried to see how far I could go with this,'' he says
when asked about the misfortunes that inevitably befall his
heroines. ``It's a matter of taste if you think it works, but I
haven't yet reached the limit. I still don't know how bad it can
get.''
 &HT;    Let's just say that for Selma, it gets uncommonly bad.
 &HT;    ``When you want to work with melodrama, then you have to find
some tools,'' Von Trier says with a shrug. ``The first tool was the
mother and child. And then a handicap is good, very good.''
 &HT;    The director's devotion to easy sentimentality coincided, oddly
enough, with his holy war on behalf of cinematic truth. Among other
things, signatories to the highly publicized Dogma 95 ``Vow of
Chastity,'' which Von Trier composed with his friend Thomas
Vinterberg, agree to work on location with hand-held cameras and to
shun special lighting and effects.
 &HT;    While ``Dancer'' is not officially a Dogma film, it aims for
that same honesty. The film was shot mostly on hand-held video, and
the musical sequences were performed in full takes, captured by 100
stationary cameras.
 &HT;    While many observers viewed the Dogma manifesto as an
attention-getting prank _ particularly its repudiation of the
auteur theory as ``bourgeois romanticism from the very start and
thereby ... false!'' _ the fact is that Von Trier, a child of
permissive hippie-intellectual parents _ simply wanted a few rules.
Dogma may have 10 points, but for him, it's a 12-step program.
 &HT;    It seems to be working, too. His later work seems almost to have
been made by a different person than the tormented genius behind
the meticulously controlled ``Element of Crime,'' ``Epidemic'' and
``Zentropa.''
 &HT;    ``They were technically brilliant, but there was a coldness,''
says Stellan Skaarsgard, who appeared in ``Breaking the Waves'' and
``The Kingdom II'' as well as ``Dancer.'' ``There was no real life
in them. But then he totally changed his way of working. He's a
control freak, like all directors, but now he knows he can control
even chaos.''
 &HT;    Von Trier says he hasn't seen his early films in years. ``I'm
embarrassed about them, really embarrassed,'' he offers. ``The guy
who made them was just so young, so irritating. Now I feel more
mature.''
 &HT;    ``You know,'' he adds, ``even now when I see drawings I did when
I was 3 or 4, I think, `Oh, I should never have given that to my
mother, because this little flower down here is completely wrong
...''
 &HT;    The need for control has been a constant motif in his life _
``that ghost again,'' he calls it _ and it is at the root of the
director's psychological ailments: compulsive perfectionism, bouts
of agoraphobia and hypochondria and a terror of hospitals and
airplanes. (As a result of the latter, he'll be a no-show at the
New York Film Festival in September, although ``Dancer'' is being
honored with the opening-night slot.)
 &HT;    It is perhaps in light of these disorders that ``The Idiots,''
his controversial and critically misunderstood 1998 film about a
cultlike group of young Danes who pretend to be retarded, is best
viewed.
 &HT;    For Von Trier, mimicking the mentally handicapped is not about
ridicule but envy; it's a fantasy of liberation from his own
tyrannical superego.
 &HT;    ``I've been a nervous wreck all my life,'' he acknowledges. ``At
a certain point, I couldn't even leave my room.''
 &HT;    He had years of therapy, but he credits Prozac with taking the
edge off his neuroses. He also practices a form of meditation,
leading himself on what he calls ``shamanic journeys'' into a sort
of Jungian spirit world.
 &HT;    ``It's really fantastic,'' he says. ``You have this drum sound
on the stereo, and you imagine that you go into this animal world.
You discover a lot.''
 &HT;    On these travels, he takes on the guise of an animal. ``I'm an
otter,'' he says.
 &HT;    Sort of like an auteur?
 &HT;    ``Oh!'' he punches the steering wheel. ``An auteur otter! Great.
Thank you. I never thought of that, but now I can never face my
otter again.''
 &HT;    Thank goodness for Bjork's rat.

 From WWD, DNR and W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HARD CELL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ When the fantasy thriller ``The Cell'' opened in
theaters recently, audiences will got another fashion statement out
of Jennifer Lopez.
 &HT;    This time, though, the actress traded in her Versaces for a
touch of ``Mad Max'' _ with the help of costume designer Eiko
Ishioka. Combining the outrageousness of the Paris couture with a
bit of quirky sci-fi futurism, Ishioka has turned ``The Cell'' into
a visual feast, with Lopez the inevitable muse.
 &HT;    ``I want to challenge the design vocabulary and weave it into
other aspects of film _ acting, lighting and directing,'' the
Japanese-born Ishioka says. ``Ninety percent of movie costumes are
based on reality or history. These were based on my imagination.''
 &HT;    On top of ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who won an Oscar for her work
on ``Bram Stoker's Dracula,'' is coming out with a new book in
October. ``Eiko on Stage'' contains sketches and photographs of her
work for film, opera and the theater over the last 15 years.
Francis Ford Coppola, one of many admirers in Hollywood, wrote the
introduction.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky to work with people who gave me creative
freedom,'' she says. ``Coppola is one of the few directors who
really adores design and its power. He is an ideal director for a
designer.''
 &HT;    Ishioka has equal praise for Tarsem Singh, who directed ``The
Cell,'' and the feeling is clearly mutual.
 &HT;    Upon meeting Ishioka for the first time, Singh, who had read her
first book, ``Eiko by Eiko,'' when he was still in art school, told
her, ``That was our bible and you were our goddess.'' So when ``The
Cell'' came around, he was prepared to give Ishioka complete
freedom to create a group of outlandish costumes for the film's
dream sequences.
 &HT;    ``In the movie's opening scene, I thought Jennifer should look
like a fairy tale,'' says Ishioka, who draped the star in a white
feather-trimmed gown. ``I liked the image of a bird in the middle
of a dry, golden desert. For her cape, I asked the research team
for feathers from all the white birds there were.''
 &HT;    ``Jennifer was very involved with her image in the film,''
Ishioka adds. In one scene, Lopez insisted that a Grecian peplum
dress be made with an open front. But occasionally the actress had
to sacrifice the comfort of standard-issue sex appeal.
 &HT;    ``When she becomes trapped by a serial killer,'' Ishioka
explains, ``she enters a world of torture and abuse _ she
essentially becomes a sex toy, so she had to look erotic and
uncomfortable at the same time. I gave her a sheer dress and a big
black-and-red wig and a bizarre hard collar made of plastic.
Jennifer asked me if I could make it more comfortable, but I said
`No, you're supposed to be tortured.'''
 &HT;    In another pivotal scene, Lopez wears a suit of molded leather
armor that Ishioka first sculpted in clay, then cast. ``Tarsem
didn't want to use typical metal. He wanted me to design something
erotic and special.''
 &HT;    Before working on ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who moved to New York
in the mid-'80s, spent two years in Amsterdam designing costumes
for Wagner's Ring Cycle for the National Opera.
 &HT;    ``When Tarsem called me in Amsterdam, he said `The Cell'
costumes should be very operatic. I sent him a 60-page fax of
initial sketches.
 &HT;    ``Film costumes should be perfect from every angle,'' Ishioka
continues, ``because the camera shoots 360 degrees. In opera, the
audience watches from a distance so there doesn't need to be as
much detail _ but my Japanese heritage forces me to do it. If a
singer or actor is wearing a perfect costume, her spirit is rich
and beautiful. If not, she has no confidence.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SUITE DREAMS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If you book yourself into Paris' latest hot hotel _ the newly
restored Meurice _ remember two secret numbers: 524 and 528. These
junior suites, nestled under the hotel's mansard roof, feature
dizzying views of Place Vendome and Montmartre and great bathrooms
with original stained-glass windows.
 &HT;    The oak-paneled dressing rooms are gigantic (there's space for
plenty of Vuitton trunks and Colette shopping bags) and feature
flattering golden lighting.
 &HT;    But if you're feeling as flush as the hotel's owner, the Sultan
of Brunei, reserve La Belle Etoile, the most expensive hotel suite
in all of Paris. The 3,000-square-foot complex includes a Belle
Epoque rooftop pavilion with a huge wraparound terrace. The views
alone may be worth the price of admission _ $8,400 a night.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MONUMENTAL HEADACHE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani can't stand clutter _ whether it's on the runway
or in the piazza. The designer is lobbying to have a monument to
former Italian president and prime minister Sandro Pertini removed
from its home in the piazza next door to Milan's Grand Hotel,
because he thinks it's an eyesore.
 &HT;    Armani, who happens to be opening his Emporio Armani mega-store
in that same piazza in October, even has offered to foot the bill
for the transfer.
 &HT;    City officials are divided as to what to do; designer Gianfranco
Ferre is furious: ``Whether Giorgio likes it or not, that monument
is part of the city's cultural face,'' Ferre says. ``He only
noticed it now, because of the opening of the store.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BABY TALK
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Supermodel Stella Tennant has been in the family way _ in more
ways than one. The supermodel, who just gave birth to a daughter,
is designing a baby line for Burberry called Tennant &AMP; Son,
handmade in her Scottish hometown by her own friends.
 &HT;    The collection will hit Burberry's 57th Street store in New York
in September.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BATTLE ROYAL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the old days, British monarchs used to behead errant nobles;
today, Queen Elizabeth just sues them.
 &HT;    The queen has filed suit against the Duke of Westminster,
Britain's wealthiest man, over a mineral-rich quarry in Wales.
 &HT;    The duke is keen to mine the quarry, but the Crown Estate
Commission is seeking a court writ to keep his minions from
trespassing on the land, which it contends belongs to the queen.
 &HT;    Let's hope the spat doesn't upset the delicate balance of royal
social life _ in the past, the duke has been a regular dinner guest
at Buckingham Palace.

 &HT;    After a decade of sleek, silvery minimalism, juniors are looking
with fondness at late '70s-early '80s wear, with a special fondness
for anything ultra-sexy or anything ``Charlie's Angels.''
 &HT;    Color is still big news, but preferred hues are going more
earthy, deepening away from sunny turquoise and fuchsia into burnt
orange, rust, olives, wines and cognacs. And purple: Junior
manufacturers said they're planning a royal push of the color.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Internet may be a great equalizer, but new research shows
that the rich are different from you and me when it comes to the
online world.
 &HT;    A new study by Forrester Research Inc. indicates millionaires
research and buy everything from clothing and jewelry to airline
tickets and groceries online.
 &HT;    For the report, ``The Millionaire Online,'' Forrester surveyed
more than 2,000 affluent households (those with investable assets
of $1 million or more, not including the value of their primary
home).
 &HT;    ``Retailers and manufacturers that target the affluent often
adopt a defensive tone about the Internet,'' said Ekaterina O.
Walsh, an analyst at Forrester. ``But our research uncovered four
oft-cited misconceptions about affluent consumers: That they don't
like technology, don't go online, don't shop online and don't use
the Internet to manage their finances.''
 &HT;    To begin, Walsh reports 56 percent of affluent households are
online vs. 43 percent of the general population.
 &HT;    The report states the affluent actually like technology more
than other consumers. Almost two-thirds of the affluent score as
optimists, according to a technology-optimism scale, vs. slightly
more than half of the non-affluent.
 &HT;    From fax machines to writable CD drives, the affluent own more
technology products than other consumers. Not only do two-thirds of
the affluent have a home PC, but the average affluent household
owns two.
 &HT;    Moreover, the survey also found that the millionaires' primary
reason for using a PC is to go online. Half of them have been going
online for at least three years, while only one-third of
non-affluent wired consumers have that much experience.
 &HT;    The study refutes the idea that millionaires don't shop online.
Millionaires are 16 percent more likely than other Internet users
to regularly research products online.
 &HT;    They are also more likely to follow through on their search.
Across a wide range of categories, the affluent score high on a
``buy to look'' ratio that measures research to purchase
follow-through. Overall, the affluent buy-to-look ratio is 21
percent higher than other Internet users, Walsh noted.
 &HT;    The study found 21 percent of affluent respondents purchased
clothing, compared with 15 percent of non-affluent buyers.
 &HT;    Millionaires are also more likely to buy in every product
category online, except for entertainment items such as music,
videos and games. They also power through the online
retail-adoption cycle faster, graduating from buying convenience
goods to research items and replenishment products earlier than
other consumers.
 &HT;    The report declares: ``Armed with deeper pockets and an affinity
for e-commerce, millionaires spend more on almost every type of
product online. They spent almost $150 more online during the 1999
winter holiday season than other buyers. This year, affluent
Internet buyers expect to spend $100 per month online, which is
double the spending planned by other Internet buyers.''
 &HT;    The affluent may spend more, but they don't overlook value. Like
other consumers, most affluent online shoppers (58 percent) are
value-focused buyers who seek good prices without sacrificing
quality.
 &HT;    The remaining 42 percent are convenience-focused buyers who
would pay extra to get their shopping done quickly and have it be
hassle-free. But even these convenience-focused buyers don't ignore
value.
 &HT;    Nine out of 10 respondents pay attention to shipping fees, and
43 percent are likely to visit price comparison sites such as
MySimon or CompareNet.
 &HT;    Compared with the non-affluent, millionaires are more
brand-conscious, states the report.
 &HT;    ``The wired affluent would prefer to buy a Baume &AMP; Mercier watch
if they could find it online,'' Walsh observes.
 &HT;    She notes that almost half say they seek specific brand names
for everything they buy versus less than a third of the
non-affluent.
 &HT;    Millionaires are a much sought-after market for a whole host of
companies, from luxury retailers and private banks to charities. To
effectively target them, the study says marketers must: &HT;    Master the online channel. Almost 60 percent of young consumers
are online, so the Internet must be at the core of any strategy to
target them. With Internet penetration among the affluent almost as
high, winning their allegiance requires synchronized offline and
online channels.
 &HT;    Avoid ``affluent portals.'' Although many will try, portals
aimed at millionaires will fail. Having investable assets beyond
seven figures is not enough of a common bond to drive site traffic.
Instead, seek the affluent at the myriad sites where they'll go in
pursuit for their other interests.
 &HT;    Use the affluent to test and launch new products. An affinity
for novelty, opinion leadership, brand-consciousness, and
value-focus make the affluent ideal candidates for examining and
fueling market trends.
 &HT;    Target emerging affluent consumers. These younger, high-income
non-affluent consumers share many key characteristics with the
affluent: a dominant career motivation, a passion for technology
and a high tolerance for investment risk. c.2000 Fairchild

 &HT;    HARD CELL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ When the fantasy thriller ``The Cell'' opened in
theaters recently, audiences will got another fashion statement out
of Jennifer Lopez.
 &HT;    This time, though, the actress traded in her Versaces for a
touch of ``Mad Max'' _ with the help of costume designer Eiko
Ishioka. Combining the outrageousness of the Paris couture with a
bit of quirky sci-fi futurism, Ishioka has turned ``The Cell'' into
a visual feast, with Lopez the inevitable muse.
 &HT;    ``I want to challenge the design vocabulary and weave it into
other aspects of film _ acting, lighting and directing,'' the
Japanese-born Ishioka says. ``Ninety percent of movie costumes are
based on reality or history. These were based on my imagination.''
 &HT;    On top of ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who won an Oscar for her work
on ``Bram Stoker's Dracula,'' is coming out with a new book in
October. ``Eiko on Stage'' contains sketches and photographs of her
work for film, opera and the theater over the last 15 years.
Francis Ford Coppola, one of many admirers in Hollywood, wrote the
introduction.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky to work with people who gave me creative
freedom,'' she says. ``Coppola is one of the few directors who
really adores design and its power. He is an ideal director for a
designer.''
 &HT;    Ishioka has equal praise for Tarsem Singh, who directed ``The
Cell,'' and the feeling is clearly mutual.
 &HT;    Upon meeting Ishioka for the first time, Singh, who had read her
first book, ``Eiko by Eiko,'' when he was still in art school, told
her, ``That was our bible and you were our goddess.'' So when ``The
Cell'' came around, he was prepared to give Ishioka complete
freedom to create a group of outlandish costumes for the film's
dream sequences.
 &HT;    ``In the movie's opening scene, I thought Jennifer should look
like a fairy tale,'' says Ishioka, who draped the star in a white
feather-trimmed gown. ``I liked the image of a bird in the middle
of a dry, golden desert. For her cape, I asked the research team
for feathers from all the white birds there were.''
 &HT;    ``Jennifer was very involved with her image in the film,''
Ishioka adds. In one scene, Lopez insisted that a Grecian peplum
dress be made with an open front. But occasionally the actress had
to sacrifice the comfort of standard-issue sex appeal.
 &HT;    ``When she becomes trapped by a serial killer,'' Ishioka
explains, ``she enters a world of torture and abuse _ she
essentially becomes a sex toy, so she had to look erotic and
uncomfortable at the same time. I gave her a sheer dress and a big
black-and-red wig and a bizarre hard collar made of plastic.
Jennifer asked me if I could make it more comfortable, but I said
`No, you're supposed to be tortured.'''
 &HT;    In another pivotal scene, Lopez wears a suit of molded leather
armor that Ishioka first sculpted in clay, then cast. ``Tarsem
didn't want to use typical metal. He wanted me to design something
erotic and special.''
 &HT;    Before working on ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who moved to New York
in the mid-'80s, spent two years in Amsterdam designing costumes
for Wagner's Ring Cycle for the National Opera.
 &HT;    ``When Tarsem called me in Amsterdam, he said `The Cell'
costumes should be very operatic. I sent him a 60-page fax of
initial sketches.
 &HT;    ``Film costumes should be perfect from every angle,'' Ishioka
continues, ``because the camera shoots 360 degrees. In opera, the
audience watches from a distance so there doesn't need to be as
much detail _ but my Japanese heritage forces me to do it. If a
singer or actor is wearing a perfect costume, her spirit is rich
and beautiful. If not, she has no confidence.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SUITE DREAMS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If you book yourself into Paris' latest hot hotel _ the newly
restored Meurice _ remember two secret numbers: 524 and 528. These
junior suites, nestled under the hotel's mansard roof, feature
dizzying views of Place Vendome and Montmartre and great bathrooms
with original stained-glass windows.
 &HT;    The oak-paneled dressing rooms are gigantic (there's space for
plenty of Vuitton trunks and Colette shopping bags) and feature
flattering golden lighting.
 &HT;    But if you're feeling as flush as the hotel's owner, the Sultan
of Brunei, reserve La Belle Etoile, the most expensive hotel suite
in all of Paris. The 3,000-square-foot complex includes a Belle
Epoque rooftop pavilion with a huge wraparound terrace. The views
alone may be worth the price of admission _ $8,400 a night.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MONUMENTAL HEADACHE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani can't stand clutter _ whether it's on the runway
or in the piazza. The designer is lobbying to have a monument to
former Italian president and prime minister Sandro Pertini removed
from its home in the piazza next door to Milan's Grand Hotel,
because he thinks it's an eyesore.
 &HT;    Armani, who happens to be opening his Emporio Armani mega-store
in that same piazza in October, even has offered to foot the bill
for the transfer.
 &HT;    City officials are divided as to what to do; designer Gianfranco
Ferre is furious: ``Whether Giorgio likes it or not, that monument
is part of the city's cultural face,'' Ferre says. ``He only
noticed it now, because of the opening of the store.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BABY TALK
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Supermodel Stella Tennant has been in the family way _ in more
ways than one. The supermodel, who just gave birth to a daughter,
is designing a baby line for Burberry called Tennant &AMP; Son,
handmade in her Scottish hometown by her own friends.
 &HT;    The collection will hit Burberry's 57th Street store in New York
in September.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BATTLE ROYAL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the old days, British monarchs used to behead errant nobles;
today, Queen Elizabeth just sues them.
 &HT;    The queen has filed suit against the Duke of Westminster,
Britain's wealthiest man, over a mineral-rich quarry in Wales.

Commission is seeking a court writ to keep his minions from

 &HT;    Let's hope the spat doesn't upset the delicate balance of royal

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Internet may be a great equalizer, but new research shows
that the rich are different from you and me when it comes to the

 &HT;    A new study by Forrester Research Inc. indicates millionaires
research and buy everything from clothing and jewelry to airline
tickets and groceries online.
 &HT;    For the report, ``The Millionaire Online,'' Forrester surveyed
more than 2,000 affluent households (those with investable assets
of $1 million or more, not including the value of their primary

 &HT;    Use the affluent to test and launch new products. An affinity
for novelty, opinion leadership, brand-consciousness, and
value-focus make the affluent ideal candidates for examining and
fueling market trends.
 &HT;    Target emerging affluent consumers. These younger, high-income
non-affluent consumers share many key characteristics with the
affluent: a dominant career motivation, a passion for technology
and a high tolerance for investment risk. c.2000 Fairchild

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A country may transform its government. It can
abolish its former ideology, revamp its economy and remove most of
the physical barriers between itself and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   What Russia cannot do, however, as Moscow's handling of the
Kursk disaster demonstrated, is to change the obsession of its
rulers with keeping up appearances at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   Every schoolboy knows about the stage-set villages that Prince
Gregory Potemkin put up to impress Catherine the Great, Emperor
Joseph of Austria and the King of Poland when they visited the
newly conquered territories of southern Russia in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later the Marquis de Custine wrote in the volume
that immortalized his journey to Russia that for those living
there, ``to conceal is useful, to feign is essential. A sincere man
in that country would pass for mad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, deliberate feigning turns into willful
self-deception. Thus officialdom's instinctive reaction to the
tragedy which played itself out in the Barents Sea, obeying that
ancestral impulse to maintain secrecy, and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, as so frequently in Russian history,
rational government has given way to a familiar brew of
incompetence and wishful thinking, topped off by half-truths and
downright lies.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has always been schizophrenic about Western Europe
and its contemporary patron power, the United States. Tugging it
one way is a superiority complex born of a belief in Russia's
special mission; pulling no less forcefully in the opposite
direction is a sense of inferiority at their country's
indisputable, ultimately unconcealable, economic backwardness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia cannot be understood with the mind alone,'' it has been
claimed in an effort to square this circle.
</P>
<P>
   Many a frustrated foreigner will vouch for the truth of the
observation. Unfortunately, it does not quite explain why it took
so long to enlist the aid of the outside world to try to save the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the delay appears to have had much in common with
another instinct shared by czars, general secretaries and
presidents alike: that the fate of individuals is nothing compared
to the raison d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the interest of the State was not only to avoid
compromising military secrets but also, it would seem, to avoid any
suggestion that the foreigners were better.
</P>
<P>
   So the foot-dragging, the absurdly ponderous first contacts
through NATO in Brussels, before permission _ too late _ for
Britain to send its rescue craft.
</P>
<P>
   This behavior, too, is of a pattern _ from the 30,000 laborers
who died in the bleak and marshy Neva delta so that Peter the Great
could have his new capital, St. Petersburg, ``a city built on
bones,'' to the hundreds more who perished following the order that
the Winter Palace should be rebuilt within two years of the fire of
1837.
</P>
<P>
   As Custine remarked, ``A ruler can be popular in Russia without
attaching great value to the lives of Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   In time of conflict the casualties would be immeasurably
greater. During the First World War, sometimes 25 percent of
recruits were sent to the front without arms, instructed to take
what they could from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   So it was, too, in the even more desperate struggle against
Hitler. The bravery and sacrifice of ordinary Russian soldiers
defies belief. But they were also propelled by the savage
discipline of penal battalions, the gulag and summary executions.
</P>
<P>
   According to archives, no fewer than 422,000 members of the Red
Army would ``atone with their blood for the crimes they committed
before the Motherland'' during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And now Vladimir Putin, who for almost a week preferred to
remain at a Black Sea holiday resort rather than fly to Moscow or
Northern Fleet headquarters at Severomorsk to take command of the
rescue effort, declining to summon immediate help from abroad to
tackle a tragedy which was gripping the world.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin however may find himself in a trap created by
the very speed of recent history. Russia is caught between two
mindsets: an old one, inherited from Soviet times and most visible
in the military establishment which obeys the old xenophobic raison
d'etat _ and a civil society with an opposition and a functioning
press, ever more resembling the West.
</P>
<P>
   Not very long ago, the foreigner visiting Russia would be
allowed to see only Great Parks of Socialist Achievements and the
Bolshoi Ballet; he would not learn about the squalors of rural
life, unchecked industrial pollution _ and certainly not about the
plight of the most modern submarine in the national fleet, lying
mortally wounded on the seabed 100 miles off Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   And so the great myth of U Nas Luchshe, ``It's better with us,''
would be publicly preserved, and along with it the eternal
trade-off between Russia's rulers and their much oppressed subjects
_ that in return for their sacrifices and hardships, these ordinary
citizens could derive the satisfaction of belonging to a country
respected beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   That bargain has now collapsed.The illusion has been shattered,
and our attitude to Russia now is less fear than condescending
bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media, meanwhile, were this time providing the first
details of a humiliating national tragedy within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   How different from Chernobyl, just 14 years ago, when only after
a fortnight did Mikhail Gorbachev provide a first proper account to
his own people _ and then one as much a tirade against the Western
press as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But that was how the military initially behaved over the Kursk.
First, the suggestion that the accident was not critical, that all
was in hand; then dark mutterings about a collision with a foreign
vessel; only finally could Russian pride bring itself to concede
that a massive forward explosion might have been to blame.
</P>
<P>
   And now the extraordinary spectacle of Russian newspapers
mocking the official obsession with official fears that ``if even
one Russian sailor is saved from a Russian submarine with foreign
help, this will end in a political catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure of how things have changed is that while Putin has
thus far been faithful to tradition in his handling of the crisis,
his methods could indeed produce a political catastrophe _ for
himself. &QL;

 &HT;    EDS: RESENDING FOR ALL WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Before fixing something, make certain it's really broken

   ATLANTA _ The beeping was driving me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, as I drove to work in the car I bought a few
weeks ago, it beeped at me.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is a way-too-fancy car with a built-in computer, I
figured I had accidentally set one of the many alarms for
temperature, time or _ for all I know _ approaching meteor showers.
So I tried resetting all the electronics. The next morning, as I
drove to work, the car beeped at me again. It wasn't a loud beep.
But it was torturous, nonetheless, sitting in the car waiting for
the next beep.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation (and in violation of the ``Rules for Guys'') I
read the car's manual. Based on that, I reset some of the controls.
But the car still beeped. Finally, I disconnected the battery
cables, figuring that would be equivalent to rebooting the computer
and would return it to normal settings, stopping the danged
beeping.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the car beeped at me like a lovesick duckling.
It made me jumpy.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to the newspaper garage, I reached over to the glove
compartment to check the manual once again. That's when I noticed a
tiny object on the passenger side floorboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pager. A beeping pager.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance of mine had dropped her pager. Since there were
messages waiting, the pager was beeping.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes life hands a guy like me a column that only requires
telling, not writing. This is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the lesson: I broke a basic rule of repairing computers,
cars or choo choo trains.
</P>
<P>
   I started fixing something before I knew what was wrong. In
almost every case, this results in messing up something brand new
and not fixing the old problem either.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, my efforts to fix the beeping messed up the computer
system. Disconnecting the . Then I checked the card that had the
code number on it and discovered I had the code number wrong.
</P>
<P>
   No problem I thought. I took the card with the correct code down
to the car and punched the correct numbers in. Those stupid letters
_ CODE _ stayed on the display. No matter how many times I punched
in the correct code, the radio wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   In terror and desperation, I turned to the manual again. It told
me that after three incorrect tries the radio would not accept any
code, including the correct one, for an hour and a half. So I
turned off the key and waited. Then I tried the code again. It
still didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I turned to the Internet. I figured that one of the
Internet's newsgroups _ little gatherings where the information is
more specialized and in-depth than on the Web _ would be devoted to
my car. Sure enough, there was a newsgroup for my car make (as well
as one for any make you can imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes of checking out the messages posted there, I
learned what I was doing wrong. The hour-plus wait the manual
mentioned meant the radio had to be turned on for that period of
time. You couldn't turn off the key, as I had done.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I got everything fixed.
</P>
<P>
   But the point of this story is that nothing at all was broken
before I embarked on three days of fixing. So learn from me. The
next time something goes wrong with your favorite computer or
gadget, make sure you understand the problem before fixing it.
</P>
<P>
   You'll save a lot of beeping time.

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ How many countries do you have to visit to declare a
state? Does an albatross follow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to Iran,
France, South Africa, China, Russia, Indonesia, Japan?
</P>
<P>
   There were times, when he returned last week, that one was
tempted to ask whether Arafat the ``terrorist'' _ the pre-Oslo,
pre-``peace' Arafat _ would have garnered more support in the Third
World than the 1993 ``peace'' partner of the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The West may rest assured. The Russians, the Indonesians _ even
the Egyptians _ have understood the equations of what we call the
peace ``process.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat should not declare a state on Sept. 13 and, almost
certainly, will not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does he tour the world to gather support for his
`independent' state before organizing the sovereign country which
he wishes to rule?'' a Palestinian refugee official asked in Beirut
Friday evening. ``Any normal ruler would seek his people's support
for such a step before he announced independence.''
</P>
<P>
   So _ in the destitute, broken world of the Palestinian diaspora
_ goes the argument. Why did Arafat need to travel to Asia to
announce that he might ``reassess'' his declaration of a state?
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian underworld, the answers seem quite clear.
Aware that he would not receive the recognition for his
``independent'' state that he promised the Palestinians on his
triumphal return from the doomed Camp David talks, Arafat decided
to undertake a world tour to prove to his people that the
declaration of statehood could not be made on the date he promised.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than admit that his promise was a lie, he preferred
to allow the presidents and kings to urge ``moderation'' and
``restraint'' _ which is what the United States and, of course,
Israel, wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Camp David talks remain officially secret but
Arafat's concessions _ for which read, capitulation _ are obvious.
The documents which leaked out of Camp David showed that he
accepted the presence of the Israeli army in the Jordan Valley and
the right of Israel on Palestinian land to use its army when it
feared a danger to the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no Arab army _ neither Palestinian nor any other
kind _ in the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli air force would have
the right to fly over the skies of ``independent'' Palestine. There
would be Israeli early warning stations on Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the Israelis would continue to hold not less than
5 percent of the land, including the settlements which cut the West
Bank off from Jerusalem and which also cut the West Bank in two.
</P>
<P>
   So much for sovereignty. But a state? Gone would be American
support and funds. Gone would be any American ``leverage'' _ a
laughable notion, perhaps _ over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten would be any future negotiations over Jerusalem and
the ``right of return'' of three million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned would be any hope of European support for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's visits to President Jacques Chirac in Paris have
already become a tired routine. Only the hardworking Le Monde
correspondent Mouna Naim ensures that Arafat's visits to France
receive anything more than a few words below the fold in her paper.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel believe that a postponement of
talks on Jerusalem and the ``right of return'' is the only way
forward. And _ aware that he and his acolytes will lose the
millions of dollars of U.S. and European support _ Arafat is in no
mood to commit financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will declare a Palestinian state'' became _ in Indonesia _
a determination to ``reassess'' the declaration. A visit to Moscow
received a cold response from President Vladimir Putin who urged
``further thought'' before such a step was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not just about American pressure on its world
allies. Even Egypt refused to accept a negation of the Palestinian
demand for sovereignty over the Muslim holy landmarks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that postponement _ delay, suspension _ of
Arafat's demand for a capital in Jerusalem is an incendiary topic.
But a deferment of statehood might still be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Arafat has called for a meeting of the Palestine National
Council next month to debate the call for statehood. In the
meantime, the Palestinian ``minister'' for economy has warned that
the Palestinians could not withstand an Israeli economic blockade _
one of Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak's threats _ without
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of leader allows one of his ministers to say the
Palestinians could not suffer a declaration of statehood without
ensuring that they could survive?'' an official of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arafat wanted to declare a state, he would have done it and
then sought international support. Instead, he travels around the
world to see if he'd get support before he consults his own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And so all eyes will be upon the meeting of the Council, which
must surely urge ``moderation.'' And then he can say that the
democratically elected representatives of his own people have urged
restraint. This will mean postponement of statehood. So much for
the Sept. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Cynical, perhaps. But not without reason. With the Americans
already calling for a second summit ``peace'' conference in
November _ and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will follow
soon after a visit from American envoy Dennis Ross _ the
Palestinian chairman can insist on a very final last chance for the
``peace of the brave''; and postpone the ``state'' which he has
already declared twice before.
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ How many countries do you have to visit to declare a
state? Does an albatross follow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to Iran,
France, South Africa, China, Russia, Indonesia, Japan?
</P>
<P>
   There were times, when he returned last week, that one was
tempted to ask whether Arafat the ``terrorist'' _ the pre-Oslo,
pre-``peace' Arafat _ would have garnered more support in the Third
World than the 1993 ``peace'' partner of the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The West may rest assured. The Russians, the Indonesians _ even
the Egyptians _ have understood the equations of what we call the
peace ``process.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat should not declare a state on Sept. 13 and, almost
certainly, will not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does he tour the world to gather support for his
`independent' state before organizing the sovereign country which
he wishes to rule?'' a Palestinian refugee official asked in Beirut
Friday evening. ``Any normal ruler would seek his people's support
for such a step before he announced independence.''
</P>
<P>
   So _ in the destitute, broken world of the Palestinian diaspora
_ goes the argument. Why did Arafat need to travel to Asia to
announce that he might ``reassess'' his declaration of a state?
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian underworld, the answers seem quite clear.
Aware that he would not receive the recognition for his
``independent'' state that he promised the Palestinians on his
triumphal return from the doomed Camp David talks, Arafat decided
to undertake a world tour to prove to his people that the
declaration of statehood could not be made on the date he promised.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather than admit that his promise was a lie, he preferred
to allow the presidents and kings to urge ``moderation'' and
``restraint'' _ which is what the United States and, of course,
Israel, wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the Camp David talks remain officially secret but
Arafat's concessions _ for which read, capitulation _ are obvious.
The documents which leaked out of Camp David showed that he
accepted the presence of the Israeli army in the Jordan Valley and
the right of Israel on Palestinian land to use its army when it
feared a danger to the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no Arab army _ neither Palestinian nor any other
kind _ in the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli air force would have
the right to fly over the skies of ``independent'' Palestine. There
would be Israeli early warning stations on Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the Israelis would continue to hold not less than
5 percent of the land, including the settlements which cut the West
Bank off from Jerusalem and which also cut the West Bank in two.
</P>
<P>
   So much for sovereignty. But a state? Gone would be American
support and funds. Gone would be any American ``leverage'' _ a
laughable notion, perhaps _ over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten would be any future negotiations over Jerusalem and
the ``right of return'' of three million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned would be any hope of European support for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's visits to President Jacques Chirac in Paris have
already become a tired routine. Only the hardworking Le Monde
correspondent Mouna Naim ensures that Arafat's visits to France
receive anything more than a few words below the fold in her paper.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel believe that a postponement of
talks on Jerusalem and the ``right of return'' is the only way
forward. And _ aware that he and his acolytes will lose the
millions of dollars of U.S. and European support _ Arafat is in no
mood to commit financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will declare a Palestinian state'' became _ in Indonesia _
a determination to ``reassess'' the declaration. A visit to Moscow
received a cold response from President Vladimir Putin who urged
``further thought'' before such a step was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not just about American pressure on its world
allies. Even Egypt refused to accept a negation of the Palestinian
demand for sovereignty over the Muslim holy landmarks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that postponement _ delay, suspension _ of
Arafat's demand for a capital in Jerusalem is an incendiary topic.
But a deferment of statehood might still be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Arafat has called for a meeting of the Palestine National
Council next month to debate the call for statehood. In the
meantime, the Palestinian ``minister'' for economy has warned that
the Palestinians could not withstand an Israeli economic blockade _
one of Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak's threats _ without
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of leader allows one of his ministers to say the
Palestinians could not suffer a declaration of statehood without
ensuring that they could survive?'' an official of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arafat wanted to declare a state, he would have done it and
then sought international support. Instead, he travels around the
world to see if he'd get support before he consults his own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And so all eyes will be upon the meeting of the Council, which
must surely urge ``moderation.'' And then he can say that the
democratically elected representatives of his own people have urged
restraint. This will mean postponement of statehood. So much for
the Sept. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Cynical, perhaps. But not without reason. With the Americans
already calling for a second summit ``peace'' conference in
November _ and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will follow
soon after a visit from American envoy Dennis Ross _ the
Palestinian chairman can insist on a very final last chance for the
``peace of the brave''; and postpone the ``state'' which he has
already declared twice before.
</P>
<P>
   The Arafat world tour may have looked impressive. It may also
have been part of the window-dressing for another Palestinian
``concession.'' Stand by, then, for the postponement of the very
last deadline. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Chasing each other across the key electoral states
of the Midwest, the two U.S. presidential contenders were Tuesday
forced for the first time to engage each other directly in a
pre-Labor Day foretaste of the autumn campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With no fewer than six opinion polls now registering the
Democratic National Convention as a resounding success for Vice
President Al Gore, the campaign of George W. Bush slipped into
defensive mode, pounding away at the safe issues _ for Republicans
_ of education and military spending.
</P>
<P>
   There was abundant evidence, however, of a new renewed vigor in
the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee Tuesday, Gore countered head-on Republican
accusations that the country's defenses had been neglected during
the past eight years, insisting that the U.S. armed forces were
``the best prepared, the most powerful, most modern military in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited his experience of war in Vietnam (albeit as an
army reporter) as proof of his superior qualification to be
Commander-in-Chief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush, nor his running mate, Richard Cheney, went to
Vietnam: Bush served in the Air National Guard in his home state of
Texas, while Cheney stayed in higher education and benefited from
perpetual deferments.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was addressing the annual convention of Veterans of Foreign
Wars, the main U.S. veterans association, just 24 hours after Bush
had used his address before the same audience to lament the
country's state of military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The next president, Bush had said, ``will inherit a military in
decline,'' and he received a standing ovation for his pledge: ``I
will rebuild the military power of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting back Tuesday, Gore argued that the cuts in the defense
budget quoted by Bush dated not to the Clinton years, but to the
tenure of his father, George Bush senior, at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Only last year, Gore said, the administration signed into effect
a 4.8 percent military pay increase, the largest in a generation,
with another 3.7 percent to come this month.
</P>
<P>
   In a succession of post-convention interviews _ his first
unscripted encounters with reporters for weeks _ Gore appeared
buoyed by the poll verdicts on his convention speech, which were
unanimously positive.
</P>
<P>
   The last two post-convention polls _ the Washington Post-ABC
television out Tuesday and the Reuters-Zogby poll out on Monday _
both put Gore in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the leads of 2 and 3 points respectively (in
projections including the Reform and the Green parties) were within
the margin of error, this was the first time either poll had showed
Gore ahead since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush insisted that the tightening of the race was what
they had forecast all along, and observers noted that a realistic
indication of the state of play would emerge only around Labor Day
(Sept. 4), when the Democratic Convention was as far in the past as
the Republican Convention is now.
</P>
<P>
   They noted also that Bush had raised seven times as much money
in July as Gore, although more frugal spending has left Gore with
more in his war chest (an estimated 6.4 million dollars) than Bush
(4 million).
</P>
<P>
   A new hint of defensiveness could be detected in the Bush
campaign, however, as the two candidates approach their next big
test: the televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   The commission that organizes and sets the rules for the debates
made its proposals more than a month ago; but as Ari Fleisher,
Bush's senior adviser made clear this week, the Bush camp has still
not agreed either the number of the debates or their venue.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has proposed three presidential debates _ in
Boston, Raleigh and St. Louis _ and one vice-presidential debate,
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   At least in public, the line of the Gore camp _ which regards
debating as one of their candidate's strengths _ is the more
debates the better.
</P>
<P>
   The post-convention polls have also brought a perceptible shift
in the approach of the U.S. media. After months of treating Vice
President Al Gore as the underdog, they are now looking at the two
campaigns through a different prism.
</P>
<P>
   It is Gore, with his Jewish running mate and passionate
wife-kissing, who has tweaked the imagination, while Bush faces new
questions of style _ about his mangled English _ and substance: the
generous retirement package awarded to his running mate, Cheney,
and his reluctance to cash in his company shares. &QL;

television out Tuesday and the Reuters-Zogby poll out on Monday _
both put Gore in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the leads of 2 and 3 points respectively (in
projections including the Reform and the Green parties) were within
the margin of error, this was the first time either poll had showed
Gore ahead since the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush insisted that the tightening of the race was what
they had forecast all along, and observers noted that a realistic
indication of the state of play would emerge only around Labor Day
(Sept. 4), when the Democratic Convention was as far in the past as
the Republican Convention is now.
</P>
<P>
   They noted also that Bush had raised seven times as much money
in July as Gore, although more frugal spending has left Gore with
more in his war chest (an estimated 6.4 million dollars) than Bush
(4 million).
</P>
<P>
   A new hint of defensiveness could be detected in the Bush
campaign, however, as the two candidates approach their next big
test: the televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   The commission that organizes and sets the rules for the debates
made its proposals more than a month ago; but as Ari Fleisher,
Bush's senior adviser made clear this week, the Bush camp has still
not agreed either the number of the debates or their venue.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has proposed three presidential debates _ in
Boston, Raleigh and St. Louis _ and one vice-presidential debate,
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   At least in public, the line of the Gore camp _ which regards
debating as one of their candidate's strengths _ is the more
debates the better.
</P>
<P>
   The post-convention polls have also brought a perceptible shift
in the approach of the U.S. media. After months of treating Vice
President Al Gore as the underdog, they are now looking at the two
campaigns through a different prism.
</P>
<P>
   It is Gore, with his Jewish running mate and passionate
wife-kissing, who has tweaked the imagination, while Bush faces new
questions of style _ about his mangled English _ and substance: the
generous retirement package awarded to his running mate, Cheney,
and his reluctance to cash in his company shares. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Some very odd questions are surfacing in the Middle
East about Colonel Moammar Qaddafi's latest adventure in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is the ``Qaddafi International Association for
Charitable Organizations'' which is run by the colonel's
26-year-old son, Seif, and which is supposedly mediating for the
release of the 24 hostages in the Philippines?
</P>
<P>
   Why does it have no address listed in the Libyan capital of
Tripoli? And why has an organization which can rustle up a jet, a
medical team and negotiators so swiftly never been heard of before?
</P>
<P>
   Why have so few people recalled that Qaddafi sent money and
weapons to the Moro Liberation Front in the Philippines shortly
after he staged his coup d'etat over King Idris in 1969? Qaddafi
turned up to witness the subsequent autonomy agreement with Manila.
</P>
<P>
   And when a breakaway of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
rejected the autonomy agreement, they changed their name to Abu
Sayyaf: the very same Abu Sayyaf organization which now holds the
hostages in the Philippines. It was this same group which, in 1995,
called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Qaddafi has weaved many a tangled web in his time, but
few as complex as this. Nor one as strange in its nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi's son is called Seif el-Islam, which means, literally,
the two-edged sword of Islam. And ``Abu Sayyaf'' _ the name of the
kidnap group _ means, in Arabic, ``father of the sword-bearer.''
Just a coincidence, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And then _ for those who enjoyed the revelations in the French
press last week that France was supporting the Qaddafi initiative
in order to get its own hostages freed _ there is the weird story
of the good ship ``Silco.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Silco'' was a rustbucket cruising off the North African
coast with five Belgians and a Frenchwoman on board when on Nov. 8,
1987, it was commandeered by members of the ruthless Palestinian
``Fatah Revolutionary Council'' led by Abu Nidal.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions remain that the ship was in fact seized by a Libyan
naval gunboat. But for two years, the world played along with the
fiction that Abu Nidal's group, which was then based in Tripoli,
was holding its prisoners in an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
   Then on April 10, 1990, one of the Belgians, Fernard Houtekins,
and his French lover, Jacqueline Valente _ along with a child born
in captivity _ turned up in Beirut, courtesy, so we were informed
at the time, of Colonel Qaddafi's ``mediation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Abu Nidal's local office in Beirut even invited
a squad of Belgian diplomats to negotiate for the other hostages. I
was present when they arrived to chat to the local Abu Nidal
representative, who was to be assassinated a few meters from the
same office a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgians diplomats thanked Colonel Qaddafi for his
``mediation.'' French President Francois Mitterand formally thanked
Qaddafi for the ``decisive role'' he played in securing the release
of the Belgian and his French woman friend.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, the two were handed over by armed Palestinians to a
senior French intelligence agent called Philippe Rondot.
</P>
<P>
   Rondot, it transpired, had been involved in the negotiations
with Libyan emissaries for the hostages' release. Where is Rondot
now, one wonders? In France? Or in the Philippines?
</P>
<P>
   And where, finally, has the $24 million offered by the Libyans
for the Philippine hostages' release actually come from? It's a lot
of money for a charity to throw around.
</P>
<P>
   And if it goes to the Abu Sayyaf group, will any of it be
returned to the man who so generously supported their parent
``liberation'' organization three decades ago: Colonel Moammar
Qaddafi? &QL;

   GORE-THEME _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore began sounding
a subtle new theme on the stump this week, aimed at countering the
political estrangement among young and middle-aged voters alike.
Campaigning in the Midwest, Gore asked voters to ``open your
hearts'' and ``allow yourself to believe'' and to ``break through
your disillusionment.'' In an interview, Gore said these were not
references only to the reaction against President Clinton's
behavior, but also to the disenchantment with politics in general.

   MONITOR _ ATLANTA _ Off the coast of Cape Hatteras, in the
graveyard of the Atlantic, time and tide are erasing the remains of
a naval legend. The USS Monitor, the icon of Civil War ironclads,
is surrendering to the natural forces and maritime mishaps that
have dogged it since it sank in a storm on New Year's Eve, 1862.
Like the H.L. Hunley, the Confederate submarine raised from
Charleston Harbor this month, the Monitor _ the first ship built
entirely of iron _changed the face of naval warfare and sounded the
death knell for wooden warships. Like the Hunley, the Monitor was
lost at sea for more than a century. And like the Hunley, it is the
object of a multi-million dollar effort to save as much of it as
possible for posterity. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I will turn 45 in a few
days. I am alarmingly healthy, far more than I deserve, though I
have the normal aches and pains, as well as that male thickening of
the middle. Nothing terribly gross, but I'm carrying 10 pounds
extra that just won't go away. I go through spasms of exercise and
good resolutions. Lately, I've been walking two miles early most
mornings, doing 175 situps, only eating one cheeseburger a week,
drinking light beer and staying out of the breakfast to-go line at
McDonalds on consecutive days. What can I say? I'm a health nut.

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ His daddy taught school before

law school waitressing. ``When I visit a school and see a
hard-working teacher trying to change the world one child at a

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ I've known many porch cats. They
are drawn to the hedge at our home and the fact that it generally
doesn't take too much wheedling for some cat chow and water to make
it out the front door. Porch cats come and go, some nameless. Then
there were others: Oopsie, with one eyelid that didn't work right.
Snowball, who became a fat farm cat when we found a family with a

birth to three in a discarded box in our driveway. When fire ants
stormed, we hustled the mom and newborns inside. Two of the kittens
have stayed to this day. (John Young is opinion page editor of the

 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Clinton administration decided this week to allow research
to be conducted on human embryos, which permits their destruction
in order to get stem cells.
 &HT;    Why? Stem cells in embryos that have yet to mature into specific
muscle, blood or brain tissue might be used to replace damaged
cells to cure such diseases as diabetes, Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's.
 &HT;    The National Institutes of Health released guidelines spelling
out ethical and scientific criteria to make grants for federal
research using human embryos that can be obtained from in-vitro
fertilization clinics.
 &HT;    This step is opposed by such medical groups as ''Do No Harm: The
Coalition of Americans for Research Ethics'' for two reasons.
First, embryonic stem-cell research ''requires the deliberate
destruction of human beings in order to obtain the raw materials
for research.'' Second, current law prohibits ''research in which a
human embryo or embryos are destroyed.''
 &HT;    The new NIH rules sidestep the law by saying its funds are for
research, not to pay for buying embryos, which are to be privately
funded.
 &HT;    A group of 20 U.S. senators wrote to the NIH that its guidelines
''do not comply with this law, which we support and which remains
in effect.... Clearly, the destruction of human embryos is an
integral part of the contemplated research.''
 &HT;    Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Berg of Stanford University responded in
an interview, ''Embryos are stored for long periods of time by
in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics. Ultimately they have to be
discarded. Why not use them for stem-cell research, when the
alternative is to destroy them by other means? It is immoral not to
proceed, when there is a potential for saving human lives. What
greater morality exists than to help those embattled by disease?''
 &HT;    IVF clinics help a woman who has been unable to conceive
normally by fertilizing a number of her eggs with her husband's
sperm in a petri dish. A fertilized embryo is then placed in the
woman's womb in hopes of a normal pregnancy. Due to the high
likelihood of failure, a number of embryos are produced for
artificial insemination and are frozen for possible future use.
 &HT;    If she conceives, say, in the third attempt, there may be a
dozen unused frozen embryos. These are the controversial targets of
the new NIH rules.
 &HT;    My question is simple. Isn't there a higher potential use for
these embryos _ adoption by other infertile women who long for
children? At least a million married women are unable to conceive
and cannot afford the IVF process. Shouldn't they have first access
to the embryos?
 &HT;    But what about the important goal of using stem cells to replace
diseased cells that cause frightening diseases such as juvenile
diabetes?
 &HT;    Lyn Langbein, mother of a 5-year-old with the disease, must
check the blood sugar of her daughter 8 to 10 times every day: ''I
get up in the middle of the night to check her blood sugar to make
sure it is not too low or too high. She is about to enter
kindergarten. Will they notice when she turns pale and gets shaky
because of low blood sugar?''
 &HT;    Research has proven that stem cells taken from mice embryos can
be injected into the spinal chords of paralyzed mice and spark
recovery. Thus, researchers want to use human embryos to see if
they will have a similar effect on such people as actor Christopher
Reeve, who is a a quadriplegic.
 &HT;    Fortunately, however, there is an alternative source of stem
cells, and a medically more sound source: the patient's own body!
Transplants from outside the body risk rejection.
 &HT;    Dr. Dave Prentice, a professor of genetics, says, ''What NIH
seems to be ignoring is the whole field of adult stem cells. Last
March they cured diabetes in mice using stem cells from the
pancreas from adult mice. Two reports in June used corneal stem
cells from blind people to grow a new cornea, a transplant that
improved their vision.''
 &HT;    The Los Angeles Times reported last week that ''researchers have
succeeded in transforming stem cells from bone marrow into
functioning brain cells in rats and humans.... It is possible to
use a patient's own stem cells to treat a variety of brain
disorders, including Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's
diseases as well as similar spinal chord injuries.'' Their work was
funded by NIH and the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.
 &HT;    The discovery ''essentially circumvents all the ethical concerns
with the use of fetal tissue,'' said a researcher in the Journal of
Neuroscience Research.
 &HT;    Thus, there is no need to destroy human embryos.
 &HT;    They can be used instead for adoptions!

 ART NOTE: Includes B&AMP;W photo and color slide of the Pontiac Aztek
GT. 
 By STEVE SMITH 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hands down the most confounding vehicle of the new model year,
the Pontiac Aztek clearly hopes to serve multiple masters. Its
looks are undeniably distinctive _ somewhere between ``hideous''
and ``purposeful,'' depending on whom you ask. It resembles the box
a smaller sports utility vehicle came in.
 &HT;    Though it shares a platform with the mainstream Pontiac Montana
minivan, the designers of the Aztek have taken a radically
different route to achieve their objective, which ostensibly is to
combine the usefulness and comfort of a minivan, with the rugged
capability of an SUV.
 &HT;    As it is presently available, the Aztek is front-wheel-drive
only, though an all-wheel-drive system will be available late this
year. But even with all-wheel-drive, it won't be prepared to do any
serious off-roading. That system is comparatively light-duty,
designed to handle slippery pavement more than rocky, rutted mud
roads.
 &HT;    So what is the Aztek? Rather than an SUV, Pontiac is calling the
Aztek an SRV, for Sports Recreation Vehicle, coining yet another
variation on the sport-ute theme. In this case, it may be
appropriate, as Pontiac is targeting younger people with active
lifestyles.
 &HT;    The Aztek is designed to carry five people and a lot of toys to
the beach, on camping trips, spring break or to the Gulf Coast! Of
course, a relatively minute percentage of anyone's total driving
time is spent doing things like that, but Pontiac hopes the Aztek
makes owners think of its extracurricular capabilities.
 &HT;    Outside, the Aztek's angularity is startling, with multiple
sharp edges, even in the rear hatch, which uses two pieces of
glass, butted together at an angle. There is copious dark gray
plastic cladding the bottom of the body. The gas cap is exposed.
It's all sort of military.
 &HT;    Though the exterior of the Aztek is rightfully ripe for
criticism, some genuine out-of-the-box thinking went on during the
interior design. Buttons and switches are large and rugged-looking.
There are really big grab handles to help you get in and out.
 &HT;    Mechanically, the Aztek has the same 3.4-liter V-6 engine as the
Montana minivan; at 185 horsepower, it does a more than adequate
job of moving around the Aztek's weight _ more than two tons on the
all-wheel-drive version, but 200 pounds less than that for the
front-wheel-drive. The only available transmission is a four-speed
automatic, and it's nicely matched to the engine.
 &HT;    Though the Aztek rides on the same 108.3-inch wheelbase as the
Montana, the abrupt rear styling does not leave room for three rows
of seats. The Aztek accommodates two up front in bucket seats,
three in the rear on a bench-style seat. Though roomy, rear-seat
passengers sit quite low, with not much forward visibility over the
front seats.
 &HT;    From the driver's seat, the Aztek is not as peculiar looking as
it is from the outside, though the large dashboard and slanted hood
make it a bit difficult to perceive exactly where the front bumper
begins. With all the glass surrounding the cockpit, outward
visibility is excellent.
 &HT;    The test vehicle was a top-of-the-line Aztek GT, which came with
16-inch tires, better suited to this tall, fairly heavy vehicle
than the 15-inchers on the base Aztek.
 &HT;    Though the GT adds quite a bit of equipment as standard _
ranging from a trip computer to a standard traction-control system
_ it also adds to the price.
 &HT;    The GT starts at $24,445, and the test vehicle had a $2,415
option package that included an upgraded sound system, a power
driver's seat, a security alarm, leather interior trim and
puncture-sealing tires. It also included a ``head's up'' display,
which projects information such as the vehicle speed onto the
windshield in the driver's line of sight. Other options, including
a $365 trailer towing package that increases towing capability to
3,500 pounds, cranked up the price to $27,875.
 &HT;    I also drove a base-model Aztek and, though it lacked leather
and some of the other niceties, it listed at a total price of
$24,025. But it was still a very well-equipped vehicle, with
options that included a glass sunroof and a premium stereo.
 &HT;    Opt for the GT, though, and you can add some pretty interesting
equipment, as well as some trademark standard features. There's a
portable cooler that latches onto the console and can hold a dozen
12-ounce cans. The GT also has ``removable utility packs'' in its
front door trim for storage of items such as sunglasses and
cellular phones.
 &HT;    There's an optional pullout rear cargo tray that holds 400
pounds and makes loading sports equipment or home improvement
products easy. Indeed, practically everything behind the front
seats can be removed, folded or reconfigured _ quite ingenious.
 &HT;    And if you're a genuine outdoor type, there's a camping package
with a custom tent that fits over the open rear of the Aztek, and
an air mattress that can be inflated with an on-board compressor.
 &HT;    If all this interests you, and you can get past the exterior
design, the Aztek is a rolling platform of innovative concepts. But
if you can't, wait a year for the Buick Rendezvous, a more
civilized version of the Aztek that has a third row of seats, but
fewer of the young-lifestyle attributes.
 &HT;    Then, of course, there's the Montana minivan, which the Aztek is
at heart. Give Pontiac credit for trying something new, though _
odd as it is.

<P>
   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wering that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman was reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since been
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.
</P>

   MISS-SAIGON-ERA (New York) _ The musical ``Miss Saigon'' has
taken in more than $1.3 billion internationally at the box office
since its world premiere in London in September 1989. ``Saigon''
has been performed in the United States and six other countries,
and a new production will open in the Philippines next month. The
show's imminent departure from New York is significant because its
departure leaves just two in a crop of mega-musicals still running
on Broadway _ ``Les Miserables'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera'' _
suggesting that an era of theatrical spectacle may be at an end. By

   LAKEWOOD, Ohio _ Greg Miller had plans for April 20, the first
anniversary of the Columbine shootings. He was going to sleep in.
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood High School had been buzzing with wild rumors of hidden
bombs and cliques of students ready to come to class with guns
blazing. Greg, a 15-year-old freshman, said he didn't want to go to
school April 20 ``with all that paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he liked sleep better than school.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg hadn't heard the hottest rumor _ the one about himself.
Two days before the anniversary, police and the principal pulled
him out of the cafeteria because students said they had heard him
say he was going to ``shoot some people.'' In his pocket they found
a knife with a thick, 3-inch locking blade.
</P>
<P>
   He was tossed into jail, expelled and, over the next three
months, forced to go toe-to-toe with the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg never planned to shoot anyone. The accusations were
bogus. The charges against him were eventually dismissed, and
police are now investigating a student who pointed him out in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   At a final hearing in Juvenile Court, Judge Joseph Russo
apologized to him. Greg's parents say their son has become a
teen-age casualty in the battle to stop the next Columbine or
Jonesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Lakewood police and school officials believe they did their
jobs. They heard a rumor, assessed a threat and eliminated it.
Chances are, Greg would have been expelled anyway, because of the
knife.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not a killer. Yet, when he walks the streets of
Lakewood, kids he doesn't know yell, ``Hey Greg, are you going to
shoot up the school today?''
</P>
<P>
   Greg's high school years, and his innocence, are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Greg was older than the rest of his classmates because of his
late birthday. He dyed his long hair black. He wore black shirts
and jeans and, often, a long black trench coat. His grades were
bad. By his own admission, he probably would have flunked some of
his classes for the year.
</P>
<P>
   He likes working with his hands. School isn't his thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do math, and I can't write stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg describes his friends as ``the people you see sitting in
the back of the room never talking to anybody.'' They play ``Magic:
The Gathering,'' a popular fantasy card game; listen to music
ranging from Aerosmith to Kid Rock; and discuss ``how Pokemon is
not cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not loners,'' Greg said. ``We just don't like hanging
out with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report, a student's aunt told school
officials about a threat a few days before the Columbine
anniversary. She said her niece had heard a teen-ager say three
weeks earlier at a local park that he wanted to kill some
classmates at Lakewood High. Other students, according to the aunt,
also heard it.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned the students, who said the boy claimed to have
a death list that included athletes. The students said they
overheard the boy say he wanted to kill all the people he hated in
Lakewood and that he wished he ``had the guts'' to go into the high
school and kill people the way the students in Colorado had.
</P>
<P>
   Police had two descriptions, the report said. He was either 6
feet 1 inch tall with long brown hair and wore a ball cap and a tan
or black jacket, or had black hair in a ponytail and owned a black
trench coat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the girls joined police and Principal Vincent Barra in
the lunchroom April 18. She picked out Greg. He was taken to the
principal's office, where they found the knife and arrested him for
inducing panic and carrying a concealed weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next 10 days in the Cuyahoga County Detention
Center. He was released after his parents promised to take him out
of state for the family's first-ever vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the criminal case started to fall apart. The Lakewood
Police Department's investigation hadn't gone much beyond the
students' statements.
</P>
<P>
   After reading through the file, Assistant Cuyahoga County
Prosecutor Lawrence Rifalsky asked Lakewood police to check the
students' accusations further. At that point, some of the girls
recanted, and Greg's main accuser stopped cooperating with police.
</P>
<P>
   Rifalsky then offered the Millers a deal. Greg would plead
guilty to the weapons possession charge. But when the case reached
Russo, he dismissed it under a rule that allows judges to dismiss a
charge if it's in the best interest of the child and community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been more than punished for that'' knife, Russo said.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't much sympathy for Greg Miller. It's clear he
didn't plan to kill, but police, city and school officials are
satisfied with what they did.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Dan Clark said he wouldn't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel for the Miller family for having gone through
that,'' he said. ``But our main goal is to protect the safety of
the kids in that school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we living in a hypervigilant time? Yes,'' Clark said.
``Greg Miller was a victim of that hypervigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Clark said police were more suspicious of Greg because his
brother, Carl, pleaded guilty a year earlier for scrawling a bomb
threat on a public bathroom in the Cleveland Metroparks Rocky River
Reservation. The message said a bomb would go off in a Lakewood
High principal's office on May 14, 1999, which sent school
administrators and police scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   And, Barra said, Greg would have been expelled for carrying the
knife no matter what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers say they are a family of whittlers. Greg said that
for a time, he carried the knife because he feared being attacked,
but he stopped bringing it to school long ago. He said he didn't
realize he had it the day he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Greg's father, Joseph, said Greg shouldn't have been held
accountable for his brother's past.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Greg's mother, Carla Heritage-Miller, accused police and school
officials of conducting a ``witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to look good to everyone around the
Columbine anniversary and used my son as a scapegoat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg's classmates start their sophomore year Aug. 29, he'll
probably have already started high school equivalency classes at
Cuyahoga Community College. Greg could rejoin his classmates but
fears harassment after being branded the school's Columbine kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about going back, just to let them know they
couldn't screw me,'' Greg said. ``But then I thought, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to go 100 yards near that school.''
</P>

<P>
   ``He had been more than punished for that'' knife, Russo said.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't much sympathy for Greg Miller. It's clear he
didn't plan to kill, but police, city and school officials are
satisfied with what they did.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Dan Clark said he wouldn't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel for the Miller family for having gone through
that,'' he said. ``But our main goal is to protect the safety of
the kids in that school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we living in a hypervigilant time? Yes,'' Clark said.
``Greg Miller was a victim of that hypervigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Clark said police were more suspicious of Greg because his
brother, Carl, pleaded guilty a year earlier for scrawling a bomb
threat on a public bathroom in the Cleveland Metroparks Rocky River
Reservation. The message said a bomb would go off in a Lakewood
High principal's office on May 14, 1999, which sent school
administrators and police scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   And, Barra said, Greg would have been expelled for carrying the
knife no matter what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers say they are a family of whittlers. Greg said that
for a time, he carried the knife because he feared being attacked,
but he stopped bringing it to school long ago. He said he didn't
realize he had it the day he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Greg's father, Joseph, said Greg shouldn't have been held
accountable for his brother's past.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Greg's mother, Carla Heritage-Miller, accused police and school
officials of conducting a ``witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to look good to everyone around the
Columbine anniversary and used my son as a scapegoat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg's classmates start their sophomore year Aug. 29, he'll
probably have already started high school equivalency classes at
Cuyahoga Community College. Greg could rejoin his classmates but
fears harassment after being branded the school's Columbine kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about going back, just to let them know they
couldn't screw me,'' Greg said. ``But then I thought, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to go 100 yards near that school.''

 THE RIDE IS GETTING SUITE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ATTLEBOROUGH, Mass. _ On the right, we have Arthur Longa's
two-floor, colonial-style house. On the left, we have his Allegro
Bus diesel motor home.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz: Which one _ the house on the right or the RV on the
left _ has all-maple kitchen cabinets, leather couches, and tile
floors? Which one has two-zone heating and air conditioning?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It's the recreational vehicle, worth $180,000 and 39
feet long. It also has a living room that expands 3 feet in width
at the push of a button, two televisions and a VCR, and a CD player
that holds eight discs. And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered the province of retirees, RVs are going upscale
and finding a younger, hipper following. Longa, a 40-year-old
father of two, is part of a groundswell of RV enthusiasm that is
putting a new face on a classic piece of Americana. In recent
years, 35- to 54-year-olds have for the first time surpassed the
over-55 crowd in ownership of RVs. And sales are at a 20-year high;
last year, manufacturers shipped $10.4 billion worth of RVs to
dealers, compared with just $1.2 billion in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom, enthusiasts say, is not just a product of the
high-flying economy. They see RV mania as a sign of a gathering
backlash against today's hyped-up, stressed-out lifestyle. An RV,
they say, represents a return to a slower, more relaxing mode of
travel, redolent of the byways and back roads of a gentler era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted my children to see more of America than a fly-in,
fly-out kind of a trip,'' said Longa, who rented RVs for several
years before purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Brunswick, Maine, is hosting the annual convention
of the Family Motor Coach Association, where manufacturers show off
the latest advances in mobile home technology and devotees swap
secrets of living the good life on the road. Organizers expected
6,000 RVs to make the pilgrimage. Consider it a show of force.
</P>
<P>
   It's an indication that, even in an age when air travel is
ubiquitous, when many families can afford expensive vacations,
Americans still find liberation behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only time in my life that I really feel free,'' said
Janet Smith, an RV devotee who rents and sells the vehicles at Trip
Makers Inc. in Walpole. She believes that many families are turning
their backs on ``jet-setting'' vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Longa's is one of them. ``The RV is very exhilarating and
free,'' he said. ``I don't have to pull into the airport and wait
for someone else to get me there. I can get there myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, parents who have bought or rented RVs say they
finally found a way to get away from the constant din of soccer and
piano lessons, bills, and leaky faucets. In an RV, they say, they
have managed to achieve family bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very, very busy. This was a way to put a pause in the
sentence,'' said Joan Wallace-Benjamin, president of the Urban
League of Eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace-Benjamin rented an RV a few years ago for a
cross-country trip with her two sons and husband, Milton Benjamin,
president of the Massachusetts Community Development Finance
Corporation. On long stretches of road, the family passed the time
with books-on-tape and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good way for us to bond and get to know one
another,'' said Wallace-Benjamin, who added that her family would
love to go again next summer. ``In the process, we decided we
really do like our kids. We don't just love them; they're
interesting people.''
</P>
<P>
   And the children, separated from their friends and forced to
talk to their parents for days on end, apparently enjoy the time as
much as the adults. One mother, Karen Boynton of Plymouth, reported
that her 16-year-old son offered to pay for a weekend at a
campground out of his allowance.
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of MTV's ``Road Rules,'' a long-running
reality show that features a Winnebago, RVs are gaining a certain
measure of cachet with youth. Mini Cost Auto Rental, a Newton
agency, rented 25 RVs to fans of the band Phish for a New Year's
Eve concert in Florida that generated a two-day traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Younger renters and buyers are exactly what RV manufacturers
want. In the past three years, the Recreational Vehicle Industry
Association has spent $20 million in print and television ads
promoting their products, with much of the campaign aimed at baby
boomers and families with young children. The association has been
so successful that it is planning to double its spending for
another three-year campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The association says one of the best lures is gadgetry, which
can push the cost of an RV to the million-dollar mark. Of the motor
homes shipped in 1999 (separate from travel trailers and other
smaller RVs), 77 percent had at least one ``slide-out,'' a
mechanism that expands floor space at the push of a button. Other
options include satellite television, Internet access, and washers
and dryers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amenities are very important,'' said Jeffrey Gladstone,
37, a Boston investment analyst who lives in Franklin. ``I see
people miserably crawling out of their tents, and they look over at
me, drinking a cup of coffee and looking for the remote control.
That says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone recently purchased a 27-foot travel trailer that
attaches to his pickup truck. He's planning to upgrade next year to
a full motor home, and perhaps drive cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   Gladstone, his wife, his 7-year-old son, and 10-year-old
daughter have gone away every weekend since they bought the RV in
April, including trips to Maine, Connecticut, and Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Unwinding at home is not good enough, Gladstone said. ``You have
to get away. If you sit on your lawn, you look down and you see
weeds, and then you get stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger, and often more affluent, market for RVs is also
influencing the camping options available across the country. Bay
View Campgrounds in Bourne, for example, has three swimming pools,
a video game parlor, and courts for tennis, basketball, and
volleyball, along with daily activities for children.
</P>
<P>
   These campgrounds make it appealing for families like
Gladstone's to take short weekend trips. And they sometimes serve
as surrogate neighborhoods. Ron Norfolk of Freetown, for example,
doesn't feel safe letting his children ride bicycles on the busy
street at home. But at Pinewood Lodge Campground in Plymouth, where
he spent last week, they can.
</P>
<P>
   Even high gasoline prices seem to have done little to dampen RV
enthusiasm. Shipments of the biggest vehicles _ Class A motor homes
_ are down 5 percent since last year, but are otherwise higher than
any time in the last two decades. Overall, RV sales are soaring to
record highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch it suck up gas,'' Gladstone said, ``but I weigh the
enjoyment, and it's not really an issue.''
</P>

YEARNING FOR THE MOVIE CAR _ UNTIL ANOTHER COMES ALONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems so long ago, yet only two months have passed since I
fell in love with Eleanor in Los Angeles. I confess, there have
been others since.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor was the 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 KR that Nicholas Cage
drove in the movie ``Gone in 60 Seconds.'' She's history.
</P>
<P>
   First came the new 911 Turbo Porsche I drove in the Black Rock
Desert in Nevada. Fast and dangerous and edgy as you wanna be.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just this month, there was a brief fling with a 1962
Mercedes 300 SL roadster. This 3-liter straight-6 is the descendant
of the famous Gull Wings, which began as race cars in 1952 and went
street legal in 1954. It cranked out 215 horsepower, had a top
speed of 159 miles per hour, and, at $10,000 in 1962, was not a
cheap date.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you this because, after Eleanor appeared in a column
about famous cars from movies and television, you readers swamped
me with mail. The cars I missed. The cars you've loved.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much that you argued with my choices, among them
Steve McQueen's 1968 Mustang GT 390 from ``Bullitt,'' the 1974
Dodge Monaco 440 cop car that Aykroyd and Belushi drove in ``The
Blues Brothers,'' Paul Le Matt's 1932 Ford five-window coupe from
``American Graffiti,'' or Kowalski's 1970 Challenger R/T Hemi from
``Vanishing Point.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that you had loves of your own; love built of
adolescent fantasy or adult yearning for that certain car.
</P>
<P>
   Your list seemed weighted toward the '70s era, one reader wrote,
but I give you bonus points for the Pacer from ``Wayne's World.''
(And to you, dear reader, a rousing chorus of ``Bohemian
Rhapsody.'') So you and your roommates improved on my list, adding
the A-Team's van, the T-Bird of ``Thelma and Louise,'' but warned
me, ``don't even get me started on James Bond.'' (Hey, I prefer
cars that start when it's wet.)
</P>
<P>
   Corvette Enthusiast wrote to say he was disappointed that no
'Vettes made the list and asked, how about the Corvettes that
rotated each season during the run of ``Route 66''?
</P>
<P>
   Good point and it reminds me I should have included the
Harley-Davidson Sportster from ``Then Came Bronson.'' ``Route 66''
with a motorcycle and no designated road.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wrote to say his wife missed Suzanne Somers's
white Thunderbird from ``American Graffiti.'' If ever a car (and
its occupant) symbolized longing _ though I'm not sure if the
longing was for the car or the blonde at the wheel _ that
Thunderbird, I must agree, heads the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Mary &AMP; Crazy Larry'' another reader wrote after I
praised that film's 1969 Charger R/T 440, I thought I was the only
one who remembered that gem. Others to put on the list, he
continued: the 1954 Sunbeam-Talbot Alpine Roadster, predecessor to
the 1959-67 Tiger. Grace Kelly drove it in ``It Takes a Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on this man's list: The 1964 Aston Martin from
``Goldfinger'' (somebody got him going on James Bond), Columbo's
1960 Peugeot 403 Carbriolet, and the three Mini Cooper S's from
``The Italian Job.''
</P>
<P>
   I was faulted for missing the 440 Six-Pack Barracuda that Ken
Wall drove on the ``Wise Guy,'' and Christopher George's Shelby
Mustang from ``The Immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Sunbeam Alpine that Maxwell Smart drove on
``Get Smart,'' asked another. Now there's a guy way ahead of his
time. Top down in a roadster, distracted, talking on the
predecessor to the cell phone, Smart's famous shoe phone.
</P>
<P>
   And so we fall in love, or like, with the cars we see on screen.
Sometimes it is because we want to own the car. Sometimes it is
because the car represents something far larger: escape, freedom,
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   But love is often in the air. Thelma and Louise, fleeing bad
marriages, loved each other all the way to the edge of the Grand
Canyon. I don't know if Maxwell Smart loved Agent 99, but I do know
that Columbo loved Mrs. Columbo and Paul Le Matt loved his
five-window coupe.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite love story from a reader? Dan Levin tells this tale:
</P>
<P>
   My favorite movie car is the steel-blue Austin Healey roadster
that Ava Gardner drove at the end of ``On the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Atomic war had all but destroyed life on earth. Gardner's
husband, Gergory Peck, a submarine captain, is heading north with
his crew on a mission that spells certain doom. Gardner snakes the
Healey along a winding coastal road, top down, desperate for one
last and longing glimpse of the sub before it disappears forever.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbed Levin right by the heart strings, it is easy to see.
Healys became to Levin, he admits, the world's most beautiful cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but love can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   That love lasted, he writes, ``until that day I saw a 1963,
British racing green Jaguar XKE headed up Mt. Vernon Street with
its top down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sic transit gloria mundi, Dan writes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm no scholar of Latin, but I assume that means: Love 'em
and leave 'em.

WHAT`S THE HONDA S2000 LIKE? IT'S AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, what's it like?
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere I parked the Honda S2000, the high-revving, hunched,
hot sports car of the moment, somebody asked that question.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'd say, it's like driving a motorcycle _ without the bugs
in your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   This is a magical machine. Consider: When you want horsepower,
you feed those horses from two sources, RPMs and torque. Honda's
response: We don't need no stinkin' torque. Instead, they are
cranking a remarkable 240 horsepower (and even that is limited by
emissions regulations) out of only 2 liters of engine. Torque? A
paltry 153 lb.-ft.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a screaming machine that's all howling horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   So thank God for the rainbow tachometer that spreads its
crescent across the top of the gauges behind the steering wheel.
Watch it climb, lightning fast, past 5,000 RPMs to 6,000, where the
engine takes on a more powerful tone, past 7,000, where it gets
downright guttural, and up to near 9,000, where it's screaming
again.
</P>
<P>
   Want to pass on the highway? Drop from sixth to third gear and
stomp it. Whatever you may have been listening to on the radio will
be lost in the whine, but the act of passing will take but seconds.
You swear this car asks to be abused because to be driven, its
engine must be wound out.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from stop, you have to be careful to wind the engine to
a healthy scream or you run the risk of stalling. Once it gets
rolling, however, the responsiveness seems without limit.
</P>
<P>
   And all this is tucked into what I consider a classic throwback
to the earlier days of sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is up front. It's rear-wheel drive. The body is
stiff. The short rear deck covers a trunk that has barely enough
room for two small travel cases. The sloping nose looks almost '60s
English until you look at the S2000 from the front and its bulging
fenders, not apparent from the side view, give it away as a modern
muscle roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the seats are firm and legroom is ample. There's even a
dead pedal for the driver's left foot, though this car is so much
fun to drive, you find yourself using that foot for shifting up and
down just because you can.
</P>
<P>
   I loved the red Start Engine button located on the dash to the
left of the wheel, but was confused by the audio control setup. It
seemed strange that, in addition to controls on the audio system
itself _ at center dash _ Honda chose to put another set on the
dash to the left of the wheel. Either way is a reach, so what is
gained? If you're going for redundant audio controls, put them on
the steering wheel where they are more convenient and a boost to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you won't want to be distracted searching for audio
buttons when you're driving the S2000. You are fully involved if
you're driving it the way it is meant to be driven.
</P>
<P>
   Its stiff body is controlled by front and rear suspensions that
both incorporate unequal length control arms, coil springs, and
anti-roll bars. Steering is electric power assist rack-and-pinion.
Brakes are vented 11-inch discs all around.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a car that displays virtually no lateral roll, is
stiff and steady on straightaways, and is knifelike in sharp
corners. In fact, it cuts so sharp there is some sense of
understeer, though not in a disconcerting way. And with all those
RPMs and rear-wheel drive, you can induce oversteer if you want it
to play with, and sometimes, using the rear wheels to help steer
can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   And the tight, clicking six-speed shifter in the S2000 makes it
virtually impossible to not have fun driving this car. It is as
fine a shifter as I've ever used.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, however, is in learning to drive by sound. That's not
an uncommon trick. What is uncommon, is doing it to sounds you
likely have never heard coming from an automobile before (except at
certain race tracks).
</P>
<P>
   That's because the engine puts forth a furious wail and you
swear you are about to blow it up _ until you look at the arcing
rainbow and see you are only at 5,000 RPMs. It is not until you hit
Six Grand that the VTEC two-stage valve-timing system, with two
sets of exhaust and intake cams, kicks in for maximum boost and
you've reached into the heart of this remarkable four-cylinder
engine. Screaming around for more than a week, it delivered about
24 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   It's very loud. It's very quick. It's very stiff. And it's a
whole lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The soft ledges built into the front doors for elbows. If the
car isn't going to roll in the corners, you are. They give great
support in turns.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The tonneau cover for the convertible top. I never could get
the whole thing snapped down. It stayed in the trunk.

THREE AMERICANS ARRESTED IN RAID ON CHURCH IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Resending to fix garble.) 
(EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One-hundred and thirty evangelical Christians,
including three visiting Americans on a religious mission, were
arrested in central China on Wednesday as they attended a revival,
according to a human rights monitor and the Americans' pastor in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was part of a continuing pattern of arrests, fines and
other harassment of so-called house churches, mainly evangelical
Protestant groups that have quietly spread their faith to tens of
millions of Chinese while refusing to accept the authority of
official religious bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It came one day after a top leader of the government-sponsored
churches told an audience in Los Angeles that religion in China had
entered a ``golden age'' of freer expression.
</P>
<P>
   The detained Chinese are followers of the China Fangcheng
Church, which claims more than 500,000 members and is one of the
largest of many fervent Protestant groups that meet and evangelize
across the country without government approval. Such groups often
receive encouragement and financial aid from like-minded churches
in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   American evangelicals say the beliefs and practices of the
Fangcheng Church fall well within the Christian tradition. But the
Chinese authorities have labeled it and several other similar
groups as cults and in December sent two Fangcheng leaders to
``re-education through labor'' camps.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it had not
yet confirmed with Chinese officials that three citizens were in
police hands but that it was sending a consular officer to the
area. Under an agreement, China must inform the embassy within 96
hours when an American is detained for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when an American supporter of the outlawed
Falun Gong spiritual group was detained she was quickly deported.
</P>
<P>
   The mass arrests were first reported by the Hong Kong based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. On Thursday, a
police officer in the township where the raid occurred,
Dawangzhuang, in Henan province, confirmed that a large number of
worshipers were being held but would not say where.
</P>
<P>
   Often in such cases, most of those detained are soon released,
but leaders sometimes face stiff fines or imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of the three Americans, all of them Taiwan-born
immigrants, was confirmed Thursday by a pastor of their church, the
Chinese Vinyard Church Fellowship in Los Altos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans _ Henry Chu, 36; his wife, Sandy Lin, 28; and
Patricia Lan, 25 _ traveled to China on Aug. 13 for a two-week
mission in support of China's beleaguered Christians, said the
pastor, who spoke by telephone on condition that his name not be
used.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chu, who has lived in the United States for 15 years, has an
engineering degree and also completed seminary school, the pastor
said, and volunteers much of his time to church work. Lin also
graduated from college and a seminary and is a paid employee of the
Vinyard Church Fellowship. Lan is a third-year seminary student.
</P>
<P>
   All three have made similar trips to China, the pastor said,
adding that his church alone, with some 300 members who are mainly
ethnic Chinese from Asia, annually sends four or five small groups
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign missionary work is illegal in China, though informal
outside aid to churches is sometimes tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fangcheng Church is not a cult,'' the pastor said. ``They
are moderate and sound Christians. ``Its members are very faithful
and fearless, and they want to save everyone for Jesus. That's why
we want to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The government-recognized leaders of China's five approved
religions _ Protestant Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, Islam
and Taoism _ arrived in the United States this week to take part in
a world summit meeting of religious leaders at the United Nations
in early September.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Fu Tieshan, bishop of the
official Chinese-Catholic Church, which does not accept the
authority of the Vatican, said religion in China is entering a
``golden age,'' with the number of believers growing and less
official interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious believers and non-believers respect each other, are
united and have a harmonious relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fu, reflecting the government's concern about the spread of
uncooperative religious groups, also warned that too many of the
people newly attracted to religion are poorly educated, and hence
susceptible to heretical teachings and to cults.
</P>
<P>
   By government estimates, about 4 million people take part in the
official Chinese-Catholic Church, but outside experts say that
another 4 million to 8 million attend so-called underground
Catholic churches, led by priests loyal to the pope, and that they
are sometimes detained or fined.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people attend the official,
non-denominational Protestant Church, but tens of millions more _
no one has good numbers _ are believed to be active in the dynamic
``house church'' movement, named for its informal meeting places.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these unapproved churches do not operate in
secret, and the police may tolerate them if they do not too openly
proselytize. But in some regions, including Henan province,
assertive house church leaders have been harshly suppressed.

 &HT;    CLINTON VISIT AIMS TO BOLSTER NIGERIA'S ROLE AS KEY DEMOCRACY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the two years since President Clinton pointedly
snubbed Nigeria's former dictators during a tour of Africa, the
sprawling country has changed from international pariah to
America's great democratic hope.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago, Nigeria installed its first civilian
government since 1983 headed by President Olusegan Obasanjo, a
63-year-old former general with a reputation as an honest democrat
and hard worker. The change provided the United States a
much-needed friend in Africa, where war and economic stagnation
have conspired to dim prospects that raised hopes in the mid-1990s
of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will spend the weekend in Nigeria as part of a brief
African tour trying to bolster Obasanjo's support and reward his
country with a clear expression of America's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If democracy takes root in Nigeria, it will lift up an entire
region,'' Clinton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the first American president to set foot in Nigeria
since Jimmy Carter _ who also visited Obasanjo, the country's
military leader from 1976 to 1979. Obasanjo ceded power to a
civilian government, which was pushed out of power in 1983,
beginning a long and draining run of military dictatorships not
broken until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Obasanjo has held the fledgling democracy
together despite the many unsettling forces that sometimes seem on
the verge of pulling Africa's most populous country apart.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the relationship between the United States and
Nigeria has flourished. At the same time, Nigeria's importance to
American foreign policy has risen radically.
</P>
<P>
   The once stabilizing countries Clinton visited in 1998 _
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Rwanda _ have fallen into war with
each other. Surprisingly, Nigeria has been reborn as a bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rice, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said earlier this week that the Clinton Administration is
working overtime to support Obasanjo. ``Across the spectrum, we are
cooperating with and coordinating with Nigeria in a way that is
unprecedented,'' Rice told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view Nigeria as an indispensable partner to pursue our
shared goals of democracy and stability and conflict resolution,
not only in West Africa and on the African continent but
globally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size and location, Nigeria could be a key in
containing the violence that has crippled Africa's attempts to
develop, the administration believes. The government recently
announced plans to assist in training and equipping up to five
Nigerian battalions for service in peacekeeping, particularly in
Sierra Leone. The first American trainers arrived in Nigeria
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policymakers also take note of Obasanjo's ambitions of
doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a day. The
country, an OPEC member, already produces about twice as much crude
oil as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday that oil prices would be on the agenda
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has dramatically increased its aid to
Nigeria _ from $7 million in assistance restricted to humanitarian
groups in 1998 to about $109 million this year _ the largest amount
in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   However, after years of neglect and outright theft from public
coffers by Nigeria's military leaders, this may be a drop in the
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country - which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that despite its oil wealth wrecked the economy,
impoverished the people and depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria developed the reputation of being perhaps the world's
most corrupt country. (In 1998, Transparency International rated
Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt nations, trailing only neighboring
Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo has made an auspicious start.
Immediately after taking office, he summarily retired from the
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo also has been willing to extend his efforts beyond
Nigeria, teaming with South African President Thabo Mbeki on an
number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains weak but at
least stable.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders say it will be impossible for them to address
the major infrastructure problems hindering the country's
development as long as they are burdened with about $31 billion in
debt to the industrialized world. Clinton has told them that he
supports their position and has pledged to lobby for debt relief.
Only about 4 percent of the debt is owed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest threat to Obasanjo now is a bloody conflict
between Muslims in the north and Christians, who dominate the
south. Muslim leaders have imposed sharia _ a strict set of laws
based on a literal interpretation of the Koran _ in a half-dozen
northern states, creating a conflict that has claimed the lives of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has been criticized for reacting too slowly and
indecisively. Politicians from both religions express concerns that
Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is a feeling among ordinary Nigerians, intellectuals
and business leaders that the change is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Clinton's visit represents Nigeria's return to the
fold of civilized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit by President Bill Clinton further underscores the
reality of our country's re-emergence into international
respectability,'' Babatunde Fadun, a businessman and politician,
wrote in the Nigerian Guardian newspaper Thursday. ``After several
years of self-imposed isolation, Nigeria returns to the world stage
in a positive light.''

 &HT;    CLINTON VISIT AIMS TO BOLSTER NIGERIA'S ROLE AS KEY DEMOCRACY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the two years since President Clinton pointedly
snubbed Nigeria's former dictators during a tour of Africa, the
sprawling country has changed from international pariah to
America's great democratic hope.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago, Nigeria installed its first civilian
government since 1983 headed by President Olusegan Obasanjo, a
63-year-old former general with a reputation as an honest democrat
and hard worker. The change provided the United States a
much-needed friend in Africa, where war and economic stagnation
have conspired to dim prospects that raised hopes in the mid-1990s
of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will spend the weekend in Nigeria as part of a brief
African tour trying to bolster Obasanjo's support and reward his
country with a clear expression of America's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If democracy takes root in Nigeria, it will lift up an entire
region,'' Clinton said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the first American president to set foot in Nigeria
since Jimmy Carter _ who also visited Obasanjo, the country's
military leader from 1976 to 1979. Obasanjo ceded power to a
civilian government, which was pushed out of power in 1983,
beginning a long and draining run of military dictatorships not
broken until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Obasanjo has held the fledgling democracy
together despite the many unsettling forces that sometimes seem on
the verge of pulling Africa's most populous country apart.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the relationship between the United States and
Nigeria has flourished. At the same time, Nigeria's importance to
American foreign policy has risen radically.
</P>
<P>
   The once stabilizing countries Clinton visited in 1998 _
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Rwanda _ have fallen into war with
each other. Surprisingly, Nigeria has been reborn as a bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rice, the assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said earlier this week that the Clinton Administration is
working overtime to support Obasanjo. ``Across the spectrum, we are
cooperating with and coordinating with Nigeria in a way that is
unprecedented,'' Rice told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view Nigeria as an indispensable partner to pursue our
shared goals of democracy and stability and conflict resolution,
not only in West Africa and on the African continent but
globally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its size and location, Nigeria could be a key in
containing the violence that has crippled Africa's attempts to
develop, the administration believes. The government recently
announced plans to assist in training and equipping up to five
Nigerian battalions for service in peacekeeping, particularly in
Sierra Leone. The first American trainers arrived in Nigeria
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policymakers also take note of Obasanjo's ambitions of
doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a day. The
country, an OPEC member, already produces about twice as much crude
oil as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday that oil prices would be on the agenda
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has dramatically increased its aid to
Nigeria _ from $7 million in assistance restricted to humanitarian
groups in 1998 to about $109 million this year _ the largest amount
in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   However, after years of neglect and outright theft from public
coffers by Nigeria's military leaders, this may be a drop in the
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country - which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that despite its oil wealth wrecked the economy,
impoverished the people and depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria developed the reputation of being perhaps the world's
most corrupt country. (In 1998, Transparency International rated
Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt nations, trailing only neighboring
Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo has made an auspicious start.
Immediately after taking office, he summarily retired from the
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo also has been willing to extend his efforts beyond
Nigeria, teaming with South African President Thabo Mbeki on an
number of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains weak but at
least stable.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders say it will be impossible for them to address
the major infrastructure problems hindering the country's
development as long as they are burdened with about $31 billion in
debt to the industrialized world. Clinton has told them that he
supports their position and has pledged to lobby for debt relief.
Only about 4 percent of the debt is owed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest threat to Obasanjo now is a bloody conflict
between Muslims in the north and Christians, who dominate the
south. Muslim leaders have imposed sharia _ a strict set of laws
based on a literal interpretation of the Koran _ in a half-dozen
northern states, creating a conflict that has claimed the lives of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has been criticized for reacting too slowly and
indecisively. Politicians from both religions express concerns that
Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is a feeling among ordinary Nigerians, intellectuals
and business leaders that the change is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Clinton's visit represents Nigeria's return to the
fold of civilized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit by President Bill Clinton further underscores the
reality of our country's re-emergence into international
respectability,'' Babatunde Fadun, a businessman and politician,
wrote in the Nigerian Guardian newspaper Thursday. ``After several
years of self-imposed isolation, Nigeria returns to the world stage
in a positive light.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A funny thing can happen on the way to the polls
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Politics is a funny business, and getting
funnier all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's looking like we're going to have a horse race of an
election after all, as opposed to a coronation fit for a king by
the name of George II.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent round of polls is giving Vice President Al Gore
a slight edge over Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose lead only a few
weeks earlier was in the double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Polls, of course, can be funny, too.
</P>
<P>
   These are nationwide popularity polls. Never mind that the
presidential election is neither a nationwide nor a popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents are voted on in individual state elections, each with
its proscribed number of electoral votes according to population,
and it's the electoral college vote that officially counts.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where it can get tricky for the polls:
</P>
<P>
   George Bush and Dick Cheney may be ahead in Texas by as many as
4 million votes, while Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are the favorites
in New York by only a few hundred thousand.
</P>
<P>
   But whether a candidate wins a state by a split-hair decision or
by a landslide, it's winner-take-all for that state's electoral
votes, making it mathematically possible to lose the popular vote
nationwide yet still be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas is so big and so lopsided in favor of Bush, the
overall polling figures are easily skewered. That being the case,
Gore may be in even better shape than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Another curious aspect of the electoral college: Electors are
prohibited from casting a vote for a president and vice president
from the same state; such was the provision written into law by the
Founding Fathers to prevent Virginia from totally dominating the
executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Cheney ticket, in effect, will do exactly that for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, though a legal resident of Wyoming, has been making a
living -- and a very nice one, at that -- as CEO of Halliburton Oil
Co. of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work in Dallas, he ate his meals in Dallas, he slept
in Dallas, and when he took a shower he took a shower in Dallas.
For all practical purposes, he lived in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the Republicans have come up with a two-Texan
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine that it would be contested in court, but if it
were, and if the challenge were successful, might we end up with
Bush as president and Lieberman as vice president?
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how that ticket would do in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best advice about polls -- and most often quoted
by the candidate who is behind in the polls _ goes something like
this:
</P>
<P>
   The only poll that counts is the one taken inside the polling
place on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm still figuring it will be Bush. Write that down
as my prediction.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'll go even further:
</P>
<P>
   I predict that Bush will be a one-term president, that through
no fault of his own, a faltering economy -- and we're about due for
a serious downturn -- will cost him re-election in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   It will be history repeating itself, just like his daddy in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Because if there's anything funnier than politics, it's history.
History has a hilarious sense of humor.

<P>
   What happens to old mobsters when they trade in their rods for a
retirement home? Just call them ``Goodfogies.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dreyfuss narrates as Bobby Bartellemeo, the former
lieutenant of an old Jersey gang of wiseguys now graying retirees
in Miami, whose social highlights are senior special dinners and
strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Dinner reigns in Dreyfuss' usual jittery,
high-strung delivery but has less success with Burt Reynolds, who
mugs his way through the film as ``Bats,'' an enforcer on a
pacemaker. Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassel round out the group as,
respectively, ``Brick,'' the thick-headed softy with a sentimental
streak, and ``Mouth,'' the tightlipped ladies man and arsonist.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by ``Kingpin'' co-writer Barry Fanaro, spoofs
``Goodfellas'' while it follows the old boys getting back into the
game. They execute a neat little bit of mobster theatrics to scare
off the young, rich tenants from their suddenly upscale apartment
house and drive prices back. Flush with success, they flaunt their
new confidence with sports cars, flashy jewelry and flashier women.
</P>
<P>
   But their plan backfires and soon they're up to their toupees in
a blackmail scheme, a murder for hire, a homicide investigation by
a cop who just may be Bobby's long-lost daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss)
and a mob war with a Hispanic drug lord (Miguel Sandoval, who
underplays the bedeviled mob boss to quiet perfection).
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is a smooth, smart director with a great sense of comic
timing, but his strengths are character humor and understatement,
where Fanaro's leering sexual humor and outrageous gags are like a
senior citizens version of a teen sex farce. It's an odd mix with
an even odder undercurrent of romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner makes this quartet of former killers a cute and cuddly
bunch of snappy-dressing codgers who couldn't harm a flea if they
wanted to, yet he thinks nothing of the gang war they inadvertently
set off on the streets of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner made his reputation on TV, directing and producing
episodes of ``The Wonder Years,'' ``Chicago Hope'' and many others.
The film is slick and handsome, showing none of the visual
clumsiness many TV transplants let get in the way of the drama, but
Dinner instills it with a sweetness that bespeaks of his years
directing for families.
</P>
<P>
   It loses all potential for black comedy as a result, but in its
place is a good-natured movie that (criminal roots aside) explores
the way the elderly lose their dignity in their later years and
celebrates the strength of four guys who draw on their skills,
their courage and their spirit to take their dignity back.

<P>
   Nothing is sacred any more _ not even the cheerleader's
energetic, virginal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' and ``American Beauty'' challenged the
fresh-faced, chaste view of this optimistically iconic American
dream queen and the extreme sport cheerleading odyssey ``Bring It
On'' accentuates the fall by giving its angelic faces foul mouths
that would make a sailor blush.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abundance of swearing and obscene gestures, there's
hardly a shred of fresh material in the film, which straddles turf
that was already getting a bit soggy more than a decade ago after a
flood of smarter teen comedies by John Hughes (``Sixteen Candles,''
``The Breakfast Club,'' ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'').
</P>
<P>
   What this almost enjoyably bad comedy will do is provoke and
titillate every teenage boy's not-so-secret fantasy life. ``Bring
It On'' might shield its wallop of T&AMP;A taste in a shroud of
win-at-all-costs acrobatics, yet this squad of nimble, agile girls
and boys will stop at nothing to win the national championship
trophy for the sixth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After a new student named Missy (Eliza Dushku, from TV's
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'') enrolls at San Diego's Rancho Carne
High (Rancho Carne translates to ``fresh meat,'' by the way), the
Toro's cheerleading team discovers its cache of award-winning
cheers and choreography has been stolen for the rival East Compton
Clovers.
</P>
<P>
   New team captain Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) is caught between
saving face and doing the right thing. And Missy, her new best
friend, has an bad-boy brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford), who loves
the punk group The Clash. When he takes a shine to Torrance, well,
her whole peppy world is about to go postal!
</P>
<P>
   You've got to wonder what charismatic actors such as Dunst,
Dushku, Bradford (who began his film career with promise as the
young hero in Steven Soderberg's ``King of the Hill'' and who is
given so little to do here that it hurts) and Gabrielle Union are
doing slumming in a movie that's so lacking in everything except
spiffy footwork and abundant energy.
</P>
<P>
   Every other aspect of this story is predictable and surprisingly
confusing in its ultimate message _ its characters sway between
modern day empowerment and punishment by a '50s puritan ethic. That
in itself could have been a great theme but, in the end, even
Hughes better captured the false bravado and the sense of
insecurity that lingered beneath the cool facades of his teenage
protagonists _ and with resonant humor.
</P>
<P>
   So while 2, 4, 6, 8, ``Bring It On'' ain't so great, I wonder,
1, 2, 3, 4, why can't Hollywood give its teenage audience more?

 &HT;    COUNTIES, CITIES TO SAVE ON COMPUTER PURCHASES
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four major computer makers joined Thursday in a
one-size-fits-all bulk purchasing program for local governments
that promises to save the nation's cities and counties $50 million
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a win-win contract for us and for our
customers,'' said David Forsythe, vice president and general
manager of state and local government sales for Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program,'' Forsythe told a press conference here,
``allows us to save time, resources and money because we do not
have to re-bid to every local government. And this increased
efficiency translates into savings that we can then pass on to our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer sales will build on a little-known government
cooperative program, in place since 1997, that allows both tiny
rural hamlets and large urban areas to qualify for a discount of as
much as 70 percent below a manufacturers' list price.
</P>
<P>
   The direct-sales participants in the program, in addition to
Dell, are IBM, Gateway and Micron. Two technology re-sellers,
Comark and Software Spectrum, have also joined in the bulk
purchasing plan, which pools the purchasing power of local
governments to achieve volume discounts.
</P>
<P>
   An umbrella group known as the U.S. Communities Government
Purchasing Alliance sponsors the plan. The consortium is composed
of National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors
and the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Their new program is expected to generate $100 million in sales
this year and more than $500 million in sales over the next three
years. This will represent a savings to local governments of more
than $50 million within a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, one large jurisdiction agrees to seek bids on
specific technology products. Then any county, city or other local
government can purchase the same products at the greatly reduced
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the alliance maintains more than 10,000 active
accounts in some 5,500 public jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   It already offers an office supply program through Atlanta-based
Office Depot that saved local governments $35 million last year.
Office Depot reported program sales of about $16,7 million in 1997,
$35.4 million in 1998, and $75.8 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hague, president of National Association of Counties and a
member of the King County (Wash.) council, said the program ``helps
local officials do more with less, exactly what our taxpayers are
demanding. We are doing it in a 21st century way, using technology
of course.''

 &HT;    COUNTIES, CITIES TO SAVE ON COMPUTER PURCHASES

   WASHINGTON _ Four major computer makers joined Thursday in a
one-size-fits-all bulk purchasing program for local governments
that promises to save the nation's cities and counties $50 million
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a win-win contract for us and for our
customers,'' said David Forsythe, vice president and general
manager of state and local government sales for Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program,'' Forsythe told a press conference here,
``allows us to save time, resources and money because we do not
have to re-bid to every local government. And this increased
efficiency translates into savings that we can then pass on to our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer sales will build on ace Depot reported program
sales of about $16,7 million in 1997, $35.4 million in 1998, and
$75.8 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hague, president of National Association of Counties and a
member of the King County (Wash.) council, said the program ``helps
local officials do more with less, exactly what our taxpayers are

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sydney Summer Olympics will unfold in September with the
tightest security ever seen at the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that was not the case back in September l972 when the
Olympics took place in Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Loose security resulted in eight Palestinian members of the
Black September Movement sneaking into the athletes' village in the
early hours of Sept. 5, killing two Israeli athletes, and over the
next 21 hours torturing and eventually slaying nine other members
of the Israeli team.
</P>
<P>
   During the last hours that the horrible drama was playing itself
out in the very heart of the Olympic village, Olympics organizers
debated whether to suspend the Games. Meanwhile, close to the
apartment where the athletes were being held and tortured, members
of other teams practiced, trained, sat at cafes or simply relaxed
in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   With our minds about to focus on the Olympics that open Sept.
13, HBO has chosen Sept. ll to air the powerful Oscar-winning
documentary, ``One Day in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Kevin MacDonald recalled the background and events that
lead to the making of the film:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only 28 years since the end of World War II and the
Germans, because of their history, were worried that if they
cracked down too hard they would be perceived as Teutonic
dictators,'' he explains. ``They were trying to live down the
reputation they had for militarism and for being overly strict. So
they went to the other extreme and were completely lax.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for the Games, unarmed German cops donned sky blue lycra
outfits. ``They wanted to show the world that they were a
democratic country, not the fascist state they used to be,'' adds
the young Scottish filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the terrorists get in? The film shows that they just
climbed over the fence around the village at about 4:30 a.m. ``They
were actually helped over by some drunken American athletes who
thought they were competitors, like themselves, trying to get back
to their dormitories without going through officials at the front
gate and having their passes checked,'' says MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were a lot more naive about security then,'' he points
out. ``It was easy come, easy go. And it wasn't uncommon for
athletes to go to parties and smuggle themselves back into the
village by climbing the fences.''
</P>
<P>
   The terrorists were also helped, says producer Arthur Cohn, by
the delegation from East Germany, who were quartered on the floor
above the Israelis. ``They passed crucial information to the
terrorists,'' adds MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, narrated by Michael Douglas, is often tough to
watch. The filmmakers' greatest coup was to track down the last
remaining member of the Palestinian terrorist squad, now hiding
with his family somewhere in Africa, and to persuade him to do an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the assassins died in a hail of bullets at the airport.
Two were eventually hunted down and killed by the Israeli secret
service, Mossad, which also disposed of a dozen other Palestinian
leaders believed to have been involved with the planning of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald says Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was at that
time head of one of the anti-terrorist squads that carried out the
reprisals. ``In the most famous incident, Barak dressed up as a
woman _ with grenades literally in his bra _ and with a dozen other
commandos got into central Beirut from the beach and killed three
senior members of the PLO. That was in direct revenge for Munich.''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Palestinian terrorist, Jamil Al Gashey, who was
also the youngest, appears in the film in disguise. In shadowy
lighting, with his face masked with glasses and a moustache and
hidden by a baseball cap, he gives a version of how the terrorists
planned the attack.
</P>
<P>
   They originally intended only to take hostages in exchange for
Palestinian prisoners held abroad, he maintains. ``We had no orders
to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Gashey, who has survived several attempts on his life, expresses
absolutely no regret for what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, the six-time Academy Award winner whose triumphs include
``The Garden of The Finzi-Continis'' (1971) and ``Central
Station,'' (l999) explains: ``Gashay said he would do it again
because it presented an opportunity to let billions of viewers
around the world know the political aims of the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Though criticized in some Israeli circles for giving Gashey a
platform, the filmmakers say most Israelis, including Mossad, are
happy with the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided from the very beginning,'' says Cohn, ``that in
order to have an evenhanded document, to have a believable and
authentic story, we needed the protagonists of that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an uphill battle to get all the others to appear. We
had, for the first time, the head of the Mossad, Zvi Zamir. We had
the German interior minister, the Munich police chief, the head of
the Olympic Village and all the other principals at Munich.''
</P>
<P>
   Because families of the Israeli athletes were upset at the
graphic photographs of their slain loved ones, the pictures were
``softened'' in the film. But, Cohn says, ``I continued to insist
that a film against terror must show terror.''
</P>
<P>
   The other great revelation of the film is the incompetence of
the infamous German officials, who not only had no anti-terrorist
squad but also had no special-services group whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   When they did try to mount an attack on the terrorists, who were
holed up with their victims in the dormitories, machine-gun toting
police dressed as athletes planned to get in through the roof's
ventilation shafts. But as they assembled there, TV cameras were
watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really the first satellite Olympic Games and the whole
world was watching _ along with the terrorists,'' MacDonald
recalls. ``It became this incredible drama unfolding in the living
rooms of viewers around the world. In some way we tried to
re-create that sense in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary to see the footage, throughout that day, of
the negotiations going on, the terrorists coming out on the
balcony, the bus with the terrorists inside, and they and the
hostages leaving in helicopters for the airport. Today the media
would be kept two miles away and wouldn't see a thing,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, having come up with a clever plan to grab the
terrorists at the airport, the German police could not follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five policemen disguised as flight crew were to be hidden in
the jet waiting at Fuerstenfeldbruck air base to fly the terrorists
and their nine hostages to Libya,'' recalls Cohn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their plan was to capture or kill the terrorist leader when he
inspected the plane, and the chances would have been excellent that
his subordinates would then have given up or been overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the police assigned to the job rejected the plan as being
a suicide mission,'' exclaims Cohn. ``Even now I find this attitude
absolutely incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, German security officials eventually opted to storm
the terrorists as they arrived in helicopters at the airport for
their plane to freedom. In blazing gunfire, five of the terrorists
perished _ but not before they tossed a grenade, blowing up the
copter carrying the nine remaining Israeli hostages.
</P>
<P>
   And the Games went on ...

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his speech accepting the Democratic
vice-presidential nomination last week, Joseph Lieberman made one
of his customary swipes at the gratuitous sex and violence coming
out of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many Americans,'' he told delegates at the party convention
in Los Angeles, ``there is a swelling sense that our standards of
decency and civility have eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Senator Lieberman's worst nightmare has just come to life.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those fortuitous coincidences that are simply too good
to have been manufactured, the film currently topping the U.S. box
office is a veritable orgy of grotesque imagery, stomach-churning
violence, scenes of torture for torture's sake, rape, child abuse
and serial murder.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``The Cell,'' it purports to be a phantasmagorical
exploration of the mind of a vicious killer, a bit like ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'' Instead of the suave, urbane,
psychologically terrifying Hannibal Lecter, however, we have Carl
Stargher, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, who appears to have no
redeeming social skills at all.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite pastime is to kidnap women and imprison them in a
plexiglass cell in the middle of the Mojave desert, where their
slow death by drowning is captured on videotape in gruesome detail.
</P>
<P>
   Stargher then douses the corpses in bleach, lays them on a
coroner's slab, plays back the death video and masturbates over
them while suspending himself from the ceiling with chains attached
to 14 steel rings embedded in his back.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the start of it. Most of the film actually takes
place inside Stargher's head, where FBI agents played by Vince
Vaughn and Jennifer Lopez are transported by the wonders of modern
technology _ I kid you not _ only to watch a horse being sliced and
diced into Damien Hirst-like tranverse sections, observe a woman
drowning in a bath of her own blood and, in one particularly
unpleasant sequence, have their own guts ripped out with a pair of
scissors and twisted on a barbecue spit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' is the debut feature of an Indian commercials
director called Tarsem Singh, previously best known for making the
music video for the REM song ``Losing My Religion.'' (In the spirit
of Hollywood sequels, this venture might have been called ``Losing
My Lunch'').
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, he doesn't think there is anything particularly
violent about his movie. ``It's graphic,'' he told one interviewer
last week, ``but not violent.''
</P>
<P>
   To anyone unimpressed by claims of ``arty'' production design or
modish preoccupation with the bleakness of the human spirit, this
film actually looks like the best argument for censorship the
anti-Hollywood faction in Washington ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it nasty, it is shamelessly directed at teenagers.
Rated R rather than NC17 (which means children can, to all intents
and purposes, get in with little trouble), it made most of last
weekend's $17.2 million take from adolescent boys in search of the
latest celluloid thrill _ exactly the market, and the material,
that got Hollywood into such trouble after the Columbine High
School shootings last year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if this were the only film Joe Lieberman or his
Republican counterpart in the morality crusades, Bill Bennett, got
to see this decade, there's a fair bet the film industry would go
the way of Big Tobacco and be hit with billion-dollar lawsuits for
threatening the health and sanity of the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   And yet _ the cultural warriors have been remarkably silent
about ``The Cell.'' Film critics have certainly vented their
disgust: the Los Angeles Times called it ``nauseating'' and the
sort of film you are sorry you ever saw. But from the politicians,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two words to explain their reticence:
presidential election. The Republicans have never gained any
mileage from Hollywood-bashing on the campaign trail, and know
better now than to shoot their mouths off and risk losing votes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats, both Lieberman and Al Gore may have
expressed concern in the past about sex, violence and profanity in
the entertainment industry, but they have their own constituencies
to think about.
</P>
<P>
   Gore raised a record-breaking $5 million in direct campaign
contributions from Hollywood last week, and can hardly afford now
to bite the hand that fed him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Lieberman, he agreed as part of the price of admission to
the presidential ticket to drop his more confrontational rhetoric.
For example, the Silver Sewer awards, which he and Bennett doled
out each year to products just like ``The Cell,'' have been put on
hold on the grounds they are not ``vice presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Hollywood is home free, and looking remarkably cocky
given that a special Federal Trade Commission report on the
marketing of violence to children is about to be released to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The self-flagellating promises the industry made to police its
own exploitative excesses in the wake of Columbine now appear to be
forgotten. Instead, gore is in vogue once again _ and not the Gore
the Democrats might have hoped for. &QL;

For example, the Silver Sewer awards, which he and Bennett doled
out each year to products just like ``The Cell,'' have been put on
hold on the grounds they are not ``vice presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Hollywood is home free, and looking remarkably cocky
given that a special Federal Trade Commission report on the
marketing of violence to children is about to be released to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The self-flagellating promises the industry made to police its
own exploitative excesses in the wake of Columbine now appear to be
forgotten. Instead, gore is in vogue once again _ and not the Gore
the Democrats might have hoped for. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ As usual, it was a massacre of the innocents. But this
time with a heavy toll of children.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air's flight GF072 killed 36 of them when it crashed into
the sea off the island of Bahrain on Wednesday night, one of the
largest numbers of children to die in an air disaster in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the shallow waters Thursday morning came their passports,
one showing a baby in a woollen wrap, another a small boy smiling
into the camera of a photo booth. Mohamed el-Naggar turned up at
Bahrain airport to find that his cousin, her husband and their two
children _ aged 2 and 3 _ were all killed.
</P>
<P>
   The other passengers _ two Britons among them _ were the usual
mixture of vacationers, guest workers and family relatives, their
bodies so badly crushed by the Airbus A320's nose-dive impact that
relatives in Bahrain were shown only photographs of the dead to
identify husbands, wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   Every body was recovered _ the plane's wreckage was lying in
water sometimes only 10-feet deep _ but divers and boat crews were
anxious to find all the remains before the Gulf's massive swarms of
fish moved into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has suffered twice in less than a year, losing almost 200
Egyptians aboard Egyptair flight MS990 over the Atlantic and now 63
_ almost half the complement of the 143 passengers and crew on the
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Egyptians _ living in a historically rich but
near-bankrupt country _ Rida Hassan worked in a restaurant in
Bahrain and had been visiting Cairo for a month just to get married
before catching GF072 back to his work. Remittances from Egyptians
abroad produce Egypt's biggest source of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual terrible scenes of grief at both Cairo and
Bahrain airports as officials either failed to provide information
or instead read out the names of the dead to horrified relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Bahrain, they were taken to a hotel in the capital, Manama.
In Egypt, which specializes in inadvertently tormenting
grief-stricken families, Egyptian staff of Gulf Air failed to
produce a passenger list for the flight _ even though they had
checked the doomed men, women and children aboard only a few hours
earlier, collecting their names on boarding cards as they left the
departure lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie was sending its own team of investigators to
Bahrain Thursday to examine the debris and the flight recorders
which were both discovered intact.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain air traffic control says that the aircraft made two
turns over the airport before crashing; fishermen saw the big jet
turn tail up and dive into the sea nose first. One said the plane
exploded although wreckage suggested the aircraft had simply broken
up under the impact. Among the detritus poking up from the
sea-floor was a large piece of fuselage bearing Gulf Air's familiar
golden falcon logo.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger manifest in Bahrain showed that the Cairo-Bahrain
flight, as well as the 63 Egyptians, was carrying 34 Bahrainis, 12
Saudis, nine Palestinians, six citizens of the United Arab
Emirates, three Chinese women _ all visiting husbands who work at
the Xinhua news agency's Cairo office _ the two Britons and
individual passport-holders from Canada, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The eight crew were from Bahrain, Oman, the Philippines, Poland,
India, Egypt and Morocco. One American _ apparently carrying
diplomatic mail _ was also aboard.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. naval ships from the 5th Fleet _ headquartered in Bahrain
as guests of the ever pro-western Emir _ took part in the initial
search with two destroyers based in San Diego and a naval rescue
tug circling the deeper waters off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   All night, U.S. SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters had moved slowly
above the waves, searching with floodlights for survivors. There
were none.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft had been delivered to Gulf Air by Airbus in
September, 1994, and had flown a total of 17,177 hours on 13,848
separate flights in and out of Bahrain. The airline's safety
standards were regarded in the region as reasonable. &QL;

 &HT;    Dolphins fans get chance to honor their hero
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dan Marino stood on the stage, licking his
lips just like he used to before taking a snap with the final
seconds clicking off the clock. Only it was clear that in many
ways, this situation was tougher. He took a deep breath. He put a
hand on his chest. He blinked hard.
</P>
<P>
   The fans cheered louder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' he said, his voice cracking. ``I'll never forget
it in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   His family came to his side. The band played. And so ended a
tribute at Pro Player Stadium that felt like the final night of a
political convention _ thousands gathering for the same cause, some
waving signs, some wearing funny hats, some getting choked up while
watching sentimental videos, all cheering at every drop of a name.
</P>
<P>
   Marino.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the applause didn't crank up every time someone
talked about what the featured speaker would do in the future. It
came whenever any of the warmup acts _ from former coach Don Shula
to the other five quarterbacks in the Class of '83 _ talked about
what Marino did in the past. And what some in the crowd clearly
wished he was still doing.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the final speech, Marino had bounded on to
the stage wearing a short sleeve black shirt, tan pants and
loafers. The fans rose to their feet and gave him an three-minute
ovation. With the Tina Turner song ``Simply the Best'' blaring over
the loudspeakers, Marino blew kisses and mouthed the words ``thank
you'' to the 52,000 people who had snatched up all the $2 tickets
in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the cheering started to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan,'' moderator Tony Segreto began, ``for 17 years . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   The fans interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more year!'' they chanted. ``One more year!''
</P>
<P>
   Marino hadn't been on this field since Dec. 27. That Monday
night _ actually it was 12:18 on Tuesday morning _ he trudged off
the field after a 38-31 loss to the Jets, grass stains smeared
across the No. 13 on the front of his jersey. Before entering the
tunnel, he raised his head for a moment, glanced into the stands,
found his children and waved.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be part of a rough farewell year. There were
the clashes with Jimmy Johnson, the injury that forced him to miss
five games and, finally, the sight of him standing alone on the
sideline in Jacksonville _ a self-imposed benching in what turned
out to be his final NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   He waited two months, seriously considering an offer to play for
the Minnesota Vikings, before calling a news conference to say,
``It's time.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was a sad day, then this was a happy night.
</P>
<P>
   While much of America watched the final episode of ``Survivor,''
the anchor for the CBS affiliate in Miami told everyone in the
stadium how fortunate they were to have other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a night if you don't get a lump in your throat,''
Segreto said, ``you don't have a pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   It was night for jokes, for gushing testimonials, for photos
from childhood, for footage from record-breaking games, for a clip
from ``The Simpsons'' that included Marino's voice, for a $104,000
donation by the Dolphins to Marino's charity, for appearances by
Terry Bradshaw, Don Shula, Mark Clayton, Mark Duper, Don Strock,
Nat Moore and many more.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Marino throwing three more passes _ hard passes _
to former targets Clayton, Duper and O.J. McDuffie.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the cheers. Maybe it was the jeers: for any footage
that included Jimmy Johnson, for the introduction of Jim Kelly, for
any reference to Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   When the fans booed Huizenga, Marino defended the man who helped
orchestrate the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not rush to Kelly's defense when the former Bills
quarterback teased the fans, saying that in Buffalo they used to
refer to the Dolphins' home field as ``Rich Stadium South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boo if you want,'' Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans did _ until Kelly praised them for years of making
it hard to run the no-huddle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the highlight was Hootie and the Blowfish playing ``Only
Wanna Be With You'' _ the 1995 song that led to a video featuring
Marino and other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tribute, Darius Rucker, the band's lead singer
explained that, despite growing up in South Carolina, he had become
a Dolphins fan at age 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived and died with Dan Marino for 17 years,'' he said.
``He's affected my moods. He's affected my relationships. He's
affected everything in my life. And to be here on a day like this,
I could never even begin to tell you what it means to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd apparently could relate.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours before the start of the tribute, cars already lined
up on the roads around the stadium _ including the recently newly
renamed Dan Marino Boulevard. The elaborate production went off
smoothly, despite a few glitches. Joe Namath had ``transportation
problems'' and didn't make it to the stadium in time for his
planned tribute to Marino's Pittsburgh's roots. Instead, the
program moved on to another Pittsburgh quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, now an analyst on Fox's pre-game show, told a few
stories about Marino's youth and gave him a little advice for his
future job with HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, that might have been the highlight. Marino being
himself. After hearing the fans break into the one-more-year chant
again at the end of the night _ ``Believe me,'' he said, ``I would
like to play one more year, but I can't'' _ Marino licked his lips,
regained his composure and made a request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have some fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he led the way, showing a side of himself that his fans
rarely saw. He danced. He sang. He relaxed.

   LOS ANGELES _ It is an odd time to be a dissenter in America.
The economy is booming. No Americans are dying in foreign wars.
Unemployment is down, and so is crime. And yet the dissent is
there, and it is being felt across an extraordinary range of public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, we have seen tens of thousands of
people take the city of Seattle by storm and challenge the
globalization agenda of the World Trade Organization; we have seen
John McCain, the populist Republican senator, launch a spirited
anti-establishment campaign to try to wrest his party's
presidential nomination from George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen the Reform Party, the third force founded eight
years ago by the Texas billionaire Ross Perot, becoming so
exercised about its own critique of the system that it is splitting
into two Reform parties, one libertarian and one far-right
nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have seen a growing disquiet among rank-and-file
Democrats that their party is losing touch with its roots and
becoming little more than a mirror image of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Warren Beatty, an active champion of liberal
causes who was briefly courted to run for president himself this
year: ``What we need is not a third party, but a second party.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their disparate agendas, there is one unifying theme
binding these dissenting voices, and that is a sense of outrage at
the corruption of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, the feeling runs, no longer belongs to the people, but
is being bought by big companies able to use their financial muscle
to determine who runs for office and what they do once they get
there.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a trivial matter to be pushed into a file marked
``Campaign Finance Reform''; the very foundation of America's
democracy is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money for political campaigns is, of course, nothing new
in American politics, but what has changed is the ability of
corporations to infiltrate the system to such an extent that they
can all but own candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
   Direct campaign contributions have been strictly limited ever
since the Watergate scandal, but thanks to a regulatory loophole
there is no cap on so-called ``soft money'' _ indirect payments
once intended to cover incidental office expenses but now most
commonly used to pay for television advertising, the biggest ticket
in any campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 presidential election, the two main parties
received $86 million in soft money contributions. By 1996, that
number had jumped to $260 million and this year it could go as high
as $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, interest groups would identify candidates and
platforms that appealed to them and donate accordingly _ big
business generally backing the Republicans while unions, litigation
lawyers and others generally backed the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, companies have understood that it is much
smarter to back both horses in a race so half of their money ends
up working for them. The number of companies contributing at least
$100,000 to both parties has skyrocketed, from 40 in 1996 to 87
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this infiltration is felt at every level.
Politicians are spending more and more time fund-raising, and much
less acting on behalf of their constituents. The greater their need
to raise funds, the easier it is for contributors to lean on them.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where television advertising rates are among the
highest in the country and political races consequently among the
most expensive, the state insurance commissioner was recently
forced to quit because he had turned a blind eye to gross abuses by
insurance companies who had contributed lavishly to his election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   He had even taken insurance money intended for earthquake
victims and funnelled it into his own campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   Also in California, a recent attempt to set up an independent
commission of inquiry into abuses by guards at state prisons was
voted down by the legislature despite a major scandal involving
staged gladiator fights, organized rape and inmate shootings.
</P>
<P>
   One legislator, when challenged by the attorney general on his
vote, admitted that he was ``whoring'' for the prison guards' union
which had contributed a whopping $28 million to candidates in the
1998 state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such instances are becoming commonplace everywhere. Russ
Feingold, a liberal Democrat senator from Wisconsin who has
co-authored a bill with McCain to ban soft money, calls the system
``legalized bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system of one person one vote,'' he said at the
Democrats' convention last week, ``but a system of one million
dollars, one million votes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The strength of feeling should not be underestimated. The
protest against the WTO, which was about the same kind of corporate
control on a global level, brought 50,000 people on to the streets
of Seattle _ little short of an earthquake in a country utterly
unaccustomed to such spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   If the street protests have since fizzled, it has partly been
through poor planning and partly because of a failure to see the
connection to domestic politics fast enough. But still, a spirit
has been captured; if there is not yet a movement, there is most
certainly a mood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore have felt obliged to refer to campaign
finance reform on the stump; in his convention speech, Gore went
out of his way to denounce corporate influence and even
acknowledged the spirit of Seattle in a reference to ``fair trade,
not just free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   How sincere these undertakings are remains to be seen. When Sen.
Feingold addressed the convention floor last week, most of his
colleagues were away at a big corporate fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore had finished his own fine words, he went straight to a
celebrity-studded concert and raised $5 million. As for Bush, he
has beaten all records, raising more than $90 million to date.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins in November will be sorely tempted to wish the
issue away. The corporate sponsors who paid for the election will
be clamoring for their pound of flesh. Besides, politicians will
have little interest in cutting off the source of their own
bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   But neglect could be perilous. There is a rage brewing in the
country, and it crosses all social and political boundaries. No
politician would want that rage to erupt; the next president will
have to find a way to assuage it. &QL;

NEW WYCLEF JEAN CD IS FEARLESS AND FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE FERMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You want audacious?
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four cuts of ``The Ecleftic _ 2 Sides II A
Book,'' Wyclef Jean has: enraged Columbia Records bigwig Tommy
Mottola for not delivering a new Fugees record; rapped over Kenny
Rogers (yes, that Kenny Rogers) doing a revamped version of ``The
Gambler;'' and performed a moving song about street players and
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the mock Mottola phone call is a put-on. But it does point
the way to the rest of this bracing, sometimes magnificent
reggae/hip-hop/rock CD. Jean, one-third of the multimillion-selling
Fugees, has established himself as one of the most ecleftic
(ecleftic _ get it?) of hip-hop superstars, and he rarely loosens
his grip here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecleftic'' is a shape-changing stew of straight-up hip-hop,
reggae-hop, balladry, old-school '70s funk _ witness the lovely
``Runaway,'' done with help from Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire _ and several
nods to classic rock. And within all that, Jean turns his lyrical
concerns from everyone bugging him about the next Fugees CD
(''Where Fugees At?'') to the joys of marijuana (''Something About
Mary'') to the infamous Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   And it ends with a hip-hop version of _ brace yourself, classic
rockers _ Pink Floyd's ``Wish You Were Here,'' which grows out of
``Bus Search,'' a skit about a redneck searching his band's tour
bus for illegal drugs. Does the ``Here'' cover work? Against all
odds, yes (although the guitar intro could have been better).
</P>
<P>
   And like the hilarious reworking of ``The Gambler'' _ the track
is called ``Kenny Rogers _ Pharoahe Monch Dub Plate,'' it shows
just how fearlessly Jean is traveling. An amazing balancing act,
``Ecleftic'' hits all the targets it aims for, from ``911,'' a soul
duet with Mary J. Blige, to the brisk feminist hip-hop of ``Perfect
Gentleman,'' from the hilarious ``It Doesn't Matter'' (which
features a cameo by wrestler The Rock) to ``Diallo,'' a mournful
reggae-ish cry of sorrow and agony. ``He didn't have no piece
sir/But now he rests in peace sir/In the belly of the beast sir''
Jean sings over and over, and it's as gripping as any number of Bob
Marley's finest moments.
</P>
<P>
   Jean is one of the few high-profile rappers successfully
balancing Marley's tradition of mixing social protest with sweet
love songs even if, occasionally, his hubris gets the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, ``Ecleftic'' is one of the best urban CDs of the
year, an endlessly wide-screen look at the man's personal issues
and those of society at large. That it's sometimes extremely funny
only adds to its appeal.

A COMEDY WITH TEETH, EVEN IF THEY ARE FALSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TODD CAMP 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Richard Dreyfuss' unmistakable nasal voice comes up over the
first reel of this surprisingly charming little comedy, you'll
probably feel flashback pains for ``Stand By Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarities might be coincidental, but probably not. After
all, this is also a story of four friends whose lives were
intertwined as youth. But unlike the naive youngsters of the Rob
Reiner film, the young wiseguys in ``The Crew'' have seen more than
their share of corpses.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't see coming is that after years of putting out
hits and making people offers they couldn't refuse, they'd wind up
a quartet of elderly has-beens knocking about sunny Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss' Bobby Bartellemeo is the brains of the outfit, with
Joey ``Bats'' Pistella (Burt Reynolds) as the hothead, Mike ``The
Brick'' Donatelli (Dan Hedaya) as the feeb and Tony ``Mouth''
Donato (Seymour Cassel) as the strong, silent type.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in a ramshackle hotel that is being renovated and sold off
to a wealthier, younger clientele, the geriatric goombahs concoct a
scheme to keep from losing their turf. They swipe a corpse from the
morgue and fake a Mafia-style hit in the lobby. Trouble is, the
stiff turns out to the long-lost papa of a well-connected local
drug lord, prompting a gangland war that continues to spiral out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss lays on the accent a little thick, but all four of the
Grumpy Old GoodFellas pull off likable performances, especially
Hedaya. Good supporting work comes from Jennifer Tilly as a working
girl who gets wind of their scheme, Jeremy Piven as a detective on
the case, Lainie Kazan as Tilly's restaurant maven stepmom and
Miguel Sandoval as the terminally confused drug lord. It's a comedy
with some teeth, even if they are false.

VIOLENCE AMONG PROTESTANT MILITIAS CLAIMS THIRD VICTIM THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A Belfast man gunned down late Wednesday was the third
victim this week of a feud among Protestant paramilitary groups
that has brought British troops back onto the streets of Northern
Ireland, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The police, who said they arrested six men after the killing and
seized guns and ammunition, identified the newest victim as Samuel
Rocket, 22. He was shot by masked men who burst into the living
room of his home in full view of his partner and a 12-month-old
baby and opened fire ``several times at close range,'' a police
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing happened hours before the coffin of Bobby Mahood,
48, one of two men killed earlier this week, was carried aloft
through Belfast's Shankill Road area, a Protestant stronghold,
followed by sobbing relatives and hundreds of others. The deaths
stem from rivalries between the Ulster Volunteer Force, with which
police said Rocket's family was associated, and two other allied
groups, the Ulster Defense Association and the Ulster Freedom
Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Police blamed the killings of Mahood and a second man, Jackie
Coulter, on the Ulster Volunteer Force. Coulter's funeral is set
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the loyalist groups are all part of the Protestant
movement that wants Northern Ireland to remain a part of Britain,
there is a widespread perception that the rivalries are fueled by a
battle for Belfast's illicit drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less and less does it have anything to do with political
considerations,'' said Ken Maginnis, a spokesman for the dominant
Protestant group, the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   The latest killing came despite efforts by the British
authorities to clamp down on paramilitary leaders. British troops
were ordered onto the streets late on Monday after a weekend of
violence culminated in the killings of Mahood and Coulter. On
Tuesday, British officials ordered the re-arrest of Johnny Adair, a
paramilitary leader linked to the Ulster Defense Association, who
had been released in September 1999 under a form of parole set out
by the province's peace agreement. The agreement permits the
authorities to re-arrest people they regard as instigators of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Adair served five-and-a-half years of a 16-year term on
terrorism charges. His supporters said Thursday that he planned to
appeal his new arrest.
</P>
<P>
   British officials have said they do not regard this week's
bloodshed as signifying the breakdown of the cease-fire
underpinning the 1998 peace agreement. But politicians on both
sides of the sectarian divide said Thursday that rising levels of
violence could jeopardize the fragile broader peace between
Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The history of the North is that when these dynamics are
unleashed within loyalism, the Catholic community end up carrying
the brunt of it,'' said Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein,
the political voice of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   And Chris McGimpsey, an Ulster Unionist leader, said, ``This
could completely destabilize the whole peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders also said they were concerned that the
violence could spiral further as the rival militias seek reprisals.
``Once these funerals are over I would be fearful that there would
be more attempts to equalize'' the tally of killings, said Maginnis
of the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has put pressure on the British authorities to calm
the situation, but some Protestants said the killings have a
momentum of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was an attack coming from outside, the Shankill
community could respond to it,'' said a Shankill pastor, Jack
McKee. ``But the fact that it is internal is like the community is
imploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians with links to both paramilitaries said there were no
signs of readiness for mediation on either side.

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a dark night of the soul when Joan Maricle logged on and
typed ``therapy'' into a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was depressed. I felt like my entire life was upside down,''
said Maricle, a 48-year-old paralegal from Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She narrowed down her prospects to counselors who had posted
photos of themselves. Then she used her gut to e-mail a handful of
those. Peter Chechele_a California-licensed marriage and family
therapist_answered first.
</P>
<P>
   Maricle liked him right away. She ``saw'' him mostly by e-mail
with a few chat and phone sessions through May, a total of 10
months. They never met.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, Maricle and Chechele are either
intrepid pioneers or foolhardy wanderers. While most everything is
offered online with a yawn these days_sperm donors, mail-order
brides, even caskets_virtual therapy is still considered
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of people with diagnosable mental health
problems don't seek treatment, according to a 1999 report of the
U.S. surgeon general. A third of those who do manage to make a
first-time appointment fail to keep it, says the American
Psychological Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy, proponents argue, knocks down many of the barriers
that keep people out of therapists' offices: embarrassment,
inertia, cost.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics say there's no way to control the quality of care
on the Internet. It's experimental, and it's impossible to
regulate. Even when it's performed by knowledgeable, experienced
and ethical professionals, there is no research on whether or how
therapy by text, rather than face to face, works, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more therapists and ``virtual clinics,'' where a credit card
gets you instant advice, are flooding online every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major objection to cybertherapy in the past has been the
lack of visual cues,'' Chechele said. These include how a client
dresses or sits_things that can tip therapists off to depression,
anxiety and lies. But Chechele, who has been practicing through his
Web site, www.cybertherapy.com, since 1997, finds ``that there's
something special about lack of visual cues. E-mail therapies allow
some people to be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricle, for instance, found it easier to write e-mails at her
own pace rather than making and keeping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful to give him a scenario when it was going
on at the time I was feeling it,'' she said. ``I didn't have to
wait until my 3 o'clock appointment on Thursday. I could go ahead
and write it right then.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lower cost helped her keep her mind on why she was in
therapy, instead of on the money she was spending to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started therapy again, I was looking at $75 to $150 per
hour. I couldn't afford it,'' Maricle said. ``It's hard to
concentrate when all you can think is, `How am I going to pay for
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Chechele's charges are fairly standard: For $150 a month he'll
answer an unlimited number of e-mails. For $1.60 per minute, he'll
do chat or telephone sessions with a 45-minute minimum. By way of
comparison, his 50-minute in-office visit runs $85.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some mental health professionals have deep reservations
about what Chechele and others are doing. They say e-therapy poses
troubling ethical and legal dilemmas and may even be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for many consumers it's not dangerous, but for some it
could be,'' said Thomas Nagy, a licensed psychologist, Stanford
University professor and author of two books on ethics who helped
formulate the APA's code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes into your office every week and seems to be
becoming more panicky and dissociative,'' or starts talking about
suicide, it's possible to refer the patient for medication or, in
extreme cases, to hospitalize him or her involuntarily, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   And some serious disorders, such as borderline personality
disorder, aren't always readily apparent. Even when a therapist is
seeing someone face to face, it may take several meetings to reach
such a diagnosis, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with someone who's 1,000 miles away or in
another country, you really can't do this stuff,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Online practitioners agree that e-therapy can't replace
traditional methods, so it's not for everyone. Most say they don't
take suicidal and seriously mentally ill patients. However,
Chechele admitted that no matter how carefully he screens them, his
online patients do from time to time become suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does for them what he would a local patient: makes
himself more available, makes contracts in which they promise not
to harm themselves or others, encourages them to tap their support
network and find local resources. Finally, if he feels a case is
outside his competence, he refers the patient to another mental
health professional.
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality is another ethical concern. Skeptics worry that
e-mails or chat sessions, which are not usually scrambled, could be
intercepted and read, especially at work where such monitoring has
become routine. Chechele offers his patients a scrambling service
that costs $1 per month but finds that few use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously my neck's out there, way out there,'' Chechele said.
``I try to practice by the same mandates as I would in my office.
Legal and ethical issues, I try to uphold those as best I can in
this new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some cybertherapists say what they are doing isn't therapy.
Instead, they call their practices ``counseling'' or ``coaching,''
in hopes of dodging state licensing laws. Some also post
disclaimers.
</P>
<P>
   But psychotherapy by any other name is still the same, warns
Marlene Maheu, director of the Telemedicine Training Program at the
California School of Professional Psychology in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Maheu and co-author Barry Gordon report in an article to be
published in October in the APA journal Professional Psychologist
Research and Practice that some 10 percent of 42 U.S. online
therapists who took part in a 1998 survey said they were not
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that a majority of online therapists
described their services ``in terms other than providing
psychotherapy,'' said Gordon, a clinical consulting psychologist in
Petaluma, Calif. But when they were asked to list what kind of
diagnoses were being made, most were fairly serious.
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, very few complaints about online providers have been
made with state attorneys general and none has resulted in
convictions or enforcement actions, said Gerry Koocher, an
associate professor at Harvard University's Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 42 state attorneys general due to be published in
the APA journal in October, Koocher found only seven states have
received complaints against therapists using electronic means to
carry out counseling. The only conviction involved telephone
counseling, not the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``duty to warn,'' Maheu said. Every state has
different standards for what therapists are legally obligated to
tell the authorities. Most states require that child and elder
abuse be reported, but beyond that, standards vary. In California,
for instance, therapists must tell the police when a client
threatens any third party. The Florida Supreme Court has ruled the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm dealing with someone from another state, am I still
obligated to report? If I'm obligated to report, is my obligation
to report in my own state_which doesn't care, 'cause the other
person isn't there_or do I call that other state where they're at?
And do I know where they are?'' Koocher asked.
</P>
<P>
   If an online therapist is sued for malpractice, it's unclear if
professional liability insurers will pay up. ``Professional
liability policies usually exclude coverage for illegal acts
committed by the practitioner. To the extent that an insured
practitioner is involved in unlawful practice under some state's
law, coverage under their professional liability policy may be
denied,'' Koocher writes in his upcoming journal article.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some say the only way to address legal problems is to license
therapists nationally. That's not likely, said George J. Alexander,
professor of law at Santa Clara University and an expert in
telemedicine law.
</P>
<P>
   State licensing laws spring from the constitutional right states
enjoy to make laws protecting their own citizens. To solve the
problem of e-therapy crossing state lines, states have begun
issuing special ``telemedicine licenses,'' but Alexander said
that's not much better. Therapists would still need to be licensed
in every state where they practice, and keep track of each state's
applicable laws.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that, given the worldwide reach of the Internet, even
federal licensure would be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible jurisdictional nightmare. The first time
you try to control it, you'll have someone in Pakistan pop up and
say, `I can help you out there in Southern California,''' said
Storm King, past president of the Internet Society for Mental
Health Online and a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at
the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology in Palo Alto, Calif. King
would rather see international, self-regulating organizations set
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the legal tangle is keeping some of the best
therapists off the Internet. ``The problem is that even though
there is virtually no enforcement, it scares a lot of ethical,
thoughtful people from doing (online therapy). It doesn't scare the
charlatans,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there's little research on cybertherapy. That
means practitioners don't know what's effective, nor do they have
widely recognized standards of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious circle,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   But even professionals with deep concerns about delivering
mental health services through the Internet don't think that it
shouldn't be done. Most would simply rather see therapists take a
more cautious and incremental approach.
</P>

   It was a dark night of the soul when Joan Maricle logged on and
typed ``therapy'' into a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was depressed. I felt like my entire life was upside down,''
said Maricle, a 48-year-old paralegal from Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She narrowed down her prospects to counselors who had posted
photos of themselves. Then she used her gut to e-mail a handful of
those. Peter Chechele_a California-licensed marriage and family
therapist_answered first.
</P>
<P>
   Maricle liked him right away. She ``saw'' him mostly by e-mail
with a few chat and phone sessions through May, a total of 10
months. They never met.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, Maricle and Chechele are either
intrepid pioneers or foolhardy wanderers. While most everything is
offered online with a yawn these days_sperm donors, mail-order
brides, even caskets_virtual therapy is still considered
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of people with diagnosable mental health
problems don't seek treatment, according to a 1999 report of the
U.S. surgeon general. A third of those who do manage to make a
first-time appointment fail to keep it, says the American
Psychological Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy, proponents argue, knocks down many of the barriers
that keep people out of therapists' offices: embarrassment,
inertia, cost.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics say there's no way to control the quality of care
on the Internet. It's experimental, and it's impossible to
regulate. Even when it's performed by knowledgeable, experienced
and ethical professionals, there is no research on whether or how
therapy by text, rather than face to face, works, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more therapists and ``virtual clinics,'' where a credit card
gets you instant advice, are flooding online every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major objection to cybertherapy in the past has been the
lack of visual cues,'' Chechele said. These include how a client
dresses or sits_things that can tip therapists off to depression,
anxiety and lies. But Chechele, who has been practicing through his
Web site, www.cybertherapy.com, since 1997, finds ``that there's
something special about lack of visual cues. E-mail therapies allow
some people to be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricle, for instance, found it easier to write e-mails at her
own pace rather than making and keeping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful to give him a scenario when it was going
on at the time I was feeling it,'' she said. ``I didn't have to
wait until my 3 o'clock appointment on Thursday. I could go ahead
and write it right then.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lower cost helped her keep her mind on why she was in
therapy, instead of on the money she was spending to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started therapy again, I was looking at $75 to $150 per
hour. I couldn't afford it,'' Maricle said. ``It's hard to
concentrate when all you can think is, `How am I going to pay for
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Chechele's charges are fairly standard: For $150 a month he'll
answer an unlimited number of e-mails. For $1.60 per minute, he'll
do chat or telephone sessions with a 45-minute minimum. By way of
comparison, his 50-minute in-office visit runs $85.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some mental health professionals have deep reservations
about what Chechele and others are doing. They say e-therapy poses
troubling ethical and legal dilemmas and may even be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for many consumers it's not dangerous, but for some it
could be,'' said Thomas Nagy, a licensed psychologist, Stanford
University professor and author of two books on ethics who helped
formulate the APA's code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes into your office every week and seems to be
becoming more panicky and dissociative,'' or starts talking about
suicide, it's possible to refer the patient for medication or, in
extreme cases, to hospitalize him or her involuntarily, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   And some serious disorders, such as borderline personality
disorder, aren't always readily apparent. Even when a therapist is
seeing someone face to face, it may take several meetings to reach
such a diagnosis, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with someone who's 1,000 miles away or in
another country, you really can't do this stuff,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Online practitioners agree that e-therapy can't replace
traditional methods, so it's not for everyone. Most say they don't
take suicidal and seriously mentally ill patients. However,
Chechele admitted that no matter how carefully he screens them, his
online patients do from time to time become suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does for them what he would a local patient: makes
himself more available, makes contracts in which they promise not
to harm themselves or others, encourages them to tap their support
network and find local resources. Finally, if he feels a case is
outside his competence, he refers the patient to another mental
health professional.
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality is another ethical concern. Skeptics worry that
e-mails or chat sessions, which are not usually scrambled, could be
intercepted and read, especially at work where such monitoring has
become routine. Chechele offers his patients a scrambling service
that costs $1 per month but finds that few use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously my neck's out there, way out there,'' Chechele said.
``I try to practice by the same mandates as I would in my office.
Legal and ethical issues, I try to uphold those as best I can in
this new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some cybertherapists say what they are doing isn't therapy.
Instead, they call their practices ``counseling'' or ``coaching,''
in hopes of dodging state licensing laws. Some also post
disclaimers.
</P>
<P>
   But psychotherapy by any other name is still the same, warns
Marlene Maheu, director of the Telemedicine Training Program at the
California School of Professional Psychology in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Maheu and co-author Barry Gordon report in an article to be
published in October in the APA journal Professional Psychologist
Research and Practice that some 10 percent of 42 U.S. online
therapists who took part in a 1998 survey said they were not
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that a majority of online therapists
described their services ``in terms other than providing
psychotherapy,'' said Gordon, a clinical consulting psychologist in
Petaluma, Calif. But when they were asked to list what kind of
diagnoses were being made, most were fairly serious.
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, very few complaints about online providers have been
made with state attorneys general and none has resulted in
convictions or enforcement actions, said Gerry Koocher, an
associate professor at Harvard University's Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 42 state attorneys general due to be published in
the APA journal in October, Koocher found only seven states have
received complaints against therapists using electronic means to
carry out counseling. The only conviction involved telephone
counseling, not the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``duty to warn,'' Maheu said. Every state has
different standards for what therapists are legally obligated to
tell the authorities. Most states require that child and elder
abuse be reported, but beyond that, standards vary. In California,
for instance, therapists must tell the police when a client
threatens any third party. The Florida Supreme Court has ruled the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm dealing with someone from another state, am I still
obligated to report? If I'm obligated to report, is my obligation
to report in my own state_which doesn't care, 'cause the other
person isn't there_or do I call that other state where they're at?
And do I know where they are?'' Koocher asked.
</P>
<P>
   If an online therapist is sued for malpractice, it's unclear if
professional liability insurers will pay up. ``Professional
liability policies usually exclude coverage for illegal acts
committed by the practitioner. To the extent that an insured
practitioner is involved in unlawful practice under some state's
law, coverage under their professional liability policy may be
denied,'' Koocher writes in his upcoming journal article.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some say the only way to address legal problems is to license
therapists nationally. That's not likely, said George J. Alexander,
professor of law at Santa Clara University and an expert in
telemedicine law.
</P>
<P>
   State licensing laws spring from the constitutional right states
enjoy to make laws protecting their own citizens. To solve the
problem of e-therapy crossing state lines, states have begun
issuing special ``telemedicine licenses,'' but Alexander said
that's not much better. Therapists would still need to be licensed
in every state where they practice, and keep track of each state's
applicable laws.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that, given the worldwide reach of the Internet, even
federal licensure would be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible jurisdictional nightmare. The first time
you try to control it, you'll have someone in Pakistan pop up and
say, `I can help you out there in Southern California,''' said
Storm King, past president of the Internet Society for Mental
Health Online and a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at
the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology in Palo Alto, Calif. King
would rather see international, self-regulating organizations set
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the legal tangle is keeping some of the best
therapists off the Internet. ``The problem is that even though
there is virtually no enforcement, it scares a lot of ethical,
thoughtful people from doing (online therapy). It doesn't scare the
charlatans,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there's little research on cybertherapy. That
means practitioners don't know what's effective, nor do they have
widely recognized standards of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious circle,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   But even professionals with deep concerns about delivering
mental health services through the Internet don't think that it
shouldn't be done. Most would simply rather see therapists take a
more cautious and incremental approach.
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. After years of chafing under the
restrictions of managed care, some practitioners see cybertherapy
as a way to access a wider pool of patients paying cash. Others

therapy as many companies think they are.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 60 million adults, some 68 percent of all American
Internet users, looked for health information on the Web, a January
Harris Poll found. Some 40 percent of those researched mental
health care topics.
</P>
<P>
   In its own December poll, the APA found the same high level of
interest in mental health information_for which about 66 percent
were willing to go online. However, only about 23 percent of
respondents said they would consider engaging in an online dialogue
with a mental health professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that says the public is not yet willing to jump up on
this thing with both feet,'' said Newman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a dark night of the soul when Joan Maricle logged on and
typed ``therapy'' into a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was depressed. I felt like my entire life was upside down,''
said Maricle, a 48-year-old paralegal from Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She narrowed down her prospects to counselors who had posted
photos of themselves. Then she used her gut to e-mail a handful of
those. Peter Chechele_a California-licensed marriage and family
therapist_answered first.
</P>
<P>
   Maricle liked him right away. She ``saw'' him mostly by e-mail
with a few chat and phone sessions through May, a total of 10
months. They never met.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, Maricle and Chechele are either
intrepid pioneers or foolhardy wanderers. While most everything is
offered online with a yawn these days_sperm donors, mail-order
brides, even caskets_virtual therapy is still considered
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of people with diagnosable mental health
problems don't seek treatment, according to a 1999 report of the
U.S. surgeon general. A third of those who do manage to make a
first-time appointment fail to keep it, says the American
Psychological Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy, proponents argue, knocks down many of the barriers
that keep people out of therapists' offices: embarrassment,
inertia, cost.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics say there's no way to control the quality of care
on the Internet. It's experimental, and it's impossible to
regulate. Even when it's performed by knowledgeable, experienced
and ethical professionals, there is no research on whether or how
therapy by text, rather than face to face, works, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more therapists and ``virtual clinics,'' where a credit card
gets you instant advice, are flooding online every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major objection to cybertherapy in the past has been the
lack of visual cues,'' Chechele said. These include how a client
dresses or sits_things that can tip therapists off to depression,
anxiety and lies. But Chechele, who has been practicing through his
Web site, www.cybertherapy.com, since 1997, finds ``that there's
something special about lack of visual cues. E-mail therapies allow
some people to be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricle, for instance, found it easier to write e-mails at her
own pace rather than making and keeping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just wonderful to give him a scenario when it was going
on at the time I was feeling it,'' she said. ``I didn't have to
wait until my 3 o'clock appointment on Thursday. I could go ahead
and write it right then.''
</P>
<P>
   And the lower cost helped her keep her mind on why she was in
therapy, instead of on the money she was spending to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started therapy again, I was looking at $75 to $150 per
hour. I couldn't afford it,'' Maricle said. ``It's hard to
concentrate when all you can think is, `How am I going to pay for
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Chechele's charges are fairly standard: For $150 a month he'll
answer an unlimited number of e-mails. For $1.60 per minute, he'll
do chat or telephone sessions with a 45-minute minimum. By way of
comparison, his 50-minute in-office visit runs $85.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some mental health professionals have deep reservations
about what Chechele and others are doing. They say e-therapy poses
troubling ethical and legal dilemmas and may even be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for many consumers it's not dangerous, but for some it
could be,'' said Thomas Nagy, a licensed psychologist, Stanford
University professor and author of two books on ethics who helped
formulate the APA's code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes into your office every week and seems to be
becoming more panicky and dissociative,'' or starts talking about
suicide, it's possible to refer the patient for medication or, in
extreme cases, to hospitalize him or her involuntarily, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   And some serious disorders, such as borderline personality
disorder, aren't always readily apparent. Even when a therapist is
seeing someone face to face, it may take several meetings to reach
such a diagnosis, Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with someone who's 1,000 miles away or in
another country, you really can't do this stuff,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Online practitioners agree that e-therapy can't replace
traditional methods, so it's not for everyone. Most say they don't
take suicidal and seriously mentally ill patients. However,
Chechele admitted that no matter how carefully he screens them, his
online patients do from time to time become suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does for them what he would a local patient: makes
himself more available, makes contracts in which they promise not
to harm themselves or others, encourages them to tap their support
network and find local resources. Finally, if he feels a case is
outside his competence, he refers the patient to another mental
health professional.
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality is another ethical concern. Skeptics worry that
e-mails or chat sessions, which are not usually scrambled, could be
intercepted and read, especially at work where such monitoring has
become routine. Chechele offers his patients a scrambling service
that costs $1 per month but finds that few use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously my neck's out there, way out there,'' Chechele said.
``I try to practice by the same mandates as I would in my office.
Legal and ethical issues, I try to uphold those as best I can in
this new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some cybertherapists say what they are doing isn't therapy.
Instead, they call their practices ``counseling'' or ``coaching,''
in hopes of dodging state licensing laws. Some also post
disclaimers.
</P>
<P>
   But psychotherapy by any other name is still the same, warns
Marlene Maheu, director of the Telemedicine Training Program at the
California School of Professional Psychology in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Maheu and co-author Barry Gordon report in an article to be
published in October in the APA journal Professional Psychologist
Research and Practice that some 10 percent of 42 U.S. online
therapists who took part in a 1998 survey said they were not
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that a majority of online therapists
described their services ``in terms other than providing
psychotherapy,'' said Gordon, a clinical consulting psychologist in
Petaluma, Calif. But when they were asked to list what kind of
diagnoses were being made, most were fairly serious.
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, very few complaints about online providers have been
made with state attorneys general and none has resulted in
convictions or enforcement actions, said Gerry Koocher, an
associate professor at Harvard University's Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 42 state attorneys general due to be published in
the APA journal in October, Koocher found only seven states have
received complaints against therapists using electronic means to
carry out counseling. The only conviction involved telephone
counseling, not the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``duty to warn,'' Maheu said. Every state has
different standards for what therapists are legally obligated to
tell the authorities. Most states require that child and elder
abuse be reported, but beyond that, standards vary. In California,
for instance, therapists must tell the police when a client
threatens any third party. The Florida Supreme Court has ruled the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm dealing with someone from another state, am I still
obligated to report? If I'm obligated to report, is my obligation
to report in my own state_which doesn't care, 'cause the other
person isn't there_or do I call that other state where they're at?
And do I know where they are?'' Koocher asked.
</P>
<P>
   If an online therapist is sued for malpractice, it's unclear if
professional liability insurers will pay up. ``Professional
liability policies usually exclude coverage for illegal acts
committed by the practitioner. To the extent that an insured
practitioner is involved in unlawful practice under some state's
law, coverage under their professional liability policy may be
denied,'' Koocher writes in his upcoming journal article.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Some say the only way to address legal problems is to license
therapists nationally. That's not likely, said George J. Alexander,
professor of law at Santa Clara University and an expert in
telemedicine law.
</P>
<P>
   State licensing laws spring from the constitutional right states
enjoy to make laws protecting their own citizens. To solve the
problem of e-therapy crossing state lines, states have begun
issuing special ``telemedicine licenses,'' but Alexander said
that's not much better. Therapists would still need to be licensed
in every state where they practice, and keep track of each state's
applicable laws.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that, given the worldwide reach of the Internet, even
federal licensure would be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible jurisdictional nightmare. The first time
you try to control it, you'll have someone in Pakistan pop up and
say, `I can help you out there in Southern California,''' said
Storm King, past president of the Internet Society for Mental
Health Online and a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at
the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology in Palo Alto, Calif. King
would rather see international, self-regulating organizations set
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the legal tangle is keeping some of the best
therapists off the Internet. ``The problem is that even though
there is virtually no enforcement, it scares a lot of ethical,
thoughtful people from doing (online therapy). It doesn't scare the
charlatans,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there's little research on cybertherapy. That
means practitioners don't know what's effective, nor do they have
widely recognized standards of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious circle,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   But even professionals with deep concerns about delivering
mental health services through the Internet don't think that it
shouldn't be done. Most would simply rather see therapists take a
more cautious and incremental approach.
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. After years of chafing under the
restrictions of managed care, some practitioners see cybertherapy
as a way to access a wider pool of patients paying cash. Others
fear that the Internet will become just another cost-savings
vehicle for HMOs as online clinics like Lifescape.com and
myTHERAPYnet.com proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the larger online therapy companies
getting started out there, the people who are helping them out and
putting the most venture capital into them are the managed care
companies,'' said David Nickelson, director of technology policy
for the APA. ``I can't imagine that the value system that comes
with some of managed care isn't going to be infused into those.''
</P>
<P>
   His fear? Picture answering 25 questions on your HMO's Web site
before you can be authorized to see someone online. ``If it's
really bad, maybe you'll get an in-person session, but they cost
more and the overhead is much higher than hooking you up online.''
</P>
<P>
   One saving grace, said Russ Newman, the APA's executive
director, is that people may not yet be as interested in online
therapy as many companies think they are.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 60 million adults, some 68 percent of all American

 &HT;    (Includes a color slide and black-and-white photo of John C.
McGinley in ``Dean Koontz's Sole Survivor'')
 By IAN SPELLING 
 c.2000 Ian Spelling 
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.) &QC;
<P>
   John C. McGinley sent chills up the spines of viewers as serial
killer Edgler Vess in the top-rated 1997 miniseries version of
``Intensity.'' And on Sept. 13 and 14, McGinley elicits sick laughs
in ``Dean Koontz's Sole Survivor,'' a Fox thriller with a sci-fi
twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do `Intensity,' I had to go and visit whatever demons I
could possibly dredge up,'' McGinley, 41, says by telephone from
his home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''`Sole Survivor' is more of me doing Alan Rickman (from `Die
Hard') or John Malkovich (from `In the Line of Fire') type
things,'' he says. ``I get to put some air underneath the role and
prance a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My character isn't even in the book. As developed in the
teleplay by Richard Christian Matheson, son of sci-fi writing
legend Richard Matheson, he's an amalgamation of three different
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the set, they said, `Dude, you can do what you
want and go wherever you want,''' he laughed, adding, ``When you
give me that kind of license, just call `Action' and get out of my
eye line!''
</P>
<P>
   McGinley co-stars in ``Sole Survivor'' as Victor Yates, a
merciless guy whose task it is to kill Rose Tucker (Gloria Reuben),
who just may be the only survivor of a recent plane crash. That
crash claimed the wife and daughter of Joe Carpenter (Billy Zane),
an former crime reporter out to speak with Tucker and unravel the
true cause of the deadly incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is really Dean's exploring some supernatural, sci-fi
and spirituality issues,'' says McGinley, whose 50-plus credits
include ``Platoon' (1986), ``Highlander 2: The Quickening'' (1991),
``Seven'' (1995) and ``Any Given Sunday'' (1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the scenes, between the lines, if you care to see it,
Dean is doing some spiritual wrestling with what this 'life' all
adds up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit about miracles, a little bit about screwing
around with nature. Dean usually writes about arbitrary killing and
death, and here he took a beat and said, `I want to explore
something different.' And Fox said, `We'll do it with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The actor says he and Koontz spoke a couple of times by
telephone, but adds that the author did not visit the ``Sole
Survivor'' set in Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   McGinley describes protagonist Yates as a purely black-hat
villain. ``He comes on the scene when there's a problem and handles
it, whatever `it' is, almost always with a smirk and a cruel, witty
line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if he removes the trash,'' the actor says. ``Tennessee
Williams wrote a play called `Camino Royale,' and there were
characters in it referred to as the street sweepers. Anytime
something goes wrong or there's a dead body somewhere, the street
sweepers come and just take it away like so much other trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy is of the same ilk. `OK, Billy Zane needs to be
eliminated? Let's go. No big deal.' Billy just happens to crash
into an intersection, but it's my intersection and now he's got to
be disposed of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this guy Yates. I think he's hysterical. He's having a
great time at everybody else's expense, and that's exactly how I
played him.''
</P>
<P>
   While shooting ``Sole Survivor,'' McGinley made time to join
Mickey Rourke to play the villains in Sylvester Stallone's next
feature, a remake of ``Get Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also due soon in ``Highway,'' a drama about a dope dealer
who, on the weekend of Kurt Cobain's suicide, hitches a ride to
Seattle with two vigil-bound young men; and ``Summer Catch,'' a
baseball movie starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jessica Biel.
</P>
<P>
   McGinley doesn't know what's on tap after ``Catch.'' Given his
bravura performances in both ``Intensity'' and ``Sole Survivor,''
it seems likely that Koontz won't be able to conjure up future
villains without McGinley's mug rattling around in his head, thus
ensuring McGinley at least a few future gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if I get invited to another Dean Koontz dance once every
two or three years, it would take care of a lot of problems,'' he
says. ``I'll do anything to stay in the fraternity. It's pretty
sweet.''

 By BILL WALSH  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans have controlled Congress for the past
five years, but Capitol Hill business lobbyist Bill Morley can only
think of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Tort reform, tax cuts, measures to ease environmental
restrictions on business _ all have been blocked by congressional
Democrats or vetoed outright by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   However, Morley is suddenly salivating at the prospect of a
Republican clean sweep in November. Should Texas Gov. George W.
Bush win and the GOP keep its majority in Congress, it would be the
first time in nearly 50 years that the Republicans have controlled
both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of legislation that doesn't even come up
because you know it will be vetoed and you don't have the votes to
override,'' said Morley, who lobbies for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. ``You would be looking at a whole different situation
with George Bush in the White House. We would be looking for some
real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say that the type of radical dismantling of
government programs envisioned by the 1994 Republican revolution is
unlikely, but they agree that a GOP sweep in November would yield a
more prolific legislative output than any other election scenario.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, at least. Invariably, they say, single-party
domination is hampered by internal squabbling that can effectively
stall legislation on its own. The factions within the Republican
Party that have kept quiet during the 2000 campaign would likely
resurface, the experts predict, if the GOP won big in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would get more through with a clean sweep, there's no
doubt about it,'' said David Mayhew, a Yale University political
scientist whose book ``Divided We Govern'' argues that between 1946
and 1990 divided governments were as productive as unified ones.
``But give it three to four months and you would be hearing about
friction between Bush and (House Republican leader) Tom DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential contest is too close to call, members of
both parties say a Democratic sweep is unlikely. Political
oddsmakers give Democrats an outside chance of winning back the
House from Republicans, but not the Senate. A Republican sweep, by
contrast, is seen as a distinct possibility, although no one is
predicting that the party will significantly pad its majority in
either chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Bush victory would clear a roadblock that has stalled
many a Republican initiative: the presidential veto. This year
Clinton has vetoed the so-called marriage penalty tax that had won
approval from the Republican-dominated Congress, and he has
threatened to veto the estate tax repeal bill that landed on his
desk Thursday. Those two items would likely be signed into law by
Bush, experts say. Clinton also has vetoed a ban on partial-birth
abortions, a bill Bush said he would sign as soon as it hit his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Bush administration, experts also would expect
significant increases in military spending and speedier deployment
of a national missile defense system, a program the Clinton
administration has balked at.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the veto, the most powerful tool Democrats would
wield during an era of Republican control would be the Senate
filibuster. They could tie up the chamber with endless speeches
until the Republican leadership met their demands.
</P>
<P>
   To shut off a Senate filibuster, the Republicans would need 60
votes, which has proven difficult even with the five-seat majority
the party has enjoyed for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could skirt the Democratic talk-fest by using
what's known as the reconciliation process _ essentially cloaking
their proposals as budget bills, a legislative vehicle not subject
to filibuster. Some believe reconciliation is a route Bush could
use to pass legislation letting retirees invest a portion of their
Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under reconciliation, Social Security reform is very doable,''
said Daniel Palazzola, a political scientist at the University of
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists see a Republican sweep as the worst of all
possible election outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club, predicted
that Bush would allow increased timber cutting on federal lands and
would roll back Clinton's conservation efforts. He speculated that
Bush would leave in place Republican-backed amendments, known as
riders, designed to chip away at environmental regulations. The
threat of a Clinton veto last year effectively derailed riders that
would have allowed oil companies to escape certain royalty
payments, undermined science-based management of the national
forests and weakened new regulations governing mining operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you combine George W. Bush with the current Republican
leadership on Capitol Hill, it will be an environmental disaster,''
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the impact of single-party domination depends on the
size of that party's majority in Congress. Currently, the
Republicans have a 13-seat majority in the House, a paper-thin
margin that is not expected to grow significantly, even with a GOP
sweep. It has forced Republican leaders to reach out to Democrats
to get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   A group that would suddenly rise in prominence under a
Republican presidency, experts predict, is a coalition of moderate
Democrats known as Blue Dogs. Some experts said that especially if
Democrats were to regain the House, the Blue Dogs would be
vigorously courted by a Republican president to help get
legislation over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Dogs would be an important swing group,'' said insurance
industry lobbyist Robert Rusbouldt. ``They have been reluctant to
take on a Democratic president. But you may see them forge certain
alliances to get things passed under a Republican administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excitement in the Republican ranks about a possible
election sweep _ the first for the party since Dwight Eisenhower's
election in 1952 _ presidential scholars say that party domination
in Washington is no guarantee of legislative productivity.
</P>
<P>
   They point to Jimmy Carter's four years in the White House as
among the least active of any modern administration, even though
Democrats controlled Congress for the entire period from 1976 to
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at odds with Congress the whole time there,'' said J.
Bennett Johnston, a Democrat and former Louisiana senator who
served during Carter's term.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is seen as more conciliatory than Carter _ or, for
that matter, Democratic candidate Al Gore _ experts predict he
would have his own intraparty problems to deal with. He has already
parted ways with the Christian conservative wing of the party over
the strongly pro-life abortion plank in the party platform, and
that rift is expected to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have control, that's when the splits start to come
out,'' Johnston said. ``It's not easy being president with your own
party in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, presidents who have been paired with opposing
Congresses have, at times, posted prodigious legislative records.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable was Ronald Reagan's last two years as president
from 1986 to 1988. Although a lame duck, Reagan and a
Democratic-controlled Congress produced more major legislation --
including welfare and trade reform bills, a two-year budget
agreement and Medicare changes _ than at any other time of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictions were that nothing would get passed,'' said
Charles O. Jones, author of ``The Presidency in a Separated
System.'' ``Reagan wanted a legacy and the Democrats hoped to
regain the White House in 1988. It was all compromise legislation,
but a lot of it got through.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones sees a legislative stalemate if Gore gets elected and the
Republicans hold onto Congress. Other experts predict Gore would at
least have a honeymoon period during which he could push through
some of his top priorities, such as prescription drug coverage for
senior citizens and a patient's bill of rights. His own targeted
tax-cut proposals also would be expected to pass muster in a
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said that during eight years as vice president, Gore
has often played the role of attack dog for the Clinton
administration and developed a reputation for extreme partisanship.
Jones said it will be difficult for a Republican Congress to forget
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been quite partisan and that's the way the Republicans
on the Hill look at him,'' Jones said. ``If it's a Republican
Congress and a Democratic president, I see that as very tough for
getting much done. It could be a continuation of what we've been
seeing in the past couple of years.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans have controlled Congress for the past
five years, but Capitol Hill business lobbyist Bill Morley can only
think of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Tort reform, tax cuts, measures to ease environmental
restrictions on business _ all have been blocked by congressional
Democrats or vetoed outright by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   However, Morley is suddenly salivating at the prospect of a
Republican clean sweep in November. Should Texas Gov. George W.
Bush win and the GOP keep its majority in Congress, it would be the
first time in nearly 50 years that the Republicans have controlled
both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of legislation that doesn't even come up
because you know it will be vetoed and you don't have the votes to
override,'' said Morley, who lobbies for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. ``You would be looking at a whole different situation
with George Bush in the White House. We would be looking for some
real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say that the type of radical dismantling of
government programs envisioned by the 1994 Republican revolution is
unlikely, but they agree that a GOP sweep in November would yield a
more prolific legislative output than any other election scenario.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, at least. Invariably, they say, single-party
domination is hampered by internal squabbling that can effectively
stall legislation on its own. The factions within the Republican
Party that have kept quiet during the 2000 campaign would likely
resurface, the experts predict, if the GOP won big in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would get more through with a clean sweep, there's no
doubt about it,'' said David Mayhew, a Yale University political
scientist whose book ``Divided We Govern'' argues that between 1946
and 1990 divided governments were as productive as unified ones.
``But give it three to four months and you would be hearing about
friction between Bush and (House Republican leader) Tom DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential contest is too close to call, members of
both parties say a Democratic sweep is unlikely. Political
oddsmakers give Democrats an outside chance of winning back the
House from Republicans, but not the Senate. A Republican sweep, by
contrast, is seen as a distinct possibility, although no one is
predicting that the party will significantly pad its majority in
either chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Bush victory would clear a roadblock that has stalled
many a Republican initiative: the presidential veto. This year
Clinton has vetoed the so-called marriage penalty tax that had won
approval from the Republican-dominated Congress, and he has
threatened to veto the estate tax repeal bill that landed on his
desk Thursday. Those two items would likely be signed into law by
Bush, experts say. Clinton also has vetoed a ban on partial-birth
abortions, a bill Bush said he would sign as soon as it hit his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Bush administration, experts also would expect
significant increases in military spending and speedier deployment
of a national missile defense system, a program the Clinton
administration has balked at.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of the veto, the most powerful tool Democrats would
wield during an era of Republican control would be the Senate
filibuster. They could tie up the chamber with endless speeches
until the Republican leadership met their demands.
</P>
<P>
   To shut off a Senate filibuster, the Republicans would need 60
votes, which has proven difficult even with the five-seat majority
the party has enjoyed for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could skirt the Democratic talk-fest by using
what's known as the reconciliation process _ essentially cloaking
their proposals as budget bills, a legislative vehicle not subject
to filibuster. Some believe reconciliation is a route Bush could
use to pass legislation letting retirees invest a portion of their
Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under reconciliation, Social Security reform is very doable,''
said Daniel Palazzola, a political scientist at the University of
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists see a Republican sweep as the worst of all
possible election outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club, predicted
that Bush would allow increased timber cutting on federal lands and
would roll back Clinton's conservation efforts. He speculated that
Bush would leave in place Republican-backed amendments, known as
riders, designed to chip away at environmental regulations. The
threat of a Clinton veto last year effectively derailed riders that
would have allowed oil companies to escape certain royalty
payments, undermined science-based management of the national
forests and weakened new regulations governing mining operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you combine George W. Bush with the current Republican
leadership on Capitol Hill, it will be an environmental disaster,''
Weiss said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They call it the Nightmare. That is how the crew
refers to the sequence in which the metal embassy fence drops in,
the helipad moves down, the sound of whipping blades intensifies,
and a life-size chopper descends.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, American troops will evacuate Saigon this way for
the last time on the stage of the Broadway Theater, bringing to a
close the musical ``Saigon,'' the sixth-longest-running show in
Broadway history. After nearly 10 years, the production, loosely
based on Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,'' will have played 4,063
performances and gone through 1,218,900 pounds of dry ice, 89,386
scene changes and 812,600 light cues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saigon'' has taken in more than $1.3 billion internationally
at the box office since its world premiere in London in September
1989. The Broadway production, which opened on April 11, 1991, has
grossed more than $266 million and has been seen by nearly six
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The show spawned two U.S. touring companies and a Toronto
production. ``Saigon'' has been performed in six other countries,
and a new production will open in the Philippines next month,
starring Lea Salonga, who originated the title role on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The show's imminent departure is significant, and not only
because ``Saigon'' is the most technically complex show in Broadway
history, or because it broke several records during its phenomenal
run, like the largest advance ticket sale ($37 million) and highest
ticket price ever for a musical at the time ($100). With ``Cats''
scheduled to close next month, the departure of ``Saigon'' leaves
just two in a crop of mega-musicals still running _ ``Les
Miserables'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera'' _ suggesting that an
era of theatrical spectacle may be at an end.
</P>
<P>
   With musicals now costing $5 million to $12 million to mount,
many producers say they would not attempt a ``Saigon'' today. (The
show cost $10.9 million in 1991.)
</P>
<P>
   Written by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schoenberg (who wrote
``Les Miserables''), with additional lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr.
and produced by the British impresario Cameron Mackintosh,
``Saigon'' is also a landmark in that it was the first successful
musical to deal with the sensitive subject of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the production originally engendered considerable
controversy when Sir Cameron clashed with the Actors Equity
Association over casting: the union insisted on an Asian actor for
the major role of the Engineer, a Eurasian pimp, while Sir Cameron
insisted on Jonathan Pryce _ initially canceling the production _
and ultimately prevailed. But ``Saigon'' has proved to be a source
of steady income for Asian actors, who often find work hard to come
by on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been with the musical the longest say they are in
no position to mourn its passing. After all, most shows don't last
even a year on Broadway. And ``Saigon'' just kept on going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was the last great blockbuster of the '80s, it had
all that sort of media-frenzied hype behind it,'' Sir Cameron said.
``Therefore, it wasn't until the dust had settled that actually the
audience decided to like it for itself. To this day it has its own
following.''
</P>
<P>
   While the production is best known for its special effects, it
is the poignancy of the love story between Kim, a Vietnamese waif
forced to work as a prostitute after witnessing the death of her
parents in the war, and Chris, an American GI compelled to leave
Saigon on the last helicopter out, that seems to explain why the
musical has run so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened was, there was an appetite for what
opera has always done well,'' said Nicholas Hytner, who directed
the show, ``which is to dramatize large passions in some people set
against a sweeping historical background.''
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the show in The New York Times, Frank Rich
wrote, ``For all that seems galling about `Saigon' _ and for all
that is indeed simplistic, derivative and, at odd instances,
laughable about it _ this musical is a gripping entertainment of
the old school.''
</P>
<P>
   While audiences may be moved by the tale and its tragic ending,
they are also awed by the element of spectacle, with sets by John
Napier, lighting by David Hersey, sound by Andrew Bruce and
costumes by Andreane Neofitou and Suzy Benzinger. In addition to
the famous 1,700-pound helicopter (often derided as too
Disneyland), the show features an 18-foot fiberglass statue of Ho
Chi Minh and a real 1959 Cadillac, cut in half to fit backstage.
The crew is bigger than the cast, 55 to 46. There are 375 costumes,
206 props, 45 firearms, including handguns, M-16s and AK-47s. The
touring company that closed this month in Buffalo required 40
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Phantom' had been the largest automated show,'' said Jake
Bell, the show's production technical manager. `` `Saigon'
surpassed that by more than double.''
</P>
<P>
   Experiencing a matinee from behind the scenes offers a glimpse
into what it takes to make this monster of a show work its magic.
</P>
<P>
   Busy in the Wings
</P>
<P>
   The action begins a half-hour before the curtain goes up. The
last of the actors enter through the stage door, sign in and head
up to their dressing rooms to get into their wigs, makeup and
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   On the cool, cavernous stage and in the wings, the crew readies
the props and scenery. Set pieces that have been left on the stage
from the close of the show the night before _ like the runway for
the Moulin Rouge strip club in Bangkok, where the story moves in
Act II _ are moved into the wings and, in most cases, flown, which
means they are strung up on chain hoists to keep the limited wing
space as clear as possible. Act I sets and props are moved onto the
deck _ meaning the stage and wings _ including bicycles and details
for the wedding shrine: incense, candles and colorful hanging
unicorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like rotating stock in a store,'' said Andrew Douglas,
the assistant propertyman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the tight space, large pieces of scenery must be
constantly moved around in the wings to allow others to get on and
off the stage. The towering Ho statue, for example, gets shifted
from side to side at the rear of the stage like a pendulum clock
throughout the performance. Then there are the five different beds
to keep track of: Kim 1 Bed, Kim 2 Bed, Kim 3 Bed, Kim 4 Bed and
Hotel Bed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition there are the smaller details to account for, like
the basket of lacquered vegetables (exactly what kind is a matter
of backstage debate: zucchini, okra, bitter melon?), stacks of fake
dollar bills, carts with hanging fish and trays of jewelry.

<P>
   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene Lopez, 15, said she
was willing to do anything if she could just get to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take care of babies,'' the
teenager from El Salvador said earnestly, her eyes as wide as
saucers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez never made it to her dream cities of Houston or El
Paso. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all high school girls
_ were unceremoniously dumped just inside Mexico by a smuggler
they'd paid to take them north. And it wasn't long before
immigration authorities in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state,
picked them up and put them in a detention center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents knew we were doing this. Our grandmother gave us
money,'' said Claudia Lopez, 16, who huddled nervously with the
other girls inside a cell, waiting for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going somewhere where with jobs we could
afford to buy food,'' Claudia said. ``We didn't know this would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While United States officials wage their own battle against
illegal crossings, Mexican officials in Chiapas _ which borders
Guatemala _ say they're grappling with a 30 percent surge in
seizures of Central Americans and other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 54,000 migrants were caught just in Chiapas here
between January and June, compared to about 37,700 during the same
period last year. The vast majority are Central Americans on their
way to the United States to escape low wages and societies still
devastated by civil war and 1998's Hurricane Mitch, according to
Javier Jimenez, regional director of the Mexican National Migration
Institute here, in this a city on the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of urgency about them,'' Jimenez said. ``The
U.S. economy is what offers them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers charging thousands of dollars are getting into the
action, leading migrants on increasingly perilous journeys in their
quest to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In April, seven people died after 250 migrants were found locked
inside suffocating train cargo holds in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In May, authorities found 309 illegal immigrants jammed inside a
convoy of four trucks traveling from Chiapas to Matamoros, on
Mexico's northern border. The migrants, ten of whom had to be
hospitalized, said their goal was to reach Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Guatemalans bound for the United States, including
two children, drowned when a motorboat they were in capsized off
the coast of Oaxaca, another southern Mexican state.
</P>
<P>
   A greater number of South Americans are also traveling through
southern Mexico en route to America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the United States,'' was the dream destination of
Luis Cayano, a 23-year-old Peruvian who'd been locked inside a
one-room holding cell here for more than a month, awaiting news on
who would pay for him to be deported to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Cayano, who has some college education, said he spent several
thousand dollars on bus fare and bribes to corrupt officials in
various countries as he made his way north. His mother had used her
house as collateral for a loan from a bank and he felt responsible
now to somehow get to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dream of going to the United States, you have to
give it a go,'' Cayano said. ``We are willing to risk a lot to get
there, even our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the Central Americans flooding Mexico, Salvadoran
Francisco Antonio Ramirez wanted to get to Los Angeles, where he
heard he could make more money than he ever imagined. Mexican
officials caught him at a bus station near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a cost-benefit analysis, it's probably worth more
for me to try to get to the United States than stay at my job in El
Salvador,'' the 26-year-old father of two said.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of tears, he said he'd saved and borrowed about
US$900 for his journey from his home in San Miguel, El Salvador.
Back home, in a country rife with crime, he was earning the
equivalent of US$110 a month repairing highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pittance,'' he said. ``We lived through a terrible war.
And now what little you earn gets stolen by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduran Carlos Castillo, 18, said he earned so little at a
T-shirt assembly plant back home _ about US$40 a week _ that his
family also thought it worth him trying his luck at getting to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation in Honduras,'' said Castillo, a
fresh-faced youth who was placed in the holding cell with the
startled look of a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hoping to join his uncle somewhere in Texas, but
he couldn't remember exactly where. He was supposed to call and get
the name of the city once he had traveled deeper into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, which hit Central America almost two years ago,
left its worst path of destruction in Honduras, Castillo's
homeland.
</P>

   More than 5,000 people were killed and 70-to-80 percent of
agricultural production was destroyed, along with 33,000 homes. The
U.S. government offered more than $103 million in emergency food
and disaster recovery. About 10 percent of another $291 million to
rebuild roads, health infrastructure and businesses was spent by
this June, according to the U.S. Agency for International
Development.

   ``It was a tragedy. We endured non-stop rain and wind. People
went for days without food. All that left big losses. You have to
look hard for ways to survive. So the hurricane had a huge impact
on us,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the migrants waiting to be shipped back home,
Castillo shrugged when asked if he would attempt the trip again.
</P>
<P>
   Most Central Americans caught in Chiapas are deported over the
border to Guatemala, where they travel freely without visas under a
multilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Those crossing illegally into Mexico sometimes walk through
tropical terrain or pay to be ferried across the Suchiate River,
which divides Chiapas from Guatemala. Once inside Mexico, the
migrants take buses or jump on trains heading north, climbing on
top of boxcars or hanging off the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials man roadblocks near the southern border to
check travelers' documents, and patrol the banks of the Suchiate
River. But because of shortages in manpower, the Suchiate appears
in some places to be a virtual no man's land.

 NEW YORK: of jewelry.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With so many sets rising and descending in the wings, backstage
can be a dicey place to be. ``Organized chaos,'' said Peter Wolf,
the first assistant stage manager. To make room for all of the
show's big bells and whistles, the theater first had to be
transformed. Jack Cennamo, 61, the head carpenter, who has been
with ``Saigon'' since it began, said he and his crew spent two
months tearing out walls, radiators and stairwells.
</P>
<P>
   During the performance, the stagehands are particularly
concerned with how the scenery moves on and off. ``It's routine,''
Cennamo said of running the show. ``But you have to pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 19 muslin blinds that look as if they were made of
rice paper and frame the stage. Behind them is black masking
through which scenery glides in and out on metal pylons that are
meant to evoke Vietnam. The rising of the blinds is carried out by
one of the show's three computers, which occupy a room of their
own. If a computer malfunctions and the blinds don't go up, the
pylons carrying the scenery rip through them and the stagehands
have a problem. It has happened, but not often.
</P>
<P>
   Girls Will Be Boys
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating all this, calling the cues, is Mark Dobrow, the
production stage manager, who has been with ``Saigon'' for five
years. Outside the office he shares with his assistant stage
managers _ Wolf and Lisa Buxbaum, the second assistant _ Polaroid
pictures cover the walls, featuring every cast member who has been
with the company, almost 300 over the years. Each of them signed
the show's coolie hat upon leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Kim's son, Tam, has been played by 34 different 4-
and 5-year-olds, mostly girls. ``Boys, when they're 4, are not
mature enough,'' Dobrow said. ``They get bored really easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking after this child is a chaperone, or ``child wrangler,''
currently Suzanne Arnold, who stays by her charge's side throughout
the show. When Tam (played by Jenna La Salla and Gail Quintos, who
alternate performances) is offstage, Arnold entertains the child in
the dressing room with games, storybooks and toys. When Tam is
onstage, Arnold is nearby, out of sight of the audience. When, for
example, Tam is sitting on a bed (Kim 3 Bed) that is curtained off,
waiting to make her entrance, Arnold sits beside the girl, telling
her jokes or reading aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is in charge of training the new Tams, who generally stay 3
to 10 months. Rather than explain the entire show to a 4-year-old,
Wolf has given each of Tam's scenes names. So when Tam first enters
by running from the bed to his mother, that is called the ``Tam Run
Game.'' When Kim shoots her cousin with a gun to protect Tam, that
is the ``Tam Bang Game.''
</P>
<P>
   The stagehands have developed joke names for some of the
grown-up scenes, too. The one in which the men enter wearing
sandals, for example, is called ``the flip-flop boys.''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room under the stage before the show, the actors
playing soldiers get dressed in their Army gear, attaching their
microphones, draping dog tags around their necks. Ray Santos, one
of the original cast members who plays a Vietnamese customer in the
first bar scene, says he values this time the most. ``We make each
other laugh,'' he said, ``talk about things outside of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   All shows become families; this one has become a dynasty. Cast
members have left and come back, borne children, married one
another. Tams have grown up, and their younger siblings have become
Tams.
</P>
<P>
   `Here We Go Again'
</P>
<P>
   It is nearing 2 p.m.: showtime. Gradually actors wander onto the
stage to stretch and chat before the curtain goes up. Dobrow, the
stage manager, stands at his podium in front of a script with
marked cues, puts on his headset and announces in low tones:
``We're at places. Places, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he checks in with all the other departments on headsets:
automation, carpentry, electronics, sound, his fellow stage
managers, the house manager who monitors the audience. Robert
Billig, the show's musical director, who is conducting today and
visible on backstage infrared monitors, reports on the number of
substitutes in his orchestra, so the sound man knows what to
expect. ``Count is 12,'' Billig says of the subs. ``One cello, two
violins, an oboe, Asian flute ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harris, the house manager, reports, ``House is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, the propertyman, says, ``Here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   The show begins in Saigon, 1975, with a sequence the crew has
come to refer to as ``Dreamland,'' in which Kim and Chris meet for
the first time in a nightclub. Then the show moves to Kim's hut
(Kim 1 Bed), then on to Ho Chi Minh City, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The actors onstage look sharp, as if they were performing these
songs and dances for the first time. But keeping it fresh is a
challenge, especially for those who have been with the show the
longest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's near impossible,'' said Alan Ariano, an
original member of the ensemble. ``I blank out sometimes and go on
automatic: `OK, did I do the laundry?' You catch yourself, have to
snap yourself out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariano said he had supplemented his ``Saigon'' life with a
photography business, shooting theatrical head shots, and more
recently with a degree in computer graphics. Knowing that no show
lasts forever, and that there may not be another one immediately to
follow, he said he wanted something to fall back on. ``What's next
for me I don't know,'' he said. ``The nature of this business is
job insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   The business is doubly insecure for Asian actors, who say they
must rely on productions like ``The King and I'' and ``M.
Butterfly'' to get work. In this light ``Saigon'' has been
something of a gold mine, employing actors of Filipino, Japanese,
Chinese, Vietnamese and Hawaiian descent as well as black and
Hispanic performers. ``Both the professional and the public view of
minority casting, nontraditional casting, colorblind casting has
taken a terrific leap forward,'' said Alan Wasser, the show's
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ariano and Francis Cruz, two original cast members, attended the
same high school in Chula Vista, Calif. ``We've been part of an
elite group that's been able to work'' in the theater, Ariano said.
''I don't take that for granted.'' The Chopper Drops
</P>
<P>
   At intermission the crew prepares for the top of Act II, flying
all the scenery from Act I up on the chain hoists, bringing down
the Bangkok units. The act opens at a conference in the United
States, 1978. Then it moves to Bangkok. Then it flashes back to
Saigon when Kim remembers the American evacuation. In other words,
the Nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter is the sum of six separate automated effects. The
boom arm can swing from side to side; the cab can pitch up and
down, move side to side and rotate; the rotor on top is a nylon
rope with a rubber ball on the end that is ejected, creating the
illusion of a spinning blade. At the controls is Virgil, a robot
whose head turns as the helicopter lands.

 NEW YORK: helicopter lands.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the chopper settles on the helipad, it is up to Buxbaum,
one of the stage managers, to signal the live co-pilot (hidden on
the pad) to come through the helicopter, motioning the rest of the
soldiers to climb aboard. The 13 men who scramble into the
helicopter actually drop into the hollow box of the pad, lined with
two benches, handing off their rifles to a prop man as they
descend. Buxbaum holds a flashlight in her mouth to light their
way.
</P>
<P>
   Then Buxbaum reports, ``All clear'' into her headset, and the
helicopter rises into the eaves. ``It's really cool to be onstage
when the helicopter is coming down,'' said Eva Schegulla, Kim's
dresser. ``After four years I still get a kick out of it every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually this all goes smoothly. But there have been exceptions.
Like the time the helicopter didn't take off. Fortunately the
automation guys were able to run the machinery from a dial on the
encoder, as opposed to going through the computer, controlling each
effect individually. But there have been times when the helicopter
didn't work at all, and for such times there is Plan B, which
essentially amounts to blinding the audience with light and adding
a lot of smoke. Remarkably, audiences who have experienced Plan B
have apparently found it satisfying. ``They think they've seen
something,'' Dobrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially Hytner, the director, did not think the helicopter was
at all essential, though he now says he is glad it is there. ``I
thought, `Oh, we don't need this,''' he recalled. ``But it's not
necessarily about what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Members Only
</P>
<P>
   Once the impact of the helicopter has receded, the show returns
to its human drama, as Kim encounters Chris' wife in a hotel room.
Downstairs in the green room, members of the cast settle in for the
matinee ritual of ``Asian Treat.''
</P>
<P>
   It started about 10 years ago when a dresser began bringing
fruit and drinks for the male cast members she attended to. This
mushroomed into an exclusive group of about 14 members who take
turns bringing snacks for the matinees. Only members can partake. A
sign nearby explains the rules of the Asian Food Treat Club:
``Anyone is welcome to be part of the club after having contributed
to the festivities and having passed the requirements specified by
the AFTC board of directors at the time of one's application _ just
kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   Today the menu includes crackers, brie and dip, and the members,
from the cast and crew, dive in while the non-members eye the
spread hungrily from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   A New Job
</P>
<P>
   In the hair room, John James, who has been hair supervisor for
seven years, is putting the female cast members into their blond
wigs for the ``American Dream'' number. Sparkly in their glittering
fringe and white fishnet stockings, the women congratulate Lisa
Yuen, an ensemble member, on her new job: she will be leaving
``Saigon'' to join the road company of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.''
</P>
<P>
   This news is clearly bittersweet; cast members know they need to
figure out what to do next, and those landing jobs before the end
of the run feel lucky. But it also offers a sobering reminder to
the actors who remain that the end is near. On Nov. 2, a gala
featuring ``Saigon'' alumni will celebrate the show's 4,000th
performance. The New Year's Eve show will be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're happy that she got another job, but sad that she won't
be there when it ends,'' said James. ``You can just feel that
people are pulling away emotionally, trying to find what to do next
and where to go next. Is there life after `Saigon'?''
</P>
<P>
   James said he was concerned about the future, too. ``I'm a
little worried,'' he said. ``This is the first time I've ever had
to face unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   On to Heartbreak
</P>
<P>
   Onstage the ``American Dream'' number has its usual buoyant
effect on the audience, particularly because of the Cadillac _
carrying a woman in a Statue of Liberty crown that lights up _
which seems to float downstage on a cloud (read: dry ice). Maltby,
who collaborated on the lyrics, said that this showstopping number
goes to the heart of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam was a turning point in America's estimation of itself,
and the American dream, which hovers over the whole show, is what
was at stake,'' he said. ``America has never believed in the
American dream after that event. Prior to that we were always the
good guys, and we always won. Suddenly we were the bad guys doing
terrible things, and, worse than that, John Wayne didn't come
riding over the hill to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show in its essence is about that, about the American
inability to make the leap to Vietnam, to understand it and to
ultimately help.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's matinee moves to its heartbreaking conclusion,
accompanied by surging notes from the orchestra. Kitschy perhaps,
but some in the audience are crying. The cast comes on for its
curtain call, bowing between the billow and the bang of the heavy
red velvet curtain as it rises and falls. ``I think they loved
it,'' one actor quips as she comes offstage, ``and we should do it
again, tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two and half hours later _ the show runs more than two and
a half hours with intermission _ all of these people will be back
to do it all over again, almost exactly as they did it before. For
them this is work: what they wake up and do every day except
Sunday, sometimes twice a day, to feed their families, afford
vacations, pay the rent. They casually head out the stage door to
their dinner breaks, showing no trace of having weathered something
wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   The audience, on the other hand, emerges dazed, the way people
do coming out of a movie in the middle of the afternoon, taking a
moment to recover and re-enter their real lives, blinking in the
sunlight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Saigon'' is at the Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd
Street, (212) 239-6200. Performances are Mondays, Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and
8 p.m. Through Dec. 31. Tickets: $20 to $85 (last week of

`FASTPITCH': ODE TO SOFTBALL AND BOYS OF SUMMERS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although ``Fastpitch'' is a documentary about softball, it is
more than a film about a dying form of sport.
</P>
<P>
   Made by Jeremy Spear, a Yale-educated conceptual artist who
joined the ranks of the sport's barnstorming players, ``Fastpitch''
is at once a valentine to fastpitch softball, a tale of men
clinging to boyhood dreams, a telling story of the impact of
big-time money on a small-town sport and a sociological odyssey
through a changing American heartland, ethnicity and love.
</P>
<P>
   Moving swiftly, covering its territory with the range of a
talented shortstop (Spear's position) and an artist's eye for
telling details, this intelligent, insightful, touching film opens
as the Fastpitch World Championships reach their conclusion in St.
Joseph, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for this equivalent of baseball's World Series on
network television. Its heroes _ in Spear's film, men like the
Maori slugger Shane Hunuhunu and the dominating Ojibway pitcher
Darren Zack _ grace no cereal boxes, attract no multimillion dollar
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they are like Spear, a former college
ballplayer who at 35 decided to take time out from his life as an
artist to return to sports. They play out their careers for love of
the game but little money in towns like Ashland, Ohio (population
25,000), Kimberly, Wis., and Aurora, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   And in most instances, they hold down full-time jobs when they
are not traveling by van or bus to some game or tournament where
they often play three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't baseball; it's a different game,'' an old-timer says
of the sport where games last seven innings and pitchers bound off
a mound only 46 feet from home plate to hurl a blinding assortment
of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport where bunts and slapping at the ball are prime
offensive weapons, one player notes, ``It takes two years to hit
.200.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a villain in this, it is Peter J. Porcelli Jr., a
Florida magnate who has set out to win the world championship by
allocating $500,000 and all manner of extracurricular luxuries to
his Tampa Bay Smokers, and makes no secret of his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Nick McCurry, who manages the Ashland Abbott Labs
team that Spear joins, operates on a budget of $30,000. Most of it,
he says, comes not from the sponsor but out of his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fastpitch'' is a fine film, but as its sport is relatively
obscure in a country where baseball lays claim to being the
national pastime, some assessment of its players, skills and
demands by a baseball expert might have added to its otherwise
admirable illumination.

`SMILING FISH AND GOAT ON FIRE': A LITTLE TOO DESPERATE TO BE
LIKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By DAVE KEHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Directed by the newcomer Kevin Jordan, ``Smiling Fish and Goat
on Fire'' is a wistful little movie with big soulful eyes _ the
cinematic equivalent of a puppy dog. This independent production,
made on a thrifty $40,000 budget, is cute enough, but like a lot of
puppy dogs it seems a little too desperate to be liked.
</P>
<P>
   The soulful eyes in question belong to the Martini brothers,
Derick and Steven, who wrote the script with Jordan and star as
Chris and Tony Remi, siblings with radically contrasting
personalities. Chris, the elder, is sober and responsible _ an
accountant, inevitably _ whose fidgety temperament earned the
nickname Goat on Fire from his grandmother, who was half Italian
and half American Indian. ` Smiling Fish was grandma's name for
Tony, a carefree would-be actor who easily attracts women with his
lazy charm and sees no particular need to settle down.
</P>
<P>
   They live together in happy male squalor in the Los Angeles
house they inherited from their parents, passing their time with
affectionate roughhousing. But providence soon provides them with
two perfectly matched prospective mates.
</P>
<P>
   The jittery, retentive Chris becomes involved with Anna
(Rosemarie Addeo), a voluptuous, open-hearted Italian beauty who
works as an animal handler on film sets. Irresponsible Tony finds
himself unexpectedly cast as a potential head of household when he
falls in love with Kathy (Christa Miller), a single mom who has
moved to Los Angeles in hopes of finding a movie career for her
aggressively adorable daughter, Nicole (Heather Jae Marie).
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's direction emphasizes big bear hugs and heart-to-heart
conversations along with a few artificial crises to create a vague
sense of suspense. His main asset is Bill Henderson, a veteran bit
player who shines here in the somewhat stereotypical role of a
wise, elderly black sound engineer who instructs Chris in the ways
of love. It's left to Henderson to serve up the film's bromides
about romance and destiny (real love comes along only once, so
you'd better grab it), but he does his job with warmth and poise.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other American independent films, ``Smiling Fish
and Goat on Fire'' is a study in delayed development, in which
helpless, childlike men in their late 20s are rescued and redeemed
by domineering, motherly women. As romantic fantasies go, it's hard
to imagine anything more regressive.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire'' is rated R (Under 17
requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes strong
language and mild sex.

`CATFISH IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE': LOOKING AT ETHNIC IDENTITY WHILE
LOOKING FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' deals with adopted children
being raised by parents of a different race, but Chi Muoi Lo, the
writer and director, plays around with the idea in an unexpected
way. Full of twists, the film tries to exploit all the comic
streams running through its narrative, a gambit Lo isn't quite up
to seizing. (He has more ideas than he knows what to do with.) And
the movie isn't quite as much fun as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the Vietnamese-born Dwayne (Lo) and Mai (Lauren
Tom) have been brought up by African-Americans, Harold (Paul
Winfield) and Dolores (Mary Alice). Mai was 10 and her brother
considerably younger when they were taken in. The uptight Dwayne,
who feels more comfortable with his parents, is a rising star at
the bank where he works and has a beautiful African-American
girlfriend, Nina (Sanaa Lathan). He wants to propose but can't
quite muster the nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Mai has issues, as they say on daytime television; she is
consumed by the urge to find her birth mother; Mai was old enough
at their separation to remember her. Mai represents what the movie
is really about: the need to keep things real. She is constantly
searching for their mother and eventually finds her, which
complicates everyone's life, especially when Mai disrupts her
brother's proposal by breaking the news. And with ethnic emphases
in American culture shifting so quickly _ a shift ``Catfish''
recognizes _ what is real becomes more and more confusing,
especially for people like Dwayne, who doesn't know if he's coming
or going.
</P>
<P>
   Lo's mild comedy is moved along by the sanguine dignity of
Winfield and Alice. They're the kind of adoptive parents an orphan
would dream of, and they're as understanding as only screen
inventions can be. Winfield doles out generous helpings of his
chuckle, and Alice frets winsomely. Her Dolores has a mother-hen
instinct that keeps hovering and fluttering over her young.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of a race comedy outside the usual black-white
dynamic is inventive enough that the tremors of shock and
confrontation that rumble through the film do a little of the
director's work for him. He has managed an incredibly fine job of
casting. The performances by the actors playing the parents have an
air of authenticity and, in Winfield's case, authority.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie introduces farce complications so abruptly that
they seem to demand the oohs and surprised applause of a live
audience for a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   A climactic dinner that tries to combine the ethnic cuisines of
both families is the kind of disaster that can make one feel
embarrassed for the actors; it's cringe-inducing. Yet Lo delivers
other comic points with a minimum of fuss, showing Asian youths
using hip-hop slang and the chasm that can exist between minorities
and is deepened when the wrong words are used. At times Lo relies
on a creaky mechanism to get his laughs, especially upon the
arrival of Thanh (Kieu Chin), the birth mother of Dwayne and Mai,
which comes as a big shock to Harold and Dolores.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne is the movie's magnet for tension; he has gathered all of
it, which often seems to pull his shoulders up to neck level.
``Catfish'' is by no means a dumb movie, but it is in such a hurry
to get its laughs that it feels as stressed as Dwayne. Lo throws in
mix-ups with Dwayne's roommate, who may or may not be gay, and
racial tensions that emerge from a run-in with a policeman when he
and Nina are out. The issues are targets to be demolished, skeet in
the way of Lo's shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   He might have served his material better if he had not been
before the camera. It takes a lot of concentration to finish a film
under less arduous circumstances. But what he doesn't do is
sentimentalize any of this, a smart impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' is rated PG-13 (Parents
strongly cautioned). It includes profanity and sexual situations.
</P>

QUILTS,   SO COVETED   AND COLLECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By   WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a good man, a great antique quilt from Provence is hard to
find.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a French antiques dealer spotted a fine old
quilt at a weekend market in Provence and tried to buy it _ just at
the very moment another man reached for it. The dealer courteously
yielded his claim. He told the man, ``You take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprised by the dealer's courtesy _ such antique French quilts
are scarce _ the man invited the dealer for coffee and introduced
himself: his name was Andre-Jean Cabanel, and he was an olive
farmer from Nimes. He invited the dealer to see his collection of
antique quilts from Provence.
</P>
<P>
   When the dealer visited Cabanel, he was the one to be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dealer told me it was the most incredible thing he'd ever
seen,'' said Ross J. Francis as he finished recounting the meeting.
Francis is the vice president for development at Brunschwig &AMP; Fils,
the American textile company that will reproduce some of the
patterns from Cabanel's quilts in its fall 2001 collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the farmer's house was filled with antique armories,
each stuffed with Provencal quilts,'' Ms. Francis said.
``Evidently, Monsieur Cabanel's mother had restored old quilts and
he had admired them when they were brought to the house when he was
a boy. He never married and had been collecting them for 40
years.''
</P>
<P>
   None were for sale, but word of their quality soon spread. The
Cabanel collection was exhibited this summer in Alsace, at the
Musee de L'Impression sur Etoffes de Mulhouse. The Museum of
Printed Textiles in Mulhouse spent the previous year and a half
restoring them. In November the show moves to the Musee de la Toile
de Jouy in Jouy en Josas, a town outside Paris near Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Cabanel's quilts are also the subject of a book, ``Pique de
Provence'' (Edisud Publishers, 2000). One of the contributors to
the book is a dealer based in Washington, Kathryn Berenson, author
of ``Quilts of Provence'' (Henry Holt, 1996). Berenson helped to
catalog Cabanel's collection of 2,000 quilts.
</P>
<P>
   `` Cabanel is a passionate collector,'' she said. ``He even
trades truffles for quilts.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of antique quilts from Provence and neither
are like American antique quilts, which are pieced together from
scraps. The Provence quilts tend to be made of two large pieces of
whole cloth, either cotton or silk, that are sewn together with
some kind of filling element, like batting or cording, sandwiched
between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These quilts are intensely quilted and the quilting shows up
because the background is often a neutral or solid color,'' said
Laura Fisher, a Manhattan quilt dealer who owns Laura Fisher in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher specializes in American quilts, but currently she has
several 19th-century Provencal quilts for sale, at prices from $150
to $2,000 apiece. ``There was a strong needlework tradition in
Provence,'' Fisher said. ``It's like a three-dimensional sculpture
in thread.''
</P>
<P>
   Quilting goes back to prehistory. In medieval times quilted
cloth was used as insulation in winter garments as well as armor,
to protect its wearer from arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguished the work of Provencal needle women was
their vision of the decorative possibilities inherent in these
lines of stitching,'' Berenson writes in her book. ``They developed
the ability to realize complex, minutely detailed patterns in
beautiful, well-proportioned motifs merely through the play of
light and shadow on the surface of a textile.'' Today, these quilts
are often called ``boutis.''
</P>
<P>
   In the18th and 19th centuries, Provencale women hand-stitched
their quilted bed covers with motifs inspired by the bounty of the
region: sunflowers, pomegranates, lavender, artichokes and olives
in patterns that completely fill the ground of the quilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French started printing imported cotton in about 1640,''
Berenson said. ``By the 1680s, the Marseilles women were producing
40,000 to 50,000 quilts a year for export to Germany, England,
Italy and Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the Marseilles community was so proud of the
women's workmanship that it gave the quilts as gifts to royalty and
as tokens of appreciation. The French called these quilts
``confections'' or ``broderies de Marseille'' and refer to the
stitching as ``embroidery from within.''
</P>
<P>
   They should not be confused with pieces woven on machine-driven
looms to obtain a textured character.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan gallery Cora Ginsburg has an exceptional bouti for
sale at the moment. It is a 19th-century, all-white wedding quilt
from Marseilles, with flower baskets, artichokes, butterflies,
birds and grapes depicted on it. At 86 by 81 inches, it is also
unusually large. ``It's a museum piece,'' said Titi Halle, the
owner. The price is $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bagley Home, an antiques shop in Sag Harbor, N.Y., has a smaller
white wedding bouti, with perfect stitching. ``It has high
definition,'' Terry Bagley said. ``It's exquisite, lightweight and
warm.'' The price is $800.
</P>
<P>
   The more common bouti is a quilt made from gaily colored printed
cottons that are stitched in tight rows or diamond patterns. In the
early 17th century, the cottons were imported from India and
nicknamed ``Indiennes.'' They were hand-printed with colorful
flowers, mythic animals, exotic locales and scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Louis XIV did not want the French to import luxury goods and
drain the country's coffers, so he banned importation of Indiennes.
But he instructed his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert to import the
best artisans and dyers to establish textile businesses in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``They produced French tapestries, laces, cottons, wools and
upholstery,'' said Berenson, who is writing a book on Colbert.
``Cardinal Mazarin is known to have had dozens of French quilted
bed covers.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding antique Provencal boutis is not easy. Berenson may have
the largest stock in the United States and can be reached by
e-mail: kwberenson(at)aol.com. In France, one of the best sources
is Michel Biehn, 7 rue des Quatre-Otages, L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, in
Provence (011-33-4-90-20-89-04).
</P>
<P>
   For those who fear the effects of daily wear and tear on an
antique bouti, there are now reproductions on the market. The store
Rue de France in Newport, R.I., sells contemporary French bouti
covered in a 19th-century-style cotton, which reverses from a
subtle floral pattern to a blue and tan stripe. The queen size
costs $695, and it can be machine washed and tumbled dried.
Information: (800) 777-0998, or on the Web at www.ruedefrance.com.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary ones are very pretty, but nothing looks as
great as a bouti that has weathered 200 years of good Provencal
living.

WHAT MAKES NEW YORK `THE' CITY AND NOT `A' CITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By VICKI GOLDBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 17th-century poet said that God made the first
garden and the first city. But as it turned out, humans gave up the
garden and were never quite so happy again. Eventually they moved
to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   By that time cities had a bad rap. Shelley thought hell was a
city rather like London. Not long after he said so, photography
came along and tried to save the sinking reputation of the urban
environment. Until late in the 19th century, when social reform
became a big issue, urban photography came mainly to praise rather
than to bury, and there was quite a lot of it around, pronouncing
black and white eulogies.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Manhattan has been photographed ad infinitum and
ad nauseam, from its towering buildings to its cowering homeless,
its intemperate subways to its decorous penthouses, Liberty to the
residents at Rikers. It's still going on. Tourists are focusing on
the Disney and Warner Brothers stores, professionals on everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   Everything. If you want to know how far afield a serious
photographer will go in this city, you can get some idea at the
Museum of the City of New York, where ``New York Now 2000:
Contemporary Work in Photography'' offers 130 photographs of New
York City and New Yorkers, taken by 41 photographers. The
exhibition was selected by Bob Shamis, curator of prints and
photographs, with the assistance of an advisory board, and is the
initial presentation of a new program ``embracing cutting-edge
approaches to creatively interpreting the distinctive urban
experience of the City,'' according to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Distinctively urban these photographs are, cutting-edge maybe.
They are more about cities than about ``the City,'' more about
photography than either. Wherever cities grow, architectural
geometries, ethnic types and rushing citizens like those on view
here will pop up. They may not be as bleached and blurred and oddly
cut off as those in the wide range of approaches in this show,
which includes photographs of collaged engravings, scenes
constructed with photographs of collaged engravings, scenes
constructed with mannequins, daguerreotypes and stereographs.
</P>
<P>
   A nice clutch of good pictures stands out here between the usual
numbers of boring ones, and a surprisingly large complement of
relatively unknown photographers is a bonus. Though the artistic
and experimental work here generally outclasses the documentary,
old-fashioned straight photography still delivers the old-fashioned
goods: Stanley Greenberg's film-noir image of a city tunnel; Andrew
Moore's morose interiors of old theaters; Jim Dow's opulent color
image of the University Club library; Mitch Epstein's color
photograph of two adults and two children, dwarfed and made pale by
an enormous, black and white billboard of a man reclining in his
Calvin Klein skivvies. Even that image, advertising being what it
is, might turn up someplace other than the glitzy, grungy, overripe
Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   New York is a problem (in more ways than one). So many
photographers have gotten drunk on this city's high-proof
distillation of urban experience that the subject ought to have
been used up long ago. But there are no used-up subjects (though
some are tired and some have become icons, and daunting); there are
only subjects that require rethinking and inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A few adventurous souls run clever riffs on the trite and true.
Thanks to Abelardo Morell's camera obscura, the upper part of the
Empire State Building and its spire lie upside down in a graceful
diagonal across a bed, while a broad swath of the city's skyline
hangs down from the top of the bedroom. Susan Wides even manages to
see the Flatiron Building with a fresh eye by paying off-kilter
homage to Stieglitz and Steichen. Both of them photographed,
memorably, the building's majestic triangular prow seen through a
bare-branched tree. Wides represents the Flatiron in strict and
nearly rectangular profile, in color, tilting crazily above a
scraggly clump of trees.
</P>
<P>
   One photographer, Katharina Bosse, finds a subject that will be
new to most people, if perhaps not unique to this city: rooms
rented to those who want to live out their sexual fantasies. One is
an operating room, entirely icy blue with rubber head masks and an
enema bag, and one a luxurious boudoir that the renters presumably
could not afford on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the photographers close in on details that might be
anywhere outside a rain forest, or liberally court blur that
effectively erases identity, or fiddle with the print till the
color wavers or the image swoons. Some of these photographs are
fine: Sophie Rivera's sharply composed, gritty viaduct painters;
Don Burmeister's pillars and sky in saturated oranges and
turquoise; James Fee's indistinct image of a blimp in a sky so full
of photographic imperfections it looks like the end of the world;
Vera Lutter's otherworldly camera obscura negative of a Pepsi sign;
Maria Theresia Litschauer's decaying buildings amid wrenchingly red
skies and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   These are urban all right _ not a hay wain in sight _ but they
don't look a lot like the New York or even the urban experience
that most people meet on the sidewalks. These and other
photographers in the show _ worried that New York has been done to
death, worried that photography has been done to death, threatened
by computers and impugned by philosophical types _ play around with
techniques, unusual composition and presentation in a dogged effort
to ``make it new.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have photographic subjects, some have photographic pretexts
_ in this case both of these are in New York _ and some are more
interested in what they can do to change, extend, disguise or
radicalize the medium. New York being close at hand, their cameras
blink at it.
</P>
<P>
   Photography has always had the dual ability to present an
equivalent to everyday experience or a camera experience that isn't
ordinarily encountered without a camera. Equivalents are the images
that make you think, ``Yes, that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   A camera experience, still dependent on what light, a lens and
film or electronic impulses deliver, is another way to look at the
familiar, a magnified detail, say, that no human eyes could see in
rectangular format, or an action stopped faster than the unaided
eye could manage. Both experiences can enrich accepted ideas by
making us suddenly recognize scenes, things, details that we hadn't
noticed before.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third kind of photographic experience that has been
around for some time and has become ever more common as
photographers grapple with the threats to photography's reputation:
a purely photographic experience, dependent on the method used
(camera obscura, for instance) or the process, or the darkroom, and
producing an image of something that doesn't quite exist outside of
the image itself. For that, any old reality will suffice, even New
York.

 &HT;    Bristol among the best tracks for excitement
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If NASCAR fans were allowed to go to only one race per year,
many would pick this weekend's night race at Bristol. It is the
hardest ticket to acquire in NASCAR, and provides an unmatched
atmosphere for racing.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton Smith's Speedway Motorsports Inc. purchased ``The World's
Fastest Half-Mile'' in 1996 and launched a massive expansion
program which increased seating and parking.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's marquee track might be Lowe's Motor Speedway outside
Charlotte, but Bristol is his little jewel tucked away in the
foothills on the Tennessee-Virginia border.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Thunder Valley,'' Bristol Motor Speedway thrills the
fans in seats totally encircling the track.
</P>
<P>
   Despite incredible lap speeds of more than 120 mph on this
high-banked, half-mile oval, the drivers still have enough room to
put on a side-by-side show.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bristol, here are the best tracks in Winston Cup racing
for side-by-side racing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Atlanta: In November 1997, Geoffrey Bodine ran a lap of 197
mph to christen the new configuration and asphalt at Atlanta Motor
Speedway. Three years later, a ``second groove'' has developed,
allowing much better grip for the cars. March's race produced
constant wheel-to-wheel action, including 30 lead changes with 17
different drivers. Then there was the unforgettable 10-lap duel at
the end: Dale Earnhardt beat Bobby Labonte by a bumper in one of
the closest finishes in NASCAR history.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Martinsville: Opened in 1947 under the direction of Clay
Earles, this half-mile oval is one of the oldest tracks on the
circuit. It has become known for its tight racing through the
years. Rarely, if ever, does a car leave a Martinsville race
without a bunch of dinks and dents from trading paint with
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Richmond: This 0.75-mile, D-shaped facility has been called
the short track that ``thinks it's a superspeedway.'' As short
tracks go, this one is wide enough to allow an overload of
side-by-side racing. At times, you'll even see three-wide action on
the sweeping front stretch. RJR Sports Marketing thinks enough of
the track to put its ``Winston No Bull Million'' on the line at
Richmond on Sept. 9. Both Richmond events are at night, when the
cars glisten under the lights and appear to be moving faster than
they do in the day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Talladega: If NASCAR ran on tracks like Talladega and Bristol
each week, there would be consistent sellouts and double-digit TV
ratings. But NASCAR makes everyone involved settle for four visits
to these two facilities each calendar year. Even the most dull
Talladega race is better than most conducted on NASCAR's beloved
flat-track superspeedways. Despite the constant griping about
restrictor-plate racing, everyone still holds their breath watching
the unbelievable moves at Talladega Superspeedway during the two
500-milers each season.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the worst tracks in Winston Cup for side-by-side
racing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Daytona: History proves there is no way Daytona should be
ranked as one of the toughest tracks for passing. Based on the two
points races and the Twin 125s _ which had zero lead changes _ a
case can be made that NASCAR's ``shock package'' was a disaster at
their crown jewel facility in Florida. Both Daytona races, most
notably the season-opening 500, were extremely dull. Changes must
be made.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Indianapolis: The Brickyard provides plenty of history, and
that came in handy for the 350,000 fans that filled the 2.5-mile
layout earlier this month. They had plenty of time to reminisce
about past events. Those memories, and the engine noise, were about
the only things to keep a collective snore from engulfing
Indianapolis. The ``race'' featured Rusty Wallace leading 110 of
160 laps and Bobby Labonte driving away into the sunset _ or
raindrops _ in the last 15 laps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Homestead: NASCAR loves superspeedway flat tracks. They must
because they still schedule races at Homestead, Loudon, and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pocono: When asking drivers about the toughest tracks for
passing, many, including Jeff Gordon, say the infamous Pennsylvania
tri-oval needs to be nuked. Ironically, Pocono had two of the most
exciting races of the season: Jeremy Mayfield bumping Dale
Earnhardt out of the way in the first event, and Mayfield blowing a
tire with a half-lap to go and being passed by Rusty Wallace. The
same excitement, however, wasn't there for the other 199 laps in
each race.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Road courses: Get the hook. The only side-by-side action
you'll see at Sonoma or Watkins Glen is when a driver is being set
up to be passed. There is no way to run a competitive, door-to-door
lap at either of these tracks. Drivers who lose their patience
often end up in the ``kitty litter'' or ``gravel pit.''

 &HT;    Fights few on circuit amid pressures to achieve
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the recent argument between Tony Stewart and Jeff
Gordon, NASCAR drivers seem to have fewer confrontations than other
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 months, there have been four major confrontations
between Winston Cup drivers _ three involving Stewart. By all
accounts, with the countless bumps and wrecks, there should've have
been more.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti, who drives for Petty Enterprises, explained some
of the reasons for non-confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a very emotional sport, we don't represent
just ourselves,'' Andretti said. ``We represent the companies that
are involved, from the people who sponsor our cars, to the cars we
drive, to the tires we're on _ you name it. So for starters, we
represent a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But above and beyond all that, we also have a lot of people
who follow this sport, and I think because of that, our goal should
be to make racing like the ultimate role model.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti earned rave reviews at Martinsville last September by
maintaining his composure when he was wrecked by Stewart while
racing among the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the same race, Stewart had twice spun out Irwin, who
got revenge by bumping the No. 20 Pontiac into the wall. Stewart
slowly climbed out of the mangled car, and waited for Irwin to
circle the track. Stewart threw a series of left-handed jabs toward
Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stewart has had separate run-ins with Gordon and
Robby Gordon. The other major argument came last May between Steve
Park and Joe Nemechek after The Winston all-star exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR will race this weekend at Bristol, where Dale Earnhardt
bumped leader Terry Labonte out of the way with a half lap to go.
There was no confrontation between the drivers after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the guys realize it's easier to talk about it than it is
to fight about it,'' driver Rick Mast said. ``Most everybody has
come through the ranks of the Saturday night bullrings, and you've
been through that stuff. You've learned how to control your
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who has been criticized by fans, finally is talking
this week about Watkins Glen. He claims he has no anger toward
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't agree with what happened, but I'm not mad about
it,'' Stewart said. ``You can't dwell on things like that in our
sport and retain a competitive edge on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, Labonte return to the scene of `the bump'
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Carvell
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   The most talked-about event of the 1999 season was last August's
Bristol race, where Dale Earnhardt Sr. bumped leader Terry Labonte
out of the way with a half-lap to go. The crowd, which had cheered
heartily for ``The Intimidator'' only several laps earlier, turned
on Earnhardt when he climbed out of his car in victory lane. He was
showered with a loud chorus of boos for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fans shouldn't expect to see a duel between the two drivers
again on Saturday night. Labonte is just getting used to steering a
car again after missing two races with vertigo. Labonte was asked
about last year's finish this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol is always an exciting place to run at,'' Labonte said.
``Last year didn't turn out quite as good as I'd hoped it would for
me, but we had a great run and a good car. I hope our car will be
as good this year as it was then.

we're hoping for. And yes, I heard 'em (boos for Dale Earnhardt)
like everybody else.''

   Here's predicting the Winston Cup champ for 2000

   With 12 races remaining in the 2000 Winston Cup season, it's
time to start looking at which driver has the best shot at winning
the championship. Here's our attempt at handicapping the chase for
the Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1. Bobby Labonte: Labonte, who drives the No. 18 Pontiac, has
been nearly bullet-proof during the first two-thirds of the season.
But history suggests that he is due bad luck, and it could come
Saturday night at Bristol, the half-mile facility nestled in the
Appalachian Mountains on the Tennessee-Virginia border. Odds on
winning Winston Cup, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2. Dale Jarrett: Jarrett, the defending Winston Cup champion,
slowly has crept back into contention for his second title. Dale
Earnhardt's first-half success was a blessing in disguise. It
deflected much media attention away from his title defense. He has
one victory this year _ the Daytona 500 _ but don't bet against him
winning at least one more race and possibly his second title in
November. Odds on winning Cup, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3. Dale Earnhardt: Earnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup
champion, looks like he's starting to run out of steam. He can look
back on two races that have derailed his hopes of sitting at the
head table at the Waldorf-Astoria in December. At Pocono last
month, he blew a tire while running second; at Watkins Glen, he
crashed on his own while again running second. Odds on winning Cup,
15-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4. Jeff Burton: When Burton gets on a roll, it means serious
trouble for the competition. But Burton seems to be streaky, rather
than consistent. Remember how he had the field covered early at
Atlanta in March only to demolish his No. 99 Ford while leading?
You know he'd love to have that race to run again. Odds on winning
Cup, 20-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  5. Rusty Wallace: Wallace will break out a new Ford Penske
chasis on Saturday evening with the Harley Davidson paint scheme.
He hopes to ``hog'' the top spot on the leaderboard at his favorite
track, Bristol. He is the real sleeper in the title chase and has
huge momentum. A Bristol victory, coupled with bad luck from Bobby
Labonte, could propel this Missouri native closer to the title.
Odds on winning Cup 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6. Tony Stewart: Stewart and Wallace are the only three-time
winners in 2000. But the early wreck at Michigan last Sunday put a
dent in Stewart's title hopes. This temperamental driver will now
race to win and let the chips fall where they may. Odds on winning
Cup, 50-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  7. Ricky Rudd: It is very difficult for a first year team to
compete for a title, much less win a race. Rudd has come very close
to winning. He and crew chief Michael McSwain seem to be meshing.
Look for Rudd to win a race and have an outside shot at a top-5
finish in the points race. Odds on winning Cup, 125-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  8. Ward Burton: At midseason, Ward Burton looked like a
serious title contender after a solid top-10 run at the Pepsi 400
in Daytona. But the team has hit the skids after being second or
third in points for a good portion of the first half of the year.
Burton won at Darlington in March and would love another victory to
stop the free-fall. Odds on winning Cup, 200-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  9. Mark Martin: Many consider Martin, a Daytona Beach, Fla.,
resident, the best active driver to not own a Winston Cup
championship. He'll have to wait until 2001 for another shot. An
unlikely victory at Martinsville appeared to have him set for a
title run, but that was followed with inconsistent finishes
including consecutive 43rd place results at Pocono and Indy. He is
clinging to the top-10. Odds on winning Cup 250-1.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  10. Jeff Gordon: It doesn't take a genius to realize that the
chemistry between Gordon and new crew chief Robbie Loomis isn't
there yet. Many forget that his original Rainbow Warrior pit crew
members bolted during the 1999 offseason and jumped to the No. 88
team. Gordon is looking ahead to 2001 as he finishes his
disappointing season. Odds on winning Cup 300-1.

<P>
   Labonte puts focus on each race, not trophy
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte remains the leader of the Winston Cup points
standings, but he is in no mood to celebrate. Labonte says that
will only happen if he is still No. 1 after the season-ending NAPA
500 on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to every weekend not worrying about (the
championship),'' Labonte said. ``We worry more about that race each
weekend. We don't bring it up at the shop or around my house until
we get to the racetrack, and everybody around us brings it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bad day is going to make it bad for us, so we can't think
about it like that. We just think about trying to make every race
as good as possible. It's not at the point that we get down to '13,
12, 11, 10' (races to go). It's going to get down to '3, 2, 1' and
maybe the last one, so we're just concentrating on each weekend and
looking forward to every race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know if we have those great days and finish in the top five
(every week), we should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is taking the same low-key approach of contending for
Winston Cup title as his older brother, Terry Labonte, a two-time
circuit champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just kind of taking it one race at a time and going
out and doing the best that they can,'' Terry said about his
brother. ``I think they're really approaching the thing right, and
they're having to run hard because it's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't gotten to a position where they can ease back and
take it easy and be cautious. They've got to go out and run hard
every week. That's what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Craftsman Truck update
</P>
<P>
   Greg Biffle has a commanding 190-point advantage in the
standings of the Craftsman Truck Series with five races remaining.
Each event, Biffle will have to choose between chasing after the
checkered flag or driving safely for points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be smart about what we are doing,'' Biffle said.
``Our goal as a team and mine as a driver is to win the
championship. That doesn't mean that we aren't going to still try
and win races.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we really have to think about every decision we
make as a team and as a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the remaining races on the 2000 Craftsman Truck Series
season:
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 27 _ Chicago 175, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 7 _ Richmond 200, Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 22 _ Dover 200, Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 13 _ O'Reilly 300, Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 28 _ California 200, Fontana, Calif.

 &HT;    Ladies man's patter boosts film
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Listen closely and feel free to take notes at
``The Tao of Steve,'' in which a pudgy, philosophy-spouting, pot
smoker reveals his secrets for becoming a chick magnet. Who says
movies can't be entertaining and educational?
</P>
<P>
   The Steve of the title does not refer to the movie's unkempt,
underachieving Zen master, whose name is Dex. It refers instead to
his pop icons of cool _ Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (''Hawaii
Five-O'') and Steve Austin (''The Six Million Dollar Man'') _ who
attract woman with their haughty air of indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Dex (the teddy bear-like Donal Logue, padded out to
Falstaffian proportions) has lardered on the pounds since high
school and made little of his life, he still has his way with the
opposite sex. The problem is he has never been in love. It has no
place in his philosophy, you see, and when it strikes, he is
knocked for a seismic loop.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles begin, or perhaps his good fortune, at his 10-year
high school reunion, when he is introduced to Syd (Greer Goodman,
who also co-wrote the script). She resents the fact that he does
not remember her, and we later learn that they had a one-night
stand in college while Dex was in an alcoholic haze. Still, from
the way they verbally spar, can quote from the same books and
continue to get on each other's nerves, even a Stu _ the nerdy
opposite of a Steve _ could tell they have a future together.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Dex-Syd scenes, which form the heart of the movie,
``The Tao of Steve'' is at its best dawdling with Dex and his
circle of slacker friends. They play Frisbee, golf and poker and
vegetate, all the while listening to Dex's mantras for success in
sexual conquests. The remarkable thing is that this exploration of
the arrested development male psyche comes from first-time
filmmaker Jenniphr Goodman, who fortunately directs a lot better
than she spells.
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote the film with sister Greer and Duncan North, the
real life model for Dex. The writing is better than the execution,
which has a few too many awkward moments and amateurish edits.
Still, the character of Dex and his cerebral, if misguided, patter
are enough to make this otherwise standard romantic comedy stand
out from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set in Santa Fe _ Syd is there as a guest set
designer for the renowned Santa Fe Opera _ and the visual beauty of
the area is captured as well as possible on an independent film's
budget. At one point Syd invites Dex on a hiking and camping
expedition in the New Mexico hills. Gamely, then ruefully, he
agrees, and even when the movie veers into sitcom shtick, it has a
point to make and leads to a new plateau in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Syd must necessarily come off as more mature than Dex _ who
wouldn't? _ but that leaves Goodman stiffer and less at ease than
the relaxed, Buddha-like Logue. Whether he is anything like Dex, he
wears the character as comfortably as he wears his shabby wardrobe,
while Goodman frequently looks like she is acting. Nevertheless,
however improbable the match, you will probably be rooting for the
two of them to get together by the fade-out, and that is all ``The
Tao of Steve'' asks of you.
</P>
<P>
   Those that want to take home more can scribble down bits of
Dex's philosophy (''Women want sex 15 minutes after men do. Hold
out for 20 minutes. She'll chase you for five.'') You might even
give it a shot, but its success is only guaranteed in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   THE TAO OF STEVE
</P>
<P>
   2 _ 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Language, drug use, sexual situations
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 28 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An amiable romantic comedy stands out from the
crowd for its comic philosophical dialogue and a big teddy
bear-like performance from Donal Logue.

 &HT;    GORE REACHES OUT TO VOTERS TURNED OFF BY POLITICS
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has begun emphasizing a
subtle theme on the stump, aimed at countering the political
estrangement among young and middle-aged voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in the Midwest this week, Gore asked voters at
nearly every stop to ``open your hearts'' and ``break through your
disillusionment'' and ``allow yourself to believe that we can do
the right thing'' as a nation.
</P>
<P>
   When he begins this portion of his stump speech, ``I see the
heads start to nod out there'' in the crowd, Gore said in an
interview following his trip down the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his words referred not only to the reaction against
President Clinton's behavior, but also to the disenchantment with
politics in general.
</P>
<P>
   Gore traces this disillusionment to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy in 1963, followed by the Vietnam War, the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in
1968, and the Watergate scandal that led to President Nixon's
resignation. It has been exacerbated in recent years, he said, by
the country's sometimes painful transition to an information
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reference to the last two years _ it's a reference
to the last 35 years or so,'' Gore said. ``There really are a lot
of people who feel like they've been burned, not by Clinton's
activities _ or maybe that, too _ but mainly it's because of the
cynicism and the ironic detachment, the feeling that politics is
not worthy of smart people, committed people getting involved,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, to hell with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``open your hearts'' portion of Gore's stump speech usually
comes at the end, soft and earnest, a somewhat jarring transition
from the fiery populist attacks on ``Big Oil, Big Tobacco and
HMOs'' that make up most of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   It is most often directed to ``the young people'' in the
audience, the teenagers and twenty-somethings that are the least
likely to vote in presidential contests, but who helped swell the
turnouts for such political mavericks as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Gov. Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During Gore's just-completed boat trip down a 400-mile stretch
of the Mississippi, his appeal captured the imagination of not only
these elusive voters, but also some of Gore's fellow baby boomers
and those of President Kennedy's generation, who wistfully recall
the promise of the New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Seeing him got me all revved up,'' said Shirley Chaney, 49,
in Hannibal, Mo., where Gore's trip ended Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He's catching the attention of people who could care less
about politics,'' said Chad Rentz, a middle-aged restaurant owner
in Bellevue, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He talks the way my father does,'' said 27-year-old Jennifer
Hedrick of Sparta, Wis., who turned out for one of Gore's riverboat
stops in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He's for the average guy,'' said Harry Haldeman, 77, of
Jesup, Iowa, who grew up in the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his idealistic appeal, Gore said, ``I think for at
least 35 years we've had a series of traumas to the political
system, to our self-government, without an uninterrupted period of
healing to restore the level of confidence and good feeling that's
necessary for a healthy democratic process. But I know that if you
decide to push past that and get involved, you really can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said if you scratch the surface of a cynic, you'll
find someone wanting to believe that the world is good and we can
make a difference,'' he said. ``That's what I'm trying to do _
scratch the surface of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his theme was born in the open meetings he held in
Iowa and New Hampshire during the nominating contest with Bradley.
At one meeting, he met someone who reminded him of himself in the
early 1970s, after a series of alienating events that included the
national tragedies of the era and his father's loss of his U.S.
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encountered somebody _ I can't even remember who or where _
who reminded me of myself at that time; and I said to that person,
`Look, you've got to let yourself believe that we can really do the
right thing, and you've got to push past this disillusionment and
cynicism','' Gore recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after that, I stood up in front of some group and it
just came out that way. Several people came up to me afterward and
said, 'That really had an impact on me, and you ought to say that.'
``
</P>
<P>
   That message was soon set aside, however, after Gore defeated
Bradley and began a series of attacks on Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, his Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began sounding the anti-cynicism theme anew in the weeks
just before the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles last
week, and it was part of his acceptance speech, widely hailed for
its non-combative tone.

 &HT;    WALKEN IN SENSIBLE SHOES: Fine performances save would-be caper
flick
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It has been such a long time since
Christopher Walken has played anything close to a mentally balanced
character, that we watch and wait now for the expected signs of
psychosis whenever he is on screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the gritty working-class Queens drama ``The Opportunists,''
he isn't creepy or crazy, just a decent guy named Vic Kelly, who
tries to escape his criminal past and fails miserably at it.
</P>
<P>
   This is a satisfying change of pace for Walken, given the
opportunity to flex different acting muscles, but his vehicle
sputters and lurches just like the cars Kelly tries unsuccessfully
to repair.
</P>
<P>
   The problem seems to lie with first-time feature director Myles
Connell, who wrote a credible, involving, if naggingly familiar
screenplay, but never establishes a filming rhythm that would
propel the story forward with dramatic tension. Not every heist
picture has to move with the velocity of ``Gone in 60 Seconds,''
and ``The Opportunists'' does dawdle productively on some
well-observed character details. Nevertheless, a little more
momentum would have helped the movie a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Take it as a character study masquerading as a caper flick.
Kelly is an intriguing, deeply flawed figure who plied his break-in
skills once too often, then turned himself in and did prison time.
He voluntarily gave back the stolen money after his family left him
because, as he puts it, he no longer had anyone to spend it on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, he is trying to mend his relationship with
his grown daughter (Vera Farmiga), support his aged aunt (Anne
Pitoniak) in a Catholic nursing home and do the right thing by his
adoring girlfriend Sally (Cyndi Lauper). But Vic is an inept auto
mechanic, falling behind in rent payments and starting to bounce
checks. As he begins to realize, ``the regular citizen thing is not
going so well,'' and one more heist looks inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in this particular deck is Michael (Peter
McDonald), a scrappy Irish bloke who turns up claiming to be Vic's
distant cousin, yearning to become an apprentice criminal under his
tutelage. Impetuous and impatient, he proves even more of a
screw-up than Vic and the combination of the two of them is
disasterous.
</P>
<P>
   Dilligently, Vic gets back his safe-cracking skills, training to
shave time off his tumbler manipulations to beat the alarm at a
shady security operation where two nervous acquaintances work as
guards. The race against the clock of the break-in does briefly
quicken the pulse, but those looking for a full-fledged caper
thriller had better look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It works far better as a morality tale of second chances and
redemption, sold by Walken's somber performance as the likeable
reluctant crook. He underplays with such seeming effortlessness,
even as he gives some truly eccentric line readings. Still, it is
refreshing to be reminded what a skilled actor he is after so many
years of off-the-wall scenery chewing.
</P>
<P>
   Dubliner McDonald lends the tale just the right edginess,
helping to keep the caper's outcome in doubt, and Farmiga (of the
unpersuasive ``Return to Paradise'') has some appealing moments
here, even though her character is frustratingly sketchy. Even
Lauper comes off well in her first dramatic role, so perhaps
Connell deserves some credit for drawing so many fine performances
from his cast.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is enough to keep ``The Opportunists'' from being
ignored remains to be seen. It has an intriguing, fragile human
quality, even as it dashes most expectations of the genre it seems
to want to be mistaken for.
</P>
<P>
   THE OPPORTUNISTS
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Language, minimal violence
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A morality character study masquerading as a caper
flick, with one of Walken's best, most normal performances in
years.

   ISRAEL-BARAK (Jerusalem) _ In a clear warning to the
Palestinians to compromise on Jerusalem and other issues, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday that he was prepared if the peace
talks fail to invite the right-wing Likud party to join in a
national unity government and even to appoint Ariel Sharon, the
hawkish former army general who is Likud's leader, as foreign
minister. A month after the Camp David peace talks ended with wide
differences over Jerusalem between Barak and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, Barak's suggestion appeared to be putting
Arafat on notice that Israel could back away from its offer of a
limited foothold in Jerusalem for the Palestinians and establish a
government that, with Likud at its heart, would almost certainly
put a break on any peace deal that involved major concessions to
the Palestinians. By John F. Burns.

   RACE-EDUCATION-GAP (Undated) _ A 30-year gap between test scores
of black and white students that had begun to narrow in the 1980s
has continued to widen in the past few years, according to new
national test results released Thursday, dealing a discouraging
blow to increasing efforts across the country to raise the
achievement of minority students. Most perplexing, officials said,
is that the gap has opened the widest among children of the most

remained relatively steady while those of blacks fell back toward

`THE CREW': THE CRIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINARAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ju know what I ang? A clee-tchay.'' So says Raul Ventana
(Miguel Sandoval), the Hispanic drug kingpin who is the designated
heavy in Michael Dinner's slapdash, hyperactive new mobster comedy.
``Ju know what happens to clee-tchays?'' Ventana asks his minions,
who look grateful to be back at work after the long hiatus of
``Miami Vice.'' ``They die.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, amigo. ``The Crew,'' with morbid relish, takes
defibrillator paddles to pop-culture archetypes and situations that
should have been allowed to expire peacefully long ago. The
inexplicable success of ``Analyze This'' and the unlikely, richly
merited triumph of ``The Sopranos'' seem to have illuminated dim
light bulbs over the heads of Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson,
the film's producers, and the good people at Touchstone Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ventana delivers his commentary, we have seen a
parade of dark suits, fedoras and cigars, strippers doing pole
dances, bodies in the trunks of cars, and a cascade of ethnic
stereotypes as vivid as third-generation photocopies of an old Don
Rickles routine.
</P>
<P>
   A carefully edited one, to be sure. ``The Crew'' pokes fun at
Latinos, Italian-Americans, Jews and the elderly but leaves blacks
and gays alone; or rather, it tries to have affectionate fun with
the ways its selected target groups have been made fun of in past
movies and television shows. And some of it is, I'll admit, pretty
funny.
</P>
<P>
   The script was written by Barry Fanaro, screenwriter of the
Farrelly brothers' ``Kingpin,'' which will someday be acknowledged
as a masterpiece of 1990s neo-lowbrow American cinema. ``The Crew''
occasionally pops to life with a priceless throwaway line (as when
the Brothers Grimm are referred to as ``a couple of Nazi goniffs'')
or an inspired set piece (like the sequence in which Ventana's
senile and extravagantly wrinkled father breaks out of the nursing
home, or the ``Goodfellas'' parody in which geriatric mobsters try
to bribe their way into the early-bird special at a Miami
delicatessen).
</P>
<P>
   But Fanaro also wrote more than 100 episodes of ``The Golden
Girls,'' which is more to the point. Like that redoubtable show,
``The Crew'' aims to be a piece of genial old-timers' slapstick. It
follows a gang of New Jersey wiseguys _ seen in their prime in an
opening sequence set in 1968 _ into unhappy, impoverished and
sexually frustrated old age. Except for Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard
Dreyfuss), who delivers a voice-over narration studded with
``mooks,'' ``fahzools,'' and ``fuhgeddaboudits,'' each member is
defined by a colorful wiseguy nickname and a single personality
trait. Bats (Burt Reynolds) has a violent temper; Mouth (Seymour
Cassel) never talks; and the Brick (Dan Hedaya) is, as Bobby puts
it, ``about 10 Lucky Strikes short of a pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedaya deserves credit for bringing his dingbat character to
comic life, the way he did as Nick Tortelli, his recurring
scuzzball on ``Cheers.'' And Dreyfuss works hard to be both wiseguy
and mensch, though his trademark intelligence is stymied by the
dumbness of the script.
</P>
<P>
   But what in creation possessed the filmmakers to cast Reynolds
as a mafioso, other than the fact that once, before much of the
current film audience was born, he was hailed as the next Brando?
In any case Reynolds, who has often mistaken lack of effort for
effortlessness, sits around looking bored, except when he is
knocked unconscious. The gag is that when he wakes up, Bats hatches
the gang's next brilliant scheme. The movie seems to have been made
by a similar method.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' is cobbled together in desperate obedience to the
widespread Hollywood fallacy that the more plot a movie has, the
more people will like it. Thus in addition to nonsensical capers
involving phony rub-outs, the accidental crossing of Raul Ventana,
and the crew's entanglement with a buxom stripper named Ferris
(Jennifer Tilly), there is the sentimental contrivance of Bobby's
search for his lost daughter and some tired banter between two
Miami detectives (Jeremy Piven and Carrie-Anne Moss) who are also
ex-lovers, one of whom just happens to be ...
</P>
<P>
   Just forget about it, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Crew'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It includes lecherous shots of women in bathing suits,
some relatively tame gangster profanity and violence that tries to
remain within the bounds of silliness.

   TAPACHULA, Mexico _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene Lopez, 15, said she
was willing to do anything if she could just get to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wash dishes, clean hotel rooms, take care of babies,'' the
teenager from El Salvador said earnestly, her eyes as wide as
saucers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez never made it to her dream cities of Houston or El
Paso. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all high school girls
_ were unceremoniously dumped just inside Mexico by a smuggler
they'd paid to take them north. And it wasn't long before
immigration authorities in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state,
picked them up and put them in a detention center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents knew we were doing this. Our grandmother gave us
money,'' said Claudia Lopez, 16, who huddled nervously with the
other girls inside a cell, waiting for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going somewhere where with jobs we could
afford to buy food,'' Claudia said. ``We didn't know this would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While United States officials wage their own battle against
illegal crossings, Mexican officials in Chiapas _ which borders
Guatemala _ say they're grappling with a 30 percent surge in
seizures of Central Americans and other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 54,000 migrants were caught just in Chiapas here
between January and June, compared to about 37,700 during the same
period last year. The vast majority are Central Americans on their
way to the United States to escape low wages and societies still
devastated by civil war and 1998's Hurricane Mitch, according to
Javier Jimenez, regional director of the Mexican National Migration
Institute here, in this a city on the Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sense of urgency about them,'' Jimenez said. ``The
U.S. economy is what offers them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers charging thousands of dollars are getting into the
action, leading migrants on increasingly perilous journeys in their
quest to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In April, seven people died after 250 migrants were found locked
inside suffocating train cargo holds in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In May, authorities found 309 illegal immigrants jammed inside a
convoy of four trucks traveling from Chiapas to Matamoros, on
Mexico's northern border. The migrants, ten of whom had to be
hospitalized, said their goal was to reach Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Guatemalans bound for the United States, including
two children, drowned when a motorboat they were in capsized off
the coast of Oaxaca, another southern Mexican state.
</P>
<P>
   A greater number of South Americans are also traveling through
southern Mexico en route to America.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the United States,'' was the dream destination of
Luis Cayano, a 23-year-old Peruvian who'd been locked inside a
one-room holding cell here for more than a month, awaiting news on
who would pay for him to be deported to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Cayano, who has some college education, said he spent several
thousand dollars on bus fare and bribes to corrupt officials in
various countries as he made his way north. His mother had used her
house as collateral for a loan from a bank and he felt responsible
now to somehow get to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dream of going to the United States, you have to
give it a go,'' Cayano said. ``We are willing to risk a lot to get
there, even our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the Central Americans flooding Mexico, Salvadoran
Francisco Antonio Ramirez wanted to get to Los Angeles, where he
heard he could make more money than he ever imagined. Mexican
officials caught him at a bus station near Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a cost-benefit analysis, it's probably worth more
for me to try to get to the United States than stay at my job in El
Salvador,'' the 26-year-old father of two said.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of tears, he said he'd saved and borrowed about
US$900 for his journey from his home in San Miguel, El Salvador.
Back home, in a country rife with crime, he was earning the
equivalent of US$110 a month repairing highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pittance,'' he said. ``We lived through a terrible war.
And now what little you earn gets stolen by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduran Carlos Castillo, 18, said he earned so little at a
T-shirt assembly plant back home _ about US$40 a week _ that his
family also thought it worth him trying his luck at getting to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation in Honduras,'' said Castillo, a
fresh-faced youth who was placed in the holding cell with the
startled look of a deer caught in headlights.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hoping to join his uncle somewhere in Texas, but
he couldn't remember exactly where. He was supposed to call and get
the name of the city once he had traveled deeper into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, which hit Central America almost two years ago,
left its worst path of destruction in Honduras, Castillo's
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people were killed and 70-to-80 percent of
agricultural production was destroyed, along with 33,000 homes. The
U.S. government offered more than $103 million in emergency food
and disaster recovery. About 10 percent of another $291 million to
rebuild roads, health infrastructure and businesses was spent by
this June, according to the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy. We endured non-stop rain and wind. People
went for days without food. All that left big losses. You have to
look hard for ways to survive. So the hurricane had a huge impact
on us,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the migrants waiting to be shipped back home,
Castillo shrugged when asked if he would attempt the trip again.
</P>
<P>
   Most Central Americans caught in Chiapas are deported over the
border to Guatemala, where they travel freely without visas under a
multilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Those crossing illegally into Mexico sometimes walk through
tropical terrain or pay to be ferried across the Suchiate River,
which divides Chiapas from Guatemala. Once inside Mexico, the
migrants take buses or jump on trains heading north, climbing on
top of boxcars or hanging off the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials man roadblocks near the southern border to
check travelers' documents, and patrol the banks of the Suchiate
River. But because of shortages in manpower, the Suchiate appears
in some places to be a virtual no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   An astonishingly bustling trade is carried out daily on the
river, whose banks are lined on both sides with shacks selling food
and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Just a football-field away from an international checkpoint in
Hidalgo, Chiapas, a couple dozen rafts crafted from inner tubes and
wooden planks ply the river, carrying people and loads of
groceries. Guatemalans use the rafts so they can avoid having to
pay tariffs on their purchases at an official checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customs' officials appear unable to stop the illegal
crossings. About the most they do is watch with binoculars and try
to stop drug shipments from coming in, said Neri Corado, one of the
reed-thin men and boys who push the rafts through the river with
long poles.
</P>
<P>
   In an impoverished region where everyone is fighting to survive,
tolerance prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sacred river provides a source of work for us,'' said
Corado. ``Imagine what we would do if it were not here.''

EFFORTS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Norway almost called off its rescue efforts for the
sunken submarine Kursk because of Russian officials' interference
and misinformation, a Norwegian admiral was quoted Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Einar Skorgen said in an interview with the Norwegian
newspaper Nordlandsposten that he told the Russians that his
deepsea divers would not be able to continue their work unless the
Russians became more cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times there were so many wrong details and disinformation
from Russia that it was close to endangering the divers,'' Skorgen
said. ``We couldn't rely on the information we were getting.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he said, Russian officials said wrongly that
undersea currents were too strong for rescue work, that the escape
hatch was too severely damaged to allow a rescue minisubmarine to
attach to it and that the Kursk's hull was cracked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The admiral's complaints ran counter to President Vladimir
Putin's assurances in a half-hour television interview on Wednesday
night that accusations of incompetence in the Russian rescue effort
were unfounded. Both Putin and the Russian navy have come under
attack from critics who say the rescue was too slow and poorly
managed, and that Putin recognized the scope of the incident only
belatedly.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Putin said he believed that Russian military
officials moved swiftly and efficiently when the Kursk exploded and
sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea on Aug. 12. Putin also said
that a much-criticized delay in accepting Norway's offer of aid was
because of unidentified ``technical parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Skorgen said that the Norwegian rescue effort only gained ground
when he used a military hotline to reach the commander of Russia's
northern fleet, Vyacheslav Popov, a colleague from earlier days of
Norwegian-Russian military contacts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Skorgen called Popov three times, and each time the Russian
bureaucracy yielded, he said. A team of four Norwegian and eight
British divers later pried open an escape hatch and confirmed that
the 118 seamen inside the Kursk were dead.

<P>
   On Thursday, a senior Russian military official disputed a
second complaint, from one of the British divers, that his team had
been barred from using a sophisticated minisubmarine specially
designed for undersea rescues.
</P>
<P>
   That diver, Paddy Heron, said in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp.-Scotland television that ``any arrangement or
proposed operation that they spoke about was rescinded, gone back
on, altered or countermanded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If life was still extant,'' he said, ``undoubtedly lives were
then lost by the fact that we sat doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, the deputy chief of the Russian
military general staff, called that accusation groundless at a news
conference on Thursday. Manilov said the minisubmarine was not
needed after it was proved that the Kursk's crew was dead. He also
insisted that the submarine's escape hatch was too severely damaged
for the submersible to dock with it.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the recriminations, families of some of the
crewmembers gathered Thursday in the military town of Vidyayevo to
lay a cornerstone for a memorial to the seamen, and later to sail
to the site of the sunken Kursk to toss flowers and wreaths onto
the waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, which has been stung by criticism about the
sailors' scant pay and their families' dilapidated housing, said it
had collected enough in donations to give each of the 118 families
an additional $27,000 beyond the $7,000 in pay already awarded
them.
</P>
<P>
   And in Murmansk, near the Kursk's home port, Russian prosecutors
opened a criminal inquiry into the two explosions that sank the
submarine. They gave no indication that a specific individual or
group is suspected of causing the blasts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutor-general Vladimir Ustinov said investigators will seek
first to establish the cause of the explosions and that the course
of the inquiry will be set by the evidence they find.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Federal Security Service, Nikolai Patrushev,
confirmed earlier reports that the submarine carried two Dagestani
men who were not members of the regular crew, and said they were
``specialists from a certain Caspian enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Their presence was notable because the Russian region of
Dagestan borders Chechnya, where separatist guerrillas are waging
war against the Russian army, thus raising the prospect that the
Kursk was sunk by a terrorist act. But Patrushev said that his
intelligence service has no information to support that theory.

`SOLOMON AND GAENOR': A FABRIC PEDDLER WHO SOLD HER A BILL OF
GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment the star-crossed title characters in Paul Morrison's
somber love story ``Solomon and Gaenor'' set eyes on each other,
your heart sinks. It is immediately obvious there is nowhere for
these young lovers to travel but down an awfully familiar path from
clandestine ecstasy to pariahhood to tragedy that could take any of
three final twists, all equally predictable. Surrendering yourself
to this well-acted film is never a question of wondering when the
last shoe will drop, but one of how much you'll allow yourself to
identify with its likable but foolish lovers, who break the strict
social rules of their claustrophobically dingy community and pay
the usual price.
</P>
<P>
   That community is an impoverished Welsh coal mining village in
1911. Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) is the eldest son in a devout
Orthodox Jewish family that has recently migrated to Wales from
Russia and has set up a pawnshop that doubles as a drapery
business. One of Solomon's tasks is to go from door to door of the
miners' cottages across the hill, peddling swatches of cloth that
can be made into dresses. One day he stops at the door of Gaenor's
strict, churchgoing family. She answers his knock, and a spark is
lighted.
</P>
<P>
   To the film's considerable credit, the young lovers don't
exactly conform to the Romeo and Juliet stereotype of celestial
innocents crushed by a cruel and envious world. Solomon, the more
morally culpable of the two, is a flagrant liar whose courtship of
Gaenor involves adopting a non-Jewish pseudonym, Sam Livingstone,
and making up a nonexistent Gentile family. As enraptured as
Solomon appears to be during the first throes of their passionate
affair, he never broaches the subject of marriage, which for a time
she assumes is his intention.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Gaenor (Nia Roberts) proves easily seduced. Once
Solomon has given her a pretty red dress he has sewn himself, she
is a goner. She hurls herself into a sexual relationship with
Solomon while hardly knowing him. Neither one seems to have the
slightest awareness of the possibility that she might become
pregnant. Which she does, of course, discovering the pregnancy just
around the time she has given up hope of Solomon's proposing
marriage or even of meeting his family.
</P>
<P>
   Although its storytelling includes a number of small glitches,
the movie does an almost dismayingly good job of conveying its
characters' grim, bare-bones existence and the stultifying sexual
and religious taboos that the lovers flout. And without dwelling on
anti-Semitism, it evokes the tensions between Jews and Gentiles,
which explode into vandalism, arson and looting after a strike
imperils the miners' precarious existence and they take out their
resentment on the local Jewish merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The most emotionally harrowing scenes show the pregnant Gaenor's
brutal denunciation and expulsion from church when her pregnancy is
revealed during a service, and Solomon's rapidly crumbling
relationship with Gaenor's loutish older brother, Crad (Mark Lewis
Jones), who is suspicious of the young stranger from the start
because of his uncallused hands.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a good performance by Gruffudd, whose Solomon
becomes obsessed with Gaenor only after she has rejected him. But
it is Roberts (making her debut) who walks off with the film. Her
understated, beautifully layered performance suggests the spark of
defiance under Gaenor's prim exterior and fans it into a reckless
impulsiveness that eventually deepens into an enfolding womanly
passion containing just a touch of fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Solomon and Gaenor'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes nudity and
sexual situations.

 &HT;    You're tired, your throat hurts. It must be cancer. Or maybe
lupus. Why do women do this to themselves?
 &HT;    By Sharyn Wizda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There it is again, the twinge, just a little
critch in the back of your throat.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just all that talking I did today, nothing but
meetings, you think to yourself, lying in bed trying to get to
sleep. Maybe get up and get some water and I'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes pass. The little voice pipes up again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I have a cold. Maybe I'm getting sick. Well, just get a
lot of sleep and you'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   The dark suddenly seems darker, more ominous.
</P>
<P>
   What if it's something else? I've been kind of tired lately.
What if that has something to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   And so on, and so on, until you've gone with a few twists of the
psyche from being a reasonably healthy person to imagining how you
will cope with the inevitable news from your doctor that you have
cancer. Or chronic fatigue syndrome. Or lupus. (Will I be one of
those brave women that I read about in the magazines? Is this
destined to teach me a valuable lesson about the meaning of life _
but too late?)
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about hypochondria, which typically involves a
good six months of obsessing despite visits to the doctor and
tests. This is something . . . different. Harder to explain, harder
to pinpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I know that I'm an intelligent person and I know
that I'm not crazy,'' says Stacy Miles, 27, an undergraduate
adviser in the University of Texas' Spanish and Portuguese
department. ``I do know that I'm a rational person. But sometimes I
feel irrational in the fears that I have about things that may be
wrong with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I had the flu one time and so I was reading this
self-diagnosis book. My glands were swollen and I managed to
diagnose myself with lymphoma. I really convinced myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles did eventually go to see a physician _ she really did have
the flu. (She never mentioned lymphoma: ``Of course, I didn't want
to go to the doctor and look like an idiot.'')
</P>
<P>
   See, somewhere in the back of your mind you're pretty sure you
don't have anything major wrong with you. But that twinge or that
exhaustion just has to have an explanation, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about some new illness and you think, `Ohhh, is that
why I'm tired all the time?' '' says Ursula Acker Parks, 32, a
budget analyst for the state. ``Those are the ones that get me:
`Oh, maybe that will explain my lethargy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I would much rather believe it was a disease or syndrome of
some sort,'' quips Parks. ``Anything that would not require me to
change my lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   What's causing this millennial wave of worry among women? Well,
for starters, we're all tired. (This goes for men, too, though it
seems that men don't think anything's wrong with them until, say, a
bone is broken. And even then they'll just walk it off.) So maybe
none of us is thinking too clearly to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the reams of information available to us,
more and more all the time. A seemingly endless parade of magazine
and newspaper articles and television stories _ all with comment
from a stricken person saying something to the effect of, ``If I
had just checked it out earlier . . .'' There's the Internet, with
its unfiltered information and quizzes and danger signs. Even the
HMOs are sending us medical manuals, designed to help us avoid the
doctor's office and figure out what we have ourselves. (Call these
the Big Books Of Very Terrifying Things.) Is it any wonder that
what used to be called ``medical students' disease'' has become an
equal-opportunity scare-fest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those type of health Web sites where you can look up symptoms
for things can be discouraging. You put s and women say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have breast pain I tend to think in those moments of
irrationality, `What if it's breast cancer?' '' says Leslie
Strickland, 28, a pre-med student at the University of Texas. ``A
lot of it is just because the publicity is so high about checking
yourself . . . I tend to think that I'm pretty strong _ I lived in
Africa for 2 1/2 years and got exposed to everything from leprosy
to cholera. But even though it's normal to have pain in your
breasts _ that's the only thing that causes me a scared moment,
where I think, `Oh my gosh, I want to not get that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Youngkin, an obstetrician/gynecologist, said many of
his female patients have worries that mirror Strickland's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are very worried about breast cancer, and with good
reason,'' Youngkin says. ``But 10 times more women die from heart
disease than from breast cancer . . . There is a concern that women
have about breast cancer that overwhelms the statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's totally normal, common behavior,'' says
psychotherapist Lisa Mersky. ``With some diseases, the symptoms are
so common . . . fatigue or lack of energy, we all have that because
of modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Both Williams and Mersky, our resident experts,
also confessed to having such thoughts on occasion. But both also
suggest trying to focus on the rational thoughts and facts in your
mind, to repeat those over and over rather than, ``How will I deal
with chemo?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to understand that we have lots of control over
our thoughts. Our thoughts are not imposed on us externally,''
Mersky says. ``So if we remind ourselves that we are in control of
what we are thinking and think about why we are thinking this _ and
decide to stop if you really do want to. This isn't a judgmental
reaction _ `What's wrong with me? This is ridiculous. Why am I
worrying about this?' _ but a lively, curious thing _ `Why do I
need to worry about this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   What's also worth paying attention to is whether these thoughts
are really masking something else _ something you're avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who tend to be worriers can have a very creative
imagination, and it may be that they want as many distractions from
the reason that they're really worried as possible,'' Mersky points
out. If there are deep-seated issues _ anything from being
dissatisfied with a job or relationship to something as serious as
childhood abuse _ that a person is troubled by, one way of coping
is to transfer all that worry into something physical. A disease
could be a life-and-death issue, after all _ it has to take
precedence over everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Barring that, breaking your thought patterns could involve
something as simple as going to the doctor and not being afraid to
voice those fears bullying you in the middle of the night. That's
one way Strickland dealt with her concerns about breast cancer: ``I
just recently went to the doctor and talked to her and that really
allayed a lot of my fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be even easier: Confess to your friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I see a TV show or read something (about a disease)
that's when I start to think about it a little bit more,'' says
Miles, who admits she's worried about skin cancer and
obsessive-compulsive disorder, among others. ``But then when I sit
down with my friends and we laugh about it _ it's not serious: `Oh,
I self-diagnosed myself with OCD the other day.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And it just doesn't seem real anymore.''

``EYEWITNESS TO POWER'': MASTER OF SPIN PUTS HIS CRAFT TO WORK FOR
HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his new book on presidential leadership, the veteran White
House adviser David Gergen laments the current state of politics,
the ascendance of spin and media manipulation and the tendency of
politicians like Bill Clinton to mistake campaigning for
governance. ``The 1980 contest for the White House was the last
truly good one the country has had,'' he writes, ``because all
three candidates _ Carter, Anderson and Reagan _ provided clear
choices for the electorate. They said exactly what courses they
intended to pursue if elected, didn't blur their differences, held
down the mud slinging, and didn't sell their souls to their
pollsters and handlers.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Gergen himself is one of the people who
helped create this sorry state of affairs; he has effectively made
a career out of playing the role of the little man behind the
curtain in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' helping to orchestrate the auras
of the great and powerful. It was Gergen who helped institute
``spin patrol'' during the Reagan years, using his mastery of
leaking, damage control and sound bites to package and promote that
administration's policies. And it was Gergen who was later enlisted
by an embattled Clinton White House _ which had reviled many of
Reagan's conservative stands _ to help shore up its operations and
public image.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Gergen's easy transit from being a Republican
helpmate to being a Democratic one, from being a White House
spinmeister to being a journalistic one (he is currently
editor-at-large for U.S. News &AMP; World Report and a regular analyst
on ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'') underscores the pragmatic _
some would say mercenary _ ethos of a political era that
increasingly values expertise over conviction, style over
substance. Gergen's description of himself as a ``pro-choice, high
safety net man'' did not keep him from working for Ronald Reagan,
just as his ``hard-line'' views in international affairs did not
keep him from working for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eyewitness to Power'' Gergen tries to spin his own image,
repudiating the consequences of the very processes he helped set in
motion. ``How could we have taught a younger generation of public
officials the wrong lessons about governance?'' he asks. ``Where
had we gone wrong? While officials since the beginning of the
republic have been cajoling the press, one of my deepest regrets in
public life is a feeling that I have contributed to this
deterioration. Spin has spun out of control and we need to put it
back in its box.''
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that his former Reagan colleague James
Baker 3rd tried in his memoirs (``The Politics of Diplomacy'') to
put his reputation as ``The Velvet Hammer'' behind him and reinvent
himself as a statesman, so Gergen tries in this volume to put his
reputation as ``The Sieve'' behind him and reinvent himself as a
Washington wise man. ``Eyewitness,'' which recounts Gergen's
experiences working with Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan
and Bill Clinton, is at once a hypocritical mea culpa and a series
of talking points designed to insure the author's reputation as the
insider's insider.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gergen's public persona, familiar to readers from his many
television appearances as both a pundit and a White House
spokesman, this book is low-key and conciliatory in tone, almost
every criticism balanced with a compliment. President Clinton,
whose service Gergen left after 18 months, feeling ``angry'' and
``used,'' receives the harshest treatment; he is repeatedly
criticized for his lack of self-control, his poor management style
and his reliance on his wife as a political partner.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally a faint whiff of ``I told you so'' creeps into the
book's pages. Had President Ford put a strong chief of staff in
place from the start as Gergen wished, it is suggested, his
administration might have avoided many of its early and
debilitating stumbles. Had Clinton listened to Gergen and others
who advised him to make a full disclosure of Whitewater documents
from the start, ``we would have punctured the growing pressure for
an independent counsel'' and the whole ensuing melodrama with
Kenneth Starr and Monica Lewinsky might well have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing heavily on Gergen's own reminiscences _ as well as such
works on leadership as Garry Wills' ``Certain Trumpets'' and Howard
Gardner's ``Leading Minds'' _ ``Eyewitness to Power'' sifts through
the record of recent administrations to give future would-be
presidents some tips on how to be an effective leader. Though
Gergen's analysis of individual presidents is often shrewd, many of
his tips are little more than the sort of common-sense
recommendations one might find in a self-help book: i.e.,
``leadership starts from within,'' or surround yourself with
``strong, prudent advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observations will be self-evident to anyone familiar with
recent history. Gergen points out that the Nixon White House went
too far in ``trying to manage the news'' and that Clinton shared
Nixon's intelligence, obsession with spinning, tendency to polarize
and compulsive need to win.
</P>
<P>
   In Gergen's opinion, Clinton's failure to take control of the
health care initiative was connected to his unwillingness to
challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton in the wake of reports alleging
that he had used Arkansas state troopers to procure women. ``Might
we have passed a bipartisan reform plan,'' Gergen asks, if the
shadow of Bill Clinton's past ``had not hung over his relationship
with his wife?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Gergen frequently mentions the importance of character
and goals in this volume, most of his advice revolves around
strategy and stagecraft and the best way to play the game. The
focus tends to be on presentation and perception, not morality or
vision. For instance, in the case of Ford's pardon of Richard
Nixon, Gergen writes, ``it was in the execution of his decision _
not the decision itself _ that the new president stumbled.''
Instead of simply springing the pardon on an unsuspecting country,
he argues, Ford should have carefully laid the proper groundwork
first.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eyewitness to Power'' Gergen also devotes a large amount of
space to drawing lessons in communication from Reagan's speeches:
keep it short and brisk, he advises, ``use the language of the
living room,'' ``look for catchy facts,'' ``use the occasional
prop,'' ``be positive,'' ``anticipate the critics'' and ``have a
good closer.'' Gergen argues that historical allusions can lend a
leader ``an aura of distinction,'' and he emphasizes the
importance, in the first 100 days, of establishing a positive
narrative in the public's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more important to the success of an actor, it
is said, than his performance in his first scene and in his last,''
Gergen writes. ``One shapes his character for the entire play, the
other the memories that the audience carries from the theater. The
same applies in politics and in other fields of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The analogy between actors and politicians is no accident: in
the spin-driven world Gergen has helped create, the line between
the two has become increasingly blurry, with handlers like himself
cast in the ever more visible role of director.

MISADVENTURES ON THE ROAD TO `LOVE AND SEX' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``First love is the most powerful because nobody's been hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is a minefield.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in relationships. Mine just happen to be short
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women like to turn men into weirdos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you're with the same person, the more annoying
they'll become.''
</P>
<P>
   That is but a sampling of the wit and wisdom that Valerie
Breiman has managed to pump into her slight but bright and charming
romantic comedy, ``Love and Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Breiman, this film tracks the
misadventurous road to love taken by Kate Welles (Famke Janssen)
from her girlhood playground passion to her loss of virginity to
her high school French teacher to _ one hopes _ a happy ending with
Adam Levy (Jon Favreau), the artist who shamelessly spirits her
away from a standup comedian at an exhibition of his latest
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Kate herself is a writer for one of those trendy women's
magazines where orders from her demanding boss to come up with
2,500 happy, perky words by the end of the day on how to find and
keep that perfect man prompt her to ponder the flashback-inducing
question: What makes a relationship last forever?
</P>
<P>
   Although Kate's relationship with Adam starts off happily and
progresses in stages to sex and other intimacies, living together,
cute arguments over tastes in films, and eventually to pregnancy,
it descends into sexlessness, annoyance, resentment over past
affairs and a decision to part company.
</P>
<P>
   While Kate and Adam remain in touch, she is soon partying with a
young man described as a perverted basketball player obsessed with
her derriere, followed by a torrid affair with the not-too-bright
but hunky star of topless Ninja movies who picks her up while she
is shopping in a store specializing in devices for the enhancement
of sexual pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Sex'' is occasionally too cute for its own good, but
it is packed with recognizable situations. Janssen and Favreau
provide enjoyably consoling company for those still dating their
way through life.

`BRING IT ON': STRONG, MODEST AND SINCERE BEHIND ALL THE GIDDY
CHEER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since ``Bring It On'' is a movie about high school cheerleaders,
you might expect whatever plot it has to be a flimsy scaffolding
for the shameless exploitation of young women in short skirts _ a
slice of diet cheesecake, a ``Coyote Not Quite So Ugly.'' And you
wouldn't be entirely wrong. Kirsten Dunst, who plays Torrance
Shipman, the striving, energetic captain of a Southern California
pompom squad, displays her bellybutton in nearly every frame of the
picture, and when she's not wearing her cute red and black uniform,
she's outfitted in pajamas, a bikini or, when modesty (or the
school dress code) demands, a series of colorful sports bras.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bring It On,'' directed with giddy, sometimes sloppy
pep-rally intensity by Peyton Reed from a brisk, slangy script by
Jessica Bendinger, is more than a low-minded appeal to male lechery
_ though it does feature an extended visit to the girls' locker
room, a scene in which the cheerleaders don skimpy bathing suits
and wash cars (it's a fundraiser), and of course innumerable
splits, leg extensions and carefully photographed bounces. But in
the post-Brandi Chastain era, female athleticism and female
sexuality seem closer together than ever, and underneath this
movie's tight acrylic sweater beats an unapologetically feminist
heart.
</P>
<P>
   If Reed's camera can't help ogle Torrance and her teammates,
Bendinger's script manages to respect their hard work and their
aspirations. It may be impossible to dispel the notion that
cheerleading is a silly, trivial enterprise _ a notion upon which
much of the comedy in ``Bring It On'' depends _ but this movie
rarely feels cynical, condescending or cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerleading, the filmmakers insist, is a sport, requiring
discipline, timing and strength as well as, um, certain
physiological gifts. One of the running jokes is that the Rancho
Grande High School football team _ represented by a couple of dim,
clueless jerks _ loses every game, while the cheering squad has
racked up five consecutive national championships. And ``Bring It
On'' is, structurally as well as thematically, a sports movie,
following Torrance and her squad through the anxieties and
tribulations of a season aimed toward the climactic national
championships in Daytona, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Their main competition comes from the East Compton Clovers, a
mostly black inner-city squad whose crowd-pleasing routines
Torrance's villainous predecessor (Lindsay Sloane) had plagiarized.
``My whole cheerleading career is based on a lie,'' Torrance
laments when she learns of the theft, and the film is at its most
honest and interesting when it deals with the consequences of her
discovery, and her relationship with Isis (Gabrielle Union),
Clovers' proud captain.
</P>
<P>
   A whole movie, rather than just a subplot, might have been
devoted to East Compton's struggle for recognition, and to the
out-of-uniform lives of Isis' squad, played with gusto by the
members of the singing group Blaque. As it is, the Clovers are on
hand to serve as symbols of a complexity the movie isn't quite able
to explore. They're better dancers and better athletes than their
white counterparts, and also, for all their gumption and
self-sufficiency, the agents of a white girl's moral awakening.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the fact that a bouncy teen-age sports comedy
can even gesture toward serious matters of race and economic
inequality is pretty impressive, as is the occasional snarl of
genuine satire. The vicious back-stabbing and defensive homophobia
of the cheerleaders seems as accurate as the high-school vernacular
in which they address one another, and even the cheering hides an
edge of hostility behind its smiling allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right, that's OK,/ You're gonna pump our gas some
day,'' the Rancho Grande squad chants in the faces of rivals from a
less affluent school district. And the opening sequence of
strutting cheerleaders mocking their own power and vulnerability
puts those in the audience out for a cheap voyeuristic thrill on
the defensive from the start, picking up where ``American Beauty''
left off.
</P>
<P>
   And then retreating. ``Bring It On'' is, in the end, a deeply
conventional movie, which is hardly surprising given that it
combines two of the most convention-bound genres in existence. In
addition to being a sports movie, it's a teen-age romantic comedy,
which means that Torrance must give up bad, popular Aaron (Richard
Hillman) for cute, goodhearted misfit Cliff (Jesse Bradford).
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, with his crooked smile and his unthreatening coolness,
is perfectly suited for the role. But it is Dunst who carries the
movie and unifies its disparate elements. She's a terrific comic
actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the
nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to
genuine hurt.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt with the preservation of its PG-13 rating in view,
``Bring It On'' tiptoes around the issue of sex even as it flaunts
its wholesome sex appeal. But in one scene, when Torrance and Cliff
surprise each other while brushing their teeth, it ascends to the
frothy, sublimated seductiveness of classic screwball. Dunst's
expression as she emerges from the bathroom, having done nothing
more risque than spit in the sink, is perfectly enigmatic and
completely convincing, a mixture of mischievous amazement and
unconscious arousal. It's a wonderfully subtle moment _ exactly
what you'd expect from a cheerleader movie.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Bring It On'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). Its characters swear occasionally and almost never
appear fully dressed.
</P>

WHERE HERITAGE AND TRANQUILITY SHARE THE WEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNISH, N.H. _ ``Walk your horses or pay two dollars' fine.''
</P>
<P>
   That command, painted in black letters, looms above the heads of
drivers venturing onto America's longest covered bridge, which
spans the Connecticut River between this town and Windsor, Vt., on
the opposite shore.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the sign was put up, it seems fair to read its intent
as saying: ``Take it easy and look around.'' It's a good idea,
because this area, halfway up the Vermont-New Hampshire border, is
rich in recreational opportunities and cultural rewards.
</P>
<P>
   On the New Hampshire side, head two miles north on Route 12A in
Cornish and you will find yourself at the Saint-Gaudens National
Historical Park, the only unit of the National Park Service
dedicated to the memory of an American sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   An artist celebrated in the late 19th century and lately the
subject of renewed admiration, Augustus Saint-Gaudens created
realistic statues and bas-reliefs of prominent figures of his era.
</P>
<P>
   He is probably best known to New Yorkers for his equestrian
statue of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, which strides forth from
Grand Army Plaza at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in New York. His
Abraham Lincoln stands in Lincoln Park, Chicago. And his statue of
the Rev. Phillips Brooks can be seen outside Trinity Church in
Boston's Copley Square. Models and sketches for some of these and
other works are displayed in Saint-Gaudens' capacious studio.
Bronze casts of other statues are arranged throughout the handsome
grounds of the outdoor museum.
</P>
<P>
   From the covered bridge, too, you can drive west to Woodstock,
Vt., home to the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Site,
which incorporates a conservationist theme, as well as impressive
19th-century houses and churches, a network of mountain trails and
boutiques aplenty. My wife, Margaret, and I chose a midsummer
weekend to visit the area. We looked forward to a scenic drive
along Vermont's twisting back roads. We did get that drive, but
only after the adventure of having the family car give out (in a
driving rainstorm, no less) in Bennington, Vt., 100 miles short of
our goal. The AAA-dispatched mechanic shook his head at my
ignorance of local custom when I asked _ while he and I stood by
the upraised hood, getting soaked to the skin _ if it was possible
to have someone look at the car that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidewalks around here roll up at 5,'' he said. A glance at my
watch showed we had 15 minutes to get the car into a garage, where
we could at least get it onto a mechanic's schedule for the coming
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But here luck provided a safety net: a Mazda dealer stood only
two blocks away. The service department took in our elderly 626,
the manager directed us to what may well have been the last
available rental car in town and an employee entertained our
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   So, after two hours' delay, we could press onward through the
storm to the Woodstock Inn, assuring each other that it could have
been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning when we looked out our window we saw to our
relief that the rain had finally stopped, although the skies
remained cloudy. On emerging from the hotel (a very child-friendly
place, we happily discovered), we found ourselves facing the
village green, a covered bridge and, as a backdrop to it all, the
forested slopes of 1,400-foot Mount Tom. Altogether, it was
everything tourists hope for when they imagine a picturesque New
England village.
</P>
<P>
   And tourists there were, flowing up and down the sidewalks along
Center and Elm Streets and packing the tables in the local
restaurants. But you don't have to go far to find ample elbow room.
The Saint-Gaudens site, a 20-minute drive away, sits atop a lovely,
partly forested expanse of ground above the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   The area includes Aspet, a former tavern that the Irish-born
sculptor (whose name is pronounced saint-GODD-ens) converted into
his home after he began visiting the area in 1885. The property was
donated to the Park Service in 1965, after four decades as a
private memorial to the sculptor, established by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the sculptor's studio, whose classical porch frames a
view of Mount Ascutney to the southwest. Exhibits inside the studio
introduce visitors to Saint-Gaudens' work, including a sleek nude
figure of the Greek goddess Diana, with bow and arrow poised to
shoot. In its time, it was considered slightly scandalous, probably
owing to its prominent display of the undraped female body. The
original gilded copper figure served as a weathervane, crowning an
earlier Madison Square Garden, a Stanford White building that
opened in 1890 for concerts, sports events and political
conventions. Diana was New York's first statue illuminated at night
by electric lights. She came down in 1925, removed before the
building was razed, and now stands in the Philadelphia Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Gaudens began his career as a carver of tiny cameos,
during his youth in Civil War-era New York. He developed his
talents as a young man in Paris and Rome. But his career, spent
mostly in New York, really began to take off when, at 28, he
received a commission to create a statue honoring the Union naval
hero Adm. David Farragut, victor of the Civil War battles of New
Orleans and Mobile Bay. The statue stands in Madison Square Park in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Gaudens' life intersected with those of many famous
American figures in the arts, like Stanford White, Charles Follen
McKim and the painter John LaFarge. He married Augusta Homer, a
cousin of Winslow Homer.
</P>
<P>
   The historic site does not overwhelm the visitor with
information. Instead, there is opportunity to wander the estate's
formal gardens and study casts of some of the sculptor's works.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is his bas-relief Robert Gould Shaw Memorial, another
Civil War monument, this one celebrating the slain commander of the
54th Massachusetts and the black troops who fought with him. It was
the first monument to black soldiers who fought in the Civil War.
(Their feats were depicted in the film ``Glory.'') An earlier
version of the monument stands at Boston Common.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a separate grove is the quietly powerful statue Saint-Gaudens
created to adorn the tomb of Clover Adams, Henry Adams' wife, who
committed suicide in 1885. The original stands in Rock Creek
Cemetery in Washington, where it has drawn many admirers. One was
Eleanor Roosevelt, who regarded the statue as a female figure
representing someone who had ``transcended pain and hurt to achieve
serenity,'' according to ``The Life and Work of Augustus
Saint-Gaudens,'' by Burke Wilkinson (Dover, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   A newer gallery nearby contains a small atrium and pool and
displays of busts and bas-reliefs, including studies the sculptor
did for the Robert Louis Stevenson memorial in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   And visiting this open-air museum, we found it easy to be drawn
to a closer look at the surrounding woods and hills.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday we climbed Mount Tom from its base in Faulkner Park in
Woodstock, a very short walk from the village green. A 1.6-mile
trail led us to the summit as the sound of church bells rose from
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Split-log benches have been thoughtfully provided along the
trail. At three points near the summit, views over the surrounding
valley are particularly rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, feeling ready for something on flatter ground, we
stopped by the Billings Farm and Museum, a neatly kept, working
dairy farm that continues the conservationist ethic of its founder,
a Vermonter named Frederick Billings.
</P>
<P>
   He made his wealth in the West during the mid-19th century
(leaving his name on the city of Billings, Mont.) before returning
home and adopting the conservationist ideas of an earlier Woodstock
resident, George Perkins Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Billings Farm is clearly a family destination,
thronged with parents and young children the afternoon we visited.
Most of them, it seemed, chose to gather in the cow barn, to watch
a farm employee milk the herd (by machine, not by hand) and to
stand awed as the cows went noisily about their digestive business.
</P>
<P>
   But while the farm offers the very young the chance to see big
animals up close, there is much else to be learned, too. When we
stopped by the 1890 farmhouse, a guide eagerly explained the
process of making butter, the farm's specialty a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   A pound, packed and shipped in a round ash wood box, cost 30
cents by the time it reached Boston. That seemed steep for the era.
But, the guide said: ``In 1890, you had two choices for cooking:
you had butter and you had lard. And if you lived in a city and
didn't have a cow, you paid 30 cents a pound.''
</P>
<P>
   She also told us Vermont's landscape today is vastly different
from that of a century ago. Back then the state served the timber
industry too well. The demands of house builders and the railroads
led to a stripping of the wooded landscape. Mount Tom was fairly
denuded.
</P>
<P>
   The interest of Marsh and Billings in reforestation, as well as
the conservation interests of a later resident of the same
property, Laurance S. Rockefeller, is related at a larger site,
across Route 12 from the farm, the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller
National Historical Park. The Park service offers tours and
information on the history of conservation.
</P>
<P>
   All this added to our appreciation of the landscape as we drove
south on our return, a route that took us past Calvin Coolidge's
boyhood farm, now a historic site in Plymouth, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   But once we reached Bennington, our talk by necessity turned to
the mechanical, focusing specifically on that part of a car's
engine called the distributor, how it works and what a new one
costs. But this was another matter.
</P>
<P>

THE COMPUTERS OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story is being transmitted to entertainment and
lifestyle wires) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe inspiration strikes simultaneously, but a couple of
magazines have trotted out their visions of the ultimate computer
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Such exercises by serious computer geeks are fun to ponder
because of what such dream machines say about where the rest of us
will be in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum PC put together a maximum machine that's pretty amazing.
Then again, it better be: It costs a shade under $12,000, which
would buy either an excellent used car or about 13 of the perfectly
satisfactory Dell Dimension L computers advertised on the
magazine's back cover.
</P>
<P>
   At $899, the Dell features a sturdy 667-Mhz Pentium III
processor, smallish 7.5 gigabyte hard drive and 15-inch monitor,
speakers and decent CD-ROM drive. It's pretty good and a reliable
enough buy for anyone with modest computing needs.
</P>
<P>
   But ``pretty good'' isn't what interests the Maximum boys. So
what ate the cash?
</P>
<P>
   Well, three superfast hard drives, including a 75-gigabyte IBM
device that looks like a bargain for serious space needs; a fast
Pioneer DVD drive; two very fast Plextor CD-rewritable drives
!ital!and a Plextor CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   It has two 256-megabyte memory modules (at $990 apiece, where
one is double what most people need), and not one but two
1-gigahertz Pentium III processors (at $1,100 each, again more than
double most people's needs), to make everything go, in Steve Jobs'
words about his own company's dual-processor Power Macs, ``wicked
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maximum machine has other little goodies, like a Creative
Labs Live Drive II that provides connections to and from all kinds
of audio devices and Sigma Designs' Real Magic Hollywood Plus,
which lets you play DVDs at high quality on your computer or
television.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the components are cheap, such as the Hollywood Plus
($70) and the Logitech First Mouse Wheel ($20). Others are
reasonable, like the fine $250 Klipsch ProMedia v.2-400 speaker
set. To Maximum PC's credit, the magazine also suggests
budget-priced alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   PC Upgrade magazine put together a more modest super machine
specifically for gamers, centered around a 1-gigahertz AMD Athlon
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Maximum machine, this is a box with a purpose: to
play high-end games. That focus reduces the need for lily gilding
(such as Maximum's dual recordable CD drives), cutting costs to a
more reasonable (ha!) $3,199 (or three Dells plus copies of Diablo
II and Deus Ex to get started playing).
</P>
<P>
   To make pretty pictures, they relied on Hercules' 3-D Prophet
DDR-DVI graphics card, which takes a big load off the computer's
brain in generating all the demanding surfaces, lighting and
shading of top-quality games. The Prophet is one of several
graphics cards out there that uses the industry-leading GeForce
chips from nVidia, combining two of them along with lots of
dedicated memory.
</P>
<P>
   They recommend Logitech's Wingman mouse ($99) and Mad Catz's
Panther DX joystick ($39) to control the games, and ELSA's 3-D
Revelator glasses ($59). So what does any of this supertech have to
do with writing a letter to Grandma or checking your e-mail? Not a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   But truth is, these machines are where we're going, with
powerful electronics capable of handling increasingly sophisticated
entertainment of many kinds, supplanting or combining many of the
devices we have lying around the house already. Consider these
dream machines a peek at our reality, in a few years. &QL;

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore gains in four states
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore has caught George W. Bush in Michigan, taken a lead in
Minnesota and New Jersey and slightly increased his lead in
California, according to state polls taken after the Democratic
convention. The surveys, released today, are generally in line with
other polls that have shown Gore getting the benefit of a
post-convention ``bounce'' that presidential candidates often
receive. California, with 54 electoral votes, Minnesota with 10,
New Jersey with 15, and Michigan with 18 together account for more
than one-third of the 270 needed for election in November. While
such bumps in the polls can be a temporary phenomenon, they could
rearrange the state-by-state landscape in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   HERE'S WHERE ONE TAX CUT WOULD GO . . .
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush campaigned in Louisiana today with a family he
said would benefit greatly from his proposals and not at all from
rival Al Gore's. Upon landing at the airport in New Orleans, Bush
presented local residents Andrew and Margaret Bechac as a family
with two children that would receive a 77 percent reduction in
their federal income taxes under his plan. ``I want to put a face
on the current tax relief package,'' Bush said with the Bechacs at
his side. Earlier in the week, he said he needed to do a better job
explaining his $1.3 trillion proposal in the face of criticism from
Gore, who has offered a $500 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   . . . BUT GENERAL DIRECTION IS QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman, in a pointed critique of George W. Bush's tax-cut
plan, says Bush is having a hard time explaining it because it's
not fair. Seizing on Bush's acknowledgment that he needed to do a
better job of explaining his plan to cut income taxes across the
board, Lieberman asserted: ``The problem isn't explaining the tax
cut; the problem is the plan itself. It benefits the wealthy, not
the hard-working families of America.'' Lieberman said there's
``nothing wrong with being rich _ in America, we all want to be
rich. The point is who needs the tax cut, who needs the help.''
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN POLICY AND EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore showed off his international and domestic sides today,
meeting with Mexico's president-elect before heading to the nearby
University of Maryland to plug his proposal to make college tuition
tax deductible. Gore highlighted his foreign-policy experience in
the meeting with Vicente Fox at the vice president's official
residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Gore says his proposal for
a college tuition tax credit would save most families about $2,800
a year and assure that college would not ``be limited to families
of wealth and means.''
</P>
<P>
   CHECKERED TEACHING CAREER
</P>
<P>
   Ezola Foster, Pat Buchanan's running mate on the Reform Party
ticket, collected workers' compensation payments for a year for a
mental disorder she now says she did not have. The disability claim
was contested by her employer, the Los Angeles Unified School
District. Foster applied for workers' compensation in 1996, shortly
after refusing to return to her job as a typing teacher at Bell
High School. The reason she could not return to work, she told the
Los Angeles Times, was that her outspoken opposition to illegal
immigration had made her a target of what she claimed was
hatemongering and physical threats at an overwhelmingly Latino
school. Foster is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE TABLE?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush may be chuckling over the debate about
presidential debates, but his staff is serious about shaping this
year's encounters to be favorable for their candidate. The Boston
Globe reports that Bush opposes the podium-and-panelist method that
has dominated recent presidential debates. Instead, Bush wants a
more intimate roundtable discussion like the primary debate in
February where he, John McCain of Arizona and Alan Keyes sat
face-to-face with CNN's Larry King before a live audience. Bush's
advisers say the traditional debate format features ``gotcha''
questions from reporters who serve as panelists.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER BIG CONCERT BOOKED
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee will invade New York's Radio
City Music Hall for the sequel to a convention-ending fund-raising
gala that raised $5.1 million. The lineup for the Sept. 14 event
rivals the concert schedule at any summer venue. It includes
Crosby, Stills and Nash; Jimmy Buffett, Sheryl Crow; Bon Jovi;
Lenny Kravitz; Bette Midler; Macy Gray; Don Henley and Glenn Frey.
Comedian John Leguizamo will serve as M.C. Ticket prices: $125 to
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM BALLOT BATTLES
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the Reform Party's national convention was
supposed to choose a nominee, the battle continues between Pat
Buchanan, the former Republican, and John Hagelin, the Natural Law
candidate embraced by supporters of Reform Party founder Ross
Perot. Iowa election officials drew Buchanan's name from a glass
bowl today after a raucous hallway exchange between party factions
fighting for a spot on the state's November ballot. Hagelin was the
winner in a film-can drawing in Montana. In California, Buchanan
had been briefly listed, but was pulled from the ballot today at
the request of party leaders, said Alfie Charles, a spokesman for
the secretary of state there.
</P>
<P>
   COMPENSATION QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times report questioned whether Dick Cheney is worth
the the multimillion-dollar retirement package he got from
Halliburton, the oil services company where he had been CEO. Cheney
presided over a merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries,
a deal that led to several money-losing ventures, including a South
American pipeline project that lost $100 million. Halliburton's
stock price rose sharply in Cheney's first years as CEO, but has
stagnated in the past year and a half. The board of directors
withheld bonuses last year from Cheney and other top execs for
missing financial targets for 1998 and 1999. And the company also
has faced fines for missed deadlines and unsatisfactory work in
North Carolina and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   THE KOSHER ELVIS
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman campaigned like a rock star in a predominantly
Jewish retirement community. But the policy message about
prescription drug prices and elder care was nearly drowned out by
the in-house band's rendition of ``Hava Nagila.'' There were shouts
of ``Joe! Joe! Joe!'' at the sight of the Orthodox Jewish veep
candidate. One small, silver-haired woman left a red lipstick
imprint on the back of Lieberman's hand and gushed, ``It's like
kissing the Torah, kissing you.'' By the way, Al Gore was there
too.
</P>
<P>
   KARENNA IN FOR AILING MOM
</P>
<P>
   A post-convention flu has felled Tipper Gore, so her eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, is taking her place on the campaign
trail this week. Al Gore's Nashville-based presidential campaign
announced that his wife was too ill from the nonstop campaigning
around last week's Democratic convention to keep her dates in
Pittsburgh and Erie, Pa., today. Tipper Gore is scheduled to join
her husband Monday on a trip to Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   THAT OLD CALIFORNIA CONFIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is predicting that he and George W. Bush will take
California on Election Day. ``This is an absolutely essential state
in this election,'' Cheney told about 70 Republican elected
officials and supporters after flying in to Santa Barbara for two
fund-raisers. ``Governor Bush was here last week; I'm here this
week,'' he said at the airport. ``We're both going to be back a lot
between now and November 7 because on November 7 we're going to
carry California.'' Cheney sounded a family values theme, noting
that he and wife Lynne have been married 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS SCUTTLE AD
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party abruptly dropped plans to air a TV ad
questioning the veracity of Al Gore and President Clinton, fearing
a backlash if moderate and independent voters viewed the spot as a
reference to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Officials with George W.
Bush's campaign and at the Republican National Committee also
apparently objected on grounds that the ad used an outdated Gore
interview and conflicted with Bush's promise to soften the tenor of
American politics. The TV spot had been scheduled for broadcast in
Texas as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT SPEECHES, SHORT DAYS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush recently cut short a day of running for president
to make time for his 3-mile run back home in Texas, ordering his
entourage to leave Memphis _ the site of his only event that day _
several hours early. It was just the latest example of Bush
maintaining a mix of down time in his campaign schedule after the
primaries, when he increased his appearances in an effort to beat
back the challenge by John McCain. Since then, his preference for
early bedtimes and short campaign swings have prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   IF NOT RELIGIOUS, THEN MILITARY VALUES
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, a former secretary of defense, met with uniformed
Junior ROTC students to praise the values taught in the officer
training program and the military. Flanked by future troops, Cheney
emphasized that public schools should build character by teaching
traditional values. ``Nothing is more essential to education than
character,'' he told students, teachers and parents at Bakersfield
High School in California. Cheney said he favored a more prominent
role for prayer in public schools, but that care must be taken to
maintain the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   HONEY, I SHRUNK THE MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking of America's military, now decried by George W.
Bush as one of the Clinton administration's biggest sins, was
pushed by running mate Dick Cheney as Bush's father's defense
secretary a decade ago. After the fall of the Berlin Wall _ and
with a Congress hungry for a ``peace dividend'' _ Cheney in 1990
proposed a gradual 25 percent reduction in the military:
withdrawing tens of thousands of troops from Europe, canceling
weapons programs, and removing 442,000 men and women from the
military over five years. ``I've got a 10-pound defense program and
a 6-pound defense budget. Somehow we've got to squeeze one down so
it fits,'' he said in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush would love to have the voters'
undivided attention, but they're not going to get it. The
presidential race is about to be overtaken by a big wave of
diversions and distractions, forcing the candidates to compete with
the Summer Olympics; the U.S. Open tennis tournament, the start of
football, basketball and hockey seasons; major league baseball
playoffs and a World Series stretching into late October.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING A READ ON IT
</P>
<P>
   Since the Democratic convention ended last week, Amazon.com saw
sales for books about Al Gore expand their lead over sales for
books about George W. Bush. Gore book sales are leading now, with a
54-46 percent edge. That's up from 51-49 percent last week.
Bush-related books had held a strong lead since the index was first
posted last month. You can keep up with the book race at
www.amazon.com/election2000. The index is updated weekly.

<P>
   Maybe inspiration strikes simultaneously, but a couple of
magazines have trotted out their visions of the ultimate computer
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Such exercises by serious computer geeks are fun to ponder
because of what such dream machines say about where the rest of us
will be in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum PC put together a maximum machine that's pretty amazing.
Then again, it better be: It costs a shade under $12,000, which
would buy either an excellent used car or about 13 of the perfectly
satisfactory Dell Dimension L computers advertised on the
magazine's back cover.
</P>
<P>
   At $899, the Dell features a sturdy 667-Mhz Pentium III
processor, smallish 7.5 gigabyte hard drive and 15-inch monitor,
speakers and decent CD-ROM drive. It's pretty good and a reliable
enough buy for anyone with modest computing needs.
</P>
<P>
   But ``pretty good'' isn't what interests the Maximum boys. So
what ate the cash?
</P>
<P>
   Well, three superfast hard drives, including a 75-gigabyte IBM
device that looks like a bargain for serious space needs; a fast
Pioneer DVD drive; two very fast Plextor CD-rewritable drives
!ital!and a Plextor CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   It has two 256-megabyte memory modules (at $990 apiece, where
one is double what most people need), and not one but two
1-gigahertz Pentium III processors (at $1,100 each, again more than
double most people's needs), to make everything go, in Steve Jobs'
words about his own company's dual-processor Power Macs, ``wicked
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maximum machine has other little goodies, like a Creative
Labs Live Drive II that provides connections to and from all kinds
of audio devices and Sigma Designs' Real Magic Hollywood Plus,
which lets you play DVDs at high quality on your computer or
television.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the components are cheap, such as the Hollywood Plus
($70) and the Logitech First Mouse Wheel ($20). Others are
reasonable, like the fine $250 Klipsch ProMedia v.2-400 speaker
set. To Maximum PC's credit, the magazine also suggests
budget-priced alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   PC Upgrade magazine put together a more modest super machine
specifically for gamers, centered around a 1-gigahertz AMD Athlon
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Maximum machine, this is a box with a purpose: to
play high-end games. That focus reduces the need for lily gilding
(such as Maximum's dual recordable CD drives), cutting costs to a
more reasonable (ha!) $3,199 (or three Dells plus copies of Diablo
II and Deus Ex to get started playing).
</P>
<P>
   To make pretty pictures, they relied on Hercules' 3-D Prophet
DDR-DVI graphics card, which takes a big load off the computer's
brain in generating all the demanding surfaces, lighting and
shading of top-quality games. The Prophet is one of several

do with writing a letter to Grandma or checking your e-mail? Not a
lot.
</P>

   But truth is, these machines are where we're going, with

 &HT;    GORE REACHES OUT TO VOTERS TURNED OFF BY POLITICS
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore has begun emphasizing a
subtle theme on the stump, aimed at countering the political
estrangement among young and middle-aged voters alike.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in the Midwest this week, Gore asked voters at
nearly every stop to ``open your hearts'' and ``break through your
disillusionment'' and ``allow yourself to believe that we can do
the right thing'' as a nation.
</P>
<P>
   When he begins this portion of his stump speech, ``I see the
heads start to nod out there'' in the crowd, Gore said in an
interview following his trip down the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his words referred not only to the reaction against
President Clinton's behavior, but also to the disenchantment with
politics in general.
</P>
<P>
   Gore traces this disillusionment to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy in 1963, followed by the Vietnam War, the
assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in
1968, and the Watergate scandal that led to President Nixon's
resignation. It has been exacerbated in recent years, he said, by
the country's sometimes painful transition to an information
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reference to the last two years _ it's a reference
to the last 35 years or so,'' Gore said. ``There really are a lot
of people who feel like they've been burned, not by Clinton's
activities _ or maybe that, too _ but mainly it's because of the
cynicism and the ironic detachment, the feeling that politics is
not worthy of smart people, committed people getting involved,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, to hell with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``open your hearts'' portion of Gore's stump speech usually
comes at the end, soft and earnest, a somewhat jarring transition
from the fiery populist attacks on ``Big Oil, Big Tobacco and
HMOs'' that make up most of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   It is most often directed to ``the young people'' in the
audience, the teenagers and twenty-somethings that are the least
likely to vote in presidential contests, but who helped swell the
turnouts for such political mavericks as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Gov. Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During Gore's just-completed boat trip down a 400-mile stretch
of the Mississippi, his appeal captured the imagination of not only
these elusive voters, but also some of Gore's fellow baby boomers
and those of President Kennedy's generation, who wistfully recall
the promise of the New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Seeing him got me all revved up,'' said Shirley Chaney, 49,
in Hannibal, Mo., where Gore's trip ended Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He's catching the attention of people who could care less
about politics,'' said Chad Rentz, a middle-aged restaurant owner
in Bellevue, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He talks the way my father does,'' said 27-year-old Jennifer
Hedrick of Sparta, Wis., who turned out for one of Gore's riverboat
stops in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``He's for the average guy,'' said Harry Haldeman, 77, of
Jesup, Iowa, who grew up in the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his idealistic appeal, Gore said, ``I think for at
least 35 years we've had a series of traumas to the political
system, to our self-government, without an uninterrupted period of
healing to restore the level of confidence and good feeling that's
necessary for a healthy democratic process. But I know that if you
decide to push past that and get involved, you really can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said if you scratch the surface of a cynic, you'll
find someone wanting to believe that the world is good and we can
make a difference,'' he said. ``That's what I'm trying to do _
scratch the surface of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his theme was born in the open meetings he held in
Iowa and New Hampshire during the nominating contest with Bradley.
At one meeting, he met someone who reminded him of himself in the
early 1970s, after a series of alienating events that included the
national tragedies of the era and his father's loss of his U.S.
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encountered somebody _ I can't even remember who or where _
who reminded me of myself at that time; and I said to that person,
`Look, you've got to let yourself believe that we can really do the
right thing, and you've got to push past this disillusionment and
cynicism','' Gore recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after that, I stood up in front of some group and it
just came out that way. Several people came up to me afterward and
said, 'That really had an impact on me, and you ought to say that.'
``
</P>
<P>
   That message was soon set aside, however, after Gore defeated
Bradley and began a series of attacks on Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, his Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began sounding the anti-cynicism theme anew in the weeks
just before the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles last
week, and it was part of his acceptance speech, widely hailed for
its non-combative tone.

 &HT;    There's little to cheer in high school romp
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' is a comedy movie about cheerleaders. Somebody
must have seen the pep squad in ``American Beauty'' and said, hey,
there's a movie we can do.
</P>
<P>
   And so they did.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, thanks. You shouldn't have. Honestly, you shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, ``Bring It On'' starts off just fine. There's this squad of
bare-midriff, California-fresh cheerleaders performing a routine
with a kick. ``I'm sexy, I'm cute. I'm popular to boot,'' they
chant. ``I'm bitchin'. Great hair. The boys all like to stare.''
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't you know it? It's all a dream. The real movie is
about to begin. Cute, popular Kirsten Dunst wakes up in a sweat.
See, she's Torrance Shipman, a pert and perky senior with a poster
of Nancy Kerrigan on her wall, and she's all nervous because maybe
she'll be named her high school cheerleading captain or maybe she
won't.
</P>
<P>
   She is, of course, and then we the viewers are treated to 90
more minutes of cheerleading angst, cheerleading catfights,
cheerleading pouts and cheerleading cheering. Feels like hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that ``Bring It On'' is a really bad movie. It's just a
lot lamer than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   In this movie, cheerleaders spew forced banter in the locker
room. ``You put the lewd in deluded,'' one cracks. ``Let's not put
the duh in dumb,'' another says.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that ``cheerleading is life'' (not fire, as
``Survivor'' must have lied to us).
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much all the jokes fall flat. Actually, the funniest bit
involves projectile vomiting. And what does that say about this
movie?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the story pits two rival schools' cheerleading squads in
a we-hate-you showdown at the national cheerleading championships.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of tumbling, butt-shaking and boy cheerleaders
tossing girls in all directions. A lot more than you or I could
ever do.
</P>
<P>
   The movie handles the rivalry without things getting too mean,
and it deals frankly with sexual stereotypes: All the guy
cheerleaders aren't gay and all the girl cheerleaders aren't
straight.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, ``Bring It On'' is a movie that's just sort of
there. Not too offensive. Not at all intriguing. It wanted to have
the spunk of something like TV's ``The Positively True Adventures
of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   It just needed more work on its vim and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst. Rated PG-13 for sex-related material and
profanity. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not enough pep.

 &HT;    Familiarity with Proust helps decipher `Time Regained'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless the names Gilberte, Odette, Albertine and Saint-Loup stir
associations in your mind like the taste of a madeleine dipped in
tea, you'll be bewildered by ``Time Regained.'' The lush, hushed
adaptation of the last volume of Marcel Proust's ``Remembrance of
Times Past'' is a summing up of the writer's immense meditation on
time, memory, snobbery and tortured passions. It's like the climax
of a sumptuous soap opera _ but if you haven't tuned in to the
previous episodes, you won't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Raoul Ruiz's elegant film unfolds largely in a
series of sumptuous rooms and corridors. Their doors open, like the
mind, onto different places and times as Marcel (played by
look-alike Marcello Mazzarello) wanders through the sprawl of his
own life, a socially connected man of Paris in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game of free association, as the clink of a spoon in a
teacup transforms into the peal of church bells, launching us into
Proust's memories of being 10 in the fictional village of Combray.
Or a withered old duchess at a gossipy salon is suddenly replaced
by her younger, beautiful self. In a way, the movie is a ghost
story, a catalog of the dead and dying brought back to life,
through Proust's memory, and in particular by his writing.
</P>
<P>
   Like memory, the film swings between specific sensual
impressions and events viewed in isolation from their full context.
We see young Marcel and Gilberte first meet as children, then again
as adults after Gilberte (Emmanuelle Beart) has married Robert
Saint-Loup (Pascal Greggory). When we encounter journalist-musician
Morel (Vincent Perez), he is already engaged in a suggestive
relationship with Saint-Loup, and a vague feud with Saint-Loup's
wealthy uncle, the Baron de Charlus (John Malkovich).
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Regained'' doesn't fill us in on the backstories as it
shuffles through time. That's because what the characters do to one
another is less important than what time does to all of them. When
Marcel withdraws to a sanitorium for his health, he returns to
society to find familiar faces have altered, lives have turned
better or worse. These changes appear full-blown _ the Baron now a
limping old man, Gilberte an embittered, scorned widow. Even
without Marcel around, time keeps busy making its changes. Only
Odette (Catherine Deneuve), the famed, slightly scandalous beauty,
remains untouched.
</P>
<P>
   What tangible plot there is concerns the onset of World War I,
as Saint-Loup blusters heartily toward the front, while Morel
becomes a deserter. But what really drives ``Time Regained'' is its
background of romantic obsession. This is a world of sexual
fluidity in which everyone seems capable of sleeping with (or has
already) everyone else. Robert and Morel, Morel and the Baron,
Gilberte and Robert, Gilberte and Albertine, Albertine and Marcel.
It's like a very polite, bisexual template for ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Though playwright Harold Pinter wrote a fascinating, but still
unproduced, screenplay tackling the whole work, Proust's six-part
novel is famous for being considered unfilmable. ``Time Regained''
proves this partly true and partly false. Ruiz constantly shifts
from naturalistic direction to touches of surrealism, letting
inanimate objects swell into the forground, or gliding furniture
(and sometimes his actors) around the sets on dollies and
turntables. In the end, it's more of a kaleidoscope than a
traditional movie, which calls for a beginning, middle and end.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it's designed for Proust readers, who are likely to
love and loathe it in equal parts for its attempts to give concrete
form to his work. It's like a gorgeous silk tapestry shrouding a
statue meant to memorialize decay and regret and ineffability _ a
statue that can't really be seen in its entirety with the naked eye
(or the camera lens).
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Regained''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Catherine Deneuve, John Malkovich and Emmanuelle Beart.
Unrated but contains sexual situations. At Lefont Plaza. 2 hours,
45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A beautiful and serious adaptation that will
flummox anyone without a handle on Marcel Proust.

 &HT;    Reggae granddaddy Burning Spear still carries plenty of fire
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After three decades of making reggae music, recording 34 albums
and winning his first Grammy Award, Burning Spear says it's time to
start thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Not actually retiring, mind you. Just thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on my mind because I know it's going to take place one
day,'' says Burning Spear, aka Winston Rodney, who will be
appearing at the Tabernacle on Saturday night. ``Everyone must
retire at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the point of Burning Spear, for now at least, is to keep
playing the ``conscious'' music that has kept his career aflame and
set him worlds apart from other popular reggae artists.
</P>
<P>
   While some old-school artists are slowing down, Spear and his
Burning Band are in the midst of a 50-state tour. At each stop,
they've been performing a marathon mix of classics from his
earliest recordings, such as ``Man in the Hills,'' as well as
tracks from his most recent album, the 1999 Grammy-winning
``Calling Rastafari.''
</P>
<P>
   During his long career, Burning Spear's music has evolved. It
has become more melodic, and the instrumentals of the band are
crisper and more refined. Despite his longevity _ or maybe because
of it _ his voice seems smoother and more energetic than ever.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is his message. His stage name is the
moniker of the late Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta. And as an
artist, Burning Spear has been a longtime proponent of black
nationalist Marcus Garvey, for whom three of his albums were named.
</P>
<P>
   His latest release stays true to his social message, without
becoming heavy-handed. And Spear promises a show that, like the
album, will keep fans' heads bobbing while giving them something to
think about long after the concert ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think them will feel the music 'pon a different level in
terms of lyrics and melody,'' Spear says in a gravelly Jamaican
patois. ``There are many social messages we a deal with. The real
message inna de music.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the songs he plans to perform is ``Statue of Liberty,''
which gives voice to the struggles of West Indians and other
immigrants who come to the United States seeking to improve their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about equal rights and justice,'' says Spear of
the album tracks he counts among his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us come to better our education and do honest work
and are not treated properly. I've been through that. I've seen
that.''
</P>
<P>
   While younger artists battle lyrically for the title of ``don
dada'' _ Jamaican slang for the uncontested ruler of the reggae
landscape _ Burning Spear has inherited the unofficial mantle of
the genre's granddaddy.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one years ago, Rodney was working as a mechanic and
laundryman in a rural section of Jamaica when he had a chance
meeting with a young Bob Marley, sans Wailers. Marley suggested
that Rodney audition for his producer, Coxsone Dodd, who eventually
went on to help launch Burning Spear's career.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, other members of reggae's royal family have died,
including Marley, Peter Tosh and most recently Dennis Brown.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Burning Spear as one of the few grown-ups on the
reggae scene. And like many grown-ups, he's concerend about the
younger generation of reggae artists _ and their fans.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially critical of dance hall performers whose
fast-paced, hard-edged lyrics have been slammed for glorifying gun
violence and raunchy sex and vilifying homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fan of dance hall,'' Spear says bluntly. ``Dance
hall is just generating fas' money; it has no morals. It seems
young people nah care what them listen to. I'm not condemning
anything, by why dem a listen to something they can't gain anything
from? Music should change your ways and your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dance hall music has been topping the reggae charts for
years, Spear predicts it will fade away. In the meantime, he's
considering the long haul. There are at least two more Burning
Spear albums planned, including a collection of love ballads, and
an overseas concert tour in the works.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about gold watches and rocking chairs. Burning Spear
still figures he has a gold record left in him, and the only
rocking he'll be doing is when he gets onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music still has a long way to go,'' he says. ``Me can't
retire just yet.''

 &HT;    Betts: `They don't want me back'
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stories conflict, but it's become apparent that drugs and
alcohol _ long-running problems for the Allman Brothers Band _ have
driven another wedge between the surviving members of the group
that used to happily live together in Macon. As a result, guitarist
Dickey Betts says he has little expectation of ever rejoining the
group he was part of for 32 years before being ignominiously sent
home from a tour three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want me back,'' says Betts, 55, who'll bring his
new band to Variety Playhouse on Sunday. ``So I don't have a choice
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The band originally said ``creative differences'' were the
reason Betts was dumped from the summer tour in mid-May. But Gregg
Allman, who was not available for comment for this article, later
said it was because Betts had addiction problems and ``when it
starts to affect the music, something has to be done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts, speaking from his home in Sarasota, Fla., counters that
he's ``not strung out on drugs, and I don't have an alcohol
problem. I've got an eight handicap at the golf course, and you
can't do that if you've got drug or alcohol problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Betts has said that he checked into a crisis intervention center
for treatment of depression June 3 at his wife's request but denies
Allman's charges that he was arrested. The Boston Globe reported
that a Sarasota County Sheriff's Office report said that ``a
husband and wife'' were having problems that night and that the
husband broke a television, overturned a couch, left and the wife
then asked for help in finding him. Chuck Lesaltato of the
sheriff's office confirmed for rollingstone.com that Betts was the
husband and that he was taken to a crisis intervention center for a
psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a lot of tough press from Gregg, who somehow feels
the need to justify what they did to me,'' Betts says. ``I called
Gregg a couple of times and he hung up on me, so I got my attorneys
to force them to meet with me, and when we did, I got different
stories from each guy. I just wished them well. I'd like to see the
band come together for a farewell tour and go out gracefully. ...
I'm grateful for the time I spent in that band.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Betts says he's happy with the seven-piece band he's
put together for his mini-tour opening Saturday in Myrtle Beach,
S.C., and scheduled to end Sept. 22 at Asbury Park, N.J. ``This is
not a throw-together project,'' Betts says, adding that sets will
include tunes from his solo career and from the Allman Brothers
songbook. ``A lot of work has gone into this,'' Betts says. ``I
auditioned players at my house, and now we've been putting in seven
hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The musicians are guitarist Mark May, vocalist Matt Ziner,
bassist Dave Stoltz, saxophonist Chris Jenson, drummer Mark
Greenberg and percussionist Junior Ortiz. ``I've had a lot of bands
since I was 18 years old, but I've never been a guy who wanted a
backup band,'' Betts says. ``With me being more of an
instrumentalist than a vocalist, I enjoy putting guys together and
showing them off. By the time people leave the show, they'll get to
know these guys, because we'll spotlight each guy as we go along.''

 &HT;    `Crew' is the lowest of low-rent comedies
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' stereotypes Jews and Hispanics and belittles the
group it's supposed to be celebrating, retirement-age Americans.
Even worse, the movie's not even funny.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and Seymour Cassel
play four mafia wiseguys, now retired to a creaky Miami apartment
building where the rent keeps climbing due to the South Beach
renaissance. The guys fix that by stealing a John Doe from the city
morgue and leaving the body in their building's lobby, making it
look like a mob hit. Residents flee; the rent drops.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is so out of touch with reality, it shows national
news teams covering the story of the fake killing. Hello, this is
Miami. A story like that would be lucky to rate a paragraph in the
daily paper.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, things get complicated, because the corpse turns out to
have been the dad of a Latin drug boss (Miguel Sandoval), who
happens to live next door to a rich Jewish widow named Pepper
(Lainie Kazan), whose stepdaughter just happens to be a stripper
named Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), whom Cassel has been paying for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Some lame plot twists and accidents ensue, all investigated by
two cops (Jeremy Piven and Carrie-Anne Moss). If you're surprised
to hear that the female officer is Dreyfuss' long lost daughter,
maybe your expectations are low enough for this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' is jerry-built entirely of tired, crowd-tested
pieces: grumpy old men, mafia cliches, dumb slapstick comedy and,
of course, a few gratuitous peeks inside Ferris' strip club. To
call this movie by-the-numbers would be an insult to numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss must have meditated on his Oscar in order to deliver
lines like, ``Fuhgeddaboutit, nobody's gonna whack nobody.'' Then
there's the scene where he has to hold Reynolds' head in the toilet
bowl, and you wonder if Burt's toupee is going to peel off. That's
the closest the movie comes to suspense, whereas the level of humor
is along the lines of this quip from Pepper: ``Thank God her father
is dead, 'cause this would've killed him.'' Oh no, stop, you're
killing me.
</P>
<P>
   When Reynolds yells, ``We would have been better off dead,'' you
can't help thinking it's an ad lib, that he's speaking for the
whole cast. Oh, well, here's hoping they enjoyed some nice beach
time while in Miami. But why write any more about ``The Crew''?
There's no reason to spend too much effort on it. After all, the
people who made the movie sure didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: F
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Burt Reynolds. Rated PG-13 for
sexual content, violence and profanity. 1 hour, 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: As entertaining as Ovaltine, it's a lead contender
for worst movie of the year.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPTIVA, Fla. _ When Robert Rauschenberg was a boy, his mother
used to make him shirts out of scraps of fabric. Collage shirts.
She even made herself a skirt out of the back of the suit that her
younger brother, Luther, was being buried in, because she didn't
want the material to go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   For his high school graduation present, Rauschenberg wanted a
ready-made shirt, his first. A decade or so later he made history
with assemblages of junk; sculptures and music boxes made of
packing crates, rocks and rope; and red paintings like ``Yoicks''
sewn from fabric strips.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on an August evening, Rauschenberg is home making oyster
stew to the dull murmur of a television set with the volume turned
low. He has a television on all the time. There's a television in
the studio. Sometimes he glances at the television as he cooks. He
cooks the way he makes art: ingredients change, spur of the moment.
He's an improviser, like his mother, resuscitating scraps.
</P>
<P>
   When he settled on this slender island off Florida's Gulf coast
30 years ago, he lived in a modest beach house and worked out of a
studio so small he couldn't get back far enough to see the big
paintings he was working on. So he built a wall away from the house
to lean the paintings against. He would scramble up to his kitchen
and look out the window, the only way to have a good view. ``I
thought it was magical,'' he says. ``There were only 500 people on
the island. At the time everybody in New York was making the big
migration to the Hamptons. Not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg is now Captiva's biggest residential landowner. He
acquired the land by at first buying adjacent properties from
elderly neighbors, whom he let live rent free in their houses,
which he maintained for them. He accumulated 35 acres, 1,000 feet
of beach front and nine houses and studios, not counting the sheds
and service buildings. He has almost all that remains of tropical
jungle on the island. He has another studio, a 17,000-square-foot
two-story behemoth overlooking a swimming pool. His assistants call
it the Taj Mahal, a joke he doesn't find particularly funny.
Sometimes sea otters wander into the pool from the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg was first intimidated by the studio, pristine like
a vast operating theater, and hesitated before settling in. He took
a while to adjust to a new house, too, dawdling for months before
leaving his old place. The living room of the new house is the size
of the entire old house and empty except for pictures on the walls,
a couch at one end and, at the other, a Ping-Pong table next to a
galley kitchen, where he is cooking at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   At 74, he is an American institution, the paradoxical fact of an
anti-orthodox career. Nine people now work for him _ several of
them have been with him for 20 years _ and they include a computer
specialist, welders and fabricators. (``I hate the word
fabricator,'' he says, joking as usual. ``It means liar, doesn't
it?'') The materials he and his assistants now use reflect the
price of the art, his early work having been notoriously ephemeral,
to the distress of collectors who paid fortunes for it. By
contrast, the recent work is extravagantly durable.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a gardener who doubles as a frame maker, and a
secretary who helps with the plumbing. All are part of a small
industry and also ``a small family,'' in the words of
Rauschenberg's friend and assistant Darryl Pottorf, an artist who
designed the new studio and new house. Pottorf, whose brother,
Kevin, works here as well, has been around for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lousy boss,'' Rauschenberg says, looking at Pottorf.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not a boss,'' Pottorf says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I mean.'' Rauschenberg smiles, perhaps not for the
first time at this exchange.
</P>
<P>
   His latest show, ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' at the Whitney, like a
lot of his work in recent years, has not been too warmly received.
But, materials aside, he continues to make art the way he always
has, as if it were the equivalent of breathing, and he sustains an
optimistic equanimity toward the results. Jasper Johns once said
that no American artist has invented more than Rauschenberg.
Creatively, he is still the most irrepressible artist.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Synapsis Shuffle'' he asked a group that included Mike
Ovitz, Martha Stewart, Merce Cunningham and Mathilda Krim to make
their own configurations from among 52 new large photo-transfer
panels by him, everyone picking lots to establish the order of
selection. Chance and collaboration, the two biggest themes in
Rauschenberg's career, were linked with an element of irony, the
irony possibly having got somewhat lost, well, in the shuffle. ``I
wanted experts,'' he says, making quotation marks in the air. ``I
wanted people who were supposed to be experts to make art.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, he thought of having the first dozen taxi drivers
who stopped at the Whitney pick the panels. ``The museum asked me
about the lights, the floor, but a work like this has got to exist
on its own, with its own muscles and mistakes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles. As with found objects and materials, Rauschenberg uses
words sneakily. At one point he mentions that when he used to play
Scrabble with his mother (she died last year at the age of 97) the
two of them accepted made-up words if they agreed that the words
ought to be in the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screwing things up is a virtue,'' he explains, partly about
Scrabble but also about ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' for which he set
rules, then allowed them to be broken, conceding that players could
trade panels or turn them to the wall. ``Being correct is never the
point. I have an almost fanatically correct assistant, and by the
time she re-spells my words and corrects my punctuation, I can't
read what I wrote. Being right can stop all the momentum of a very
interesting idea.''
</P>
<P>
   So with Rauschenberg you go with the flow. His flow. Serendipity
and also control: the essence of his art.
</P>
<P>
   He is garrulous, back-slapping, mildly naughty, more resilient
physically than he ought to be, adept at publicly disguising
whatever might be his temper or disappointment. These days he has a
half-dozen projects percolating. He's designing announcements for a
new Merce Cunningham performance. He just signed off on prints for
Al Gore's campaign, to raise money for the Democratic Party, and
for Hillary Clinton: elephants seen from the rear, a broom, a
donkey. ``No point being subtle,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He photographed the elephants in a Zurich animal park, the
donkey in Venezuela, years ago, when he was working on the
Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural Interchange, ROCI (a word-play on
the name of his old pet turtle, Rocky). The project was the
culmination of lifelong collaborative ambitions, ROCI being a
mammoth art chain-letter that toured the world. Hundreds of his
photographs from it and elsewhere are stockpiled in the studio by
country and date. He can recall photographs 30 or more years old.
As he needs them, pictures are got from the files, scanned into a
computer by an assistant, Lauren Getford, printed to spec and
stacked on long tables, where they wait, like his brushes and
containers of paint, to be used, or not, since he constantly
changes his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually work in a direction until I know how to do it, then
I stop,'' he says. ``At the time that I am bored or understand _ I
use those words interchangeably _ another appetite has formed. A
lot of people try to think up ideas. I'm not one. I'd rather accept
the irresistible possibilities of what I can't ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg has just finished a series for a show this fall at
PaceWildenstein in New York. He says it is about struggling against
what he knows how to do, about doing what's unnatural. The works in
the living room and around the studio belong to that series.
Meanwhile, two years' labor on a mural for a Renzo Piano cathedral
in Italy, commissioned by the Vatican, has gone for naught, he says
disgustedly. The Vatican, among other things, didn't like that he
represented God as a gold satellite dish. ``You know _ a halo, and
also something that hears everything, knows everything.''
Rauschenberg is perfectly sincere. ``The subject of the mural was
the Apocalypse, and I think I handled the destruction of the world
as gently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Having once thought of becoming a priest, he may have had more
invested in this project than in others. He backed out rather than
even discuss changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you do will be an abuse of somebody else's
aesthetics,'' he adds.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger
</P>
<P>
   and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl with
special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs. evil, the
film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The Exorcist,''
``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other Catholic/satanic epics, all
while managing to bore the pants off you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes.
D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' R (violence, sex, nudity and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dan Hedaya,
</P>
<P>
   Frances McDormand
</P>
<P>
   and M. Emmet Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers' first film is back in all its devilishly
degenerate glory. Re-released in a spruced-up but still-smirking
so-called director's cut, the movie is pretty much exactly as it
was when it hit theaters in 1984. That is, a good-old-boy gothic
full of flashy camera angles and trashy people. What's astonishing
is how much of the Coens' unique talent was evident from the start.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring It On'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst stars in a comedy that pits two rival high
schools' cheerleading squads in a we-hate-you showdown at the
national cheerleading championships. Pretty much all the jokes fall
flat. Actually, the funniest bit involves projectile vomiting. And
what does that say about this movie? (Bob Longino)1 hour, 33
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne
</P>
<P>
   and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a
cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented'' R (profanity, sex, violence
</P>
<P>
   and substance abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Dorff.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite demented enough. There are some amusing bits and some
savvy cinema in-jokes in John Waters' movie about a Hollywood star
(Melanie Griffith) kidnapped by underground filmmakers and forced
to star in their no-budget flick. Like Patty Hearst (who appears in
the film), Griffith becomes a convert to their cause and their
wild-eyed leader (Stephen Dorff). Too much of the film is slapdash
and just plain silly. (ERG) C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' R (violence, language and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez,
</P>
<P>
   Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an intrepid
child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi technique, can
enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince Vaughn) asks her to
stroll through the brain of a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) so
he can find where he's stashed his latest victim. Visually
provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG) 1 hour, 52
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia,
</P>
<P>
   Maria Bello and John Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving liquor
in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the bar and
set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big pitchers of
water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young waif, a
struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crew'' PG-13 (sexual content,
</P>
<P>
   violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Dreyfuss
</P>
<P>
   and Burt Reynolds. he rise and fall of evangelical diva Tammy
Faye Bakker Messner, the PTL Club and her marriage to Jim Bakker
makes a fascinating story. But somewhere along the way, directors
Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato turned the subject of their
documentary into its mascot. Often captivating and informative, but
full of gaps and lacking key interviews. (SM) 1 hour, 19 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl on the Bridge'' R (sexual themes) subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel Auteuil
</P>
<P>
   and Vanessa Paradis.
</P>
<P>
   Starts great but loses steam. The fine French director Patrice
Leconte (``Monsieur Hire'') has cooked up a romantic fairy tale
about a suicidal gamin (Vanessa Paradis) and a professional
knife-thrower who persuades her to become his new target. After an
impressive first hour in which the film creates an aura of
unresolved romantic tension and intensity, it goes adrift. (ERG) 1
hour, 31 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' PG (monster violence
</P>
<P>
   and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Takehiro Murata,
</P>
<P>
   and Tsutomu Kitagawa (as Godzilla).
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' is everything hard-core fans want it to be. So
corny and campy. And, God bless it, so badly dubbed in English it
soars. Sure it's bad filmmaking. Sure it's a guy _ actor Tsutomu
Kitagawa _ clad in a nearly vintage latex Godzilla get-up and
stomping through Tokyo, knocking down cardboard mini-buildings and
upending toy-sized cars with his gnarly feet. But that's the point.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence,
</P>
<P>
   nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers,''
``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome, state-of-the-art computer
effects and exercise his gleeful brand of brutal action. But his
filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script and characters so
two-dimensional, they're virtually all transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the One That I Want'' Unrated (contains strong profanity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual subject matter)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Margaret Cho.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed over two nights in San Francisco, it's stand-up comic
Margaret Cho's raunchy and hilarious act. Some memorable bits
include comparisons of straight and gay porn and recalling her one
sexual experience with a woman. She also details the idiocies of TV
execs during her experiences as the star of the very first
Asian-American sitcom (``All-American Girl''). (SM) 1 hour, 36
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty Professor II:
</P>
<P>
   The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is the
nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' R (language and sex-related
humor)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Steve Harvey,
</P>
<P>
   Cedric the Entertainer,
</P>
<P>
   D.L. Hughley and Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing that original. It's just a lot of funny stuff
knocked out by four sharp stand-up comics. And under Spike Lee's
direction, it's one of the liveliest concert films in years. The
routines get raucous and rude, but hold off on the blistering
verbal assaults of other comedians. Lee looses several cameras
through the venue, capturing audience reactions and giving the
movie the dynamic spark of the live event. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates the
collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the
battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wah0'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the
</P>
<P>
   voices of Ikue Ootani
</P>
<P>
   and Unsho Ishizuka.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pokemon movie is a lot better than last year's first
flick. And slightly better than a poke in the eye. ``Pokemon the
Movie 2000'' has more accomplished animation, more drama and a
decent-enough sprinkling of jokes, all adding up to something
barely watchable. Still, it's mostly cheaply made, barely
interesting and focused on niche marketing. (Bob Longino) 1 hour,
24 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' PG-13 (some crude sexual humor
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves
</P>
<P>
   and Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays. Boneheaded
comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer player, puffs
cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt pep squad whose
sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to fumble a lot.
Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp about adult
scabs taking over for striking pro players. (Bob Longino) 1 hour,
58 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' R (drug content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn
</P>
<P>
   and Craig Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   A guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned Devine'' mold.
The film has everything it takes to be hopelessly twee: steaming
teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a rowdy pub and
some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the credit of
everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title role, the
comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. (SM) 1 hour, 33
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' R (strong crude sexual humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drug use and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans
</P>
<P>
   and Marlon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen (writer/director),
Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor) _ ``Scary Movie'' is
a parody of teen horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just
because it was popular, ``The Matrix,'' all get skewered in a
thousand jokes that are either hilarious, funny, not funny or
simply crude. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' PG-13 (some profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood,
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in Clint
Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program in the '50s are summoned
into service to repair the thing. The best part of the film is
watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on
the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't always stay on track. For anyone older than 6 or who
isn't already a fan of the British TV series, this could be
subtitled ``The Little Engine That Couldn't.'' Things start to go
wrong in a magical land where talking trains are menaced by a
bullying diesel and their protector, Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin).
It's not total a wreck, but avoid being railroaded into sitting
through it unless there's no choice. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Regained'' Unrated (contains sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Catherine Deneuve,
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich
</P>
<P>
   and Emmanuelle Beart.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it's designed for Marcel Proust readers, who are
likely to love and loathe it in equal parts for its attempts to
give concrete form to his work. It's like a gorgeous silk tapestry
shrouding a statue meant to memorialize decay and regret and
ineffability _ a statue that can't really be seen in its entirety
with the naked eye (or the camera lens). (SM) 2 hours, 45 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback
to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect (unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn'' and ``Blade'').
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

CAPTIVA, Fla.: aesthetics,'' he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flashing on the television at that moment is Lauren Hutton.
Rauschenberg touches the screen. Hutton is the host of an annual
benefit he organizes for an abused women's shelter in Fort Myers,
Fla. Sharon Stone was the host last year. A framed photograph of
her is in the kitchen. Rauschenberg raises or donates hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year for charities for women, children,
medical research, politicians, artists. When added to the business
of what has become a major operation, a chunk of time _ too much,
you can sense he thinks _ now goes into being Robert Rauschenberg,
which is not the same thing as making Robert Rauschenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this is not what he had imagined 50 years ago, when it
seemed as if nobody wanted anything from him.
</P>
<P>
   Or almost nobody. The often reproduced photographs of him and
Susan Weil making silhouette negatives on blueprint paper,
Rauschenberg's breakthrough pictures, were for Life magazine in
1951. There was other media attention too. But the New York art
world after the war was in some ways even more circumscribed and
harder to succeed in than it had been during the war. Peggy
Guggenheim's gallery was closed. So was Stuart Levy's. Many of the
European artists who had waited out Hitler in New York, enlarging
the local culture, had returned to Europe. Duchamp was around but
lying low. ``Jasper and I broke into his privacy,'' Rauschenberg
says. ``Duchamp knew who we were because his wife knew everything
and everyone. She was his reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   There were just a few dealers representing new work: Betty
Parsons, Samuel Kootz, Sidney Janis, Charles Egan. ``Egan used to
open his gallery in the morning and head for the bar,''
Rauschenberg fondly recalls. ``You could go there at 9 at night and
it was still open and there was the art on the walls and nobody was
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was trying to give up European aesthetics then. That
was the struggle, and it was reflected in the fear of collectors
and critics. John Cage said that fear in life is the fear of
change. If I may add to that: nothing can avoid changing. It's the
only thing you can count on. Because life doesn't have any other
possibility, everyone can be measured by his adaptability to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauschenberg and Cage became friends not when they were at Black
Mountain College, as people think, but after Cage happened into
Rauschenberg's first show, at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1951,
and asked for one of the paintings. He was the only person who did.
Cage and Rauschenberg rendezvoused a year later at Rauschenberg's
loft, where, as Rauschenberg tells the story, the only place to sit
was on his mattress. Cage started to itch. He called Rauschenberg
afterward and said that he was going away for a while so
Rauschenberg should stay over at his place because Rauschenberg's
mattress must have bedbugs.
</P>
<P>
   At Cage's apartment, Rauschenberg decided he would touch up the
painting Cage had acquired, spur of the moment, as a kind of thank
you, painting it black, being in the midst of his all-black
paintings at the time. Then Cage returned. He was not amused.

   ``We both thought, `Here was somebody crazier than I am,'''
Rauschenberg recalls. ``That's why we got along so well. John said
I was natural Zen while he had to choose between studying Zen or
going to a psychiatrist, and Zen seemed like the better
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Cage also recognized what you might call the sympathetic music
in Rauschenberg's art _ the silence of the all-white paintings, for
example. Even the famous ``Automobile Tire Print,'' for which Cage
drove his Model-A Ford over a long strip of paper that Rauschenberg
unrolled outside his studio on Fulton Street in 1951, besides
taking a funny swipe at Barnett Newman's ``zip'' paintings, was a
``concrete'' score. At least, like a score, it was a printed
version of their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mostly rejected by the visual art world,'' Rauschenberg
says about the early '50s. ``But this turned out to be very lucky
for me because my interest in life led me to be involved with
musicians and dancers and they became my friends. Not just John and
Merce but also Morty Feldman, Christian Wolff, Earle Brown. The
problems they were having, I thought, had a lot more to do with
painting than the problems of the people at the Cedar Bar, who were
just whining about how the latest collector in town had bought a de
Kooning instead of one of their paintings. The fastest way to
become unpopular at the Cedar Bar was to sell something.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-beam smile appears. ``The thing about the people I was
close to in my career is that they wouldn't have been survivors if
they didn't have a sense of humor. I remember one time John and
Merce were walking ahead of Morty and me, and I was asking Morty
how he was doing. `Haven't you heard?' Morty said. `I'm the toast
of two continents. Australia and Africa.' Those guys didn't get any
more encouragement than I did, but they just continued with a
vibrancy for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been kind of envious of them because they had
professions that depended on the moment. That's why I like dancers
and musicians _ because I feel that art can be like furniture,
static, clumsy. The whole point of collaboration is to counteract
that. For me, art shouldn't be a fixed idea that I have before I
start making it. I want it to include all the fragility and doubt
that I go through the day with. Sometimes I'll take a walk just to
forget whatever good idea I had that day because I like to go into
the studio not having any ideas. I want the insecurity of not
knowing, like performers feel before a performance. Everything I
can remember, and everything I know, I have probably already done,
or somebody else has.''
</P>
<P>
   The oyster stew turns out to be delicious, by the way.
Rauschenberg, still going, talking apropos of doing what other
people have already done, recalls an idea he once had for an
exhibition of paintings imitating different Abstract
Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, the luxury, the excessive energy and the iridescent
glory of doing a Rothko,'' he says. ``Of course, it would have been
blaspheming, but can you think what it would be like to throw
yourself into that incredible mood? Then out of respect I decided I
wouldn't paint like Rothko or Franz Kline because I'd be in their
way and they in mine. That was also John's attitude. Cage always
said, There's enough room in the world so that nobody has to be
that close to another person.''

   Everything has its place, all things have their value, nothing
is extra. I Ching. Rauschenberg, having shared this philosophy with
Cage, nonetheless has trouble when he drifts briefly onto the
subject of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen, the composers.
Each of them asked to visit Cage, and afterward each one denounced
Cage's music. Rauschenberg starts to weep suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was not the kind of person who would admit hurt because
he had enough spiritual belief to think that everything is as it
should be _ there is no tragedy. The thing with John is that he
didn't separate his work from his life because there was no
separation in his mind. He had no ambition because ambition implies
growth and he was full already. But I bet he was hurt because it is
hurtful to lose a friend.'' Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it has happened to me I have a few days of feeling, `How
could I be so gullible?' Then I realize gullibility is a desirable
state because it means I'm open. I'm Libra, and Libras are
gullible. We lean over backwards while we're walking upright.''
He's smiling again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're born an artist or not,'' he adds. ``I couldn't
have learned it, and I hope I never do because knowing more only
encourages your limitations. I wouldn't want to be any less
vulnerable than I am.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed by the fact that most 18- 24-year-olds
don't vote, national youth and civic groups are mounting a massive
campaign to entice young adults to become politically involved.
</P>
<P>
   After young adults aged 18-20 were given the right to vote in
1972 by the 26th Amendment, the voting rate of 18- to 24-year-olds
fell from 43 percent that year to 28 percent in 1996, according to
the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a group
that studies voting trends.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the voting rate among all population groups
declined from 55 percent to 49 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   As they get older, many young adults are retaining their
nonvoting habits, reversing an earlier pattern in which they began
voting once they started collecting such middle-aged trappings as
mortgages and children. For example, voter participation among 25-
to 34- year-olds dropped from 54 percent in 1972 to 39 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we start doing something about the whole political
culture, the rates of voter participation are going to continue to
decline,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the committee and a
leading analyst of voting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Younger adults are not apathetic _ in fact, they are the most
activist generation in history, says Steven Culbertson, president
of Youth Service America, an umbrella group for more than 200
national, state and local organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He says young people are choosing to perform volunteer work
instead of voting.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 survey by the University of California at Los Angeles and
the Higher Education Research Institute of 383,815 students at 668
universities and colleges showed a record 74 percent volunteered
for community service, up from 62 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that if you volunteer but don't vote, 20 years
from now your kids are going to be cleaning up the same dirty
rivers and tutoring at the same mediocre schools,'' Culbertson
said. ``The large-scale impact doesn't take place until you go to
the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson said young adults complain that politicians ignore
their concerns. Politicians, in turn, admit overlooking young
adults because they don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   To break this cycle, the group's Servicevote 2000 campaign is
planning six political forums this year at college campuses and
community centers around the country in which young people can ask
questions of federal and state candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Another effort _ this one by Doug Bailey, founder of the
Hotline, a popular politics newsletter _ is working through school
systems by contacting principals around the nation, hoping they
will register 15 million high school students to vote on-line in a
late October mock election.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the two goals of his Youth-e-Vote program, launched
in January, are ``to turn today's students into tomorrow's voters _
to start them early,'' and ``to facilitate the teaching and
learning of civics.''
</P>
<P>
   The students also will vote on issues such as education and
criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in this country is a situation where there is
less and less civics taught in the schools and at least 50 percent
(of youths) live in homes of parents who do not vote,'' Bailey
said. ``This is simply an effort to try to re-instill'' voting
habits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Scaggs, a former six-term congressman from Colorado, now
executive director of the democracy and citizenship program at the
Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan research group, is trying to spur
new adults to vote by training political candidates to better
address the concerns of the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get candidates willing to think differently, it's
probably not going to make a lot of progress,'' Scaggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs has compiled a ``tool kit'' for candidates trying to
reach the estimated 30 million young adults who don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   The kit was distributed last month to 2,400 state and federal
candidates and campaign managers around the nation. It includes
tips such as dressing casually and warns against imitating the
language of youths. ``The phoniness detectors of this age group are
very finely tuned,'' Scaggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also lose youth audiences when they talk about
``bridging the digital divide'' instead of making sure schools have
computers, or when they refer to ``universal access'' instead of
health care for everyone, said Sharon Bassett, who works with
Scaggs.
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs said many politicians ``tend to have a stereotype of this
age group as cynical and turned off by politics.'' That image ``is
wrong and it feeds into the `why-pay-attention-to-them' frame of
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs said most young people don't vote because they aren't
familiar with the issues or are intimidated because they don't know
how to push a lever in a voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more a reluctance to do something foolish than a
kind of attitude against politics,'' he said. ``This age group is
not walking around with a negative attitude. It's much more an
attitude of humility and ignorance and not wanting to make a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth Vote 2000, a coalition of more than 60 national groups, is
planning a series of debates for state and federal candidates, with
the job of moderator being held down by young journalists aged 18
to 30.
</P>
<P>
   John Dervin, 26, political director for the group, said he
expects questions from young adults will include queries about how
to pay for higher and continuing education and how to pay for
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Dervin said Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for
president, has agreed to participate in a youth-moderated
presidential debate, but the group hasn't heard from Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Youth Vote 2000 also teamed with the World Wrestling Federation
to seek out younger potential voters. Last month, the partnership
registered thousands of new voters at a Madison Square Garden
match. During the Republican convention in Philadelphia earlier
this month, a 28-year-old wrestler known as ``The Rock'' publicly
signed up to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Charitable Trust, a private foundation that supports
nonprofit efforts to solve public problems, has in the 1999-2000
election cycle shelled out an unprecedented $4.3 million to boost
young adult voting. The Pew money was used to fund such
vote-related programs as a Project Vote Smart web-site for youth
issues. Pew also paid for students at the Medill School of
Journalism at Northwestern University to report on the presidential
campaign for college campus newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, which reaches 77 million households, also is working to
boost younger voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Friedman, vice president of public affairs for the
24-hour cable music video service, said MTV's web site,
www.rockthevote.com, already has registered more than 70,000 young
people to vote so far this year, compared to 42,000 for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's ``Choose or Lose'' campaign, responding to surveys showing
youths listen best to their peers, employed a ``street team'' of
four young TV reporters to report on issues of concern to young
people at the national political conventions. In another special,
the young reporters interviewed politicians to find out what they
were doing at age 22.

 &HT;    TODAY'S KIDS GET HIGHER TEST SCORES; BUT MINORITIES SLIP
 &HT;    600&AMP;adds. With TEST-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ National test scores are higher for today's
students, but some of the progress in closing the gap between the
races slipped away in the 1990s, said a report issued Thursday by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Baby Boomers who took similar tests 30 years ago,
today's students of all races have average scores that are
significantly higher on math tests and a little higher on reading
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The results on science tests taken three decades apart were
mixed: 9-year-olds do worse, 13-year-olds do about the same, and
17-year-olds do better than the baby boomers did when they were
that young.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1970 and 1988, the gains by blacks and Hispanics were
even greater than the gains among whites. That narrowed the scoring
gap between whites and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But some ominous trends were confirmed when career researchers
from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) looked at
what has happened in the last 10 to 12 years of that 30-year span:
</P>
<P>
   _ Among white students, math and science scores rose more
slowly, and reading scores remained flat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among black students, scores stayed flat in all three
subjects. That wiped out about half of their previous gains in
closing the gap. By 1999, the average math scores of black
17-year-olds and white 13-year-olds were the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among Hispanic students, scores were flat, except for gains by
13-year-olds in reading and 17-year-olds in science and math. On
balance, the gap by which their scores trail those of whites
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Kati(cq) Haycock of the nonpartisan Education Trust, a
Washington-based reform advocacy group, glumly described the more
recent trend as ``disappointing, especially for students of color
and their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCES researchers examined scores on special national tests
given to samples of up to 17,000 students aged 9, 13 or 17 every
two to three years. The tests began in the 1973 school year for
math, 1971 for reading and 1969 for science.
</P>
<P>
   They said that their lengthy, nuanced, and apolitical report
showed what happened, rather than why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report shows a mixed picture of good news and bad news, of
gains and then of gaps narrowing and widening again,'' said Michael
Nettles, the black scholar from the University of Michigan who is
vice chair of the National Assessment Goals Board, the independent,
bipartisan body that oversees the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all the reduction in the gaps between whites and
blacks took place (in the 1980s), and since then the gaps have
widened,'' Nettles said. ``This is a depressing reversal of gains
made over the previous two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The average scores of Hispanics are slightly higher than those
of blacks,'' Nettles said. ``In the past decade, the gaps between
whites and Hispanics have fluctuated _ some narrowing, some
widening _ but over all, little has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said minority students have virtually caught up with white
students of their age in learning basic skills, but ``when you move
up to more complicated work the differences appear to be wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why that happened, Nettles suggested several
possibilities, but cautioned, ``The only honest answer is that we
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Haycock said she thinks minorities lag because they are less
likely than whites to take advanced math and science courses, and
more likely to attend schools in which those who do take advanced
courses are taught by a teacher who didn't major in that subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their teachers are less qualified and their course-work is
less rigorous,'' she said. ``Put those factors together and, of
course, you get lower test scores.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some evidence for her view was offered by Michael Casserly,
executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, which
consists of 60 urban school districts that educate 35 percent of
the blacks and 30 percent of the Hispanics in the nation's public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing teachers, particularly math and science
teachers, to higher-paying suburbs,'' Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, average scores ``have not fallen significantly in any
category'' in the 1990s, said Education Secretary Richard Riley. He
said a slump would have been expected, because weaker students are
less likely to drop out nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, today's schools teach ``a group of students
that is larger and more diverse than ever before _ with higher
percentages of test-takers with disabilities and a higher
percentage whose home language is not English.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the test rules excluded all students who were
identified as having either learning disabilities or
English-language problems judged to be serious enough to affect
their scores.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that ``we have a persistent gap in
achievement and we must work to close it while lifting achievement
for all,'' Riley added, ``In several categories, blacks and
Hispanics are scoring better than ever _ and that is good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the tests fell into nine categories (three age
groups in math, three in reading and three in science), Riley
pointed out that in 1996 or 1999:
</P>
<P>
   _ White children and black children tied or exceeded their
highest scores in six of the nine categories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hispanic children tied or exceeded their highest scores in
seven of the nine.

`TAO' MAY BE TOO COOL FOR ITS OWN GOOD

<P>
   Dex (Donal Logue), the protagonist of this indie effort, is the
guy who comes up with the film's title. An overweight Santa Fe
slacker, Dex concocted and practices the ``Tao of Steve,'' a
philosophy of cool detachment based on such macho heroes as Steve
McQueen and ``Hawaii Five-O's'' Steve McGarrett, as a way of
scoring with women.
</P>
<P>
   As Dex explains it, you can't just act uninterested when you're
with a woman; you've got to be uninterested, and then she'll become
so intrigued that she'll want to sleep with you. The camera pans
across Dex's bookshelves, showing rows of philosophy books. But he
seems to have a copy of ``The Rules'' stashed there somewhere as
well, and he simply reversed the genders. Whatever he's doing, it
works. Ten years out of college and passing his time as a
kindergarten teacher, Dex is still quite the ladies' man despite
being, by his own reckoning, 50 pounds heavier since graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins at a college reunion, where Dex meets Syd
(co-screenwriter Greer Goodman), a down-to-earth set designer for
the Santa Fe Opera. Syd quickly challenges Dex's faith in the Tao _
which appears to have more to do with Peter Pan than with Eastern
philosophy _ and he finds himself falling for her. But he still
wants to mess around; it's as if he's in a triangle with Syd,
himself and his own immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which was directed by Goodman's sister Jenniphr, was
an audience fave at Sundance and has gathered some good prerelease
buzz. It has its moments, and Logue's easygoing frat-boy manner
makes it worth seeing. But the screenplay is a little too
self-consciously offbeat and clever for its own good; you can
figure that out by checking out the lead characters' occupations
and listening to the philosophy-major dialogue. It'll probably be
an art-house hit _ and it's tough to get past the feeling that it
was schemed out that way all along. &QL;

FOR A CHEERLEADING MOVIE, THIS IS PRETTY DISPIRITED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest teen comedy is sort of like ``The Replacements''
turned inside out; instead of being about the lame football team,
it's about the good cheerleading squad that's working its way to
the big game ... er, competition. But it's not even as good as
``The Replacements,'' which has a rowdy affability that makes its
formula construction forgivable. Despite the fast-lane-paced
dialogue, the short-attention-span editing and the frequent rah-rah
scenes, ``Bring It On'' is a little dispirited.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst plays the chirpy new cheerleading captain of an
award-winning San Diego squad. She discovers, with the help of
incongruous newcomer Eliza Dushku, that the team's
competition-winning routines were stolen from a squad in East
Compton, Calif. Dunst and Dushku.MDNM/ lead a likable cast, but
director Peyton Reed seems unable to light a fire under anybody. In
fact, he appears to have been busy extinguishing sparks; anyone who
promises to steal the movie is quickly reined in.
</P>
<P>
   Dushku enters the movie, Gothed-out and dreadlocked, with the
same bird-flipping attitude she had as Buffy's nemesis on the WB's
``Buffy The Vampire Slayer,'' but she's almost as sunshiny as Dunst
before the movie's over. Jesse Bradford, who plays Dushku's brother
and Dunst's love interest, makes an impressive entrance but is soon
enough reduced to reactive crooked smiles from the Freddie Prinze
Jr. school. Gabrielle Union has some edge as the head East Compton
cheerleader, but she's not in the movie nearly enough to make a big
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The elements for a good movie are here, considering the stress
that must go into a real cheerleading competition, but the
impatient editing makes it impossible to appreciate the stunts in
the climactic competition, and the movie is aimless even though you
always know exactly where it's headed.

<P>
   HONOLULU _ We don't talk much on the hike to the top of Diamond
Head, the peak of dry volcanic ash that looms nearly 800 feet over
Waikiki Beach. Even though we had started in the cool hour just
after dawn, the trek requires some exertion, especially at the
brisk pace we're keeping, trying to beat the heat and the crowds
for a clear, panoramic view of the Oahu coast.
</P>
<P>
   But this had been billed as a nature hike, so on the way down,
after she'd pointed out the sprawling beach estate shared by the
Hawaii cast of MTV's ``The Real World,'' our guide begins
explaining the island's unique flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   A landscape that seemed lush and colorful and typically Hawaiian
_ macadamia and avocado trees, brilliant hibiscus and plumeria,
tropical songbirds _ had once been even more exotic, she tells us.
Developing in a vacuum, more than a thousand miles from other land
masses, hundreds of species of plants and animals found nowhere
else had evolved on Hawaii. But the humans who settled the islands,
first the Polynesians and then Europeans, brought pigs and chickens
and goats, plus plants such as breadfruit and papayas. Rapidly,
many of the endemic birds, flowers and trees died out, replaced by
the interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What took millions of years to evolve on Hawaii, humans
basically destroyed in only a few hundred years,'' she says
soberly, as we pick our way downhill, single file.
</P>
<P>
   Until I'd seen the view from the top of Diamond Head, I had been
formulating a similar thought: Had we tourists had the equivalent
effect in just two generations?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if I had expected Hawaii to be an undiscovered
tropical paradise. The islands have been the American dream of a
vacation destination for at least 40 years, a magnet for
honeymooners and families since before Gidget went Hawaiian or the
Brady Bunch used it as the setting for a Very Special Episode. And
the destinations I had chosen _ three nights in Honolulu, four on
Maui, on the stretch of beach known as Kaanapali _ were the most
visited of all.
</P>
<P>
   But I was traveling with my parents, both in their early 80s,
and the itinerary had been something of a compromise, allowing them
to leisurely revisit sites, like Pearl Harbor, that they had
enjoyed on earlier visits, and giving me a first-timer's overview
so I'd know where I'd want to return to later. I reasoned that I
really just looked forward to spending time with them; it didn't
matter that our schedule would be heavy on touristy sites I might
not choose on my own. And surely, Hawaii was beautiful everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in my first 36 hours in Hawaii, I had been shocked at
its, well, schlockiness. We had sipped weak $7.50 mai tais at a
poolside bar overlooking Waikiki Beach, which was slightly gray and
packed end-to-end with beach towels bearing sunbathers. Honolulu
had struck me as a nondescript city that existed largely to provide
a setting for cheap sushi bars and souvenir shops selling coconut
purses, pearl necklaces and loud print shirts; it looked, in the
words of a well-traveled friend, ``like Oklahoma City with a beach
stuck on the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, most horrifyingly, we'd spent a long, hot, endless day at a
Polynesian theme park, staffed by well-meaning students from
Brigham Young University's Hawaii campus. Women and men alike wore
pretty flowered sarongs, danced the hula enthusiastically if not
authentically, and insisted on shouting ``Alo-HA!'' at the
slightest provocation. It was as if we'd found the Hawaiian version
of Branson.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip turned around just before 5 a.m. on my second full
day in Oahu, when I awoke to meet the van transporting us to
Diamond Head.
</P>
<P>
   Early morning is my favorite part of day in almost any new
place, and I was delighted to see streets free of the usual tour
buses, their parking spaces taken by delivery trucks double-parked
in front of restaurants as workers delivered cases of papayas,
pineapples and freshly caught fish. Here and there, shopkeepers
were sweeping sidewalks in front of stores that looked more
inviting minus the crowds; the occasional bicyclist or jogger
crossed our path, taking advantage of the cool early morning.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was a pale pinkish-orange circle, still low in the sky,
as our group of eight pulled into the parking lot at Diamond Head,
so named because British sailors who spotted it in 1825 mistook its
sparkling calcite crystals for precious stones. The peak is
actually a tuff cone, formed of the ash left over from a long-ago
volcanic explosion.
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   The summit and the surrounding crater have been used for many
things over the years: Early Hawaiians called it Leahi and crowned
it with a temple, possibly used for human sacrifices. The U.S. Army
built a fort at the edge of the crater, starting in 1909; at the
summit, it added a series of tunnels, bunkers and observation
points. The crater, which in the '60s and '70s was the site of big
rock concerts, now contains a National Guard encampment, picnic
tables and restrooms, and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But most people come here to get the view from the top. It is
not as easy a hike as it first appears; the gently sloping path
quickly turns steep and narrow, and just before the peak, there are
a series of stairs and two dark tunnels, the Alcatraz-like remnants
of the old military base.
</P>
<P>
   After less than 40 minutes, however, we're rewarded for our
early start _ we are among the first few of the day to take in the
grand view. It's a clear day, so we can see it all, from the
Waianae Mountains of the leeward coast, to the homes and hotels and
the Waikiki Shell lining the beach, to the lighthouse and the
sailboats and a few hardy surfers in the bay below.
</P>
<P>
   The view is spectacular, and I've enjoyed the walk and the
company of my fellow hikers so much that I feel guilty back in the
van, when I admit to one of them that this was the first thing on
the island I'd really enjoyed. She had been to Hawaii before, and
she hadn't found a part she couldn't love; she warned me gently
against making such a quick judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it time,'' she said. ``You haven't really seen anything
of Hawaii yet.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Maui,'' my father, who is not usually given to
superlatives, tells the man seated next to him at the Old Lahaina
Luau, a lavish spread on the beach at the edge of Lahaina, the old
whaling seaport on the west coast of the island. We are all
drinking rum punch and wearing fresh-flower leis; our plates are
loaded with roast pig and mahi-mahi and coconut pudding and fresh
tuna and sweet Hawaiian yeast bread. In a few minutes, traditional
hula dancers will take the stage, lit by rows of glowing tiki
torches and featuring a traditional dugout canoe.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be more traditionally ``touristy.''
</P>
<P>
   And I couldn't agree with my dad more.
</P>
<P>
   We have been here for two days, having settled into a spacious
condo just steps from the beach and about 10 minutes from Lahaina,
a village that was built more than 150 years ago to support the
whaling industry and now is largely populated by tourists and the
shops and restaurants that serve them. There is a mall there, in
what used to be a pineapple cannery, and several smart shops and
galleries, selling traditional, gorgeous Hawaiian quilts, oil
paintings with island themes, and sculptures carved of native koa
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was inevitable that Maui was where I'd really learn to
love Hawaii. The second-most recognizable site in Hawaii, after
Waikiki, Maui has been voted the best island destination in the
world four years running by the well-traveled readers of Conde Nast
Traveler. Though it is rife with development _ huge resorts, many
with manicured golf courses and multilevel swimming pools attached,
stretch for miles on its western and southwestern coasts _ it still
seems more laid-back than bustling Honolulu, which is, after all, a
major city that just happens to have a world-class resort attached.
</P>
<P>
   We'd originally planned to visit Maui to see the whales _ it is
a prime winter playground for humpback whales, and whale-watching
is such a popular pastime from January through April that traffic
jams, and accidents, are sometimes caused by carloads of tourists
suddenly braking to peer at the great creatures playing just
offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But our schedules hadn't worked out, so we'd missed whale season
by more than a month. Freed of that major objective, we found
ourselves with a much more flexible schedule than we'd adhered to
on Oahu, giving us plenty of time to shop, eat, sightsee, swim,
walk on the beach, and generally put ourselves on island time.
</P>
<P>
   Our first afternoon on Maui, we wandered into a casual seafood
restaurant on a prime stretch of Front Street, which, as its name
implies, fronts the ocean. A friendly waiter beckoned us to a table
on the wooden deck perched on the edge of the water, and we
lingered for hours, feeding morsels of bread to seabirds and
watching rowers in long canoes glide past, training for an upcoming
race. Other diners were in no hurry, either; we all talked
companionably as we staked out tables to watch the sunset. The
setting was so scenic and cozy we wouldn't have even cared about
the food, but it was wonderful _ barely seared, perfectly cooked
ahi, or tuna (plucked from the Hawaiian waters less than 24 hours
earlier, our server told us proudly).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was just the jet lag finally wearing off, but the
relaxing evening seemed to set the tone for the rest of the trip.
The days quickly developed an easygoing rhythm: Wake just before
dawn, take a freshly brewed cup of coffee to the beach and sit on a
low rock wall, watching the sun rise and talking to my fellow early
risers, like the couple from North Carolina who liked to sculpt
sand castles before the day's waves, and crowds, could destroy
them. Then back to the room to plan the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   One day, it was nothing more taxing than swimming and sunning on
the wide white-sand beach, eating fish tacos at a picnic table that
overlooked the ocean, then saving up for the Lahaina luau, so
authentic in its food, music and dancing that even locals sometimes
attend. (Tourist-centered though it might be, I was fascinated by
the lump of a ``kalua'' pig roasting in a pit and by the carved
bowls, koa-nut necklaces and other crafts being made right on the
grounds by local artisans.)
</P>
<P>
   Another day, we took a circle tour of the island, driving past
pineapple fields, the occasional stray nene, or black-faced
Hawaiian goose, and a flower farm where we stopped to admire dozens
of varieties of brilliant protea, orchids and bromeliads. We got
caught in a sudden rainstorm at the lush Iao Valley, a sharp
counterpoint to the dry western shores; the valley, punctuated by
the soaring rock known as the Iao needle, is a bona-fide rain
forest, with gentle streams, a waterfall and hiking trails amid all
the tropical plants.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the tour _ literally, as it turned out _ was
the trip to the top of Haleakala, the world's largest dormant
volcano. The smooth road to the top takes more than two hours to
drive, rising more than 10,000 feet in less than 40 miles of road;
more than a million tourists make their way there annually. The
Hawaiian word for House of the Sun, Haleakala offers the best
vantage site on the island; on clear days, you can see all the way
to the Big Island.
</P>
<P>
   Another morning, after bird-watching on our terrace overlooking
the beach, we decided to go for a drive. The winding, narrow road
to Hana on the east coast, taking more than four hours to traverse
one way, was too much for one day, we decided, so we took off
instead for the little-visited northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles north of our condo, the clusters of hotels and
shopping centers began to thin out and the road narrowed. We drove
for miles, only passing another car every five or 10 minutes. Every
few miles, there would be a wide turnout, filled with cars parked
every which way; just below would be a beach, sparsely populated
with sunbathers and swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   The view at every stop was just like a postcard: cliffs tumbling
to the water, waves crashing against white sand beaches and jagged
black rocks, a lone yacht anchored in the bay. No wonder I loved
Maui; this was what I had dreamed of, when I thought of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, with the benefit of hindsight, even Honolulu came to
grow on me.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remember sitting in the beachside dining room of the Royal
Hawaiian, the big pink hotel that was one of Waikiki's first,
watching the sunset and sipping a Blue Hawaiian (a strong one, this
time) as islanders tied up their catamarans and windsurfers for the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remember Pearl Harbor: the survivor of the bombing who,
wearing a cap and name tag marking him as a veteran, proudly told
of how he'd fought back that day. The silent ride out to the
memorial at the sunken Arizona, where the names of the dead were
etched on the wall. The oil bubbling up around the floating
memorial, leaking from the battleship entombed beneath, as if the
sea itself were still weeping.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remember the USS Missouri, and standing on the deck where
the Japanese surrendered, and hearing for the first time that my
stepmother's brother had been aboard the ship that day, a witness
to history.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll remember standing on the peak of Diamond Head,
surveying the island spread out below me as the sun rose on another
day in paradise. It was a very good reminder that sometimes,
destinations become popular with tourists for a very good reason.

 &HT;    A TRUE LOOK AT TAMMY FAYE'S MAKEUP(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug abuse. Sex scandals. Vicious backbiting. Missing millions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the life of a TV preacher can be pretty rough.
</P>
<P>
   So says (beginitalic)The (enditalic)(beginitalic)Eyes of Tammy
Faye(enditalic), a compelling documentary about life behind the
pulpit that examines the rise and fall of PTL, one of the most
successful television ministries in history.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato combine old footage,
interviews and an innovative style to produce a stunning portrait
of the so-called ``electric church.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye, of course, used to be Tammy Faye Bakker. She was
married to televangelist Jim Bakker, who built PTL from nothing,
only to see it destroyed by the Jessica Hahn sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Tammy Faye Bakker Messner has been little more than
a (beginitalic)Saturday Night Live (enditalic)joke. Because of her
garish makeup - the movie includes a hilarious tour of her makeup
bag - and squeaky speaking voice, the mainstream media made her out
to be a clownish loon, little more than an amusing sideshow to
Jim's fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   In a sympathetic portrait, the film shows the other side of
Tammy Faye, who comes off surprisingly candid and quite sane. If
we're to believe the producers, Tammy Faye is a victim, a
well-meaning Christian entertainer done in by her husband's hubris
and the ambition of fellow TV preacher Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by RuPaul, the film notes that Tammy Faye was one of
the first religious figures to openly embrace those who were
rejected by other churches: gays, AIDS victims and drug addicts.
She also survived bouts with drug addiction and cancer, along with
the foundering of her marriage and career.
</P>
<P>
   The film also points out that Tammy Faye was a tireless
entertainer, sometimes doing TV shows for hours at a time with no
script. It's also clear that she has a good singing voice, which
she used to produce dozens of albums.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the movie offers a fascinating look into the early
days of televangelism, which is rooted in the work of old-time
traveling preachers, such as Oral Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   It includes priceless footage from Jim and Tammy's early days,
when they created hand puppets to entertain children on one of the
first Christian TV shows. Their partner was none other than Pat
Robertson, who later became well-known as the host of
(beginitalic)The 700 Club(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   After several false starts, Jim and Tammy struck gold with the
Charlotte, N.C.-based PTL (Praise the Lord) network, which produced
Las Vegas-style shows and eventually was on 24 hours a day. At the
height of their success, the pair built Heritage USA, the world's
first Christian theme park, which, at one time, was third in
attendance behind Disneyland and Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all came tumbling down after it was revealed that
Jim had had a tryst with Hahn, a young church employee. According
to Tammy Faye, Falwell used that news to leverage the Bakkers out
of PTL. Falwell, for his part, said he assumed control of PTL at
Jim Bakker's request.
</P>
<P>
   The film also takes some shots at (beginitalic)The Charlotte
Observer(enditalic), which won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of
the PTL scandal. In one of the film's most poignant moments, Tammy
Faye confronts the reporter who wrote the stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he asks for her autograph.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Lower humidity will return to the Northeast on Friday as light
breezes bring drier air south from Canada. Patches of early fog
will yield to plentiful sun, boosting readings to seasonal levels
by the afternoon. Farther south, scattered showers will accompany a
front plodding south through the Middle Atlantic States. Meanwhile,
partial sunshine and seasonably high humidity will cover the
Southeast with isolated thunderstorms erupting during the heat of
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Oppressive heat will persist in much of the Plains. Amid sunny
skies, daytime highs will near 100 degrees from central Kansas to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will shroud parts of the Pacific coast, especially in the
Northwest where onshore winds arrive. Most of the West will be dry,
but spotty thunderstorms will form near some mountain peaks in the
afternoon.

<P>
   FOCUS: THE DEMISE OF DEBBY
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, satellite images showed a delicate swirl, the eye
of the storm, emerging from beneath the cluster of clouds that
surrounded Hurricane Debby. The tempest was being torn apart. The
demise of the storm began when part its circulation encountered the
mountains of Hispaniola. As the hurricane weakened, brisk winds
from the east in the lowest 5,000 feet of the atmosphere drove its
low-level circulation away from the tops of the tall thunderstorms
that had been essential to the storm's heat engine. By Thursday,
the swirl had vanished and with it so had the storm called Debby.

`SPENT': ODDS ARE THIS GAMBLER'S GOT PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Spent'' Max (Jason London) is such an inveterate gambler
that he leaves everything to chance. He picks his sports bets by
writing team names on a piece of paper, then carefully tearing it
up and flinging the scraps into the air. He bets on the teams whose
names are on the pieces he grabs. It's as imaginative a way to play
out a gambling addiction as has been seen in the movies in a long
time. This crazy character moment comes early enough in the picture
to make the audience believe there is going to be more such
characterization ahead. There isn't, though. ``Spent'' coasts on
that gesture and then finally runs out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spent'' is essentially a movie about people unable to
communicate, which in this film is synonymous with denial. That
point is made clear by the opening, a montage of motivational
speakers from infomercials bellowing into the camera, admonishing
viewers about wasting their lives and potential.
</P>
<P>
   Max's roommate, Grant (James Parks), has a crush on him but
refuses to admit he is gay. And there are scenes like the one
featuring the of Max's girlfriend, Brigette (Charlie Spradling),
and her parents at brunch. Brigette, who has a drinking problem, is
downing one chardonnay after another. Her mother clicks away with
castanets to make herself the center of attention, and her father
stares obliviously into space.
</P>
<P>
   The writer and director, Gil Cates Jr., is trying to make a
movie out of of grand, memorable sequences like Max's flinging the
bits of paper, and his future, into the air. But much of the rest
of the picture rings hollow and imitative: for example, the glib,
self-mocking chatter between Max, an unemployed actor, and his
show-biz hanger-on friends Doug (Phil Lewis) and Nathan (Erin
Beaux), which reaches at wit and succeeds only in showing the
strain.
</P>
<P>
   The main story, such as it is, involves Max's not coping with
his addiction, persisting in gambling long after it has left him
teetering on personal and financial ruin. A subplot about a script
Doug has written for Jack Nicholson _ a script about a movie star
obsessed with his floor seats for the Lakers _ is too obvious to
get the laughs it's after.
</P>
<P>
   Cates' material feels autobiographical; he must have lived many
of Max's moments, and the pathetic self-absorption of the losers on
the periphery of the movie business has an ache that is often real.
``I got a residual from that `Silk Stalkings' episode,'' Max says
to explain what he's living on. Cates is from a successful show
business family, and he probably grew up knowing the kind of
aimless guys who, in the backs of their minds, always knew they had
money to fall back on. (His father is the well-known television
director Gil Cates; his uncle Joe gets an executive producer credit
on ``Spent,'' and his brother Jonathan is its editor.)
</P>
<P>
   Max is also good at sifting through his options, shifting loans
and debts like chess pieces, and scamming family friends like the
naive Walsh (Barbara Barrie) into keeping him afloat. He gets a
charge from being just barely a step ahead, and the sick look on
his face when he loses a bet shows how deeply he has sunk into his
gambling addiction. But ``Spent'' lacks the junkie's rush, the
juice that keeps gamblers going. Cates wants to set up a mirror,
making Max self-righteous about Brigette's alcoholism. The whole
thing feels minor, though, and the troubles seem only skin deep:
``The Days of Whine and Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to give all of its characters face time, ``Spent'' is
spread so thin that what narrative thread there is dissipates.
There's an unwieldy attempt to graft farce onto the mingy
melodrama. By the end the most vivid figure on the screen is the
lovable doggie, who goes wherever dangling fingers are waiting to
give the happy pooch a scratch.

`CHALK': A DOWN-AND OUT TALE OF A POOL HUSTLER AND A $10,000 BET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmed in 1993 by the members of a San Francisco theater group
for the homeless, ``Chalk'' may be more interesting for what it
represents than for the disappointingly generic down-and-out tale
it relates.
</P>
<P>
   The film is the work of Rob Nilsson, one of the originators of
the contemporary American independent film. (His ``Northern
Lights,'' made in Minnesota, dates back to 1978.) In 1991 Nilsson
moved into the Tenderloin district of San Francisco with the
intention of writing a screenplay about the area's inhabitants. As
part of his preparation he founded a free acting workshop, the
Tenderloin Action Group, open to any resident of a San Francisco
shelter. Although the original project never got off the ground,
Nilsson discovered a number of promising performers and wrote
``Chalk'' with the help of his longtime collaborator, Don Bajema,
around the talents of the nonprofessional actors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie takes place in a harborfront pool hall called
the Crab Tree _ actually a Bay Area warehouse fixed up by Nilsson
and his crew _ where the wily, ailing owner, Earl Watson (Edwin
Johnson), urges on the sibling rivalry between his unsuccessful
son, Jones (Johnny Reese), who is half-Korean and half-black, and
TC (Kelvin Han Yee, a professional actor), an Asian-American whom
Watson took under his wing when he was a child and developed into a
world-class pool hustler. Jones urges TC to take on the legendary
pool shark Dorian James (played by the wiry Bajema) for a $10,000
bet, secretly hoping that his brother will lose and his father's
affection will return to him.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson's affection for the work of John Cassavetes is apparent
in every dark, smoky frame of ``Chalk,'' which strives to capture
the grit and authenticity of Cassavetes' 1976 ``Killing of a
Chinese Bookie.'' But Nilsson doesn't have his elder's sense of
structure _ apparently improvised, Cassavetes' films were actually
tightly scripted and carefully composed _ and much of ``Chalk''
feels aimless and repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   A former shipyard worker who became a drifter after the death of
his wife, Johnson is cool and convincing as Watson, a character who
combines Don King and King Lear. But many of the other
characterizations suffer from excessive sentimentality _
revelations of soft interiors beneath tough exteriors _ and the
film finally fails to escape the conventions of the Hollywood
cinema it so proudly deplores.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after its making, ``Chalk'' still has not found a
national distributor and is being released theater by theater by
members of the Tenderloin Action Group. In New York it opens Friday
at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in Manhattan.

ONE-THIRD LESS IN BAY STATE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' robust economy helped cut the number of
people without health insurance by almost a third, giving 158,000
more people access to regular medical care than in 1998, according
to a state report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the number of uninsured children was
reduced by half, leaving only 2.8 percent of Massachusetts kids
without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At time when the uninsured population in the United States
continues to swell, state officials said the finding was a
testament to the unique, medically-focused, political climate here,
where a Republican governor and private businesses were among the
driving forces behind the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the medical and public health capital of the world,''
said state Department of Public Health Commissioner Howard Koh.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that about 1 in 20 state residents were without
health coverage in 1999. The national figure is 1 in six, or 44
million people. Only 1 in 50 children here were uninsured, the
study found, compared to more than 1 in 10 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci trumpeted the report at the Boston
Medical Center Thursday, where a crowd of doctors and
administrators gathered in the hospital's lobby to hear him
proclaim that the state's uninsured population had ``fallen
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing better than the nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report did contain one troubling finding, said Celucci: The
number of blacks without coverage was double that of whites, and
the number of uninsured Latinos tripled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unacceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But overall the increase in insurance coverage represents a
significant advance in the quality of life for state residents,
said health experts. Those with coverage are more likely, though
regular check-ups, to diagnose and treat health problems before
they become serious. And they have access to prescription drugs,
which have become crucial in keeping chronic health problems in
check.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the uninsured are the working poor, according to
the report. More than two-thirds of the uninsured had jobs. Of
those, about 70 percent had employers that elected not to offer
health coverage for economic reasons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Massachusetts employers were more likely to offer
insurance than their counterparts in most other states, said health
policy experts. In 1999 Massachusetts had 2.1 percent unemployment;
the number of employers that refused to offer coverage dropped to 7
percent, from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a culture here among employers of
providing coverage,'' said Rick Lord, president of the Associated
Industries of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Lord sounded the only discordant note of the day when he
attacked a universal health care proposal that will appear on the
November election ballot. If passed, it would mandate universal
government-provided health coverage. Lord said such a measure
``would dismantle the HMO system'' because patients might be able
to select any doctor they desire.
</P>
<P>
   Lord and the 5400 companies he represents are in the midst of
developing a fall ad campaign aimed at defeating the ballot
question, under the banner of ``No On Five.'' They believe it would
increase health care costs in general and put HMOs out of business.
They prefer the approach championed by Cellucci, which seeks to
slowly chip away at the uninsured population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incremental approach is working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those increments is the state's Children's Medical
Security Plan, which offers coverage to every child in the state.
The only obstacle to covering all of them, said officals, is
informing parents of the program's existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been beating the doors down,'' said Cellucci, promising
to continue the effort.

`BITTERSWEET MOTEL': LOVE PHLOWS BETWEEN PHISH AND PHANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sheer niceness is not a quality you expect to find in a rock
concert film. But niceness is precisely the ambience of
``Bittersweet Motel,'' Todd Phillips' bland, unrevealing
documentary of the hugely popular cult band Phish on tour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This rock quartet is one band for whom the standard equation of
sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll hardly applies. Instead of sex, think
hugs and naked fans innocently romping outdoors. Instead of drugs,
think soy milk strained through homemade oatmeal cookies. Or the
Grateful Dead with the mystical psychedelic burners turned on low.
</P>
<P>
   True, Phish's redheaded lead singer, Trey Anastasio, is shown
drinking beer, and in one scene he might be a tiny bit tipsy. But
guzzling beer is something even the squarest college Joes like to
do on a Saturday night. Another scene observes some teen-age
parking attendants at a Phish concert discussing the chemistry of
marijuana, but the members of Phish itself aren't shown smoking or
snorting anything.
</P>
<P>
   As for sex, one scene finds Anastasio amiably fending off an
enthusiastic but inarticulate female fan who might possibly have
designs on him. If she does, he seems not to notice. Instead of
exuding any macho Dionysian charisma or sartorial flash in concert,
Phish prefers to convey the bonhomie of superannuated collegiate
nerds. (The band members are all in their mid-30s.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, Anastasio has by far the most screen time. He muses
affably about a bad review that accused Phish of artistically
``urinating on the audience'' and expresses pride that over the
years, the members have remained friends. He was born in New Jersey
and describes himself as a child of the '70s in his eclectic
musical tastes. The quartet's other members _ its keyboardist, Page
McConnell; its bassist, Mike Gordon; and its drummer, Jon Fishman _
remain politely in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Phish's very first gig, at an ROTC dance in the mid-80s,
Anastasio recalls, was not a success, and the students tried to
drown out the band's version of ``Proud Mary'' by turning up the
volume on Michael Jackson's ``Thriller.'' But Phish improved and
developed an ever-widening fan base, largely through word of mouth
and more recently through the Internet. The group eventually became
America's most popular band to sustain a following while remaining
largely under the radar of the mass media. Phish's albums have sold
in the millions without the benefit of hit singles or MTV
promotional buzz. Like the Dead, to whom Phish is inevitably
compared, the group is known for marathon concerts that are never
the same and draws the same kind of nomadic hordes who follow the
band from gig to gig.

   ``Bittersweet Motel'' includes quite a bit of music, but not
nearly enough to show the band's range of musical interests or its
ability to create wonderful free-floating jams. Its essential style
is an upbeat, improvisatory folk-rock, reminiscent of the Dead's,
that often rides on a cheerfully chugging beat. Like the Dead,
Phish lacks a polished lead singer, and the group's homegrown vocal
harmonies are frequently out of tune. But that's part of its folksy
charm.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic event in the movie is an outdoor concert near
a small town in Maine at which the fans were invited to take off
their clothes and lie down in a circle. Glimpsed from afar, the
spectacle of 1,200 naked bodies scrunched together resembles
nothing so much as a huge stack of freshly caught fish baking in
the sun. Or is that baked Phish?

BUSH PUSHES $1.3 TRILLION TAX CUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ After admitting he has not done a good enough job
selling his $1.3 trillion tax-cut proposal, George W. Bush Thursday
relied on a smiling family of four to argue that his plan would
help working Americans and not just the wealthy, as Al Gore has
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put a face on the current tax-relief package,'' the
Republican presidential contender said on a day in which he and
Vice President Al Gore stepped up the debate over the effects and
fairness of their competing tax proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, Bush illustrated his point with Andrew and
Margaret Bechac of Mandeville and their two daughters. Bechac, a
high school football coach and former local Republican activist,
said: ``We want to thank Governor Bush with his proposed tax cuts,
because I truly believe in education. I am a school teacher, and we
would love to plan our future around educating our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Bechac pledged to place the $1,600 he would save under the Bush
plan in an educational trust fund for his girls, 4-year-old
Meredith and 1-year-old Camille. The two wore freshly pressed pink
dresses at a news conference arranged in the aftermath of Gore's
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing tax code, the Bechacs pay $2,075 in federal
taxes on $40,000 of annual income. Bush has proposed an
across-the-board tax cut and doubling the current $500 per child
tax credit. Those changes would reduce the Bechacs' federal taxes
to $475.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast to the Gore tax-cut proposal, Bush aides said
the Bechacs would not qualify for any of the child care, higher
education, prescription drug, or other narrowly defined breaks
included in the vice president's $500 billion tax-cut plan. Gore's
campaign said a typical family of four with a gross income of
$40,000 would be eligible for $2,525 in tax credits under the Gore
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called targeted tax cut means that some are targeted
out of tax relief,'' said Bush. ``I believe that Andrew and his
family should have more money in their pocket. They ought to share
in some of the surplus, so that he can make decisions for his
children, so that they can plan for their children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a luncheon speech before the Louisiana Republican
Party, the Texas governor said, ``I ask you, I ask America to take
a look at the facts in these tax plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with the Bechacs was part of a more aggressive
response by the Bush campaign as Gore has pulled even or ahead in
public opinion polls. One of the vice president's messages has been
that Bush's tax plan _ a hallmark of his campaign _ was tilted
toward the wealthy and would ``wreck our good economy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush admitted he had not done a good job selling his
proposal. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut, immediately seized upon the comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to Governor Bush, the problem isn't
explaining the tax plan, it's the plan itself,'' Lieberman told a
Florida audience Wednesday. ``And the problem is that it benefits
the wealthy, not the hard-working families in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued pounding that drum Thursday, meeting with a
family in Maryland to highlight his higher-education tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed granting a tax cut with about a quarter of the
$4.6 trillion federal budget surplus projected over the next 10
years. Under his 10-year, $1.3 trillion plan, Bush would reduce the
five tax brackets to four, drop the highest one from 39.6 percent
to 33 percent, and reduce the lowest one from 15 percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He would also reduce the so-called marriage penalty and repeal
the estate tax over an eight-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying Bush's plan is his oft-stated principle that ``it's
the not the government's money, it's the people's money.'' He also
argues that if the entire surplus remained in Washington, ``the
appropriators will appropriate it.''
</P>
<P>
   In dollar terms, the wealthy would benefit the most from Bush's
plan: About 60 percent of the $1.3 trillion would go to taxpayers
earning $92,500 or more, with 12 percent going to those with
incomes of $39,300 or less.
</P>
<P>
   According to Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-funded research
group that studies how taxes affect middle-class people, the
richest taxpayers, those earning over $319,000 a year, would get an
average $46,000 tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argues that Bush's plan uses budget surpluses for rich
people who don't need tax help, jeopardizing spending on education,
the national debt, Social Security and a Medicare prescription drug
benefit. Bush contends the surplus is big enough to accommodate his
tax cut and still take care of the other priorities. Even after
setting aside Social Security funds and granting his tax cut, Bush
estimates there would still be about $1 trillion for other
spending.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has proposed a $500 billion tax cut that
includes a lengthy list of specific tax credits and deductions
aimed at the roughly 80 percent of taxpayers earning less than
$75,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   They include breaks for long-term health care, higher education,
small-business health insurance, after-school expenses, and
tax-free retirement savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says a married couple with two children _ one in college _
earning $60,000 a year could save $3,025 in taxes if they took
advantage of his proposed retirement savings accounts, increased
standard deduction for married couples, and credit for college
tuition. This is a bigger tax cut than under Bush's plan in those
circumstances, the Gore campaign says.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign counters that Gore's proposals are so
detailed, some 50 million Americans would not qualify for a tax
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the tax debate,'' Bush declared to reporters
Thursday aboard his campaign plane. He refused to back down when
told polls do not show support for a large tax cut. Instead, Bush
said he considered that fact to be a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walk in front of Congress, should I be the president,
and say, `This is what I campaigned on from Day One,' the people in
the Congress are going to hear that the people have spoken. And it
may not show up in that survey you read, but it's going to show up
in this guy's wallet today,'' he said, referring to Bechac.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes challenged Gore's assertion that
he was the candidate for working families and Bush only cares about
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the Bechac family, with a $40,000 annual income,
don't represent the rich or the powerful. They are a working
family, and Vice President Gore's targeted tax cut misses the
target for them, as well as for a lot of other families,'' Hughes
said.

   PARAGUAY: OPPOSITION VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   After a tense 12-day delay in counting the vote, a narrow
victory was won by Julio Cesar Franco, the opposition Liberal Party
candidate to replace the vice president assassinated last year. The
defeat of Felix Argana, son of the slain official, is the first at
the national level for the governing Colorado Party since it came
to power in 1947, and is expected to weaken the position of the
unpopular president, Luis Gonzalez Macchi, who was appointed in the
chaos that followed the slaying.

   Five bomb blasts damaged two businesses and three trucks in the
Basque cities of San Sebastian and Irun as violence linked to a
separatist campaign by the armed group ETA continued. No one was
injured in the explosions, which authorities said were part of

   The high court has upheld the corruption conviction of former

It reduced his sentence, however, from seven years to five while
also fining him about $1 million. Ershad, who had been free on bail
since 1997, is expected to appeal.

   SOUTH AFRICA: PRESS CALLED RACIST

   In a long-awaited report on bias in the country's press, the
South African Human Rights Commission called the media racist and
criticized news organizations for not doing enough to identify and
eliminate racist views and practices. The 97-page report urged news
organizations to come up with more effective ways of monitoring
themselves, stopping short of proposing any new layer of government
regulation.

   ZIMBABWE: POLICE REBUFFED
</P>
<P>
   After the police took the unusual step of destroying the
dwellings of squatters occupying farms outside the capital, senior
government officials disavowed the action, saying it contradicted
policy. The move against the squatters, who have occupied more
hundreds of farms for several months, had raised the hopes of South
Africa, which has been pressing Zimbabwe's leaders to end the

CARTOONS GET HIP IN KIDS' WB SERIES `GENERATION O!'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LANA BERKOWITZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Can't miss Molly O's big mouth. She makes a living with it, and
sometimes it gets her into kid-size trouble.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new Kids' WB animated Saturday morning series
``Generation O!,'' Molly O is a singer for a top rock band, and
she's only 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   She's rich and famous, but she still lives at home with her
loving, but clueless, parents. There's also an older brother, Buzz,
who Molly O says can be ``very, very annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bandmates are quirky, too: Cousin Eddie (Edwina) plays lead
guitar, Nub is the bass player, and the drummer is a kangaroo named
Yo-Yo.
</P>
<P>
   The series opens on a topical note in this election year with a
political episode. It's titled ``Damp Sheets.'' Ask a member of the
target audience, ages 6-11, what that means, and see if you get a
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   During this election story, Molly O flies to Washington, D.C.,
to sing her song ``Favorite Son'' in support of a senator's
presidential campaign. Along the way she discovers the senator is
not a nice man. He mistreats his dog, Rayburn, even pulls the poor
hound's ears, a la Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Molly O balks at supporting the politician, but the unscrupulous
senator threatens to reveal one of Molly O's embarrassing secrets
if she doesn't perform. Yes, her secret is a bed-wetting accident
after an overindulgence of juice.
</P>
<P>
   After much agonizing, she performs. But she slips in her new
song ``Damp Sheets.'' It's not a rousing Bruce Springsteen rocker,
but it gets the crowd on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   The original songs in the 13 half-hour episodes are written and
performed by Letters to Cleo, a Boston-based band that appeared in
the film ``10 Things I Hate About You.'' Lead singer Kay Hanley has
recorded five songs for the upcoming live-action film ``Josie and
the Pussycats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation O!'' offers positive messages about friendship and
responsibility in a cheery package. And there's no violence, unless
you count the sister-brother tussles.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday morning debut continues Kids' WB's rollout of new
series. ``Generation O!'' will settle into a Friday afternoon time
slot when the Saturday morning lineup debuts Sept. 23.

`THE MOST TERRIBLE TIME': PRIVATE EYE   AVENGING   SOME PUBLIC
THUGGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mildly amusing Japanese appropriation of 1950s American
detective movies, ``The Most Terrible Time in My Life'' relates the
life and crimes of a Yokohama private dick named Maiku Hama. Say it
fast four or five times and the hidden reference to Mickey
Spillane's notably brutal character Mike Hammer grandly emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Hama is played by Masatoshi Nagase, the dyspeptic, terminally
bored-looking young man Jim Jarmusch recruited to play a lethargic
Japanese tourist in his 1989 ``Mystery Train.'' At first, it's
surprising to see how little Nagase appears to have aged in 11
years. It turns out that ``The Most Terrible Time,'' which opens
Friday, was actually made in 1993 and has since been patiently
awaiting American distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, America has probably not been awaiting ``The Most
Terrible Time in My Life,'' patiently or otherwise, since this
nation is fully capable of producing mildly amusing detective
spoofs all on its own. The director, Kaizo Hayashi, incorporates
the references, standard since Jean-Luc Godard's ``Breathless,'' to
the Bogart myth and the gangster films of the big hat, pin-stripe
suit era. But where Godard was revealing the unstable existential
underpinnings of the Bogart legend, Hayashi offers a far more
naive, romantic version of the material. It often feels like little
children playing dress-up, and indeed the film was said to have
started a fad for private detective gear among Japanese teen-agers
when it was released.
</P>
<P>
   Nagase does look sharp in his pork pie hat and sunglasses,
particularly when he hops behind the wheel of his lustrously
polished 1954 convertible. Maiku Hama keeps his office in a heavily
symbolic location, just off the upper balcony of a run-down
neighborhood movie theater where ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' is
playing to small groups of Yokohama film buffs. (The Japanese
characters on the marquee flip over to reveal the title of
Hayashi's film.) But his work comes to him in the storefront
gambling parlor where he spends his lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   He rescues a Taiwanese busboy from a savage beating by local
Yakuza thugs, losing his little finger in the process. When the
busboy, Yang Haitin (the actor uses his own name in the part),
wants to reward Hama for his efforts, he offers to pay him to find
his brother, De Jian (Hou De Jian), who has disappeared into the
Japanese underworld and taken on a Japanese name.
</P>
<P>
   The film finds its only resonance here, in the theme of mainland
immigration and the prejudice that Korean immigrants in particular
experience in Japan. ( Hayashi was born to Korean parents in
Kyoto.) The brother is actually a big-time hood who is organizing a
group of fellow newcomers into a brutal new gang, which he calls
the New Japs; it's a development that adds a deepening darkness and
violence to the film's final reels.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a film more about look and attitude than about
social issues. Its outstanding feature is the soft-edged,
black-and-white wide-screen images contributed by Yuichi Nagata.
They almost perfectly recapture the look of Japanese underworld
films of the 1950s and '60s, like Mikio Naruse's ``When a Woman
Ascends the Stairs'' and Akira Kurosawa's ``High and Low.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Most Terrible Time in My Life'' was a hit in its home
country and inspired two sequels, one of which, the garishly
colored ``Stairway to the Distant Past,'' is given a preview at the
end of this film. More patient waiting appears to be in store. &QL;

NASA LOOKING TO MORE DISTANT VISTAS: MARS IS GRAND GOAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as it leads the partnership assembling a new Earth-orbiting
space station, NASA is looking to more distant vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Possible destinations include the moon, visited by Apollo
astronauts between 1969 and 1972; an asteroid; or a solar orbit
nearly a million miles away that would serve as the site for a
powerful new space telescope.
</P>
<P>
   But especially, Mars is a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars continues to be the grand goal,'' said Bret Drake, who
leads mission planning activities at NASA's Johnson Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   These exotic missions are more than a decade away from
launching. And unlike the Apollo flights that spanned less than two
weeks, these would require explorers to leave the Earth for months
to years, raising technical hurdles and raising the cost into the
billions.
</P>
<P>
   White House space policy directives confine human activity to
the new space station and the shuttle. But they allow NASA to
engage in research to develop advanced human life support
equipment, deep space propulsion systems and cost cutting
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday NASA will open the gates of Johnson Space Center
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. CDT, offering the public its free annual
behind-the-scenes look at what its experts are doing to open those
final frontiers. The activities focused on getting humans far from
the Earth will be interspersed among more than 100 displays that
feature current pursuits, like the space station, the shuttle and
mission control.

   Under development in Building 29 is the BIO-Plex, a cave-like
collection of large interconnecting cylinders with the internal
feel of a future deep space base. BIO-Plex will serve as the
laboratory for the development of life support systems that could
sustain explorers on long voyages or settlers on the moon or Mars
by recycling their breathing air, drinking water and food.
</P>
<P>
   Without intensive recycling, NASA would be faced with supplying
each of its deep space explorers with nearly 50,000 pounds of fresh
supplies annually at a transportation cost of at least $10,000 per
pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd never be permitted to mount such a mission,'' said Don
Henninger, NASA's chief advanced life support researcher at
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In late 2003, four volunteers will march into the BIO-Plex for a
240-day stay, relying on a combination of plants, compact machinery
and chemicals to recycle the air they breath as well as their urine
and the water they use to shower and wash their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The experimenters will be trained to grow some of their own
food, including salad vegetables, sweet potatoes and wheat that can
be processed into bread.
</P>
<P>
   By 2008, the facility will be home to volunteers for 540-day
recycling trials, tests that begin to approach the current estimate
of a single Mars mission.
</P>
<P>
   The BIO-Plex will likely be used to study the psychological
stresses of the isolation and confinement posed by the long flights
as well as health care strategies.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab, the monster swimming pool in which
astronauts train for spacewalks to assemble the new space station,
also houses the small Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory. The
facilities are located north of the main Johnson campus and
adjacent to Ellington Field.
</P>
<P>
   Within the propulsion lab, astronaut and physicist Franklin
Chang Diaz is directing the development of an electric propulsion
system that could cut in half the 10-month travel time to Mars
needed by conventional chemical rockets.
</P>
<P>
   More rapid travel would cut the health risks to astronauts from
cosmic radiation, a threat that experts have yet to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   The propulsion researchers hope to deploy a test prototype of
their variable specific impulse magneto-plasma rocket from the
space shuttle in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The design uses electrical current to create radio waves that
heat hydrogen fuel, much the way a microwave oven warms food.
</P>
<P>
   Since convention materials cannot withstand the high
temperatures of a plasma engine, the combustion and the exhaust are
constrained within a magnetic field created by cooled
superconducting magnets.
</P>
<P>
   In their small laboratory, the research team must rely on
electricity from the local power company to warm small samples of
fuel to 50,000 degrees. An actual interplanetary spacecraft would
need a nuclear reactor to heat its fuel to a million degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, researchers at Johnson will finish their
work on an experimental propellant production device that until
recently was to be launched to Mars aboard an unmanned probe in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The launching was postponed indefinitely in the wake of NASA's
loss of the Mars Polar Lander last December.
</P>
<P>
   Called MIPS, short for ``Mars In-Situ-Propellant Production
Precursor,'' the device is about the size of a small microwave oven
and developed to demonstrate that small amounts of oxygen can be
extracted from the plentiful carbon dioxide in the Martian
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Essential to humans for breathing, oxygen is also a rocket
propellant. Researcher David Kaplan estimates a full-scale
production device on the Martian surface could produce about 90
pounds of oxygen a day. Over the long haul, that production rate
would be enough to launch a human crew on the return leg of a Mars
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   By producing oxygen on Mars, NASA could cut the mass of the
cargo it must launch from Earth by 30 percent, a huge cost savings,
said Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a zeolite catalyst that draws oxygen from the Martian
atmosphere during the daily temperature swings on the planet, the
device has few moving parts and requires little electrical power,
lowering the odds of a mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   A life-sized mock-up of MIP will be on display in Building 15 of
the main Johnson campus. The actual flight experiment will be
placed in storage soon where it will await reassignment to a future
Mars launch.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago, a team of scientists from the Johnson made
headlines when it claimed the discovery of fossilized evidence of
primitive bacteria within the crevices of a meteorite of Martian
origin.
</P>
<P>
   Experts continue to debate the claim. But Johnson's expertise in
the preservation of rare meteorites and the lunar rocks gathered by
the Apollo astronauts have made it the storage facility for the
materials that will be collected by robotic rovers launched to Mars
to gather soil and rock samples. Once returned to Earth, the
materials will be examined for signs of biological activity.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 15 meteorites recovered from the Earth have been traced
to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A fist sized sample of the first of those identified to be
Martian, EETA 79001, a 1-billion-year-old meteorite recovered from
Antarctica will be on display in building 31 of the main Johnson
campus. The rock has not yielded evidence of past Martian life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as close as the general public will ever get to the
planet Mars,'' said Carlton Allen, who serves as Johnson's curator
of astrobiological materials.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display in the same facility will be NASA's Genesis
probe. The small spacecraft is slated for launching in February.
The unmanned probe was designed to gather samples of material from
the solar wind and return with it to Earth in late 2003. The
materials will be stored at Johnson.

   ISRAEL-BARAK (Jerusalem) _ In a clear warning to the
Palestinians to compromise on Jerusalem and other issues, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday that he was prepared if the peace
talks fail to invite the right-wing Likud party to join in a
national unity government and even to appoint Ariel Sharon, the
hawkish former army general who is Likud's leader, as foreign
minister. A month after the Camp David peace talks ended with wide
differences over Jerusalem between Barak and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, Barak's suggestion appeared to be putting
Arafat on notice that Israel could back away from its offer of a
limited foothold in Jerusalem for the Palestinians and establish a
government that, with Likud at its heart, would almost certainly
put a break on any peace deal that involved major concessions to
the Palestinians. By John F. Burns.

   COLOMBIA-U.S. (Bogota) _ As President Clinton prepares to visit
Colombia next week and turn on the spigot of military aid,
Colombia's neighbors are expressing growing concerns that an
escalation of the fighting here could cast coca growing, drug
trafficking, refugees and even fighting across their borders. The
Colombian conflict has already led to guerrilla incursions into
Panama and Venezuela for safe haven. U.S. military officials warn
that one Colombian rebel group already exerts influence over Indian
dissidents in Ecuador, and new Colombian plantings of coca and
poppies have been reported in Peru. By Clifford Krauss.

million small and medium-sized private enterprises in a country of

with the way things are, and she is likely to vote for the reformed

   INDIANS-POLITICS (Lummi Indian Reservation, Wa.) _ Mention the
name Slade Gorton in this far corner of Indian Country and some
people will talk about Slade Gorton the senior senator from
Washington who helped to secure $15 million this year to replace a
decrepit tribal school. But most people will think of Slade Gorton
the Indian fighter, the better-known and much-feared figure, a
72-year-old Republican who has spent much of his public life
battling the Lummis and other tribes on everything from fishing
rights to the power of governing their own affairs. In all the
years that Gorton has feuded with American Indians, he has never
suffered a strong political backlash from the tribes. But this
year, flush with money from casino gambling operations, Indians
across the country say they are going to make him pay. By Timothy

   HEALTH-BUYERS-CLUBS (Undated) _ After decades of ceding control
over their care to cost-conscious health plans, consumers appear
ready to reclaim at least some of the decision-making authority
that they had in the years before managed care. Now, a number of
new companies are setting up shop, often on the Internet, to offer
people with little or no health care discount medical services,
cheaper prescription drugs and reduced rates on everything from
dental care and chiropractics to eye care and acupuncture. The new
companies, many of which operate like buyers' clubs like Costco,
are intended to let consumers and their doctors, decide which
medical services they need rather than deferring to case managers
at a managed-care companies. Customers pay for medical services
with cash or credit cards and typically pay a small annual fee to
belong to the plan. In exchange for the opportunity to get paid
immediately, doctors in the programs agree to serve consumers at
reduced fees comparable to those they receive from managed care
companies. By Milt Freudenheim.

`GOD'S ARMY' : MOVIE WITH A MISSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
Houston Chronicle 
``God's Army'' is a low-cost, appealing independent production that
unapologetically targets the nearly 5 million American members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, otherwise known as
Mormons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an example of how a little creativity and sensitive
writing can make a niche movie attractive to those beyond its
target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's Army'' is the brainchild of Richard Dutcher, an
experienced filmmaker who wrote, produced, directed and starred in
a movie sure to leave Mormon audiences teary-eyed and standing
tall. Non-Mormons may not be as emotionally pumped but can enjoy an
entertaining, interesting movie.
</P>
<P>
   Dutcher, a former missionary to Mexico, knows well that the
appearance of Mormon missionaries automatically deploys the Faith
Defense Deflector Shields of non-Mormons. He shows an irreverent
wit with humorous scenes of residents using clever and
not-so-clever ploys to shoo the missionaries away from the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's Army'' focuses on the adventures of a hearty band of
white-shirted, tie-bedecked young male missionaries spreading the
church's message in the less than welcoming streets of Los Angeles.
The action centers primarily on 19-year-old Brandon Allen (Matthew
Brown) and his mentor, Marcus Dalton (Dutcher).
</P>
<P>
   Dutcher nicely portrays the mission band as serious but just as
genuinely human. They are not beyond frat-style pranks and jokes.
Underneath the white shirts are hearts sometimes torn by
self-doubt, and even doubts about the authenticity of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   A resident skeptic, Kinegar (Michael Buster) brings up questions
about the founding of the church by prophet Joseph Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The drama in ``God's Army'' is driven by the moral struggles of
good people in a messy, indifferent, sometimes hostile world.
</P>
<P>
   The highpoints are the low-key scenes where imperfect souls are
laid bare. It is Allen poignantly explaining how his sometimes
troubled faith was instilled by a stepfather now imprisoned for sex
crimes. Dalton tells of his father's disappointment when he
withdrew from medical school to become a missionary.
</P>
<P>
   While Dutcher effectively creates a scene, he sometimes falters
in blending the scenes for the coherence and drama of a movie.
There are too many one-dimensional characters floating in and out,
blurring the storyline.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the no-name cast is Jacque Gray in the role of
Allen's love interest. While she shines in her few scenes, she is
suddenly and inexplicably sent to another mission. Perhaps Dutcher
is emphasizing that not even love interferes with missions. But in
Hollywood, you keep the strong actors in front of the camera as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The over-long ending is saccharine and replete with a
``miracle.'' But it will be satisfying to most viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Dutcher filmed the movie in 18 days on a
$500,000 budget, ``God's Army'' is a minor cinematic miracle in
itself. &QL;

ABUJA JOURNAL: NIGERIA'S NEW AND NEUTRAL CAPITAL AWAITS CLINTON'S
VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ The street was wide open, with more lanes than
cars, on a quiet afternoon here in Nigeria's shiny new capital. But
somehow, Usman Muhammed, an excitable 28-year-old taxi driver, had
gotten into a fight with a Peugeot immediately recognizable as a
government-owned car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government drivers, they are useless! Criminals!'' Muhammed
yelled, nearly colliding his jalopy with the Peugeot. ``My friend,
why are you driving rough?''
</P>
<P>
   The Peugeot came to a stop at an intersection where Muhammed's
``friend'' promptly used his right hand to form the equivalent of
the Nigerian finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Abuja,'' Muhammed said, somewhat deflated, ``they are all
driving rough.''
</P>
<P>
   He perked up, though, on seeing a Toyota Corolla, which he had
long coveted. ``Once I buy that car,'' he said, ``I go marry my
wife.'' He would have it made, as he explained in Nigerian English:
``Big man don come.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the big men, President Clinton, is to arrive on
Saturday in Abuja, a city that has long been home to government
rough drivers and ordinary Nigerians with big dreams. Nigeria
decided to move its capital from Lagos and create a new one a
quarter of a century ago. But it was only in the last decade that
the government moved here and Abuja grew from a town to be the
capital of Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of so many new government buildings, new
villas, new hotels and new cars on new roads in a country where
every other city seems to teeter on collapse has long fueled
visitors' imaginations, sometimes in unexpected ways. For example,
the troubles in the oil-producing Niger Delta were said to have
grown in recent years after youths from the region came here.
Gaping at the gleaming new capital that the country's oil had
built, they returned to their villages in the mangrove swamps with
a militancy that has since pushed the delta to the brink of civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos _ a city that many Nigerians regard with the same kind of
awe and loathing with which many Americans view New York _ was
abandoned as the capital because it was too crowded, too dangerous,
too closely linked to the Yoruba, the main ethnic group in the
area. In a nation riven with ethnic cleavages, a new capital in a
neutral zone, geographically in the center of the country, was
needed, a symbolic home for all Nigerians. Abuja, an African
Brasilia, was born.
</P>
<P>
   Still, telltale signs of dominance by Nigeria's Muslim
northerners dot Abuja. The new National Assembly building looks
like a mosque. A gold-domed mosque sits in the middle of the city,
not far from an unfinished church.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his two-day visit to Nigeria, Clinton will stay here
with his host, President Olusegun Obasanjo. U.S. officials rejected
visits to the north and south, partly for security reasons, partly
for political ones. Calls to the north and southeast would have
left out and angered those in the southwest. Any visit to a city
other than Abuja would have been a slight to Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   And so Clinton will remain stuck in the neutral zone that is
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, whose residents look down on Abuja the same way New
Yorkers do on Washington, the news came as a shock. If Abuja knows
how to build beautiful roads, Lagos knows how to party. There is
fine pepper soup in every neighborhood restaurant, the best
musicians from the region, enough thrills to provide plenty of what
some English-speaking West Africans call ``life enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much life enjoyment here in Abuja, which becomes a ghost
town on weekends when politicians leave to visit their villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``By leaving Lagos out of Clinton's itinerary, it's a big
mistake,'' said James Uloko, 39, who works in public relations in,
naturally, Lagos. ``From Lagos, you can see all the colors of life
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   At a market here, Sylvester Ebere said he did not want any of
that color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Abuja for security reasons,'' said Ebere, acknowledging
that he had never set foot in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Ebere, 23, moved to Abuja two weeks ago, looking for job
opportunities he has yet to find. ``British trained,'' said Ebere,
who said he had worked as a gardener for a British-owned company in
Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
   For now he is living with his brother, Joel, 28. They were
marketing products like skin cream and tooth powder and share a $7
a month cubicle on the outskirts of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   Housing was the hardest part of living here, said Tony Njoku,
42, a businessman, who paid about $300 a year for a two-bedroom
apartment, 45 minutes from Abuja. Something comparable in the city
itself could cost $2,500. ``No common man is able to rent here,''
said Njoku, who moved here in the late 1980s when Abuja's
population was around 15,000. Now it is an estimated 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1991 that Nigeria's former military ruler, Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida, formally transplanted the capital here, some
months after surviving a coup attempt in Lagos. Since then, in this
country whose economy still depends almost entirely on the
government, the center of gravity has shifted here.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Muhammed, 55, a jobless man from the northern state of
Jigawa, said he had come to Abuja to support his two wives and 23
children back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually go to some big men from my area, who are in
government jobs, to ask for contracts,'' Muhammed said, explaining
that he then sold the contracts _ to clean a road here or to cater
some food there _ to a third party for a markup.
</P>
<P>
   ``But things are very difficult now,'' he said, adding that
Obasanjo's administration had cracked down on the freewheeling
spending of the past. ``The officials no longer want to see us.
They now prefer to give contracts to their girlfriends. You can
hardly see them inside their cars with dark tinted windows.''

HOW ANIMAL INSTINCTS FIGURE IN FALL FASHION. (WITH PHOTO)

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Not all the hides and skins for fall are showing up as clothing.
The accessories market is an easy and sometimes less expensive way
for women to update last year's wardrobe.

LEATHER, SUEDE, FUR AND OTHER ANIMAL INSTINCTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
In a season when political parties are bending over backward to be
politically correct, the fashion industry appears to be taking on
the entire animal population.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Designers followed a decade of converting leopard print to a
classic with a couple of seasons of toying with their favorite pony
prints. Then they moved on to zebras and tigers, and now pythons
and crocodiles, not to mention herds of leather and suede garments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see a cow anywhere, call us,'' said Judy Pryor, owner
of Pryorities boutique in Houston, Tex. ``There is so much leather
for fall we're afraid there's probably not a cow left.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet leather in the new millennium is not the same as leather in
the 1980s or '90s, but more a way to update all-neutral wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   In the over-the-top '80s, leathers were hard-edged, executed as
entire suits or dresses with pleats, ruching and metallic trims.
Then when the fashion world emerged from grunge into the
minimalistic years, the look was a simple black leather jacket,
skirt or pant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black leather jacket especially has become a necessity,''
said Christina Kerford, public relations manager for Macy's. ``It's
a key piece for every wardrobe.'' With that in mind _ and in their
closets _ her customers are now moving on to color.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said that this year her customers are combining leather
with lace and looking to buy metallic leathers and ruffled leather
skirts. For holidays, she will stock turquoise and violet leather,
but the looks are not garish.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are using leather and suede more like fabrics. This
year's soft, thin leather is drapey and sensual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think of fashion-forward things like this unlined, coral
suede jacket, with its fringed edges, as anything but an
accessory,'' Pryor said. ``It's lightweight, it's fun and it's
hip.'' And it has a price tag of $335.
</P>
<P>
   Leathers and suedes come in a wide range of prices, however, and
for those who want to spend even less, there is pleather, a sort of
``plastic leather.''
</P>
<P>
   Other less expensive lookalikes are moleskin, a polyester blend,
and washable suede.
</P>
<P>
   Many women may update their wardrobes with a python-print
blouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many animal prints have become classics,'' said Erin Carmack,
director of fashion presentation for Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Cows and snakes can thank their lucky stars for crocodiles and
alligators, whose popularity is on the upswing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new this season is not leopard but crocodile _ real,
faux or printed _ although python is still strong for fall and
winter,'' Carmack said.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar tile patterns of crocodile skins are being printed
on fabrics as thin as chiffon and embossed on thick leathers for
handbags and shoes. Real skins are around _ at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein and Donna Karan are showing real crocodile clothing
that is cost-prohibitive for most women.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jacket can easily run $20,000,'' she said, noting that with
new technology, designers and manufacturers are achieving crocodile
prints as authentic-looking as the work achieved by the makers of
artificial wood flooring.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bryant, retailer of plus-size fashions, is carrying
crocodile- and python-patterned pants and skirts in a thick
polyester faux leather.
</P>
<P>
   Not so more conservative dressers. In many stores, python has
reproduced faster than rabbits. It was the logical move after the
customer tired of leopard, with python's ability to shine in either
neutral or bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   In an astonishing turnaround, many, if not most of this fall's
fur accessories are real, not the popular faux.
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue, for example, furs figure heavily in the
look called ``Neander girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as the beginnings of life in fashion, the wild,
fun-sister side of this fall's ladylike, uptown dresser,'' senior
vice president Jaqui Lividini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fur may be fake or real _ it doesn't matter,'' Lividini
said. ``It's all over the body, but it's not your mother's fur
coat. It's patched, trimmed, shearling, long-haired and colorful.
Color _ that's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the must-haves for fall, she said, is fur neckwear, in
the form of a doughnut collar, shawl or cape. But seeing
full-length fur coats on the street again is not out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are fur bags at Saks, from itsy-bitsy fluffs for
luncheons or evening to tote-size bags in dulled-down shades of
red, green or blue rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   In most women's wardrobes, however, fur is an accessory, a bit
part, not a necessity like leather.

SHOW YOUR STRIPES IN FUNKY PLAIDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
For fall, the ladylike side of the sportswear equation is tweed.
For the younger, hipper crowd, however, style equals plaid _ and
mothers may be jealous.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of these plaids look like ancestral tartans _
red-and-black, navy-and-green. Others are art-project explosions of
color. Picture rust with burgundy, fuchsia with lime green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaid should be funky,'' said Lisa Spain, owner of Cotton Club
in Houston. ``We're using it with suede, leather, little cashmere
sweaters or just as plaid shoes. The look is very clean with only
plaid feet. We don't want our customer looking like a schoolgirl.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Spain doesn't want her youngest customers,
for whom she ordered plaid jumpers, looking too old.
</P>
<P>
   Today's interest in plaid began with the successful rejuvenation
of the house of Burberry. Under the leadership of Rose Marie Bravo,
former president of Saks Fifth Avenue, young designer Roberto
Menichetti moved from a British line of dowdy designs bought mainly
by tourists to high fashion sold around the world. Now Burberry
offers its signature plaid on bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   Plaids for fall look different for more than their colors,
ruffles _ yes, ruffles _ and pairings with animals prints. Some
designers, such as Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, took an Op Art
look, morphing plaids into bold graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Others excelled by cutting plaid on the bias, meaning diagonally
across the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   With A-line skirts and dresses, bias cutting means more movement
and a more body-conscious garment. In looks, bias cutting equals
cute _ far from the school-uniform syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Plaid shows in prom and ball-gown designs, as well as in
feminine, scarf-neck blouses that might look great under a tweed or
leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But don't wear plaid head-to-toe. Mix with other mediums, such
as denim, leather and suede, and even other patterns, including
argyle, camouflage, leopard, tiger, ostrich, crocodile and python.
These are the funky looks to which Spain referred.
</P>
<P>
   Camel, the new neutral of fall, also mixes well with plaid. Just
a touch of plaid _ a shoe or a shirt _ is the modern way to update
last year's gray flannel suit.
</P>
<P>
   Or use it with a twist of embroidery or leather trim, or pair
plaid with a cashmere sweater or leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Plaids were last strong during the grunge period of the late
'80s, but wearing plaids today is more fun, not as contrived.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frank Sinatra is singing ``Blue Skies'' as my
80-something cousin Ceil Merritt changes from her sensible street
shoes into a pair of metallic gold strappy heels. They could be
Cinderella's slippers. For in the next hour and a half she will be
transported from the world of a senior with her share of aches and
pains to that of a fairy princess, dancing waltzes, tangos and
rumbas with a series of princely partners.
</P>
<P>
   Ceil is a regular at the weekly ``Dance Evenings Elegante,''
held on Thursday nights in the social hall of an Upper East Side
church and on alternate Saturday evenings at the Roseland 2000
ballroom, a converted garage in Nutley, N.J. At these events, no
one stands on the sidelines hoping to be asked to dance, and no one
suffers partners who don't know a mambo from a merengue. With twice
as many female dancers as male dancers, the women dance every other
dance, with a chance to rest in between. For the women who
participate, this is dance heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The private dance parties are the invention of Stan Martin, a
magical dancer who began holding them in 1962. As a dance director
at a studio, he was frequently asked by students to continue their
lessons in dance clubs, at their expense. Happily married, he
turned them down, but he then consented to accompany two women at
once, and dance alternately with them. To the sounds of Guy
Lombardo and his orchestra at the Roosevelt Grill, the women had a
fabulous time.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, others asked to join, and Martin, whom everyone
calls Stan, approached another dance instructor about joining them.
The group multiplied quickly, maintaining its 2:1 ratio. When the
Roosevelt Grill closed, they moved to the Savoy Plaza, and when
that was slated for demolition, they tried the Manhattan Room of
the Hotel New Yorker, the Promenade at Rockefeller Center, the St.
Regis roof and the Hotel Taft.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we opened our doors, the hotels closed theirs,'' Stan
explained. For more than 30 years, with Peter Jones, also a former
dance-studio director, as his business partner, they ran the
evenings at Roseland on West 52nd Street. When the ballroom limited
its hours, they shifted to private clubs and then to their present
home at St. Jean Baptiste Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a high-ceilinged chamber on the church's lower level, the 20
or so women greet one another like old friends. Made up with care,
most wear dresses with color and flair. Adjacent to pillars at the
far end of the room, four tables are set with plastic tablecloths
and cups for water, with each woman's place marked with a small
envelope hand-lettered with her name, for the evening's fee. The
single artificial flower at the center of each table becomes a lush
bouquet as the music and dancing begin, and the makeshift dance
hall becomes a palace ballroom in the not-too-distant dreams of the
participants. Elegante, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the women are in their 80s, although the participants
ranged widely in age, with the youngest in her 30s. A lot of years
of dancing _ and a lot of stories _ percolate in the room. Some
women have been dancing all their lives, and others began recently,
perhaps after some family tragedy or a New Year's resolution to
learn to tango. ``I call this my mental health night,'' a nursing
supervisor said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women are widows who found these evenings to be a
way to transcend their loss and solve the practical problem of
lacking a dance partner. One notes that her doctor suggested
dancing as exercise, and more than one mentions that her
psychiatrist sent her. A marketing executive in her 50's said that
dancing fed her soul; an author said that it engaged her mind. For
many, it is the highlight of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the group has included songwriters, editors,
lawyers, a Rockette, wives of well-known men and a woman named Rose
who danced until she was 98 and was buried in her dance shoes.
Today, Eleanor Carlucci, 79, has the longest tenure, having danced
with the group for 35 years. She was Alfred A. Knopf's secretary in
the last years of his life and still works part time as the
librarian for Random House. She walks with a cane. But when the
music starts, the cane is on the sidelines, and she's in step and
in the swing.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' ages also vary, from the 20s to the 80s.
</P>
<P>
   (Some of the women and teachers will no sooner divulge their age
than have a woman lead.)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vance, one of the youngest teachers, said that dancing
was ``ageless.'' One of the most senior, Johnnie Rossi, 76, a World
War II veteran, has had two replacements in one knee.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked one of the women to identify the music being
played, she said, ``You can always tell by looking at Johnnie's
hips.'' He moves with remarkable grace and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   For the teachers, all independent instructors, the parties offer
an opportunity to attract new clients, although they're not allowed
to solicit. Some give private lessons before and after the session,
which runs from 8 to 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing random about these evenings. The women at the
two tables on the left dance while those on the right sit out, and
then they switch. Always wearing jackets and ties, the teachers
come to collect their partners in the 10 seconds between songs _
taking their arm to lead them to the dance floor. They follow a
precise order of rotation, so that by the end of the evening, every
woman will have danced several times with every teacher, doing
different dances with each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's my next gentleman caller?,'' Bel Kaufman joked, rising
to wait for her partner. Kaufman, the 89-year old author of ``Up
the Down Staircase,'' especially loves dramatic dances like the
tango and pasa doble, and dances with flourish. ``It can be
intimidating the first time,'' she said. ``We all look like we're
wonderful dancers. We're not. We dance with wonderful dancers. But
we're improving.'' She looks wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   People who happen upon the social hall and peek in are often
puzzled. Something about the dancers' mixed ages and appearances
suggest that these aren't married couples. Yet they waltz and
cha-cha with the familiarity of people who've known each other for
years, sometimes laughing and chatting, sometimes looking at each
other in a locked, silent gaze as they glide together with seeming
ease. It looks like a tea dance, reborn.
</P>
<P>
   On the polished dance floor of Roseland 2000, Stan's group
danced amid the New Jersey crowd, all their gestures reflected in
the mirrored wall. From 9 to 11 p.m. they follow their usual
rotating format. Without a doubt, Stan is the best dancer in the
room, and he makes whoever he is dancing with look splendid too. He
and his wife, Judie, had been a professional adagio team _ a dance
form where the man lifts the woman up high _ and performed
internationally but retired 10 years ago after an injury. With the
women in this group, he lifts only their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of a Saturday session, Ceil is doing a variation
on the merengue with a bit of hustle, and her partner, George,
drops to his knees and dances around her. Not missing a beat, she
continues her steps, raising her arms and waving them to the music.
It is a tour de force; they are applauded as they conclude in an
embrace. ``Sometimes I like to show off,'' she admits later.
</P>
<P>
   One evening when there was a no-show and the teachers had a gap
on their dance cards, I was invited to dance. I demurred, saying I
didn't have the right shoes, but I was gently prodded to give it a
whirl. I did a tango with Peter, a mambo with Stan and then moved
through some stylish fox-trot quick and slow combinations with
Robert. Hey, I could do this. I was floating. But I was brought
down to earth when a regular guy asked me to dance at Roseland 2000
and our arms pretzeled instead of looping when we turned. So part
of the charm of this brigade of princes is that they lead
powerfully but don't make you feel as if they're propelling you
into place although, clearly, at times they are.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   About leading, Peter, who is 6 foot 3 and athletic-looking, and
the most professorial of the bunch, said, it was an ``imperceptible
art, like a magician's sleight of hand.'' He explained that he
``shifts gears'' for each partner. For some of the women, who are
totally in charge in their professional lives or have lived on
their own for so long that they're accustomed to making the rules,
learning to follow rather than lead is an acquired skill. ``To
suddenly think of myself as submissive is one of the hardest
things,'' a magazine publisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of the reasons so many participants view ballroom
dance as healing is because of its quality of touch. It's one of
the few activities in which physical contact is permitted among
people who don't know each other well. But it's a touch that can be
tender and communicative without being intimate, even as the
partners hold each other and move as one. That distance provides a
layer of comfort and dignity that enable the women to lose
themselves in the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Ballroom dance is the rare fantasy that's easily lived out: with
stirring music and a talented partner, it's not much of a leap to
imagine being elsewhere, in another time, or being in love. To
watch these women dance is to feel the romance, the possibility,
the transformation and the fun of it all. ``When I arrive and
descend those steps, I hold onto the banister, aware of my age,''
Kaufman said. ``When I leave, I run up the stairs. I'm 18 again, no
matter how tired. I'm exhilarated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the evening's final song ends, the women complain about the
time going by too quickly. Most could have danced all night.

CLINTON OFF TO AFRICA TO BOLSTER TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Clinton-Nigeria)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after his historic first trip to Africa,
President Clinton leaves Friday for the continent on a new
high-stakes mission that he can only hope will leave a more
enduring legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stops first in Nigeria, whose oil riches and influence
on other African nations make it arguably one of the most
strategically important nations in the world. There, he will
publicly praise the country's quick turnabout from dictatorship to
democracy and privately press for stability in petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
   And then he travels for a day to Tanzania to recognize the
handiwork of one of the most influential people in his life, Nelson
Mandela, who has been presiding over a shaky peace deal among 19
parties in neighboring Burundi. Mandela hopes for a signing of the
work-in-progress treaty on Monday, but onlookers fear any deal
could easily unravel, sparking a genocidal fury.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential attention comes at a pivotal time for
sub-Saharan Africa, much of which was afflicted at the end of the
century by war, debt, disease and _ in the words of Harvard
University's Robert I. Rotberg _ ``venal leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, there is great joy that a US president is coming. But
leaders harbor only modest expectations that Clinton's three-day
swing heralds significant relief for the continent's financial
burdens, either by forgiving billions of dollars owed to foreign
creditors or in the form of major assistance in coping with the
HIV/AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   US critics of the administration's Africa policy doubt any
dramatic changes loom in the last four months of Clinton's tenure,
and instead expect much of his focus to be on a US domestic
concern: keeping down the price of oil. Nigeria, Africa's largest
oil producer, is a member of the OPEC oil cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get down to the brass tacks, what's still driving
American policy toward Nigeria is oil and stability defined by
oil,'' said Salih Booker, director of both the Africa Policy
Information Center and Africa Fund. ``The US wants to say it
supports democracy and wants to encourage the democratic process,
but my concern is that it's not really investing in that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Africa's troubles stands the unsteady giant of
Nigeria, the most populous country that up to two years ago was run
by one of the most venal dictators of them all: General Sani
Abacha, said to have transferred $5 billion from the nation's
accounts to his own.
</P>
<P>
   Months after Clinton bypassed Nigeria in his first Africa trip,
Abacha died mysteriously, a transitional military leader took over,
and a multi-party vote in May 1999 elected President Olusegun
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials, who had done little pre-trip promotion,
described Nigeria as an anchor for all of Africa. The State
Department has listed Nigeria as one of four key countries to
closely monitor because democracy is either in transition or under
threat; the others are Indonesia, Colombia, and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a make-or-break transition, not just for Nigeria but
for Africa,'' National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger said. ``If
Nigeria succeeds, this can help lift the whole region to prosperity
and peace. If it fails, it can swamp the whole region in turmoil
and misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton's visit signaled ``our strong support for
the most important democratic transition in Africa since the
collapse of apartheid'' in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton toured Africa in 1998, he pointedly skirted Nigeria
because of Abacha's reign and instead singled out four other
leaders as examples of promise for the future. But to Clinton's
embarrassment, months later all four leaders were engulfed in two
wars, those along the Eritrea-Ethiopia border and the multi-party
conflict inside the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Obansanjo wears the American imprimatur of a promising
African leader, even though Nigeria remains extraordinarily
volatile. Internal troubles include separatist Islamic-led
movements and the brutal repression of environmental protesters in
the oil-rich Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans hope Obansanjo will inspire other democracies
and shoulder the weighty burden of peacekeeping responsibilities in
the region, especially the current United Nations mission in Sierra
Leone. In the last decade, Nigeria has spent $10 billion on
peacekeeping operations, yet it has expressed wariness to do more
because of the huge cost.
</P>
<P>
   The United States this week sent the first of about 200 military
advisers to Nigeria to train five batallions for peacekeeping
operations. But already Nigerian military officials are grumbling
that they are not being provided with new military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continent of Africa is increasingly hanging by a thread,
and what happens in Nigeria is becoming increasingly decisive,''
said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Africa program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and
until last January a senior State Department expert on Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Since the administration ``does not have a lot of success to
point to in its African policies, our approach to Nigeria is one
noteworthy achievement,'' Morrison said, noting that US aid to
Nigeria increased to $108 million this year, from $7 million two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Booker called that ``peanuts. It's less than a dollar per
person, and a lot of that new money will pay for American employees
at the new USAID office in Abuja. What Nigeria and other African
countries want to see is debt cancellation. The US should be
playing a leading role in that, cancelling its debt and leaning on
the Europeans to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Smith, the National Security Council's senior director for
African Affairs, said the US was ``Nigeria's smallest creditor, at
only 4 percent of the total.''
</P>
<P>
   Four percent equals about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip marks the beginning of an intense international
agenda for the White House. After returning to Washington next
Tuesday, he makes a one-day visit Wednesday to Cartagena, Colombia,
to underscore his support for a $1.6 billion anti-drug package.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Labor Day, he will spend at least two days at the
United Nations Millennium Summit in New York, which is expected to
attract more than 100 heads of state. There also is a chance that
Clinton could hold talks there between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to try to build on
this summer's collapsed Camp David negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a sprint to the finish line,'' said NSC spokesman P.J.
Crowley.

DEFENSE LAWYER SEEKS MEDICAL RECORDS OF DEAD HOCKEY DAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FARAH STOCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The lawyer for Thomas Junta, the Reading
father accused of killing a man in a disagreement over a youth
hockey game, Thursday filed a court motion to review the alleged
victim's medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Thomas Orlandi said that he does not know if Michael
Costin had a pre-existing medical condition that might have
contributed to his death after a fight with Junta at a Reading ice
rink in July. But Orlandi said he wants to look over Costin's
records to see if such a condition did exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always look into that when there is an injury of this
magnitude,'' Orlandi said after Junta pleaded not guilty to a
manslaughter indictment in Middlesex Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandi filed a discovery motion with Judge Maria Lopez seeking
the records.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also said he plans to argue that Junta was acting in
self defense. Orlandi said Junta and Costin had confronted each
other in a seperate incident just before the fight and Costin had
kicked Junta in the leg with his ice skate.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez granted Orlandi's request to preserve Costin's ice skates
as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two sides to every story and we have evidence to
defend our side,'' said Orlandi after the brief court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   However, Denise Costin, the alleged victim's cousin, dismissed
the idea that a review of Costin's medical records might benefit
Junta's defense.
</P>
<P>
   She said Costin was ``completely healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pre-existing condition,'' Denise Costin said.
``It was blunt blows to his head that killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Costin also rejected the claim that Junta could have been
acting in self defense against her cousin, who weighed 100 less.
</P>
<P>
   Junta, 42, was indicted two weeks ago for the July 5 death of
Costin, 40, a single father of four from Lynnfield.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors at an earlier hearing said ``unchecked rage'' led
Junta to smash Costin's head against the floor of the locker room
at Burbank Ice Arena in front of a crowd of adolesent boys, leaving
Costin with injuries that cut off the blood flow to his brain.
</P>
<P>
   At Junta's District Court arraignment, a judge ruled last month
that he was not a threat to society, and allowed him to be released
on $5,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Superior Court Judge Maria Lopez denied Junta's request
to reduce the bail. Lopez also ordered Junta to steer clear of the
victim's family or any potential witnesses, and suggested that
Costin's family do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Orlandi said he had been hoping to use the $5,000 bail money to
hire an expert to review Costin's medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a family of means,'' Orlandi said, ``and they
could have used the money for experts.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatal fight began when Junta, a 275-pound truck driver,
quarreled with Costin for allowing too much rough play on the ice
while refereeing an impromptu game involving Junta's 10-year old
son and Costin's three sons, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As their argument erupted into violence, other patrons at the
ice arena separated the two, and Junta left the rink. But after, he
returned and confronted Costin, who tried to punch him. Junta then
threw Costin to the floor and beat him. Outweight by 100 pounds,
Costin fell unconscious. He was hospitalized and pronounced dead
two days later, authorities said..
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Denise Costin reiterated her family's outrage at
Junta's freedom and the fact that he is only facing a manslaughter
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' she said. ``I was actually at the
court room longer than he was in custody.'

DOLPHINS `TALK' BY WHISTLING, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other than humans, there are no land-dwelling mammals that are
capable of learning and imitating sounds they hear _ a crucial part
of the development of language, the most distinctly human of our
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But dolphins share that capacity for imitation. When swimming in
the wild they keep in touch by uttering a ``signature whistle''
repeatedly. And now, new research being reported in the current
journal Science shows that one dolphin may address another _
whether for comradeship or conflict _ by immediately repeating the
other's distinctive whistle. In essence, they may call each other
by name.
</P>
<P>
   Birds can imitate sounds to some extent, but not with the kind
of specific individual signatures that dolphins produce. Dolphins
are remarkably adept at it _ they develop their unique signatures
within the first year of life, using sounds different from those of
dolphins around them, but related to noises in their environment.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of their signature whistles has been known for
about a decade _ first discovered by a team including biologist
Peter Tyack of Woods Hole (Mass.) Oceanographic Institution _ but
the new work is the first to show that these whistles are often
copied by different individuals within a few seconds of the
original.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results show that bottlenose dolphins use their learned
whistles in matching interactions, most likely to address each
other,'' Vincent Janik, a biology student at the University of St.
Andrews in Scotland, wrote in the new paper. Such ``addressing''
whistles might, he suggested, ``be either aggressive or
affiliative,'' or could ``signal alliance membership to third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins in the wild are notoriously difficult to study: The
ocean is a very big place with limited visibility, and dolphins
move very fast. The breakthrough that made the new findings
possible was the use of an array of three underwater microphones
that, coupled with sophisticated computer software developed by a
Belmont, Mass. firm, Engineering Design, made it possible to
pinpoint the place where a given sound originated.
</P>
<P>
   Janik, currently working at the Woods Hole institute, placed the
microphones in a section of the Moray Firth on the Scottish coast
in 1994 and 1995, and recorded dolphin sounds over a period of 7
days as part of his thesis research.
</P>
<P>
   To count as a ``matching'' whistle, the second occurrence had to
happen within 3 seconds of the first, and be separated by a
distance large enough that a single dolphin could not have swum
that far in the interval. This ensured that the sounds really were
being made by two different dolphins, but it also meant that sounds
copied by dolphins swimming close together would not be counted.
Thus, ``it is possible that matching interactions are more common''
than the results indicated, Janik wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery, Tyack wrote in an accompanying commentary, is
``important for anyone interested in comparative studies of the
evolution of vocal learning and labeling in animals.''
</P>
<P>
   From research with captive dolphins, researchers had already
found that they seldom use their signature whistles when they are
all close together. But as soon as one dolphin is separated from
the others, all of them immediately begin emitting their
signatures, suggesting that this is a way of keeping track of each
other and keeping the group together.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have also demonstrated that dolphins in captivity
will very quickly learn to associate a newly learned whistle with a
specific object _ a key part of the development of language. But
the new research, Tyack wrote, now extends that finding to show
that ``vocal labeling'' is also used by dolphins in their natural
habitat, as part of the process of social interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Slater, a professor of natural history at St. Andrews and
supervisor of Janik's research, called the use of the technology
for pinpointing the location of sounds ``a great innovation. . . .
If you hear two identical sounds in a row, you might think it was
the same dolphin. But if they occur a few seconds apart and you can
tell that they are hundreds of feet apart, they must be different
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this method _ using microphones anchored to the
bottom _ avoids any disturbance of the dolphins' natural behavior,
which might occur with the use of boats or divers to observe their
behavior. In this research, the recordings were made from shore,
while a second researcher at a higher elevation was watching with
binoculars to monitor the number of dolphins and their movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you disturb them, they may behave in a different way,''
said Slater, a specialist in animal sounds. ``It's important to
extend our research out into the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, he said, the research on dolphin vocalizations is
``only scratching the surface of something that's probably very
complex.'' Dolphins are ``capable of all sorts of tasks, and they
presumably got all this intelligence for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And by studying them, humans may learn something about our own
origins, Tyack suggests. ``There is a growing appreciation. . . of
the fascinating similarities in the ways that birds and mammals use
vocal imitation to interact with specific individuals,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``These similarities may provide an important comparative
perspective on how capabilities for imitation evolved in our
hominid ancestors.''

   BIALA RAWSKA, Poland _ In the past 10 years, Urszula Malinowska
and her husband have transformed their lives, turning a tiny farm
and orchard into a wood-processing factory that employs 35 people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after failed farming ventures, they bought a used
American machine to cut timber, a Wood-Mizer, and built their
business of making timber into lumber for the construction boom
that has transformed this area near Mszczonow, some 35 miles
southwest of Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they have $500,000 a year in revenue, produce their own
power and heat from the waste wood and sawdust and are planning a
more modern plant to work on more expensive woods for higher-profit
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Ursula Malinowska, at 48, could be a billboard for the new
market economy that has taken hold in Poland, the largest and most
successful country in central Europe in this transformation. She is
the active boss of one of 2 million small and medium-sized private
enterprises in a country of 42 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But like many Poles, she is not especially happy with the way
things are, and she is likely to vote for the reformed communists
of the Democratic Left Alliance in the parliamentary elections
expected next spring, dumping the more conservative Solidarity
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   To Malinowska, the changes have come with mixed blessings. ``The
great satisfaction is that we've built something new, and without
permission from anyone,'' she said, as her workers took large pine
logs and began to turn them into lumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``As owners, there is a great feeling of responsibility, and we
work from 6 to 6,'' she added. ``But there is a sense of achieving
one's goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, `` There are lots of problems.'' Small
businesses do not get much help from the state; the tax laws are
complicated and contradictory; there is an effective state monopoly
on the supply of lumber, given the difficulties of trade with
Russia, Ukraine and Belarus; and with Poland still outside the
European Union and membership probably four years away, she feels
that ``our Western partners take advantage of our weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The sourness is widely felt by Poles, whose rapid progress is
nonetheless falling behind their own expectations. While young
people are full of confidence, many Poles still have a deep fear of
being marginalized, of falling behind, both as individuals and as a
nation striving to join the rest of Europe as an equal, said Jacek
Kucharczyk, deputy director of the Institute of Public Affairs, an
independent Polish research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poland is a country doing better than it feels _ it's doing
better than it thinks it's doing,'' Kucharczyk said. Surveys show
that more than 50 percent of Poles think theirs is a better country
than it was 10 years ago, and only 30 percent disagree, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But change is still frightening to those who are over 40. And
the current Solidarity government's biggest undertakings _ to
decentralize and streamline health care, education, pensions and
provincial administration _ have caused enormous anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   With more to lose, there is also a growing concern about
personal safety and crime, and a feeling that the police are not
keeping up with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even the prospect of joining the European Union has raised
considerable fear _ not just among the many farmers who fear
European competition, but also among those who worry that Poland
will give up some of its precious identity, after centuries of
struggle to shape and preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   What is the Polish nightmare? ``To be the Mexico of Germany:
proud, important, too big to fail but deeply unbalanced next to a
neighbor that is too rich and too big,'' one European ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
   Poles are more pessimistic these days, said Halina Binczak,
economics editor of the respected daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
In polls, only about 8 percent of Poles think the reforms are going
well. Five years ago, she said, 60 percent of households had
trouble making ends meet. Today, it's some 40 percent. ``Yet five
years ago, people were more optimistic than now,'' she said. ``Our
aspirations are rising faster than our possibilities. People are
less satisfied with what tey have, even though they have more.''

   Yet the signs of new prosperity are everywhere in Poland. In
Mszczonow, a small town of some 6,000, there are scores of new
shops _ bakeries, groceries, hardware stores, hairdressers _ that
did not exist 10 years ago. The town has streetlights now, put up
four years ago. Farmers are growing a special kind of apple that
feeds good, tart concentrate into blended juices. There is one
large industrial park, Europark, already in operation, with another
soon to open.
</P>
<P>
   On this main route near Warsaw, there are hundreds of trucks
from all over Europe and the former Soviet Union. Servicing them
are large gas stations, looking like modern palaces, with cafes and
small grocery stores attached, and numerous prostitutes line up at
intervals along the roadway, near thickets of trees.
</P>
<P>
   The roads are crammed with new cars. Poles have bought more than
500,000 new cars each year for the last four years, reflecting the
prosperity and an explosion in consumer credit, but posing dangers
for more inflation, already at 11.6 percent in July, a two-year
high.
</P>
<P>
   And they use their cars to shop at huge supermarket complexes in
the suburbs, where Ikea rubs up against Carrefour and Geant and KFC
and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But for all this wealth, the infrastructure lags far behind.
Warsaw traffic is bad, and there is barely a subway system, with
only one short route. The telephone system, reluctantly changing
from a state monopoly, is inefficient, compared with the Czech
Republic's or even Romania's, and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   There are few highways, and the two-lane roads _ effectively
three-lane, with expensive cars zooming around buses, trucks and
the little old Polski Fiats that can't go much over 60 miles an
hour _ are often seamed and channeled, with heavy traffic punishing
roadbeds built for less booming times.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Road fatalities are consequently a major issue, with large green
and black signs displaying the number of dead and injured at
particularly bad spots. A billboard campaign shows wrecked cars
with large, one-word slogans: ``Autoagresja'' and
``Autodestrukcja.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Like its roads, Poland's politics are messy and crowded, still
driven by the ideologies of the battle, 20 years ago, against
communism: Reformed communists versus the Solidarity coalition,
which itself is a very broad group of some 30 parties. Although its
roots are in a trade union, Solidarity is center-right in politics.
Some of the best-known intellectuals associated with Solidarity,
like the historian and former Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
formed the Freedom Union, further to the right. And then there are
farmers' parties and some Roman Catholic parties that veer toward
ultranationalism, exemplified by Radio Marya, a radio station
supported by a vocal minority of Poland's priests.
</P>
<P>
   But as everywhere in the former Soviet-bloc countries, patronage
and corruption still play too large a role in politics, with
parties and ministers often getting kickbacks from businesses and
lobbyists for contracts or favors.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government itself asked the World Bank to look into
corruption last year, and was told that the main problem is graft
among legislators, ministers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, everyone agrees, Poland's biggest problem is the
deficit in the current trade account _ with imports, fed by new
prosperity and credit, growing more rapidly than exports. The gap
is now almost 8 percent of gross domestic product, said Binczak of
Rzeczpospolita. The government has to do more, she said, to support
exporters with credits and tax breaks or risk a currency crisis and
a reduction in foreign capital flows that finance the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Polish exports have increased at least four times in
the past decade, with more than 70 percent of exports going to
countries of the European Union and only 10 percent now going to
Russia, said Witold M. Orlowski of the Independent Center for
Economic Studies. The economy has grown an average of about 5
percent a year over the past several years, and the government
estimates $12 billion this year in foreign direct investment, after
last year's record $8 billion _ a serious vote of confidence by
hardheaded foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and analysts are concerned that the minority
Solidarity government, facing likely elections in the spring over
the 2001 budget, will increase the budget deficit too much with
populist spending, to try to fight slowly rising unemployment,
estimated at 13.5 percent this year. But Binczak and others believe
that the fundamentals of economic policy are set, in part by the
markets and the pressure to join the European Union, and that the
politicians will not want to disrupt them too badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming sense is that the Poles are going in the
right direction,'' a Western ambassador said. ``This is no longer a
grimy little East European country trying to keep its head above
water, but a country taking its place in Europe.''

   Agriculture remains the biggest structural challenge to a
modernizing Poland _ and to its entry into the European Union. Some
25 percent of Poland's work force lives in the poorer countryside,
many of them on small farms. But of the country's 2.1 million
farms, only half sell significant amounts to the market. The other
half are subsistence farmers whom no one wants to suddenly move
into the cities. The European Union will help, but wants to contain
the size of the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, protected by socialism, are the ones most concerned by
the new Poland, which they see as a land of high taxes, falling
farm prices and rising prices for fertilizer, fuel, seeds and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In Skorzec, a tiny village about four miles south of
Ciechanowiec, two farmers, Czeslaw Bojar, 59, and his neighbor,
Kazimierz Murowski, 64, stopped work to chat and complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bought my first tractor, under communism, it cost 27
pigs,'' Murowski said. ``Today, it costs 100 pigs.'' He stopped to
scratch. ``It's not that we liked communism, but life was better
for us then.''
</P>
<P>
   Bojar has six sons and worries that his farm, roughly 25 acres,
will not be big enough for all of them and that some will find
themselves in the cities, unemployed. As for the European Union, he
said: ``I can't know the future, and people disagree. But when we
join the E.U., it will be like a bulldozer and break down all the
walls, and then who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Murowski said everything was comparative. ``I remember how it
was after the war, with everything destroyed and nothing to eat,''
he said. ``Well, it's better to be poor in peace than rich in
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the farmers have cars, heat, telephones and television, a
big change from 15 years ago, they admit, and their neighbors, with
a new roof and siding on their house, are off working in Belgium,
earning good money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were a communist country, they said we'll be in heaven
one day, and now they say it'll be even nicer that we're not
communists anymore,'' Bojar said. ``And we, we still hope it will
be better than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Karol Szyndzielorz, a former journalist turned businessman, put
it simply. ``Poles cannot believe it, but it's true,'' he said.
``Poland is now a lucky country.''

READ MY LIPS: THREE-SECOND SMOOCH MELTS GORE'S OLD IMAGE 
BY CLIFFORD PUGH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you wanna know if he loves you so,
</P>
<P>
   It's in his kiss.
</P>
<P>
   _ from the ``Shoop Shoop Song'' &QR;
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore is elected president, pundits may be able to trace
where his fortunes first turned.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   On center stage at the Democratic National Convention, before
the most important speech in his political career, Gore laid a big
one on his startled wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   In that one instant, he surprised a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Political pundits, etiquette experts and regular folks have been
buzzing about it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a quick peck on the cheek, Gore took his wife in his
arms and gave her a passionate lip lock that lasted a full three
seconds _ an eternity in political kissdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kiss,'' which some political experts believe did more than
anything to shed Gore's robotic image, had some etiquette experts
squirming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was a high moment in their lives, but it just went a
little teeny bit over the line,'' Houston etiquette expert Annie
Cater said. ``My thought was what does he do when they're alone?''
</P>
<P>
   Letitia  &UR;  &LR; Baldrige, who served as first lady Jacqueline
Kennedy's social secretary and remains one of the nation's leading
etiquette experts, was put off by ``the kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a political gesture to show the world that this
marriage is not in trouble,'' Baldridge said. ``A normal couple
wouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garth Jowett, director of the School of Communication at the
University of Houston, believes such criticisms are silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a New York ball. This is politics where you let it
all hang out,'' he said. ``How many times have politicians gone
around kissing babies? They may as well go around kissing their
wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews indicate that much of the general public liked
seeing the Gores show such unabashed affection toward each other
after 30 years of marriage. His standing in the polls has shot up,
particularly among women.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh was so perplexed
by the turnaround that he invited women who had changed their minds
about Gore to phone in this week. A large majority of callers
thought the kiss was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of those little defining moments that can make or
break a campaign over time,'' said Jowett, who teaches classes on
pop culture. ``If Gore goes on to victory, the kiss will be
enshrined as part of political popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics maintain the kiss was a staged event. But in
interviews on all three network morning talk shows, Gore insisted
it had been ``completely spontaneous'' and was not part of an
attempt to reshape his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said, `Are you trying to send a message?' I said,
`Actually, I was trying to send a message to Tipper,' '' he told
the CBS ``Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Houston first lady Elyse Lanier, who showed a remarkable
amount of public affection toward her husband, Bob Lanier, when he
was mayor, believes the Gores simply were showing their human side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny thing. People lose sight of the fact that
politicians are human. You don't get the other side of them so
often. We really have another side. We kiss each other. We kiss our
children. We hold hands. And if we don't like each other, we don't
get near each other,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier believes the public is smart enough to see through an
insincere display of affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything shows through on the camera, much more so than even
in person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston political consultant who asked not to be identified
because he advises candidates across the spectrum likened the
Gores' public smooch to a kiss at a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a wedding, it's public, but it's still sincere,''
he said. ``Unless you're an actor, it's hard to fake that kind of
thing. Anyone who sees them together knows they are real.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Crigler, professor of political science at the University of
Southern California, believes Gore's public display of affection
struck such a chord because it didn't seem to fit his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kisses their wife. It wasn't so hugely passionate
that it would have been surprising for some other people, but
because of Gore's reputation, it was surprising,'' she said. ``It
was new and different and told us about a side of him that we
hadn't quite realized. And it was reinforced both by his wife's
introduction and his speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Such nonverbal communication can be very effective in presenting
a message, said Crigler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan knew that. He would always have great visuals in
his media message, and the story would get out in a very positive
way. This is the same kind of thing. It's communicating a lot more
than words can communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that the Gore kiss illustrates that passion is
more in fashion nowadays. Etiquette expert Cater links increased
public displays of affection with the trend toward dressing more
casually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more casual it gets, the more casual you get,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a generational thing, she believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men of a certain age _ 50, 60, 70 _ were brought up with a
different feeling about women and passion. The times they lived in
were a little bit more restrained. For younger people, it's not as
big of a deal. You see them necking at a ball game, for gosh sake.
And they probably don't even call it necking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Politically speaking, Jowett jokingly suggests all the fuss over
the Gore kiss could open up a new way of politicking. Instead of
debates, ``politically we may end up with the `kiss-off' and see
who can kiss their wife (the best and longest),'' he said. ``That's
a good way to do it.''

   EUROPE-TELECOMN-LI (Hong Kong) _ Li Ka-shing, the tycoon known
here as Superman, earned his nickname among investors by amassing
more wealth and influence than any other local businessman here
ever had. His flagship conglomerate, Hutchison Whampoa, reinforced
that reputation on Thursday when it reported earnings of $4 billion
in the first half of 2000. Most of Hutchison's profit, however,
came from a special one-time gain after the sale of its European
mobile phone operations. And the company's encore, an ambitious
plan to offer next-generation cellular services throughout Europe,
is in doubt. Last week, Hutchison unexpectedly gave up a coveted
license to offer advanced mobile services in Germany, saying it was
too costly. Thursday, even as Li and his lieutenants basked in the
glow of rich earnings, they had to explain why the German setback
had not scrambled their plans. By Mark Landler.

Great moments in kissing history 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
All-time great lip-smacking moments:
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Rice groomed his moustache and then lip-locked May Erwin
in a short silent film titled ``The Kiss.'' This first on-screen
kiss, filmed in 1896, shocked the public.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster kissed on the beach like there
was no tomorrow in the 1953 movie ``From Here to Eternity,'' a
scene that still sets the sizzling standard for a scintillating
screen kiss.
</P>
<P>
   An uptown cocker spaniel found true love over a bowl of
spaghetti with a streetwise downtown mutt in the 1955 Disney
classic ``Lady and the Tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedy series ``Will and Grace'' delivered network prime
time's first smooch between two gay male characters this year. Jack
and Will smooched on the street in front of ``Today'' show
weatherman Al Roker to protest the fact NBC wouldn't air a gay kiss
on a fictional series.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II kisses the ground in every country he visits,
but his first visit as pope to his home country of Poland in 1979
evoked the most poignant memories.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years in the hit television series ``X-Files,''
Scully and Mulder finally shared a kiss as themselves in a 1999
episode set on New Year's Eve. They had kissed a couple of times
earlier in the guise of other characters. They also came close in
the ``X-Files'' movie before Scully got stung by a virus-carrying
bee.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most famous photograph involving a kiss is Alfred
Eisenstaedt's picture of an unidentified sailor and nurse
celebrating the end of World War II in New York City's Times
Square. Many men have claimed to be the sailor.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas A&AMP;M football games, every time a touchdown is scored,
an Aggie and his or her date get to share a kiss. It's one of the
university's most zealously guarded traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) marked his brother for death with a
kiss in ``Godfather II.''
</P>
<P>
   Television's first interracial kiss between Capt. Kirk and Lt.
Uhura in a 1968 episode of ``Star Trek'' caused a furor. Thirty-two
years later, interracial kissing is such a non-factor that Ally
McBeal and her African-American doctor boyfriend never even mention
their different races.

RUSSIA'S ANGUISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beyond the human loss Russia has suffered with the sinking of
its nuclear submarine stands the injury to national pride. Russia's
submarine fleet, which once numbered 180 craft, is a shadow of its
former self in the wake of the fiscal shambles that followed the
breakup of the Soviet Union. The rest of the world, both out of
sympathy for the 118 lost lives and wish for Russian stability, may
have a positive role to play in the aftermath of the tragedy if it
is done delicately.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military leaders and President Vladimir Putin have been
blamed both at home and abroad for failing to ask quickly for
assistance from other countries in attempting to rescue the crewmen
trapped on the submarine Kursk 400 feet deep in the Barents Sea.
Military leaders in any country give high priority to security, and
the Kursk was one of the newest of Russia's submarines. Russian
officials may not have relished the idea of Western experts pawing
over it. Conversely, the Russians may have been reluctant to invite
outsiders to see the low estate to which their prized possessions
have fallen because of inadequate funding for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   They may have genuinely believed that they would be able to
reach the submarine with their own equipment in time to save some
lives, although the subsequent discovery of the damage from an
apparent explosion suggests that any crew members who survived the
initial catastrophe died before British or Norwegian rescue teams
could have arrived under the best of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   That the Russians did ultimately accept British and Norwegian
assistance stands to their credit. Their hope to recover bodies
from the submarine, and perhaps the submarine itself, evidently
depends on additional foreign assistance. This would particularly
involve Norwegians, who have had extensive experience in waters of
comparable depths. The process would be slow at best because
Norwegians are worried about the condition of the hull and interior
of the vessel. They might even decline the challenge, given the
risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   This increases the likelihood that there will be efforts to
recover the Kursk by raising it from the ocean bottom and moving it
either to a Russian port or to shallower waters, where it might be
easier for divers to work. It would be a herculean task, but one
for which Americans may be equipped.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, a great deal of coordination will be required,
and it is essential that the mission be conducted in a spirit of
mutual interest. Russia's difficulties are serious, but the loyalty
and persistence of so many individuals in the face of those
difficulties have to be admired. In the long run, the interests of
Russians, Americans, and many others will be served best by
increased cooperation rather than intense competition, and
cooperation can be based only on a willing spirit among all
parties.

`ORFEU': REBORN IN AN UNROMANTIC RIO, ORPHEUS FLAVORS HIS SAMBA
WITH RAP
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Diegues' ``Orfeu'' is based on the play by the Brazilian
writer Vinicius de Moraes that also inspired Marcel Camus' 1959
film, ``Black Orpheus.'' Diegues is one of his country's leading
directors. (His earlier films include ``Xica,'' ``Bye-Bye Brazil''
and ``Subway to the Stars.'') He has not so much remade ``Black
Orpheus'' as tried to correct it and to bring the mythic resonances
of the original play into line with the complicated realities of
contemporary Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The basic story _ a retelling of the legend of the bard Orpheus
and his tragic love for the nymph Eurydice, played out against the
jubilant frenzy of Rio's carnival _ is the same, as is the milieu,
the serpentine slums, called favelas, that cling to the city's
hills. (The Carioca Hill shantytown in ``Orfeu'' is a set,
painstakingly decked out with graffiti and tattered bits of
decoration). In Camus' movie, the favelas were a place of exuberant
primitivism, a realm of pure folklore, whose characteristic musical
expression, the samba, was the spontaneous expression of joy in the
face of deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   Diegues' Rio, in contrast, is, for all its vivid local color,
the hub of a heterogeneous and sophisticated popular culture. Its
misery consists not of picturesque squalor but of gun battles
between vicious drug gangs and corrupt, murderous police officers.
His heroes and villains live in a recognizably modern world. Orfeu,
played by the Brazilian pop star Toni Garrido, is a serious
musician, composing his sambas with the aid of a laptop and
orchestrating his carnival performance with the discipline and
self-assurance of a show business professional.
</P>
<P>
   A similar cosmopolitanism informs the movie itself, which turns
Camus' romantic ethnology inside out, presenting a nation proudly
aware of its cultural achievements and thus able to welcome and
assimilate outside influences. Just as Orfeu leavens his sambas
with hip-hop and funk _ nobody is scandalized except an obtuse
policeman named Stallone _ ``Orfeu'' filters de Moraes' literary
conceit through the lens of American urban cinema. An unseen radio
disc jockey, the self-proclaimed ``Voice of the Hill,'' is the
film's conscience and Greek chorus, a device that recalls Walter
Hill's ``Warriors'' (also based on a classical source) and Spike
Lee's ``Do the Right Thing.'' In making the figure of Death a drug
dealer who was Orfeu's childhood friend, Diegues manages both to
augment his film's naturalism and to place ``Orfeu'' in a tradition
that extends from the rap-fueled ghetto melodramas of recent years
back through ``Mean Streets'' and, ultimately, the classic gangster
movies of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Such eclecticism is both the movie's most interesting feature
and the source of its shortcomings. ``Orfeu'' tries to do too much
at once: to be both mythic and realistic, to celebrate Rio's rich
culture while exposing the brutality and cynicism that dominate
daily life in its slums. In part because of its simplistic,
sentimental depiction of favela life, ``Black Orpheus'' was a
simpler, more coherent film than this one, which struggles to
balance disparate styles and clashing emotional registers.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is especially uneven. Garrido, gorgeous and
effortlessly charismatic, is convincing when called upon to be
feckless and charming, but he strains when the burden of tragic
emotion is dropped onto his shoulders. The thick-necked and
glowering Murilo Benicio, as Lucinho, the drug lord who rules
Carioca Hill, tries to convey the anguish simmering underneath his
character's thuggery but ends up with doing a faltering impression
of Harvey Keitel. Except for the sloe-eyed Patricia Franca, whose
Euridice is in any case a half-dreamed emanation of Orfeu's desire,
the women _ Isabel Fillardis as Orfeu's jilted lover, Mira, and
Maria Ceica as Euridice's embittered aunt, Carmen _ emote
awkwardly, caught between the psychological expressivity of
melodrama and the more stylized keenings of Greek tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Only Milton Goncalves, as Orfeu's father, Inacio, who has given
up music for religion, and Zeze Motta, as his hotheaded wife,
Conceicao, succeed in making their characters real people as well
as archetypes. But if the other actors flail a bit, the movie
itself manages to keep its contradictory energies from exploding
all over the place. This is partly because Caetano Veloso's score,
which includes some songs written for the original play, supplies
the missing emotional nuances. The best Brazilian music _
represented by both the carnival sambas and the delicate bossa nova
ballads on the soundtrack _ somehow fuses pure sentiment with
intellectual clarity, a fusion the film aspires to but never quite
achieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orfeu'' was photographed by Affonso Beato, whose sense of
color so enriched Pedro Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' and
it's similarly beautiful to look at without being overly showy.
Somehow Rio, like Paris or New York, is one of those cities that
looks great on film no matter how many times you've seen it before,
and its silvery tropical light, especially when Orfeu calls up the
sunrise with his guitar, has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the music, the city and the ardor of Diegues'
commitment to his story, with all its contradictions and
confusions, lift ``Orfeu'' above its flaws. It may succeed neither
in plumbing the depths of the contemporary Brazilian life nor in
rising to heights of allegory, but it finds a sprawling, vivid
middle ground somewhere between documentary and myth _ a place that
might be the true Rio de Janeiro after all.

   Face to Face on Rushmore
</P>
<P>
   In the late '50s, MGM assigned Alfred Hitchcock and the
screenwriter Ernest Lehman to make ``The Wreck of the Mary Deare,''
a project of zero interest to either of them. Hitchcock had no
fully developed alternative to suggest, but he told Lehman that he
wanted to make something that had a chase across the presidential
faces on Mount Rushmore. He also envisioned a scene at the United
Nations in which the speaker on the podium would declare, ``I
refuse to continue until the delegate from Peru wakes up.'' The
delegate, of course, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   By December 1958 Hitchcock and Lehman had incorporated these
situations into ``North by Northwest,'' to be issued on Tuesday by
Warner in a new edition on videocassette and DVD. With DVDs of new
films ever more loaded with features generated by current directors
and production companies, it is interesting to see how well a
famous old film can be represented when many of the major players
aren't around to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock died in 1980 and Cary Grant, the film's primary star
in the role of Roger Thornhill, in 1986. But a new documentary,
available on the tape as well as on the disc, warmly and gracefully
recreates an experience from more than 40 years ago. Eva Marie
Saint, Grant's co-star, introduces the film. Martin Landau, a heavy
in ``North by Northwest,'' gives his Hitchcock imitation, but the
major recollections are provided by Lehman, the screenwriter, who
also contributes an audio commentary on the disc.
</P>
<P>
   As is usual on better discs, the pleasure is in the details.
Grant charged 15 cents for autographs. Jessie Royce Landis, who
plays Thornhill's mother, was younger than Grant. Ever the
eccentric, Hitchcock, or so it is said in the documentary, never
called actors cattle; he only said they should be treated like
cattle. In any case he is remembered as a likable tyrant,
respectfully obliging to cast and crew.
</P>
<P>
   As Eve Kendall, Saint, now 76, received three instructions:
lower your voice, keep your hands still and always gaze into
Grant's eyes. ``With Hitchcock you got the sense you were the only
one who could do it because you were there and he thought you
could,'' she said in an interview. She added that she wasn't sure
what he saw in her that landed her the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes always followed beautiful women,'' Patricia
Hitchcock, his daughter, says in the documentary. He liked white
gloves and beige clothes. Saint wore both to an introductory lunch
where everything but the script was discussed. That bothered her,
she said, because Eve Kendall didn't appear until page 58.
</P>
<P>
   In his commentary, Lehman lauds Hitchcock's way with lighting
and his genius with little touches, but he is more than a little
put out that everybody lionizes Hitchcock but never him, the
screenwriter. Saint agreed. ``What do they think _ Hitch made it
up?'' she said in the interview. But one never doubts their
feelings for the director. ``Funny and dear,'' Saint said. ``A
class act.''

   &UR; NEW RELEASES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Princess Mononoke
</P>
<P>
   Forces of man and nature battle in Hayao Miyazaki's sumptuously
animated and exotically beautiful action film, set during the
Muromacho period in Japan (A.D. 1392-1573). Sent into the forest to
find the demonic forces that have contaminated him, young Ashataki
finds himself caught in a running battle between a ruthless
iron-mining baroness, Princess Eboshi, and woodlands creatures led
by Princess Mononoke, herself part human and part wolf. Permeating
all, the spirit of the forest appears as an elk by day and a
diaphanous divinity by night. While gods and demons struggle, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, a moral universe is created in
a ``sweeping, ambitious version of the comic-book storytelling that
engendered it.'' _ 1999. Miramax. $103. 135 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13. Release date: Aug 29. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I Dreamed of Africa
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for the grandeur of ``Out of Africa,'' Hugh Hudson's
film never rises above an epic travelogue. Packing up her young
son, Kuki (Kim Basinger) goes to live in Kenya with her new
husband, a bounder named Paolo (Vincent Perez). Cue the lions and
elephants for predictable crises. Trying to take flight with poetic
profundities, Basinger manages only lifeless recitations as she and
Perez remain seriously miscast as ``adventure-seeking dilettantes
who have wandered far beyond their depth to indulge in an expensive
lifestyle experiment'' (Stephen Holden). _ 2000. Columbia Tri-Star.
$105.77; DVD, $29.95. 114 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release
date: Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Simpatico
</P>
<P>
   Trying to sketch in information that Sam Shepard's play omits,
Matthew Warchus' offbeat, gawky adaptation thrives with gripping
performances and a screenplay that skillfully imitates the
playwright's language. Horse racing is the metaphor for the
adrenaline-pumped American dream as a corrupt breeder (Jeff
Bridges) and his wife (Sharon Stone) tangle with a hard-drinking
eccentric (Nick Nolte) who threatens to expose some slippery
dealings over a high-priced steed. At least the film has integrity.
``Far from being a typical Hollywood desecration of a difficult
play, it stays true to the work's quirky, renegade spirit''
(Holden). _ 1999. New Line. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 106 minutes.
Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Kahuna
</P>
<P>
   Staking out a hotel room in Kansas, three salesmen scheme to
unload a lot of product. Phil (Danny DeVito) is the showy type, but
Larry (Kevin Spacey) is the big kahuna, dominating Phil and Bob
(Peter Facinelli), a fresh-faced young Baptist. Based on Roger
Rueff's play ``Hospitality Suite,'' John Swanbeck's film airs
tired, secondhand truths in an exercise ``so transparent you could
wrap sandwiches with it'' (Elvis Mitchell). _ 2000. Universal.
$107.37; DVD, $26.98. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release
date: Aug. 29.

   &UR; Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater
release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier
editions.  &LR;  LONGITUDE. Adapted from Dava Sobel's international best
seller, Charles Sturridge's film tells the parallel stories of John
Harrison (Michael Gambon), the 18th-century carpenter, clockmaker
and musician whose nautical timepieces attempted to solve the
complexities of longitude at sea, and Rupert Gould (Jeremy Irons),
the World War I Royal Air Force veteran who rescued Harrison's work
from oblivion. With plenty of political intrigue stirred in, Julie
Salamon wrote in The New York Times, ``the film surprises, much as
the book did, by taking what might seem a worthy but dull subject
and making it sparkle.'' 2000. A&AMP;E. $59.95, four cassettes; DVD,

BUSH, GORE PUSH PLANS TO MAKE HIGHER EDUCATION MORE AFFORDABLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both major party presidential candidates went back to college
Thursday to push education proposals that would help make a higher
education more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate George W. Bush announced in New Orleans he will
seek $600 million over five years in new funding for colleges and
universities serving large numbers of blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also vowed to seek congressional approval for
a $1 billion plan _ also spread over five years _ to provide $1,000
bonuses for the low-income recipients of Pell grants. The funds
would be extended to college students who, while still in high
school, passed Advanced Placement math and science examinations or
passed college-level math and science courses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore
campaigning in Maryland, said his proposal for a college tuition
tax credit would save most families about $2,800 a year and assure
that college would not ``be limited to families of wealth and
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initiatives, unveiled at predominantly black Dillard
University, are aimed at helping the nation's 104 historically
black colleges and the 195 universities that serve large numbers of
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in raising standards, raising the bar and focusing
resources the right way,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan he outlined would provide an extra $437 million over
five years in Title III aid for what the government calls
``historically black colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hispanic-serving colleges that get Title V funds, total aid
would increase $166 million over five years. These colleges have
student bodies that are at least 25-percent Hispanic _ and at least
half of them are low-income students who qualify for Pell grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have large endowments. We can't charge students who
come to us the tuition they ought to be paying,'' said Dr. Norman
Francis, president of Xavier University, who estimated that
students pay only half the cost of their educations at most
historically black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the assistance in the student financial aid and the
institutional aid, we would have to raise our tuition and we'd cut
out students,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that only twice before has Congress boosted the
institutional aid to black colleges _ in 1890 and most recently in
1965 ``at the urging of another Texan, Lyndon Baines Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., who helps oversee funding for
black colleges, joined university officials in praising Bush for
offering to seek the funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's always more that can be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Lee Jiles of Houston, secretary of the Texas Higher
Education Coordinating Board and a graduate of Texas Southern
University, hailed Bush's proposal. He said Bush has already shown
support for minorities in Texas _ by keeping TSU independent and
approving increased funding for both TSU and Prairie View A&AMP;M
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's record in Texas for support of historically
black colleges is outstanding,'' Jiles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put a number of buildings on the historically black
colleges throughout the state of Texas,'' he added, ``from
dormitories to science buildings to business centers. The record is
that of making sure that it happens and making his appointees
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   A second Bush appointee also endorsed the plan. University of
Texas regent Raul Romero of Houston said Bush increased minority
scholarships by 300 percent and lowered the cost of taking Advanced
Placement tests. The $1,000 in extra funds for Pell Grant
recipients should be a huge help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the catalyst that will make this program be very, very
successful,'' Romero said. ``I'm really delighted to see that the
governor has the vision to invest in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bush campaigner, Texas Railroad Commission Chairman
Michael Williams, said, ``This is not an empty promise. This is a
promise that comes with a record of achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994-2001, Texas Southern University's funding has
increased by 60 percent while Prairie View A&AMP;M state support has
risen 64 percent, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush emphasized his education initiatives, he took time to
``put a face'' on his $1.3 trillion tax relief plan, after
admitting earlier this week that he needed to do a better job
explaining his 10-year package.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his plan's impact on a typical, middle-income
family, he introduced Andrew Bechac, a Slidell high school football
coach who earns about $40,000 annually. Bush said that under his
plan, Bechac's annual tax liability would drop 77 percent, from
$2,075 to about $475.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Al Gore's tax plan, he gets no tax relief. The so-called
targeted tax cut means that some are targeted out of tax relief,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on a campaign stop at the University of Maryland in
College Park, just outside Washington, said his education plan
would include a new tax-free saving program to help parents save
for the rapidly increasing costs of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to about 1,000 people packed into an outdoor
amphitheater, Gore said his tuition proposal would allow families
to claim either a credit or a tax deduction of 28 percent on up to
$10,000 in tuition and fees for any post-secondary education,
including college and vocational training schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff said most families with a child in college would be
able to claim the full $2,800 credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to make the largest investment in education since
the G.I. bill,'' Gore told an audience that included students,
union members and Democratic activists.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal also would involve a new ``401j'' provision to
which workers and their employers could contribute just as they do
for 401k retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Invested earnings could be withdrawn tax-free if used for any
education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed a national tuition savings plan that would
link tax-free savings initiatives started in some states to allow
parents to begin saving for their children's education from birth.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's proposal, existing state programs would be linked
into a national program, and states without them would be
encouraged to join.

   LUMMI INDIAN RESERVATION, Wash. _ Mention the name Slade Gorton
in this far corner of Indian Country and some people will talk
about Slade Gorton the senior senator from Washington who is
helping to secure $15 million this year to replace a decrepit
tribal school.
</P>
<P>
   But most people will think of Slade Gorton the Indian fighter,
the better-known and much-feared figure, a 72-year-old Republican
who has spent much of his public life battling tribes like the
Lummis, who live two hours north of Seattle, on everything from
fishing rights to the power of governing their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In all the years that Gorton has feuded with American Indians,
he has never been subjected to a strong political backlash from the
tribes. But this year, flush with money from casino gambling
operations, Indians across the country say they are going to make
him pay.
</P>
<P>
   And because Gorton controls Indian-program purse strings in the
Senate, the stakes are high _ creating tension among tribal members
who say they are afraid that their challenge to Gorton will
threaten the paternal role of government that bonds most tribes,
uneasily, to the other Washington. This year, many tribal leaders
say they are so upset at Gorton that they are willing to take the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Indians have pooled money and are mounting a
campaign directed against a specific candidate, rather than a
single issue, as Indians have done in successful ballot initiatives
in California. The tribes say they have raised nearly $500,000 of
what is planned to be a $2 million independent campaign to deny a
fourth term to Gorton, who has fared poorly in recent polls even
though the Democrats will not select their nominee for almost a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, members of Congress and senators should think
twice before trying to undermine tribal authority,'' said Ron
Allen, vice president of the National Congress of American Indians
and the leader of the campaign to raise Indian money against
Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how politics works. And until now, we've never played
the game,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Indians contributed a record $1.3 million in
so-called soft money, mostly to Democrats, but with no specific
target. This year, the tribes are on pace to surpass the 1996 mark,
and Gorton is the sole target _ or ``public enemy No. 1,'' as the
Native American Rights Fund, the largest Indian legal support group
in the nation, has labeled him.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally of the national Indian congress several months ago,
leaders urged tribes from around the country to contribute to the
First American Education Project, the fund set up to run issue
advertisements against Gorton here in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The television and radio advertisements started running this
month and may follow Gorton all the way to Election Day, said Russ
Lehman, managing director of the fund. They feature a telegenic
tribal leader talking to children about the environment, then segue
to images of a large proposed mine in north central Washington,
which Indians have opposed and Gorton has championed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton is using the campaign against him to generate money
of his own, citing ``Indian tribes flush with gambling dollars,''
in a fund-raising letter to supporters. And he has used his
position as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that controls
federal funding for the tribes to counter the impression that he is
anti-Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the Lummi Reservation, for example, the tribe is
desperate to replace its cluster of dilapidated modular buildings
where children from kindergarten to high school are educated.
Gorton has helped to ensure that next year's budget includes money
for a new school.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the feud between the tribe and Gorton over
Indian control of water and property of non-Indians living on the
Lummi reservation has escalated. A few years ago, Gorton threatened
to withhold half of the tribe's federal funding if it did not
buckle to the wishes of private developers seeking more water for
building non-Indian homes on the reservation. The dispute
continues, causing a rift within the tribe as members have tried to
win federal money for the new school.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Lummi people, this has become personal,'' said Darrell
Hillaire, a Lummi tribal council member. ``The needs of our
children come first, and Sen. Gorton has helped us there, and we
respect him for that. But on all these other issues, it seems like
it's racial with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Jones, the Lummi tribal chairman, said the tribe was not
sure how active it would be in the campaign to defeat Gorton _
because the school funds came first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stand up for our children,'' said Jones. ``But we
also have to make a stand for our rights. The Indian tribes are
finally learning how to use the system, and this is the test
case.''
</P>
<P>
   But others fear a backlash, should the effort fail. ``Tribes
pooling their resources together in an effort to defeat a senator
is a recipe for disaster,'' said Tom Keefe, a Democrat running for
Congress in eastern Washington state, who is married to a Nez Perce
Indian. ``What if the tribes pour millions of dollars into the
campaign and Sen. Gorton wins re-election?''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, with 29 federally recognized tribes, most of them
based near urban areas around Puget Sound, has long been at the
center of modern-day disputes between Indians and non-Indians.
Gorton's battles with the tribes date to the mid-1970s, when, as
Washington's attorney general, he opposed the treaty rights of
Indians to take up to half of the annual runs of salmon and
steelhead. He carried the fight to the Supreme Court and lost.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he proposed a bill to curtail Indian fishing
rights. Five years ago, he tried to cut nearly 25 percent of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs financing that goes directly to tribal
governments. And two years ago, he introduced measures that tried
to knock out tribal immunity from certain civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In support of the last measure, Gorton held a hearing in the
Seattle area that drew hundreds of people carrying anti-Indian
slogans and waving American flags.
</P>
<P>
   All of the proposals failed to gather support in the Senate, and
were fiercely opposed by Republicans, including Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who received more political donations from Indians than
any presidential candidate ever had.

</P>
<P>
   Gorton says non-Indians do not have adequate constitutional
protections on reservations. He supports Indian self-government,
but says tribal rule should not extend to non-Indians who live on,
visit or have businesses on Indian land. This year, he points to
his effort to increase Interior Department spending on tribal
schools by $143 million as an example of his support for basic
Indian needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drafted the Interior bill this year, one of my top
priorities was to dramatically increase federal dollars for tribal
schools,'' said Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   But many Indians say Gorton's school support is designed to
divert attention from a quarter-century of public battles with the
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's election year window-dressing,'' said Brian Cladoosby,
chairman of the Association of Washington Tribes, and head of
Swinomish Indian Tribal Council, based just south of here. ``People
remember what he has done over the years. This year, we are trying
to make him an example. And so, even if we don't defeat him, it
will send a message: We can no longer be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, Allen, who is chairman of the Jamestown
S'Klallam tribe on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, has been
visiting some of the wealthier tribes around the country, trying to
raise money against Gorton. Indians gambling is generating more
than $8 billion a year in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest of the casino-enriched tribes, the Mashantucket
Pequots of Connecticut, are now considering donating to the fund,
even though some of the tribal leaders are Republican, as is Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been substantial and continuous attacks on Indian
Country from Gorton,'' said John Guevremont, the director of
national affairs for the Mashantucket Pequots, who said he was a
Republican. ``The tribes have a long list of grievances against him
and now have the means to try to defeat him.''

   The Toronto International Film Festival is about to enter its
25th year, having shown 5,790 features and shorts, by actual count,
since its inception in 1976. This year's edition, which runs from
Sept. 7 to 16, will add about 300 titles to that figure.
</P>
<P>
   In those years the festival has grown from a strictly local
event, organized by a group of Toronto businessmen, into one of the
primary stops on the international festival circuit, the North
American counterpart of Cannes, Berlin and Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one year when we incrementally grew,'' said Piers
Handling, who joined the festival's staff in 1982 and has been its
director since 1994. ``It was year by year, adding 10 films one
year, 10 more the next. There have been no massive leaps, no huge
shifts in terms of artistic direction. It's a festival that has
valued its continuity and as a result has grown organically. It
hasn't had to deal with outsiders. It was all insiders who were
promoted into the key jobs, so there was nobody who came in and
thought they had to change the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto has grown into a festival that combines public support
with a large professional presence, which means that visiting
critics and distributors see movies alongside a huge and famously
responsive local audience. (By contrast, festivals like Cannes and
Sundance are attended almost exclusively by industry types.) It's a
chemistry that creates the crucial festival commodity called buzz,
the sense of excitement that grows around unknown films.
</P>
<P>
   For example Jean-Jacques Beineix's ``Diva'' had already flopped
in France when David Overbey, a programmer, took it to the 1981
festival, where it became a word-of-mouth smash and was picked up
for distribution. That year the festival also fielded the North
American premiere of an untested British feature, ``Chariots of
Fire,'' which went on to win the Oscar for best picture.
</P>
<P>
   ```Chariots of Fire' put us on the map and legitimatized us in
the eyes of the industry, that a film like that could play here and
break out into major awards,'' Handling said. ``Festivals were
always perceived as events for art films, for cinephiles. The
studios were afraid of their films' being described as festival
films. But Toronto is a large public festival. It's very inclusive,
it's noncompetitive; it has something for everybody. That's been
its philosophy since it was founded. We will show anything from
experimental cinema and documentaries to films from foreign
cultures to studio films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thread that runs from `Chariots of Fire' to
`American Beauty,''' he continued, referring to the most recent
Oscar winner to have had its premiere in Toronto. ``When you can
actually prove to the studios that there is commercial value in
their film coming to your event, then they won't be afraid of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-profile films that will premiere at this year's
festival are ``Almost Famous,'' a comedy about a teen-age rock
journalist directed by Cameron Crowe (``Jerry Maguire''); Kathryn
Bigelow's erotic thriller ``The Weight of Water''; and the military
drama ``Men of Honor,'' with Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And for unrepentant cinephiles, there will be new offerings from
the directors Tom Tykwer (``Run, Lola, Run''), Wong Kar-wai
(``Chungking Express'') and Stephen Frears (``My Beautiful
Laundrette''). The schedule, along with ticket-ordering
information, can be found at the festival's Web site,
www.e.bell.ca/filmfest.

<P>
   A MASTER RECALLED
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mr. Kurosawa I knew was like a little boy,'' says Emi
Wada, who won an Academy Award for designing the costumes for
``Ran,'' by Akira Kurosawa. ``He was gentle, shy and truly an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ran,'' a transposition of ``King Lear'' to 17th-century Japan,
is generally considered the last great film of Kurosawa, the
Japanese master who died in 1998. First released in 1985, it is
being reissued nationally by Winstar, both theatrically and on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions by fax from her home in Tokyo, Wada
recalled her collaboration with Kurosawa. They ``met for the first
time at a party to celebrate the completion of his film `Dersu
Uzala' in 1974,'' she wrote. ``There I learned that he was planning
to make a film based on Shakespeare's `King Lear.' In 1983, when
`Ran' was about to start filming, I went to see Mr. Kurosawa. I
talked to him about my ideas, and he decided to hire me on the
spot. And at that moment the title `costume designer' first came to
existence on a Kurosawa film.''
</P>
<P>
   Wada went on to design the costumes for movies including
``Prospero's Books,'' by Peter Greenaway, and Nagisa Oshima's
``Gohatto,'' which had its premiere at this year's Cannes
International Film Festival, as well as for numerous operas and
theater pieces in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the preparation of `Ran' began, Mr. Kurosawa and I drew
numerous sketches,'' Wada recalled. ``If all those pieces of
drawing paper were piled up, it would come to about 20 centimeters
high or more. He would continually say to me, `This design is
marvelous, but can you come up with something better?' I would work
on it some more, add things or sometimes change the idea
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the costumes of `Ran' I was thinking of the theatrical,
symbolic, stylized costumes of Noh, focusing on the fabric with a
static silhouette. These costumes were more suitable for the film
than costumes in the actual period style.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the main characters I decided on the colors first, and
then the patterns, and then the material that would make the most
out of all those elements. For example, the costume of the leading
character, Lord Hidetora, started with a pure white and ended with
a thoroughly soiled white. For the three brothers I decided on
yellow, red and blue as the main colors, and I changed the
intensity of the colors depending on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After working six months like this, finally he approved the
designs, and I started weaving them. Mr. Kurosawa entrusted me with
creating the fabrics, from selecting the threads to deciding on
their thickness, the dye and how they should be woven. When the
first woven cloth was done, I showed it to Mr. Kurosawa. He
congratulated me that I made something better than he aimed for.''
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS IN PARIS
</P>
<P>
   Two New York University film students, Caran Hartsfield and
Peter Sollett, have been chosen to participate in a new program,
the Cinefondation Residence, sponsored by the Cannes Film Festival.
In October they will join four other students in a five-month
residency in Paris, where they will develop projects for their
first feature films under the guidance of French film
professionals. Oliver Assayas, who wrote and directed ``Irma Vep,''
led the selection committee. &QL;

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ As President Clinton prepares to visit
Colombia next week and open the spigot of military aid, the
country's neighbors are expressing concerns that an escalation of
the fighting here could push coca growing, drug trafficking,
refugees and even fighting across their borders.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian conflict has already led guerrillas to seek safe
havens in Panama and Venezuela. U.S. military officials warn that
one Colombian rebel group already exerts influence over Indian
dissidents in Ecuador, and new Colombian plantings of coca and
poppies have been reported in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders around the region say the nature of the war is about
to change with the release of $1.3 billion in new U.S. aid over the
next two years to train and equip an anti-narcotics army brigade,
and the impact of the war on their nations is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   The brigade will be outfitted with 60 helicopters that will
support police efforts to eradicate the coca fields and shut down
trafficking operations in two southern Colombian provinces occupied
and largely controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, the biggest rebel faction.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the rebels stand and fight to support the coca
growers and traffickers, whose protection money finances their war
effort, tens of thousands of coca growers are likely to move far
and wide, taking their seedlings and guerrilla protection with
them.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Secretary of State Madeleine Albright heard
from nervous Ecuadorean and Brazilian leaders on her trip through
South America this month. It was repeated when Ecuador's president,
Gustavo Noboa, came to Bogota on Wednesday to ask President Andres
Pastrana that his government be kept informed of all military
operations in southern Colombia so the Ecuadorean army could
prepare for any incursions of coca growers, refugees or guerrillas
across its frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our worry is that the removal of this cancerous tumor will
cause it to metastasize into Ecuador,'' Ecuador's foreign minister,
Heinz Moeller, told Colombian reporters on Wednesday. He noted that
successful efforts by Peru and Bolivia to eradicate coca plantings
in recent years encouraged more cultivation in Colombia, worsening
this country's drug problem while having little impact on world
cocaine supplies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials call it the ``balloon effect,'' when they succeed
in attacking drug activity in one county or region, only to see it
pop up again in some other country nearby. They note that when the
Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration
succeeded several years ago in helping the police in Colombia
arrest the leaders of the country's biggest drug cartels,
organizations emerged elsewhere to take their place and the flood
of drugs continued. Those new organizations, weaker then their
predecessors, sought protection from the Colombian guerrillas and
have pumped up their powers with much financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Even Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, who took a hard line
against guerrillas in his country in the early 1990s, told
reporters this week that he was concerned that an escalation of the
fighting in Colombia ``could generate a wider conflict, one in
which the FARC retreats into Peruvian territory.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Colombian officials are trying to assuage Latin
American leaders, arguing that the new military effort in southern
Colombia _ which is part of a broader national military and
humanitarian effort called Plan Colombia _ is an attempt to force
the FARC to negotiate seriously in peace talks, which have stalled
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a peace plan, not a war plan,'' is how Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto of Colombia characterized his
government's new initiative to his regional colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Fernando Tapias, the chief of the Colombian armed forces,
argued last week that eradicating the coca fields in the Putumayo
and Caqueta provinces of Colombia would deprive the FARC of a
source of hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and hence its
ability to make war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be peace, but first there will be war,'' he said in
an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo.
``With or without Plan Colombia, things are going to get worse.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On her South American trip last week, Albright offered Ecuador
$15 million to help Colombian refugees. Ecuadorean leaders publicly
backed Plan Colombia, despite their concerns, but Brazilian leaders
told her they would not contribute to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil does not have the same level of commitment as the
United States in the program to fight drug trafficking in
Colombia,'' said Brazil's foreign minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
   Panama, which has not had an army since the U.S. invasion that
overthrew Gen. Manuel Noriega in 1989, has begun moving hundreds of
police officers to the Colombian border and has requested $30
million from Washington to bolster efforts to defend itself from a
growing number of border incursions by Colombian guerrillas, drug
traffickers and coca growers.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has also begun to reinforce its long, porous border with
Colombia, and it is buying four French Cougar AS-532 helicopters to
increase the mobility of its border patrols. Peru has moved a fleet
of MI-17 helicopters from its border with Ecuador to its Colombian
frontier in recent months. And Venezuela, which has long complained
of Colombian guerrilla incursions, has also beefed up its border
guard, which now stands at an estimated 25,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such preparations, there have been persistent reports
that the Colombian guerrillas have established cordial relations
with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, a populist who is critical
of the U.S. role in Latin American affairs. This week, one of the
leading commanders of the National Liberation Army, the second
largest guerrilla group here, announced that he had reached a
formal agreement with Venezuela that included a cease-fire along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, denied that
there was any agreement with the guerrilla group, ``whether tacit
or explicit,'' though he acknowledged that there had been contacts.
But Rangel went on to say that his government's concerns about an
escalation of the four-decade-old civil conflict in Colombia would
be vigorously voiced at a meeting of Latin American presidents in
Brasilia on Aug. 31, the day after Clinton's eight-hour trip to
Colombia to kick off Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are inevitable and basic fears Venezuela shares with
other neighboring countries that when this plan is put into
operation there will be a flood of Colombian refugees moving toward
the frontier zones,'' Rangel told reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S.-supplied and trained anti-narcotics brigade will
not be fully ready for combat until well into 2001. But there is
already growing evidence that the guerrillas are using the remote,
permeable borders of Colombia's neighbors to wage their war.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori this week announced that Peruvian intelligence had
uncovered an international arms ring that had trafficked 10,000
Russian assault rifles from Jordan through Peru and across the
Colombian border to FARC units. Fujimori charged that high
Jordanian military officials were involved in the operation, and
among those arrested were two Peruvian military officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned,'' Fujimori said, ``that these FARC arms
shipments are meant to counteract the military support the United
States is now giving Colombia.''

<P>
   GLEN ELLEN, Calif. _ Returning to their first love after a brief
but expensive fling in the beer business, the Benzigers will open a
high-tech winery this week in the Sonoma Valley on the site of
their failed microbrewery.
</P>
<P>
   Never ones to think small, the Benzigers hope to make their new
Imagery Estate Winery into a must-see stop on Highway 12 with an
array of tourist-friendly attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, which opens Friday for weekend visits, features an
art gallery with more than 125 paintings that have adorned the
labels of Benziger's ultrapremium Imagery wines for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Appellation Trail'' winds through the 20-acre property,
offering visitors a walking tour of Sonoma County's diverse
viticultural regions. And the winery is planning a new exhibition,
``Wines Through Civilization,'' to showcase the role of wine
throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it an educational tour, where people can
relax, have fun and learn something about wine,'' the winemaker Joe
Benziger said as workers buzzed around putting the final touches on
the winery.
</P>
<P>
   And what a winery it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We designed it with the latest and greatest in wine
technology,'' Benziger said.
</P>
<P>
   Benziger can monitor and operate the winery from anywhere in the
world, using a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Steel tanks can be heated or cooled to maintain precise
temperatures during the fermentation process. The specially
designed tanks can handle large or very small volumes of grapes,
allowing Benziger to make wines in small lots without blending
grapes from different vineyard blocks.
</P>
<P>
   A computer records every step in the viticultural and winemaking
process, creating an electronic archive that allows Benziger to
track changes from vintage to vintage.
</P>
<P>
   The new winery, which can process 3,000 tons of grapes, is twice
the size of the Benziger Family Winery on London Ranch Road. For
the first time in years, the Benzigers will be able to produce all
their wines in house, rather than renting space at other wineries.
</P>
<P>
   It is a homecoming of sorts for the Benziger family.
</P>
<P>
   The family created the fastest-growing segment of the wine
business in the 1980s, marketing a line of inexpensive varietals
under the Glen Ellen brand. The Benzigers sold the label in 1993 to
Heublein and focused on a line of higher-priced wines sold under
the family name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Benzigers branched out into the beer business,
ripping out several acres of prime merlot vineyards to make room
for the Sonoma Mountain Brewery. The family pulled the plug on the
$4 million brewery early last year, saying it never turned a profit
in 18 months of operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw no light at the end of the tunnel,'' Benziger said.
``We made a business decision to get out early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the brewing tanks and iceboxes filled with kegs. The
Benzigers sold the brewing equipment to a beer maker in France,
recouping some of their investment. Now, the brewery is filled with
grape presses and steel fermentation tanks for wine.
</P>
<P>
   The winery will serve as the home of the Benzigers' Imagery
brand. The label focuses on unusual grape varietals like malbec,
cabernet franc, petite sirah, viognier and barbera, produced in
small lots. This winter, Benziger will debut a new line of
single-vineyard cabernet sauvignons under the Imagery label.
</P>
<P>
   The Benzigers plan to double production over the next five
years, from 5,000 cases to about 10,000 cases. The ultrapremium
wines, which retail for $20 to $50 a bottle, will be sold
exclusively in the winery's tasting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to sell every drop out of there,'' Benziger

<P>
   Part of the new winery will be used to make the family's core
Benziger brand, a 175,000-case label with wines that retail for $10
to $40 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the tasting room will be greeted with a free glass
of wine at the door _ although a fee will be charged for additional
tastings _ and encouraged to browse through the art gallery. The
collection, valued at more than $1 million, features original art
commissioned for the Imagery label.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Bob Nugent, an art professor at Sonoma
State University, the winery has commissioned more than 100 artists
over the last 17 years to create paintings that adorn its labels.
Artists are given free rein over the content of their creations,
with one caveat _ all must include a depiction of the Parthenon,
the ancient Greek temple in Athens that has become the winery's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the paintings were exhibited at the Benzigers'
original winery, most of the collection has been crated up in
storage, until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art collection is very special,'' Benziger said. ``We
wanted to keep it all in one place.''

AT SUMMER'S END

  Rent a movie! Watch a movie being made! Be in a movie!

<P>
   It's late August, most kids aren't back in school yet, the
parade of visiting friends and relatives from out of town is
continuing and the thought of listening to ``It's a Small World''
one more time is more than you can stand.
</P>
<P>
   We feel your pain.
</P>
<P>
   For these dog days of summer, there are still some entertainment
options out there. Some are new, some may be new to you, others may
be ones you've forgotten about. Here are a few attractions _ and
distractions _ to consider during summer's last steamy gasp.
</P>
<P>
   _Going through ``Survivor'' withdrawal already? Bored with
``Millionaire,'' ``Big Brother'' and reruns of reruns? The
offerings on the tube may be passe, but don't forget we live in TV
Land. Most networks' fall premieres are weeks away but those new
episodes are in production right now. Audiences Unlimited in
Universal City (818-753-3470) and Audience Associates on Melrose
Avenue near Gardner (323-653-4105) have free tickets to tapings of
popular returning comedies such as ``Everybody Loves Raymond,''
``The Drew Carey Show,'' ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``3rd Rock From the
Sun'' and newcomers like ``The Geena Davis Show'' and ``Bette.''
They also offer game shows such as ``The Price Is Right,''
``Hollywood Squares'' and ``Wheel of Fortune'' or late-night fare
like ``Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher'' and ``The Dennis
Miller Show'' _ the HBO one, not the ABC Monday Night Football one.
</P>
<P>
   To get into ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' line up at NBC
Studios, 3000 W. Alameda Blvd. in Burbank, by 4 p.m. the day of the
telecast. (If there's a big star or a hot musical guest on the
bill, plan on getting there early in the morning.) Tickets are
given on a first-come, first-served basis, with a limit of two
tickets per person. For more information, call (818) 840-4444 and
ask for audience services.
</P>
<P>
   There are standard rules to most television tapings: Leave those
cameras, video recorders and cellular phones behind, along with
children under the show's minimum age. And keep in mind most shows
hand out more tickets than the studio has seats to assure a full
house, so arrive early unless you want to feel like the loser in
musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   _Universal Studios Hollywood still has its famous features
including ``Jurassic Park: The Ride,'' ``Back to the Future'' and
the year-old ``Terminator 2: 3D,'' but it also has a few
attractions added this summer, among them the ``Rugrats Magic
Adventure!'' stage show; The Klumps, a special effects production
built around Eddie Murphy's ``Nutty Professor'' sequel; and the
``Chicken Run'' maze featuring clay animation models from the
movie. And now through Sept. 5, Universal is displaying all 27 real
Emmys (without winners' names, of course) that will be handed out
Sept. 10 at the 52nd annual Primetime Emmy Awards. It is the first
ever public display of the TV academy's winged statuettes.
Universal's Studio Tour tram ride recently underwent a face-lift,
with the addition of on-board monitors that show movie scenes
filmed in the backlot locations pointed out by the guide. For more
information, call (818) 622-3801.
</P>
<P>
   _Universal isn't the only studio offering tours. It's just the
one with the biggest advertising budget. Paramount (5555 Melrose
Ave., Hollywood), Warner Bros. (Hollywood Way and Olive Avenue,
Burbank) and NBC welcome the public for an inside look at the
movie- and TV-making process. Prices vary: $7 for a 70-minute
stroll around NBC (818-840-4444) with peeks at the ``Days of Our
Lives'' and ``Tonight Show'' sets; Paramount (323-956-1777) gives
escorted two-hour walks for $15 per person; and Warner Bros.
(818-954-1744) charges $32 for two hours, part on foot and part in
golf carts. Most tours set a minimum age, and tickets are given out
on a first-come, first-served basis except for groups' advance
reservations. There's no guarantee you'll see real movie stars or
get into busy soundstages; these are working lots and their first
priority is making movies and TV shows, not catering to the
curious. But tours offer a great opportunity to see how movie magic
is made.
</P>
<P>
   _If you've seen all the summer's best movies _ or should we say
``both''? _ head to the neighborhood video store and walk right
past that new releases section. Instead try the foreign language
aisle for an Akira Kurosawa epic such as ``The Seven Samurai'' or
his melodramatic ``Rashomon,'' Mexican director Alfonso Arau's
bittersweet ``Like Water for Chocolate'' or wonderful comedies such
as Jacques Tati's ``Mon Oncle'' or ``Mr. Hulot's Holiday.''
Although Italy's ``Life Is Beautiful'' is available dubbed in
English, it's only right to see it in the language that helped
writer-director Roberto Benigni earn his best-actor Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a total aversion to subtitles, there are many gems
hidden in the mainstream comedy, drama and action aisles. Consider
a few hot stars of the moment and look for one of their early
films, such as Tom Cruise's ``Risky Business,'' Minnie Driver's
``Circle of Friends'' or Martin Sheen's ``Badlands.'' There are
videos out there for nearly everyone. Ever appear in a community
theater production and laugh at yourself in the process? See
Christopher Guest's mockumentary ``Waiting for Guffman.'' Going
through home construction or remodeling hell and need
commiseration? Watch Cary Grant and Myrna Loy in the 1948 comedy
``Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House.''
</P>
<P>
   _Dodgers got you blue? Try an alternative sport once in a while,
such as polo at Will Rogers State Park, home field of the Will
Rogers Polo Club. There are games every weekend through Sept. 24 in
Pacific Palisades, with matches running 2-5 p.m. Saturdays and 10
a.m.-1 p.m. Sundays. And it's a bargain among L.A. sports _ just $3
per carload. Call (310) 573-5000 for schedule details, or (310)
454-8212 for other information.
</P>
<P>
   _It's hard to beat a beautiful summer evening at the Hollywood
Bowl, unless it's a beautiful summer day there watching a rehearsal
for free. The Los Angeles Philharmonic practices mainly Tuesday and
Thursday mornings, and there's a jazz soundcheck usually on
Wednesday afternoons. On Friday mornings you usually can catch the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra rehearsing, more often than not with the
weekend headliner. While you're there, stop in at the museum to see
photos, videos and interactive displays of the landmark's history.
There is no admission charge for daytime rehearsals or the museum.
Parking on the grounds is free until 4:30 p.m. For more information
call (323) 850-2000.
</P>
<P>
   _Of course, in Los Angeles entertainment is not merely a
spectator sport. In addition to tapings tickets, Audience
Associates (323-653-4105) also can get fans in front of the camera
through its aptly named Big Crowds business. You may be needed to
play a screaming groupie in a concert scene, a football fanatic or
a loyal party member cheering a candidate's speech. These are
unpaid extra positions but Cash Oshman of Audience Associates/Big
Crowds say they sometimes lead to paid assignments and membership
in the Screen Extras Guild. Oshman said groups of 50 or more can
use one of his assignments to raise money for their favorite
non-profit organization while working on a real film or TV shoot.
No promises that you won't be left on the cutting room floor, or
even that your face will be caught on camera, but at least you can
say you worked on a movie. That could be a good bragging point when
it comes time to rehash what you did on your summer vacation.

DISCOUNT CLUBS FILL THE GAPS IN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   A variety of new companies are beginning to offer below-market
prices on prescription drugs and services like doctor, dental and
eye care and medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   Like buyers' discount clubs, including Costco and Sam's Club,
the new companies attract people looking for a better price, in
this case because they have no health insurance or because their
health insurance does not cover the treatments they want.
</P>
<P>
   Individual patients sign up, often on the Internet, and agree to
pay for medical services with cash or a debit or credit card. They
usually pay a small annual membership fee, and get an
identification card that is accepted by a network of doctors,
drugstores and other health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The drugstores and other providers join the plans _ and accept
the lower prices _ to reach more customers. And doctors, eager to
avoid the payment delays and the restrictions on diagnostic and
treatment choices they experience when patients are using
insurance, accept reduced fees comparable to those they receive
from managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the services are so new, there are no firm statistics on
how many people have signed up, or how many thousands of doctors
are involved. But many self-employed people with little or no
insurance find the new discounters particularly useful.
</P>
<P>
   Adria Firestone, a mezzo-soprano who lives in Jersey City, N.J.,
said her union health plan got so expensive that she could no
longer afford full coverage. So when she needed bifocal contact
lenses before a concert in Italy, she showed her card from a
company called Medisavers to a participating Manhattan optometrist.
As a Medisavers member, she paid $306.68 instead of the $475 retail
price.
</P>
<P>
   David Wallen, a free-lance entertainment writer in Los Angeles,
saw a Web site operated by a company called HealthAllies soon after
it began offering doctor services in May. There was no charge to
sign up. ``They negotiated rates for me with the internist and
eye-ear-throat doctor I was already seeing,'' he said. ``It saved
me half on my medical bills. It's great for people without health
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients with insurance are using the new services as well.
Anyone trying to see a doctor outside his managed-care network, or
looking for a medical service his insurance does not cover, like
acupuncture or cosmetic surgery, may now be able to find a lower
price for what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a real phenomenon,'' said Gail Wilensky, a
health care economist and former White House official. ``People are
going to be able to shop and choose'' from a variety of medical
services including ``individual providers and services they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The new programs are not aimed at people of limited means who do
not qualify for Medicaid, those often referred to as the working
poor. But they can stretch the buying power of people who can
afford to pay for medical care _ including the one in 10 uninsured
people who earn $50,000 a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Making discounts on health care widely available ``is clearly a
method for making the market work better,'' said Judith Lave, a
professor of health economics at the University of Pittsburgh. ``We
are clearly better off with them than without them.'' But she said
the services would mainly attract patients who were relatively well
off, so the discounts would not solve ``our macro problem,'' the 45
million people without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Limited alternatives to employer-sponsored medical plans have
existed for some time. AARP, formerly the American Association of
Retired Persons, has long had a mail-order pharmacy for its
members, for example. But the new companies can help people who do
not have an employer or an organization to negotiate the lower
discounts that are typically provided to groups.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent, HealthMarket, a startup in Wilton, Conn. headed
by Stephen F. Wiggins, the former chief executive of Oxford Health
Plans, began listing doctors in the program on its Web site in late
July and plans to add hospitals, dental and vision care and
alternative medicine next month.
</P>
<P>
   Other small companies starting up or expanding discount medical
services include HealthAllies, based in Glendale, Calif.;
MedAdvantage of Southfield, Mich.; AmeriPlanUSA, based in Dallas;
and Medisavers, which also offers health plans to a number of New
York unions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Larger companies are entering the business as well. In June, the
Reader's Digest Association joined with Medco to advertise
drugstore discount cards and mail service to 50 million customers
of Digest magazines, books and records, and says it may eventually
offer other medical services as well.
</P>
<P>
   People who join YourxPlan, the Reader's Digest-Medco program,
pay $25 a year, or $40 annually for a family, to get promised
savings averaging 18 percent on brand-name drugs by mail, and 11
percent at 40,000 participating pharmacies. Members can also check
on prices or order refills on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O. Ryder, chairman of the Reader's Digest Association,
said it started the business after conducting a survey of customers
of its magazines, books and records. ``We discovered that around 20
million did not have drug coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people find the new services through professional
organizations. Melissa Wahl, executive director of the National
Association for Female Executives, said the organization was
recommending HealthAllies to its 135,000 members, many of whom run
small businesses with limited insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new medical service companies hope to grow
substantially if the tight employment market eases, and if big
employers begin to remodel health benefits the way they did when
they replaced pensions with 401(k) plans. If employers make that
change, employees would receive a set amount of money for their
health care needs instead of the relatively open-ended coverage
they have now, and they would spend their own money if their costs
exceeded the set amount.
</P>
<P>
   Already, employees are shouldering more of their health care
costs. The percentage of employees with fully paid health coverage
has dropped sharply under managed care. In 1998, 26.6 percent of
Americans had fully paid care, compared with 45.5 percent in 1983,
said James L. Medoff, a Harvard University economist who studied
the trend for the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit research
organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even the covered services in managed care are disappointing many
patients. ``Health plans have so frustrated consumers that some of
them are ready to reach in their pocket and spend money,'' said
Karen Donelan, a public opinion expert at the Harvard School of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hates the current system,'' said Bill McGahan, a
health care industries investment banker at UBS Warburg.
``Employers don't like it, physicians don't like it, employees
don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-pocket spending on health care services is exploding,
especially for drugs. Americans spent $199.5 billion of their own
money on health care in 1998, by the government's latest count, up
38 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, consumers spend $30 billion annually on
alternative medical treatments like acupuncture, said Regina
Herzlinger, a health care expert and professor at the Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Donelan said a recent survey by Harris Interactive found that 15
percent to 20 percent of Americans who have health insurance were
already spending their money for extras, including alternative
care.
</P>
<P>
   To capture some of that spending, the online discount health
plans offer services and products that many health plans do not
cover, including expensive, heavily advertised drugs like Claritin
for allergies, lifestyle products like Viagra for male impotence,
and laser surgery to correct nearsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new companies are spurring some established health insurers
to expand their offerings. The three biggest managed-care drug
companies, Merck-Medco, PCS and Express Scripts, are inviting a
broader public to try the discounts that they provide to employers
and health maintenance organizations, their main customers.
</P>
<P>
   As for AARP, the group recently waived a $15 annual fee for the
PCS cards it gives to 3.3 million members who buy the
organization's health-related insurance. And in February, the
association began offering member discounts on eye exams, glasses
and contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts said it was adding more than 500 members each
week to several new drug card programs it started this summer with
groups like Seniority America, which sells services to people over
50.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As with much of what is available on the Web, the information
provided by the new medical companies is not always screened for
reliability or accuracy. The Web sites provide only limited
information about the doctors in their programs, and many rely on
outside organizations that have been approved by the National
Committee for Quality Assurance to vet doctors' credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers on their own looking for quality information about
doctors are at a real disadvantage,'' said Barry Scholl, a
spokesman for the quality assurance committee, whose main function
is to set standards and accredit managed-care plans. On Thursday,
legislation in California that would have regulated the discount
companies was defeated. Consumer advocates and some medical groups
said the law would have been too lax.
</P>
<P>
   At one startup company, HealthAllies.com, the listings on
doctors include their addresses, fees, the number of patients they
see each day, and whether they are board-certified in their
specialties. The company promises savings of 10 percent to 50
percent on ``the things insurance doesn't cover.''
</P>
<P>
   On HealthMarket, Wiggins' startup, consumers can get
information, including professional profiles of doctors, fees and
full charges for dozens of treatments. Individuals pay $29 a year
and families pay $49, plus a transaction fee for each service used.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they liked the prompt hassle-free payments and
increased patient flow. Dr. Stephen B. Meisel, a radiologist who is
chief executive of Medfocus, a national chain of 1,800 medical
imaging centers, said the direct-to-consumer services were ``a
great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sign up with insurance companies or employers,'' he
said, ``we give them a good value because they provide patient
volume. We offer the same range of fees for HealthAllies.com. The
patients are getting a big break.'' For example, he said, a
magnetic resonance imaging scan, or MRI, in New York City would
cost ``50 percent off the retail price.''

`GOD'S ARMY': DOING GOOD IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good works don't necessarily make good films.
</P>
<P>
   So while it is possible to admire ``God's Army'' as an act of
piety, and for its unusual subject and unpretentious performances,
this film about Mormon missionaries eventually becomes preaching
that is likely to tax the credibility of the unconverted.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Richard Dutcher, who is also one of its
stars, ``God's Army'' tells the story of Brandon Allen (Matthew
Brown), a 19-year-old Mormon missionary assigned to Los Angeles
under the tutelage of Marcus Dalton (Dutcher), a dedicated
29-year-old member of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   With a few other young missionaries, they share an apartment
where college dorm pranks are commonplace. Wearing white shirts and
neckties, they spend their days on the streets of the city, ringing
doorbells, distributing literature and seeking conversions that
take them among prostitutes and into the homes of ordinary people.
Among themselves, the missionaries study, pray and are subject to
crises of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon himself struggles with his faith but is less troubled
than Elder Kinegar (Michael Buster), who reads voraciously in
literature that attacks the tenets of Mormons. The steadfast,
uncompromising member of the community is Elder Dalton (Dutcher in
a convincing performance), a former medical student who is dying of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, let's do some good,'' he is fond of saying at the
start of the day.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time the paths of the young men cross the paths of
the female missionaries Sister Fronk (Jaque Gray) and Sister Monson
(Kelli Coleman), but the principal drama of ``God's Army'' spins
around the relationship of Elder Dalton and Elder Allen to Benny
(Doug Stewart), a lame young man who vanishes on the eve of his
baptism.
</P>
<P>
   His reappearance as a mugging victim, shorn of spirit and
convinced that death is near, sets the stage for ``God's Army'' to
exhibit its faith in a manner that mingles sentimental drama with
religious devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's Army'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has
some hospital scenes and bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>

By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across an expanse of 20-odd years, the glistening pop of
Marshall Crenshaw still shines sweetly, music with smarts and hooks
and, wow, a beat you can even dance to sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's guitar-dominated, and it all starts with wanting to play
the guitar in the first place,'' Crenshaw said. ``It's like highly
nuanced, finely detailed, cool rock music, sort of, with really
good rhythms and just sort of adventurous and different sonic
textures from album to album, intelligent, groovy, passionate
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the album that first put Crenshaw on the pop firmament, his
eponymous debut augmented with several tracks, and a crackerjack
retrospective called ``This Is Easy: The Very Best of Marshall
Crenshaw,'' are hitting store shelves, while Crenshaw himself is
hitting the stage in a show tonight in Santa Monica's McCabe's
Guitar Shop.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been a chance for Crenshaw to review fruits of a
rewarding _ artistically if not always commercially _ career,
starting with that first album, which came out in 1982 to
overwhelmingly positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who really love that record,''
Crenshaw said. ``I'm pleased about that, because it's been a long
while now since I made it and it's stood a test of time. I really
love it. It did make a big impact in its time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Crenshaw isn't entirely happy with his work on that
first effort, despite the hosannas it received (and continues to
garner _ Daily News reviewer Glenn Whipp gave the reissue a
highest-possible four stars this week).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raw and unformed as a singer, kind of groping vocally on
some of those tracks,'' he said. ``I have these criticisms of it,
but I'm fond of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Crenshaw was writing the songs for his first album,
he was ``kind of rediscovering and dealing with a lot of rock `n'
roll stuff I'd loved in my childhood,'' he said. ``I was really
listening to a lot of rockabilly and getting back into stuff I knew
during childhood and was getting back to it as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been working as the understudy of the John Lennon
character in ``Beatlemania,'' on both the national tour and in runs
in Los Angeles and San Francisco. And it is the Beatles and Buddy
Holly and some of the earlier rock that influenced his writing of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   He took the big, open sounds and smacking rhythms of that music
and tried to adapt them to a more modern context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the time I was getting there, I think,'' he said. ``I
had this real set idea of song structure, just bam-bam-bam and no
wasted motion. I did that for a while, but after about 20 songs
within those parameters, I had to bag it and throw away the rule
book.''
</P>
<P>
   With his second album, ``Field Day,'' he began exploring
different approaches, not always to the glee of fans he'd collected
with his debut. ``Field Day'' still had a couple of songs left over
from his earlier songwriting phase, including the transcendent
``Whenever You're on My Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``For Her Love,'' another leftover of that initial
songwriting rush, ``really felt like I had to force it,'' Crenshaw
said. So he began trying other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could compose melodies really easily, and could go as deep
emotionally with (lyrics) as I could and stretch out,'' Crenshaw
said. ``That was the direction I went in 'Field Day.' I really
caught a ton of (grief) from people for the way my second album
sounded. But it was just a really great representation of my tastes
then.''
</P>
<P>
   He recorded five albums for Warner Bros. and another for MCA,
put out a collection of demos, a live album and two more recent
studio albums for the independent Razor &AMP; Tie.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he's played with artists such as Don Dixon, the
BoDeans and Was (Not Was); had his songs covered by artists as
diverse as Bette Midler and the Gin Blossoms; acted in ``Peggy Sue
Got Married'' and as Buddy Holly in ``La Bamba''; and helped put
together a book of good and bad rock movies called ``Hollywood Rock
&AMP; Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 46, Crenshaw said the best-of collection, which Rhino is
also releasing, is another source of great pride, a chance for even
him to look back on his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually got really excited about it when it was all
mastered,'' Crenshaw said. ``I got my reference CD and listened to
it on a long plane ride home. I was just happy to hear it. It's a
really good body of work. I don't listen to my stuff, and I forget
what it sounds like. But there's a lot of different textures and
tracks as you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, with two children less than 4 years old and a place
in New York City, he leads a very different life than in the
knock-around years before he finally got serious about songwriting
in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being here, being back in the city, I'm taking in a lot
of information, and different kinds of information,'' Crenshaw
said. ``Kids change what I listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after reading that some kinds of music can improve
learning skills for young children, he started playing more jazz
and orchestral music, especially great pianists such as Bill Evans
and Fats Waller.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he'll always be a rocker, with none of the classical
and operatic pretensions of quasi-contemporary pop craftsmen such
as Paul McCartney, Pete Townshend, Joe Jackson and Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really drawn in that direction,'' Crenshaw said. ``The
first thing I always deal with when I write songs is the rhythm:
What's the tempo, what's the groove, what's the feel?''
</P>
<P>
   The past couple of years, he's been touring a lot on the East
Coast, often doing solo shows because he is ``really big on the
simplicity of the solo stuff. I don't have to cut any checks (for
other musicians). I don't have to worry about who's going to be the
bass player that night.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's pretty content, Crenshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of satisfaction now about it,'' Crenshaw said.
``Until I did this `Best of,' I had this ambivalence about the
records I've made. But now I just sort feel like it's a good body
of work. It's all kind of resolved for me at this point.'' &QL;

DOLPHINS `TALK' BY WHISTLING, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other than humans, there are no land-dwelling mammals that are
capable of learning and imitating sounds they hear _ a crucial part
of the development of language, the most distinctly human of our
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But dolphins share that capacity for imitation. When swimming in
the wild they keep in touch by uttering a ``signature whistle''
repeatedly. And now, new research being reported in the current
journal Science shows that one dolphin may address another _
whether for comradeship or conflict _ by immediately repeating the
other's distinctive whistle. In essence, they may call each other
by name.
</P>
<P>
   Birds can imitate sounds to some extent, but not with the kind
of specific individual signatures that dolphins produce. Dolphins
are remarkably adept at it _ they develop their unique signatures
within the first year of life, using sounds different from those of
dolphins around them, but related to noises in their environment.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of their signature whistles has been known for
about a decade _ first discovered by a team including biologist
Peter Tyack of Woods Hole (Mass.) Oceanographic Institution _ but
the new work is the first to show that these whistles are often
copied by different individuals within a few seconds of the
original.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results show that bottlenose dolphins use their learned
whistles in matching interactions, most likely to address each
other,'' Vincent Janik, a biology student at the University of St.
Andrews in Scotland, wrote in the new paper. Such ``addressing''
whistles might, he suggested, ``be either aggressive or
affiliative,'' or could ``signal alliance membership to third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins in the wild are notoriously difficult to study: The
ocean is a very big place with limited visibility, and dolphins
move very fast. The breakthrough that made the new findings
possible was the use of an array of three underwater microphones
that, coupled with sophisticated computer software developed by a
Belmont, Mass. firm, Engineering Design, made it possible to
pinpoint the place where a given sound originated.
</P>
<P>
   Janik, currently working at the Woods Hole institute, placed the
microphones in a section of the Moray Firth on the Scottish coast
in 1994 and 1995, and recorded dolphin sounds over a period of 7
days as part of his thesis research.
</P>
<P>
   To count as a ``matching'' whistle, the second occurrence had to
happen within 3 seconds of the first, and be separated by a
distance large enough that a single dolphin could not have swum
that far in the interval. This ensured that the sounds really were
being made by two different dolphins, but it also meant that sounds
copied by dolphins swimming close together would not be counted.
Thus, ``it is possible that matching interactions are more common''
than the results indicated, Janik wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery, Tyack wrote in an accompanying commentary, is
``important for anyone interested in comparative studies of the
evolution of vocal learning and labeling in animals.''
</P>
<P>
   From research with captive dolphins, researchers had already
found that they seldom use their signature whistles when they are
all close together. But as soon as one dolphin is separated from
the others, all of them immediately begin emitting their
signatures, suggesting that this is a way of keeping track of each
other and keeping the group together.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have also demonstrated that dolphins in captivity
will very quickly learn to associate a newly learned whistle with a
specific object _ a key part of the development of language. But
the new research, Tyack wrote, now extends that finding to show
that ``vocal labeling'' is also used by dolphins in their natural
habitat, as part of the process of social interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Slater, a professor of natural history at St. Andrews and
supervisor of Janik's research, called the use of the technology
for pinpointing the location of sounds ``a great innovation. . . .
If you hear two identical sounds in a row, you might think it was
the same dolphin. But if they occur a few seconds apart and you can
tell that they are hundreds of feet apart, they must be different
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this method _ using microphones anchored to the
bottom _ avoids any disturbance of the dolphins' natural behavior,
which might occur with the use of boats or divers to observe their
behavior. In this research, the recordings were made from shore,
while a second researcher at a higher elevation was watching with
binoculars to monitor the number of dolphins and their movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you disturb them, they may behave in a different way,''
said Slater, a specialist in animal sounds. ``It's important to
extend our research out into the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, he said, the research on dolphin vocalizations is
``only scratching the surface of something that's probably very
complex.'' Dolphins are ``capable of all sorts of tasks, and they
presumably got all this intelligence for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And by studying them, humans may learn something about our own
origins, Tyack suggests. ``There is a growing appreciation. . . of
the fascinating similarities in the ways that birds and mammals use
vocal imitation to interact with specific individuals,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``These similarities may provide an important comparative
perspective on how capabilities for imitation evolved in our
hominid ancestors.''

`THE ART OF WAR': SO, THE U.N. HAS THIS ACTION UNIT ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ludicrous, impenetrable and headache-inducing: the newest Wesley
Snipes film, ``The Art of War,'' is all that and more. In
portraying its Chinese villains as devious triple- crossing
schemers who have devised levels of treachery that Americans have
only just begun to understand and adapt for their own purposes, it
is also racist. Oh, those enigmatic Asians! They're so far ahead of
us in fiendishness and, of course, inscrutability.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, this clunky, frenetic action-thriller, directed
by Christian Duguay from a screenplay by Wayne Beach and Simon
Davis Barry, is a wretchedly acted slice of high-decibel nonsense
in which Snipes portrays Shaw, a secret agent of a U.N. covert
action unit.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew that the United Nations, of all institutions, had its
own extremely busy and meddlesome counter-terrorist unit? The
secret leader is none other than the U.N. chief of security,
Eleanor Hooks (Anne Archer), who carries that dreaded postfeminist
stereotype, the ruthless female executive, into new realms of
demonized iciness. The fact that her last name is Hooks, of course,
is a dead giveaway that she's no angel.
</P>
<P>
   The action revolves around mysterious last-minute attempts to
sabotage, through assassination and terror, an about-to-be-ratified
worldwide free-trade agreement with China that Secretary-General
Douglas Thomas (Donald Sutherland) has spent years putting
together. Although the whys and wherefores of the threat remain
murky, be assured they have nothing to do with such political
realities as globalization or China's record on human rights.
Neither issue is broached.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to Hong Kong action-adventure films, ``The Art of War''
has Shaw execute so many impossible leaps from high places that he
practically flies around the movie. ``The Art of War'' is also more
fetishistic than the most toy-stuffed James Bond movie; its
gadgetry tends toward hidden cameras, itsy-bitsy radio
transmitters, and wireless computer devices. But it also has its
standard shock effects, especially tons of shattered glass.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Snipes remains characteristically affectless. No
emotion, not even rage, ruffles his masklike detachment.
Sutherland, looking cadaverous and bleary- eyed, and Archer, grimly
stony-faced, hit new career lows with their wooden line readings of
the screenplay's unreadable dialogue. Normand Corbeil's
relentlessly grating music deserves special mention; it is like
having a jackhammer just outside your window. Chinese water torture
would be preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Art of War'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity,
violence and nudity.

ANALYSIS: AS SUPPORT GROWS, GORE IS IN A POLITICAL GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., N.J., Calif., Mo., Iowa, Wis.)   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore entered a convention hall in Chicago on
Tuesday afternoon to a raucous ovation from union carpenters that
would have been hard to imagine during the many dark days of his
lengthy campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The union members, packed six deep behind rope lines, reached
frantically toward Gore as he high-fived his way through the hall.
At one point, the candidate found himself spread-eagled as he
reached for one hand beyond the rope line on his left and another
beyond the line on his right.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally made it to the lectern, Gore placed his hand
over his heart in what seemed an earnestly emotional gesture and
thanked the laborers for their welcome. ``I felt a little bit like
it was the Super Bowl,'' he said, ``and I was the last player
introduced running through the gantlet of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a new feeling for Gore, whose campaign has struggled to
catch a break through months of misfortune, some of it
self-inflicted, some not. But in the last three weeks, as he has
watched the country and the polls respond approvingly to his
selection of a running mate, to his separation from President
Clinton, to his speech to the Democratic National Convention, and
to a picturesque post-convention cruise down the Mississippi, Gore
is finally in a political groove.
</P>
<P>
   It has clearly made him a better candidate, firmer in his
purpose, confident in his message, comfortable in his skin. And it
has happened not just at an opportune moment, but at a critical
one. If Gore had emerged from the convention without this kind of
lift, not just in the polls but in the energy of his crowds and his
campaign, the race might well have been lost. As it is, if Gore
defeats Gov. George W. Bush in November, historians will
undoubtedly see this period as a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   And voter surveys released Thursday show that Gore is on a roll,
erasing Bush's lead nationwide and receiving good news in several
key states. He has pulled even in Michigan and has increased his
lead in New Jersey and California.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment at least, the transformation has reinforced the
legend of Gore as a political clutch performer. And it has been all
the more striking because it has coincided with a rare moment of
off-message unsteadiness for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After such prolonged adversity for Gore's campaign _ the
scandals involving Monica Lewinsky and campaign fund raising, the
perceived pandering on Elian Gonzalez, the constant tweaking of
message and image, the profligate spending, the bickering at
headquarters _ Democrats and Republicans alike have noticed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster not affiliated with the Gore
campaign, conducted a focus group on Wednesday night in a suburb
outside St. Louis and was amazed by the shifting perceptions of
Gore. The voters interviewed, he said, now see Gore more as a
leader and less as Clinton's subordinate. They understand his
agenda, he said, and can verbalize reasons to vote for Gore, not
simply against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable,'' Hart said. ``Gore's lift off the
convention is much more than a numerical lift. It's a platform and
a platform for him to build upon.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, a Republican strategist and the publisher of
The Weekly Standard, said Gore had benefited immensely from the
transition of the Democratic ticket from Clinton-Gore to
Gore-Lieberman. And he said that Gore had demonstrated boldness by
selecting Sen. Joe Lieberman as his running mate and by using his
convention speech to lay out a forward-looking agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush may actually have to win this campaign now instead of
just watching Gore lose it,'' Kristol said, ``and that's starting
to sink in with some Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, both Hart and Kristol emphasized that such
moments can be transitory, and that Gore could squander his
newfound appeal by returning to the plodding, awkward form of his
not so distant past.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, Gore is having fun. On his riverboat
trip down the Mississippi, he stood atop the upper deck and waved
boyishly to hikers on the distant bluffs. Like Clinton, he has
discovered the joy of wading into crowds and lingering along a rope
line. He grabs pens to sign T-shirts and, at one stop this week, a
cantaloupe. The raspy hoarseness that afflicted him all week made
him sound positively Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, Gore broke a deep freeze with his campaign
press corps by inviting reporters to an off-the-record gathering on
the riverboat. It went so well that he invited the reporters back
for another get-together on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, Gore cannot always excite a crowd purely with
the force of his personality. But Gore can take the energy from a
crowd and make it his own.
</P>
<P>
   His crowds, while not approaching the 25,000 that showed for
Clinton and Gore in St. Louis on their 1992 bus tour, have been
respectable in their size and expressive in their support. In
little Keokuk, Iowa, on Sunday night, some 2,000 people waited in a
park for his arrival at 10:10 p.m., about an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   Those who travel to see him say they find Gore to be
down-to-earth, a trait not always associated with him in the past.
Debbie L. Mundy, a self-employed house cleaner who listened to Gore
in Moline, Ill., last Sunday, said she would vote for him at least
partly because the new prosperity had provided plenty of work for
her husband, a union electrician. But she also said she and others
in the area now viewed Gore as he wants them to _ as his own man
with his own message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have all these people here otherwise,'' she said
at a rally that jammed a downtown street. ``I think everybody's
trying to get in close to get a look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore does, in fact, seem comfortable with his message. He
explains it forcefully, but without the shouting that once seemed
so contrived. The recent prosperity has been great, he says, but
some have been left out, and he will broaden the impact through tax
cuts and new spending aimed at the middle class. The enemy, he
makes it clear, is not big government but selected big industries,
including oil, insurance and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll taken just after the Democratic convention, one
of several that now show Gore with a slight lead, found that 61
percent of those questioned said Gore was articulating what he
wanted to accomplish. In a poll taken two weeks earlier, only 36
percent said so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether his message works or not I don't know,'' said Charles
O. Jones, a retired political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin. ``But at least you can fathom that they have a strategy.
Before they seemed to have been all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor has been Lieberman, the Connecticut senator and a
friend of Gore's for 15 years. He clearly puts the vice president
at ease and his sense of humor encourages Gore to show his own. The
public approval of the selection has given Gore confidence in his
own judgment, and after eight years as second fiddle he seems to
relish sitting in the first chair. The two men plan to campaign
together a lot, often on ``double dates'' with their popular wives.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Gore campaign moves toward Labor Day with the sense
that it is clicking on all cylinders, at least for now. ``This
campaign,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, ``was like a
car where you turn the engine and it almost catches and almost
catches. And then, last week, it finally caught.''

   BEIJING _ One-hundred and thirty evangelical Christians,
including three visiting Americans on a religious mission, were
arrested in central China on Wednesday as they attended a revival,
according to a human rights monitor and the Americans' pastor in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was part of a continuing pattern of arrests, fines and
other harassment of so-called house churches, mainly evangelical
Protestant groups that have quietly spread their faith to tens of
millions of Chinese while refusing to accept the authority of
official religious bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It came one day after a top leader of the government-sponsored
churches told an audience in Los Angeles that religion in China had
entered a ``golden age'' of freer expression.
</P>
<P>
   The detained Chinese are followers of the China Fangcheng
Church, which claims more than 500,000 members and is one of the
largest of many fervent Protestant groups that meet and evangelize
across the country without government approval. Such groups often
receive encouragement and financial aid from like-minded churches
in the United States, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   American evangelicals say the beliefs and practices of the
Fangcheng Church fall well within the Christian tradition. But the
Chinese authorities have labeled it and several other similar
groups as cults and in December sent two Fangcheng leaders to
``re-education through labor'' camps.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it had not
yet confirmed with Chinese officials that three citizens were in
police hands but that it was sending a consular officer to the
area. Under an agreement, China must inform the embassy within 96
hours when an American is detained for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when an American supporter of the outlawed
Falun Gong spiritual group was detained she was quickly deported.
</P>
<P>
   The mass arrests were first reported by the Hong Kong based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. On Thursday, a
police officer in the township where the raid occurred,
Dawangzhuang, in Henan province, confirmed that a large number of
worshipers were being held but would not say where.
</P>
<P>
   Often in such cases, most of those detained are soon released,
but leaders sometimes face stiff fines or imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of the three Americans, all of them Taiwan-born
immigrants, was confirmed Thursday by a pastor of their church, the
Chinese Vineyard Church Fellowship in Los Altos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans _ Henry Chu, 36; his wife, Sandy Lin, 28; and
Patricia Lan, 25 _ traveled to China on Aug. 13 for a two-week
mission in support of China's beleaguered Christians, said the
pastor, who spoke by telephone on condition that his name not be
used.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chu, who has lived in the United States for 15 years, has an
engineering degree and also completed seminary school, the pastor
said, and volunteers much of his time to church work. Lin also
graduated from college and a seminary and is a paid employee of the
Vineyard Church Fellowship. Lan is a third-year seminary student.
</P>
<P>
   All three have made similar trips to China, the pastor said,
adding that his church alone, with some 300 members who are mainly
ethnic Chinese from Asia, annually sends four or five small groups
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign missionary work is illegal in China, though informal
outside aid to churches is sometimes tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fangcheng Church is not a cult,'' the pastor said. ``They
are moderate and sound Christians. ``Its members are very faithful
and fearless, and they want to save everyone for Jesus. That's why
we want to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The government-recognized leaders of China's five approved
religions _ Protestant Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, Islam
and Taoism _ arrived in the United States this week to take part in
a world summit meeting of religious leaders at the United Nations
in early September.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Fu Tieshan, bishop of the
official Chinese-Catholic Church, which does not accept the
authority of the Vatican, said religion in China is entering a
``golden age,'' with the number of believers growing and less
official interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious believers and non-believers respect each other, are
united and have a harmonious relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fu, reflecting the government's concern about the spread of
uncooperative religious groups, also warned that too many of the
people newly attracted to religion are poorly educated, and hence
susceptible to heretical teachings and to cults.
</P>
<P>
   By government estimates, about 4 million people take part in the
official Chinese-Catholic Church, but outside experts say that
another 4 million to 8 million attend so-called underground
Catholic churches, led by priests loyal to the pope, and that they
are sometimes detained or fined.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people attend the official,
non-denominational Protestant Church, but tens of millions more _
no one has good numbers _ are believed to be active in the dynamic
``house church'' movement, named for its informal meeting places.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these unapproved churches do not operate in
secret, and the police may tolerate them if they do not too openly
proselytize. But in some regions, including Henan province,
assertive house church leaders have been harshly suppressed.

BMG AND CLIVE DAVIS START NEW LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a stormy public relations battle over his leadership
succession at Arista Records, Clive Davis has formally fashioned a
deal with BMG Entertainment to head a new label with a roster that
includes up-and-coming young artists and Q-Tip, the rapper.
</P>
<P>
   The new label, which will be called J Records, is a joint
venture between BMG and Davis, who founded Arista in 1975 and was
replaced in July as chief executive by Antonio Reid. That
succession was marked by tensions between BMG's top executives and
Davis, 67, who issued public statements attributing his departure
to the imposition of a general retirement policy by BMG's corporate
parent, Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   That retirement standard applies only to top executives at the
media conglomerate, which required its previous chief executive,
for example, to step down at age 60. But even so, a number of
artists on contract with Arista criticized the corporate power
shift. They said they believed Davis was ousted because of his age
despite a banner year at Arista, which included Carlos Santana's
commercial comeback.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the struggles of the past were not mentioned in the
news release issued by BMG and Davis, who had been talking with
other music companies about starting a label. Davis will be
creating J Records with a team of some familiar faces from Arista
including Charles Goldstuck, former executive vice president and
general manager at Arista.
</P>
<P>
   The first recordings from the company are expected as early as
this October. One person close to the negotiations said that J
Records' new roster will feature Deborah Cox, LFO, Shannon Curfman,
Alicia Keys, Jim Cozier and O-Town, a boy band that is the subject
of a television series.

<P>
   The final episode of the CBS series ``Survivor'' reached an
audience of more than 50 million viewers Wednesday night, eclipsing
every show of any kind on television in the last year except the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour double episode of ``Survivor,'' which reduced four
finalists to a single winner, Richard Hatch, beat every episode of
series television over the last year, including ``ER'' the biggest
regular-season hit on the networks, and even topped last April's
broadcast of the Academy Awards, which in every other season is
second in audience only to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The finale even beat every night of Olympic broadcasts over the
last three Olympiads. It was, CBS said, the 11th most-watched
episode of a series in the history of television.
</P>
<P>
   Just as impressive for CBS, a network with a reputation for
rarely reaching the young adult viewers most advertisers prefer,
``Survivor'' was strongest among viewers between 18 and 34 years
old. The finale reached more than 60 percent of the viewers in that
age group tuned in to television from 8 to 10 p.m. Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The success sets CBS up for some enormous payoffs, starting with
the second edition of ``Survivor'' set to start in January, which
CBS' top sales executive, Joseph Abruzzese, predicted would attract
the highest per-commercial price of any series on television in the
coming season. ``Survivor II'' will begin the night of Jan. 30,
immediately after the Super Bowl, which CBS will broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that's going to be the most profitable night in the
history of television,'' said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS
Television.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl always attracts the highest prices for
commercials every television season, but the game comes with an
expensive fee of hundreds of millions of dollars for rights from
the NFL. ``Survivor'' has a budget of less than $1 million an
episode and CBS owns the show with its executive producer Mark
Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Survivor II'' following the Super Bowl, CBS expects to
charge record prices for advertising for the entire evening. David
F. Poltrack, executive vice president for research at CBS, even
suggested that having ``Survivor II'' follow the game ensured that
viewers would stay tuned even if the game became lopsided. ``We may
have found the only programming with the potential to actually
benefit the Super Bowl,'' Poltrack said.
</P>
<P>
   Abruzzese said that advertisers, who had traditionally used the
Super Bowl to introduce products and ad campaigns, were already
talking about extending that strategy into the first new episode of
`'Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The network is also predicting a ``Survivor'' bounce for its new
lineup of fall prime-time series, all of which were heavily
promoted during the 13-week run of ``Survivor.'' Poltrack said that
CBS' tracking studies showed that the new CBS shows were far ahead
of any upcoming show on any other network in terms of audience
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves declined to predict that CBS could become the leading
network in prime time in the next year, but he did say, ``I think
we're going to make it a very interesting season.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other statistics racked up by ``Survivor'' were a total
audience _ viewers who watched some portion of the show Wednesday
night _ of 72 million. The average audience figure for the entire
telecast was 51.7 million. It was by far the most-watched network
broadcast in the summer since Nielsen Media Research initiated its
People Meter Rating System in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The entire 13-episode run of the series was an extraordinary
success. It averaged a 17 rating and 30 percent share of the
audience. That would have ranked the show second among all series
in television's regular season, behind only ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Poltrack pointed out that ``Survivor'' undoubtedly had more
viewers than officially counted. ``About 20 percent of the people
in America are on vacation in the months of June, July, and August.
Those people were surely watching in motels and hotels but they
weren't being counted.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS saw some additional immediate advantages from its enormous
night. The CBS local station in New York, WCBS, saw its late news
ratings soar by almost 200 percent. The network's late night star
David Letterman brought on the 16 ``Survivor'' contestants for a
Top 10 list _ featuring Hatch going naked _ and scored his
third-highest rating this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves also said CBS hoped to begin cashing in on an extensive
merchandising effort, selling ``Survivor''-related products,
everything from hats and T-shirts to camping equipment. The network
has already released an e-book and will soon release a conventional
book based on the show, along with a board game from Mattel and CD
of music from the show.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cast members have also made deals for themselves but
Hatch is obviously in the best position. In a telephone interview
Thursday he declined to discuss what deals he had made, though he
acknowledged that he was considering writing his own book.
</P>
<P>
   The other biggest winner from the show's spectacular success is
the producer, Burnett. Moonves said Thursday that the ownership
deal on the show was ``extremely complicated,'' but that Burnett
was entitled to a portion of the advertising revenue from
`Survivor,'' both for this edition and future ones.
</P>
<P>
   Abruzzese said that Burnett helped sell the show to the list of
nine sponsors who signed on before it began, including Reebok
shoes, Budweiser Beer, Target stores and Ericsson phones. ``They
got one of the best deals ever, tremendous bang for their buck,''
Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the show became a hit, CBS began selling an additional
minute of advertising in the show each week, mainly to movie
companies. CBS extended the finale from one hour to two hours and
had the whole second hour to sell at new prices, which reached as
high as $600,000 for a 30-second commercial. The network also sold
the hourlong discussion show that followed at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett shared in all that new advertising revenue. ``He got
half and we got half,'' Abruzzese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Burnett is definitely becoming a very wealthy man,''
Moonves said.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: A REALITY-TELEVISION CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If George W. Bush were a ``Survivor'' contestant, he would have
been Kelly, who made it to the finals with her ability to recall
the details of her former teammates' family histories.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the man can run into somebody he met 15 years ago for
five minutes in a hotel lobby and you'd have thought they roomed
together at prep school. This may not be the most important talent
in the universe, but it's surprisingly rare in the male of the
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what your wife's name is. Isn't that
interesting?'' exclaimed Richard, the eventual ``Survivor'' winner,
to another contestant with whom he had spent 39 long, intense and
occasionally naked days.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Richard went home with the $1 million has caused
many Americans to question the existence of a benevolent deity, and
we will not be so cruel as to suggest that if Al Gore had been on
the island, he would have been Richard. But Gore did tell the
Democratic convention that he was not concerned about being
lovable. This came after four days of continuous effort to convince
the nation that the vice president was adorable as all get-out, and
was therefore a very Richard thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Many people seem to feel they have gotten a real education in
the downside of the human character from ``Survivor.'' The show
didn't have an equivalent to Nick Bateman, the archvillain of the
British version of ``Big Brother,'' who attempted to win the
support of his fellow contestants by telling them that his
nonexistent wife had been tragically killed in a car crash. The
tabloid press urged that helicopters be used to drop leaflets
warning the housebound competitors about the viper in their midst.
When ``Nasty Nick'' was evicted for cheating last week, The Sun,
which had led the campaign against him, swiftly hired him as a
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. The subject at hand is whether the ``Survivor''
mania can teach us any lessons about the current presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   There were some similarities. The ``Survivor'' finale went on
way too long, much like this political season, which seems to
stretch back to the Battle of Hastings. The ``Survivor'' jurors all
wound up protesting that they hated both the candidates and didn't
want to vote for anybody, which certainly sounds familiar.
</P>
<P>
   And weirdly, as the show wound down, the contestants began
talking a little like Bush. The people on the island had the
advantage of some careful editing, but you still couldn't help
noting that a lot of them tended to rush verbally forward,
stringing words together without much concern for where the trail
was taking them. (One convoluted rationale by a Richard supporter
concluded with the announcement that ``Kelly was more
double-faced.'')
</P>
<P>
   Like Kelly, Bush has had a not-great week. Gore is rising in the
polls. There's a growing suspicion that the public is never going
to embrace the $1.3 trillion tax cut that sits like a great wart in
the middle of the Bush agenda. And on Monday, the candidate
delivered a speech that connoisseurs of Bushian malapropisms
regarded as a four-star keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation
hostile or hold our allies hostile,'' he told an Iowa fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised to ``work to end terrors _ tariffs and
barriers,'' and to bring an end to ``four years of Clinton-Gore.''
His attempts to defend the tax cut were marred by an unfortunate
tendency to mix up billions and trillions. As a finale, Bush
assured the audience that victory was theirs because ``we're
talking about issues in a way the American people can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after vowing to do a better job of explaining the tax cut
to average voters, he proceeded to give a disquisition that even
the above-average national correspondents on his press plane found
bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Tired politicians always tend to mess up their syntax.
Unfortunately, Bush's Iowa speech came after he had taken a day off
the trail to return to Austin, for a schedule in which the word
``nap'' figured prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bush can turn all this to his advantage. The babbling
thing seems to be spreading, and Americans may prefer a president
who would not look down on them if they forgot to insert verbs in
their sentences. They might conclude that at least he's not, you
know, like, double-faced.

   ANCHORAGE. Alaska _ On a visit Wednesday to the state where his
legacy is larger than that of anyone since the man who bought
Alaska from Russia for 2 cents an acre, former President Jimmy
Carter again had to pass through a knot of people shouting his name
and waving placards in his face.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of burning Carter in effigy and shouting obscenities
as Alaskans have done in past visits, the crowds that greeted him
in the twilight of summer hailed Carter as a hero and visionary for
what has been called the greatest conservation act in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, just weeks before handing the presidency to
Ronald Reagan, Carter signed a bill that protected an area of
Alaska equal in size to California. The Alaska National Interest
Lands Conservation Act declared 104 million acres as national
parks, wildlife refuges and wilderness. It more than doubled the
acreage in the national park system and tripled the amount of
public land that cannot be developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lands Act, which Alaska's political and business elite saw
as a betrayal of the state and a blueprint for economic ruin, has
helped to spur a $1 billion annual tourist economy.
</P>
<P>
   Carter used his triumphant return to Alaska this week to urge
President Clinton to settle an issue left unresolved when the act
was passed: whether to allow oil and gas development in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is a summer range for more
than 100,000 caribou and untold numbers of birds, but it also holds
what is believed to be the biggest untapped oil fields in the
nation, perhaps as much as 10 billion barrels, which would be
second only to the output now flowing from Alaska's North Slope.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Carter called on Clinton to declare the
refuge a national monument, an act that would infuriate many
Alaskans because it would almost certainly prevent development. The
president does not plan to declare the area a monument, his aides
said Thursday, but they did not rule out the possibility that he
might change his mind during the waning days of his presidency,
especially if Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   For the business interests that have never gotten over the
passage of the Lands Act, the prospect of new protections is
unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what Alaskans fear the most,'' said Carl Portman,
deputy director of the Resource Development Council, which
represents major businesses in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what to do with the Arctic refuge, which has
been largely overlooked outside of Alaska, could be the biggest
environmental decision by the next president. Bush favors opening
the refuge to oil and gas development, while Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic nominee, says it should be protected, although
he has not come out for designating it as a monument.
</P>
<P>
   History has been kind to Carter's act, the former president said
this week, and some prominent Republicans in this state grudgingly
agreed with him. In December 1980, a month after he was voted out
of office, Carter signed a bill that had been fought over, in one
version or another, since Alaska was made a state in 1959. It has
been called the biggest zoning act in history, designating 10 new
units to the National Park system and protecting nearly a third of
the state from development. Carter ranks it among the biggest
achievements of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, it looked like Carter would never be able to
set foot in this state. At the Alaska State Fair, he recalled, he
was a bigger villain than the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, as
people lined up to throw bottles at his image. Just months after
Carter left office, he stopped in Anchorage on his way to Tokyo,
and the Secret Service urged him not to leave the air base for fear
of what angry Alaskans might do to him.
</P>
<P>
   One National Park Service plane was burned at Wrangell-St.
Elias, the biggest national park in the nation, and the cables were
cut on another plane. The governor of Alaska at the time, Jay
Hammond, a Republican, said he would sue to stop the act, calling
it a ``de facto repeal of statehood.'' Alaska's Congressional
delegation vowed to undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of predictions were made that Alaska would go to hell if
this much land was taken away from gas and oil development,''
Carter said in a speech here Wednesday before 600 people that drew
five standing ovations. ``But Alaskans have done well. Tourists
come here to find a solitude, a beauty, sites that are not
available to a Georgian or someone from Ohio or Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has become one of Carter's favorite places. He has heard
the thunder of caribou herds as they migrate out of the Arctic
Slope, he has seen a brown bear up close, and he has caught a
31-inch rainbow trout on a very small fly. This week he planned to
fish at Lake Clark National Park, one of the parks created by the
Lands Act.
</P>
<P>
   More than three million tourists a year visit the new parks,
refuges and monuments created by Carter. In Seward, the town named
for Secretary of State William Seward, who bought Alaska for $7.2
million in 1867, a multimillion-dollar industry has developed
around ships that take visitors to the bird rookeries and glaciers
of Kenai Fjords National Park. The town rescinded a 20-year-old
resolution opposing Carter's action.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, the former governor, has also had a change of heart.
Seated at the dais with Carter on Wednesday, he said most Alaskans
now favored the act for which Carter was so vilified.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Alaska's Congressional and business leaders no
longer talk of overturning the Lands Act, they say it has blocked
access to many areas and stifled needed development in rural
communities. Many people want snowmobiles, new roads and airstrips
in the parks and monuments. They say small-time miners, the
archetypal sourdoughs of Alaska, have been shut out of the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's critics believe the interests of Alaska were overlooked
by a leader far removed from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
opposed the act 20 years ago and still says it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Thom, a spokesman for Rep. Don Young, a Republican who has
been Alaska's Congressional representative for more than 20 years,
said, ``Signing the act was one of the darkest days in Alaska
history, a travesty of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Alaska's congressional leaders were at the anniversary
luncheon for Carter on Wednesday, nor was Gov. Tony Knowles, a
Democrat. But for the overflow crowd, it was a celebration that had
a ``told you so'' air to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember what Morris Udall, the congressman most responsible
for the act, said when he came back to Alaska in the mid-'80s,''
Deborah L. Williams, executive director of the Alaska Conservation
Foundation, said at the celebration. ``He said, `Just like in the
'70s, everyone waves at me, but this time all five fingers are
extended.'''

TREASURIES FLAT AS ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices were flat Thursday after the government
reported a larger-than-expected drop in orders for durable goods in
July, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will hold off raising
interest rates again this year.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note rose 1/32, to
105 9/32, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, fell to 5.71 percent from 5.72 percent on Wednesday. The
30-year bond rose 8/32, to 108 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.66
percent from 5.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 12.4 percent plunge in durable goods orders last month was
the largest on record and surpassed economists' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber, said the
``orders data are consistent with our forecast for GDP growth to
slow in the third quarter to 3.3 percent at an annual rate after
5.2 percent growth in the second quarter.'' He said the numbers
were consistent with forecasts that the Federal Open Market
Committee, which next meets on Oct. 3, would keep interest rates
static indefinitely. ``Nevertheless, one should not overreact to
the weakness in these numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset
Management, said, ``Signs of a moderating economy, coupled with
faster productivity growth that is helping to suppress inflationary
tendencies, has given the Fed some breathing room in its quest to
maneuver the economy into a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore,'' Fine said, ``the proximity of the presidential
election makes it highly unlikely that any change in policy would
be instituted at the Oct. 3 FOMC meeting. Thus, if the Fed should
deem additional tightening necessary, a clearly debatable point
both inside and outside the FOMC, the Nov. 15 meeting would appear
to be the earliest conceivable date for further action.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed is still very sensitive to the potential for
inflation in a vibrant economy with a 4 percent unemployment rate,
Fine said, the Fed will not raise interest rates for a while unless
economic growth picks up or inflationary pressures become
threatening, or both. He says neither appears imminent.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed expected to adhere to an unchanged monetary policy,
bonds are likely to trade in a range, Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at the J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca
Raton, Fla., also saw the bond market's lack of reaction to
Thursday's data as a sign that it was trading well ahead of itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this economic slowdown is not as strong as what
Treasury rates are telling us,'' he said. ``You just can't put a
pen to paper to justify the current rates.''

COLUMN: WILL DECIMALIZATION DECIMATE PROFITS? 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A quarter century ago, the old order passed on Wall
Street. A new system forced price competition where there had been
none, and that soon changed the financial landscape in ways no one
had expected. Something very similar will begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   The change on May Day 1975 was the end of fixed commissions.
Suddenly, brokerage firms could seek business by offering to charge
less on stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   Commissions on institutional orders collapsed far faster than
Wall Street expected. Some brokerage firms were forced out of
business. Discount brokers appeared, and big blocks of stock traded
as never before.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange will begin trading a total of 13 stocks in dollars and
cents, rather than using fractions. Sometime next year, all stocks
will be traded that way.
</P>
<P>
   That change, in itself, is unimportant. Whether a price is
quoted as a quarter or as 25 cents is irrelevant. What is important
is that arbitrary limits on price competition are vanishing. In
1997, the smallest change in price on the Big Board was cut in
half, to one-sixteenth of a dollar, or 6.25 cents. Now it will go
to a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street hopes that will bring a gradual reduction in
spreads, the difference between the best price offered to buy a
stock and the best price offered to sell it. Bernard L. Madoff, the
chairman of a firm that bears his name, says that for the largest
600 stocks, the spread now averages 10 cents a share. He thinks
that will come down to a range of 5 cents to 7 cents and forecasts
that additional volume will preserve brokerage firms' profits.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Wall Street, these changes have a way of
arriving at inopportune times. In 1975, the market had just ended a
severe bear market, and the public had lost interest in stocks. So,
Wall Street was confronted with shrinking profit margins when it
could least afford them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, profits are high. But the Internet has opened up new ways
to trade stocks and set off intense competition among different
markets. That competition makes it likely that spreads _ at least
for the most active stocks _ will sink more than many brokerage
firms would like. The options markets, where competition is less
cutthroat, have adopted rules to limit price changes to a nickel on
many options and a dime on others. But efforts to arrange such
civilized competition among stock markets fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts will continue, and the Securities and Exchange
Commission will have to watch closely to make sure that rules do
not inhibit price competition. But if the SEC is vigilant, the
world will change. Michael LaBranche, the chief executive of
LaBranche &AMP; Co., a leading Big Board specialist firm, forecasts
that exchanges and market makers that pay brokerage firms for
sending orders to them will have to pay less. That will put
pressures on profits of Internet brokers that charge low
commissions and make their money from such payments.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street fears that a surge in message traffic will strain
computer systems. But once the computer power is in place, trading
methods will change. The role of limit orders _ in which an
investor sets the price at which he or she will trade _ could
expand since it will almost always be possible to seek a price
between the posted prices.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be immediate, in part because the stocks that
go decimal next week are not among the most active ones. But big
changes will come, and the Wall Street that emerges will be very
different from the current one.

ALBUM OF THE WEEK: `LEARNING HOW TO SMILE '
</HEADLINE>
   By JON   PARELES  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERCLEAR: ``Songs From an American Movie, Volume One: Learning
How to Smile'' (Capitol).
</P>
<P>
   What are memories for? Art P. Alexakis of Everclear ponders that
question on ``Songs From an American Movie, Volume 1.'' Alexakis,
38, isn't afraid to admit he has a long past, and he seesaws
between weighing what he has done and trying to forget it. In the
album's single, ``AM Radio,'' he borrows the strutting riff from
Jean Knight's `` Big Stuff'' to rap-sing fond reminiscences of the
1970s. But in ``Here We Go Again,'' he fends off a new girlfriend's
questions, saying, ``I do not want you to know me the way I used to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs'' is a post-divorce album. Alexakis observes the
collapsing marriage, hurls his final barbs and worries about the
effects on the child. He pins his hopes on a new love, vowing not
to make the old mistakes. With ``Unemployed Boyfriend,'' he comes
up with the perfect modern come-on.
</P>
<P>
   The album started as a solo project for Alexakis, and it moves
away from Everclear's usual punky, guitar-charged rock toward
AM-radio music he remembers: country-rock, the Beach Boys, the
string-laden pop of Electric Light Orchestra. Despite some overdone
moments, like the remake of Van Morrison's ``Brown-Eyed Girl,''
most of the album turns Alexakis' ups and downs into tuneful,
broad-shouldered rock.  &QL;

TEST GAP WIDENS BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich., Pa.)   By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gap between test scores of black and white students that had
narrowed through the 1980s widened from 1990 to 1999, according to
results released Thursday by the federal Department of Education,
with the average black 17-year-old reading only about as well as
the average white 13-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Most perplexing, officials said, is that the gap is widest among
children of the best-educated parents, where average scores by
white students remained relatively steady while those of blacks
fell back toward the lower achievement of the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That data suggest that what was once considered an urban
problem, the consequence of poverty and disadvantage, has become a
suburban problem, too, one that may result from lower expectations
by teachers, a lower number of black students taking tougher
courses, or different attitudes about education among black
students.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and officials say there is no clear explanation for
why progress slipped after the gains of the 1980s in the next
decade of remarkable prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a depressing reversal of the gains made over the past
two decades,'' said Michael T. Nettles, vice chairman of the
National Assessment Governing Board, which monitors results of the
test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress. ``The
alarming part is that since 1992, the gaps have been getting
wider.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are still gaps between white and Hispanic students,
those continued to narrow over the past few years, the test results
show.
</P>
<P>
   And while blacks are catching up to whites in performance of the
basic skills, showing an ability to do simple arithmetic, for
example, they are slipping further behind whites when asked to do
more complicated work, like fractions, percentages or decimals.
This, officials said Thursday, suggests that efforts by states like
Texas to make sure more students know the basics before they
graduate from high school have paid off. The challenge now, they
say, is for states to demand even higher levels of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we take action to address the gap, then we should
expect it's going to continue in this direction,'' said Nettles, a
professor of education and public policy at the University of
Michigan. ``What we've learned from this trend report is that when
we take action, we get results.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests are given every few years, in different intervals,
depending on subject, to samplings of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds.
While other versions of the national tests have changed to reflect
changing curriculums, this test, known as the long-term trend test,
has stayed essentially the same over the 30 years it has been
administered to about 16,000 students around the country. It is
considered the most reliable and unbiased survey of U.S. students'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The overall results revealed some positive signs. Girls, in
particular, have made striking gains in math and science, and math
scores overall have improved consistently from the 1970s through
1999. But reading scores remained flat or dropped. And science
scores of 17-year-olds were lower in 1999 than they were when the
test was first given in 1969.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley and other officials emphasized
Thursday that blacks had made progress since the tests were first
given. In almost every subject at every age level, the average
scores of black were higher than they were in the late 1960s or
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, they said, is a new pattern of slipping. Among
9-year-olds in science, for example, the gap in scores between
blacks and whites narrowed to 41 points in 1999 from 57 points in
1970. But that 41 points is up from 37 points in 1996. Among nine
indicators _ three age groups in three subjects _ the gap has
widened in seven since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it has slipped back to where it was in the early
1970s. Among 17-year-olds, for instance, the gap in science scores
widened to 52 points in 1999 from 47 points in 1996, almost back to
the 54-point difference noted in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has grown most strikingly in ranks of children of the
better-educated parents.
</P>
<P>
   In reading scores of 17-year-olds in 1971, there was a 44-point
difference between whites and blacks whose parents had gone beyond
high school. That narrowed to 27 points in 1990, but then grew
again to 36 points in 1999. While the average white score remained
relatively stable, the average black score rose to 279 in 1990 from
261 in 1971 and then slipped back to 268 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said Thursday that the gap was not a reflection of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can say with total confidence is this is not an IQ
story,'' said Abigal Thernstrom, author, with her husband, Stephan,
of ``America in Black and White'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997) as well
as a forthcoming book on the test gap. ``Black IQ scores haven't
gone down, and we are seeing too many success stories. This is a
story about schooling. You look at places that really are doing a
great job with highly disadvantaged urban kids _ and they exist all
over this country _ and you know it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great
City Schools, a coalition of about 60 school districts, said that
cities where the gap had narrowed significantly, like Houston and
Philadelphia, offer preschool to all children, successful
after-school programs, smaller class sizes and require students to
take rigorous courses.

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those cute, modest British comedy-dramas of manners can be
tricky propositions. When they work _ as did ``The Full Monty'' _
they manage both rousing crowd-pleasing scenes and moments of
genuine reflection. But when they fall off the table in terms of
twee preciousness _ say, ``Waking Ned Divine'' _ you kind of just
want to cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last of the Blonde Bombshells'' falls somewhere in between
_ it's not so silly as to be distasteful, but neither is it
particularly involving. Dame Judi Dench stars as Elizabeth, who as
the film opens is attending her husband's funeral. He wasn't a bad
man, just a terribly humdrum one, apparently, and his death gets
her to reflecting upon her squandered life, particularly before she
got married, when she was the star saxophonist in a World War
II-era all-girl band, the Blonde Bombshells.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Elizabeth decides to round up her colleagues for one
more performance _ at, of all things, a dance at her
granddaughter's high school (following a punk band _ hmm, does this
scan for you?). Turns out that one of the all-girl players was in
fact a boy, Patrick (Ian Holm), who prods her along in her unlikely
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   So we get both the requisite getting-the-band-together cliches
(will the holdouts return?) and the band's-lousy-at-practice
cliches until the fateful moment, which there's no point in ruining
for you if you haven't guessed it already. That Patrick turns out
to be a Lothario from way back isn't given much of a surprising
spin, either.
</P>
<P>
   Dench, as usual, imbues her character with a real sense of
mischief and keeps the proceedings moderately engaging _ she
singlehandedly prevents the film from being DOA _ while the
normally reliable Holm just seems to be going through the motions.
The rest of the cast isn't given enough screen time to make much of
an impression, which is a real shame, given that it includes Leslie
Caron and Cleo Laine (Olympia Dukakis has a brief, loud role).
These ``Bombshells'' could use a little more pop. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``The Last of the Blonde Bombshells.'' &QL; 
What: Dramedy about the reunion of a World War II-era all-girl
band. &QL; 
The stars: Judi Dench, Ian Holm, Leslie Caron, Cleo Laine, Olympia
Dukakis. &QL;

THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST
</HEADLINE>
  Singer Williams seems to have appeared from a gentler time 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients after Aug. 27, 2000) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eclectic folk-pop singer Victoria Williams is an astute observer
of the human condition and the music world, but even she wasn't
ready for her manager's reaction when she turned in an album of
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `The label doesn't want an album of standards.
They want your songs,''' the easygoing Williams recalled the other
day. ``So, I just went ahead and recorded some of my own songs on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' just-issued third studio album for Atlantic, ``Water
to Drink,'' contains lush covers of ``Until the Real Thing Comes
Along,'' ``Young at Heart'' and the Antonio Carlos Jobim-penned
title track along with typically idiosyncratic originals.
</P>
<P>
   The album was recorded primarily in Williams' newly built home
studio in hot, arid Joshua Tree, surrounded by her dogs, burros,
chickens and expanding orchard.
</P>
<P>
   The new effort follows a trio of self-released albums from the
Harmony Creek Dippers, a side project featuring Williams and her
husband, ex-Jayhawks member Mark Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I walk outside, the hummingbirds stop in midair, look me in
the eye and say, 'Thank you for planting all this fruit,'''
Williams said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   A characteristic observation. After all, Williams' most
oft-quoted lyric from her 1987 debut album, ``Happy Come Home,''
advised listeners that ``every day is poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Her frequent musings on life, love and death saw Williams
venerated by a crop of peers including Lucinda Williams, Lou Reed
and members of Pearl Jam.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Williams was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in
1992 while on the road opening for Neil Young, some of those
friends rallied to help her pay medical bills by recording the
tribute album ``Sweet Relief: A Benefit for Victoria Williams,''
featuring Reed, Pearl Jam, Garbage, R.E.M., Smashing Pumpkins,
Matthew Sweet, the Jayhawks, Live and Soul Asylum. It far outsold
any of Williams' own albums.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 41-year-old Williams has good and bad days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of energy when it's hot,'' she said. ``So
I'll jump in the pool. There's a dry heat that coaxes me into
sitting there. I'm OK. I've grown used to it. I have to take this
shot everyday. Mark is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   From her earliest days in Louisiana to her dues-paying,
club-playing days in Los Angeles, Williams won the attention of
everyone who saw her perform. It wasn't just the stirring
musicianship but the refreshing, compassionate attitude and quirky
sensibility of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s Peter Buck once said that ``Victoria inspired me to
stay in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 1993's ``Sweet Relief'' helped make Williams
better-known, she remains perhaps a bit too distinctive for the
mainstream (even though her cover of the standard ``What a
Wonderful World'' graced a Microsoft commercial). Boasting an
unusual high-pitched (almost shrill) voice and that unique poetic
bent, she draws from a wide range of influences _ gospel, country,
folk, acid-rock, jazz and pop _ to create work that's highly
personal.
</P>
<P>
   One of her most enchanting collections is 1994's ``Loose,''
which glows with good feelings and love.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Williams _ who plans local dates this fall _ seems
like she's from a different, far gentler time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have lost their attention span and they're overwhelmed
with music these days,'' she mused. ``They have attention deficit
disorder from TV and being able to change the entire world by
changing the channel. A hundred years ago that would have been a
strange fascination. I mean, radio was a strange fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been 100 years. I don't know with the computer _ www
this and www that. I get on that computer and when I try to look up
one of these Web sites or something, it's just frustrating. It'll
keep you there for so long. Check out this and check out that,
sitting at this little screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Williams said, the reaction she got when she turned in
the tapes to ``Water to Drink'' didn't compare to the response to
her original idea for the album's cover and title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to call it `Fixin' to Spit,''' she said. ``See, the
original cover shot was my feet. But the guy in charge of putting
it out said, 'We don't want to see your feet on the cover. We want
to see you.' So I said any picture was OK with me. But they
couldn't deal with my original title. They said, `We're not gonna
call your record `Fixin' to Spit.' No matter what.''' &QL;

Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Witchblade'' is obviously based on a comic book, but it's hard
at times to tell which one. It's about a tough-babe cop who, thanks
to some mystical mumbo-jumbo, gets this goofy-looking metal arm
that deflects bullets just like Wonder Woman's wristbands and pops
out villain-skewering daggers similar to the knuckle-bound cutlery
of the X-Men's Wolverine.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Pezzini (Yancy Butler, who takes this role more
staggeringly seriously than anyone could ever imagine) is haunted
by memories of a dead-dad cop and an iced estranged pal.
Surrounding her are a partner (William Yun Lee), who's around just
long enough to mention the wife and kids before the inevitable
happens; a moony, hunky cop (David Chokachi) who takes time from
his Tommy Hilfiger photo shoots to provide snippets of exposition;
and a zealously murderous evil genius (Conrad Dunn) of the sort
that exist only in really stupid movies.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a couple of mysterious figures who disappear
whenever there's a convenient break in the editing _ and, given
Norman Buckley's MTV-on-speed cutting and ``Matrix''-on-a-budget
visual effects, that's fairly often _ who are tied in some fashion
to an ethereal goofball named Irons (Anthony Cistaro). Irons
studies up on this sort of thing so he can tell Sara, ``The
Witchblade has a way of slipping from its wearer's grasp just when
it is needed most'' _ kind of like common sense in this movie. It
gets worse _ the gizmo is ``a mystery wrapped in a riddle and
cloaked in a conundrum.'' Even though this is clearly designed to
spin off into an equally dumb TV series, Irons sums it up for us
when he says, ``You've disappointed me, Sara.''
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL;

HASKELL, TRAVERS COULD PRODUCE CHAMPION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to selecting a champion 3-year-old colt at the end
of the year, summertime races such as the Haskell Invitational and
the Travers Stakes don't mean much.
</P>
<P>
   At least that has been the case each of the past three years in
thoroughbred racing. Since 1997, horses that haven't even competed
in the Haskell, Travers and Breeders' Cup Classic have been
selected the champion 3-year-old colt.
</P>
<P>
   The list of those horses that have won the races, but lost the
championship, isn't bad. Touch Gold won the Haskell _ he even won
the Belmont Stakes _ but he missed being 3-year-old champion in
1997. Coronado's Quest won more big stakes races than any
3-year-old in '98 _ including the Haskell and the Travers _ yet he
was no champ. And Lemon Drop Kid won the Travers last year, then
Cat Thief was the Breeders' Cup Classic winner, and both of those
horses got little mention when it came time to pick a champion.
</P>
<P>
   If those horses didn't stand out, there is something that stood
out about each of those seasons. There was a 3-year-old that pulled
the Kentucky Derby-Preakness Stakes double and almost won the
Triple Crown in the Belmont: Silver Charm in '97, Real Quiet in '98
and Charismatic last year. All were selected champion even if they
took the rest of the year off.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus hasn't raced since
the Preakness, though trainer Neil Drysdale smugly suggests that he
will in the fall. And Preakness winner Red Bullet is out for the
year because an X-ray revealed the start of a crack in his left
front cannon bone.
</P>
<P>
   So, maybe it's time for the spotlight to fall back upon the
Haskell and the Travers. If that's the case, it could be the start
of a championship run for Dixie Union. The colt is co-owned by
Gerald J. Ford of Dallas, whose name adorns the new SMU football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union already has won the Haskell, and he'll be the
favorite in the Travers because Arkansas Derby winner and Jim Dandy
Stakes winner Graeme Hall will miss the race because of an injured
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Just going on his Haskell victory, Dixie Union is special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had every right not to run well in that race,''
trainer Richard Mandella said. ``He got pinched going into the
backstretch. He came close to clipping heels. He lost three lengths
within a jump.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Dixie Union finished fifth in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile last year and had to miss the Triple Crown because a bone
chip had to be removed from a knee. Before the injury, Dixie Union
won four of five races and defeated the likes of Exchange Rate,
High Yield, Captain Steve and eventual Breeders' Cup Juvenile
winner Anees.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he can pull off the Haskell-Travers double, Dixie Union
will have to do something special later this year. After
second-place finishes in the Preakness and Belmont in '96, Skip
Away won the Haskell and finished third in the Travers. Then his
special moment came: He beat Cigar in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, and
he was chosen champion 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   If Dixie Union can't find his special moment in the weeks after
the Travers, the champion 3-year-old will be Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   LATE SCRATCHES REMATCH, AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Heritage of Gold has jumped to the top of the older female ranks
by virtue of her two victories this year against defending champion
Beautiful Pleasure. But she'll be tested again Friday, because both
horses are entered in the Grade I $400,000 Personal Ensign Handicap
at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 11/4-mile race, and both horses carry equal weights and
have to spot 11 to 12 pounds to the other three horses in the race.
But trainer Tom Amoss is confident after Heritage of Gold erased a
seven-length deficit to beat Beautiful Pleasure by a length in the
Grade I Go For Wand last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was more relaxed and more professional last time out than
she's ever been,'' Amoss said.
</P>
<P>
   GOLD NUGGET RESTS
</P>
<P>
   After finishing third at odds of 30-to-1 in the Grade I Eddie
Read Handicap on July 30 at Del Mar, the next start for Gold Nugget
is up in the air. According to owner Leland Cook, Gold Nugget was
lined up for the Fourstardave Handicap _ with Pat Day getting the
riding assignment _ Saturday at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't come out of his last workout Sunday on his toes
like he did before the trip to Del Mar,'' Cook said. ``So, we're
going to pass for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming starts for Gold Nugget, champion turf horse at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie this year, could be either the Grade III
Bay Meadows Handicap on Sept. 23 at Bay Meadows, the $50,000 Sport
City Handicap on Sept. 4 at Louisiana Downs or the $100,000 Texas
Hall of Fame Stakes on Oct. 7 at Retama Park.
</P>
<P>
   LONE STAR SALE
</P>
<P>
   The Fasig-Tipton Texas Summer Yearling Sale is offering 400
horses at its auction Monday and Tuesday. The start time is noon
each day at the sales pavilion at Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   Among the horses scheduled for auction are siblings to these
horses: former TTA Futurity winners I'm Allthat and Louetta;
Middleground Stakes winner Superpave; Independence Handicap winner
Jest In Orbit; and Grade III Round Table Handicap winner Slew O
Mink.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON: BOB BAFFERT
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert's jokes sometimes fall short. In fact, the more he
forces them, the more they fall short. And he forces them with
increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert trains General Challenge and River Keen, who both are
entered in Saturday's $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar
(televised 5:30-6:30 p.m., TVG). So, Baffert's chance to crack a
joke came at the post position draw.
</P>
<P>
   When Baffert was informed by a television reporter that River
Keen and General Challenge had drawn the two inside post positions,
Baffert joked that the draw had been fixed because people were
conspiring against him.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had no quick reply when the reporter asked him how there
could be a fix against his horses when John Mabee, who owns General
Challenge, is the longtime chairman at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Post position is unlikely to make much difference in a race with
the distance of 11/4 miles and only seven horses in the starting
gate. Baffert finally admitted it later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to have my two horses together,'' Baffert said. ``But
we're just happy to be in the race and that the horses are doing
well. That's more important than post position in a mile and a
quarter race.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge is the 9-to-5 favorite. River Keen is 15-1.
The rest of the field from the inside post out is Euchre (8-1),
Tiznow (5-1), Skimming (5-2), Ecton Park (7-2) and Forty One Carats
(12-1).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVERS TOPS PACIFIC CLASSIC
</P>
<P>
   Both the Travers Stakes in New York and the Pacific Classic in
California offer purses of $1 million and will be contested
Saturday. The Travers (ESPN, 3-4:30 p.m.) is restricted to
3-year-olds and the Pacific Classic is open to horses 3 years old
and older. It would make sense that the Pacific Classic would
produce horses that would be more successful later in the year in
the Breeders' Cup Classic, but the statistics don't support that
notion:
</P>
<P>
   {Travers Pacific Classic} Number of horses to the Breeders' Cup
Classic 179 153 Average finish in Breeders' Cup Classic 5th 6th
Best finish in Breeders' Cup Classic 1st 2nd {Note:} Concern (1994)
and Cat Thief (1999) won the Breeders' Cup Classic after competing
in the Travers the same year. Twilight Agenda (1991) and Bertrando
(1993) finished second in the Breeders' Cup Classic after competing
in the Pacific Classic the same year. Paseana won the Breeders' Cup
Distaff (1992) after competing in the Pacific Classic.

<P>
   Fifty or so basketball players _ college players or college
bound _ were shooting in the gymnasium at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook last Sunday. Amid the thump of balls, the
snap of nets and the morning sunlight streaking in from windows,
one would hardly have picked out the skinny redheaded kid as
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players trying out for the American team to the
Maccabiah Games in Israel next summer, the thin redhead was not as
physically impressive as others. He was, however, the only player
wearing a yarmulke, a small, round light-blue skullcap pinned in
place.
</P>
<P>
   There was little definition to his arms and legs, and at
6-foot-3, 170 pounds, he seemed even smaller and slighter, this
despite a rigorous weight-training schedule in which he has gained
35 pounds in the last two years. At 18 years old _ and having
graduated from high school in June _ his face retains the youthful
quality of someone younger. He seemed almost out of place in this
gym of athletes, perhaps over his head. But could looks be
deceiving?
</P>
<P>
   This was Tamir Goodman, and, under closer observation, one could
discern a certain grace, an unmistakable intensity, the palpable
confidence of an athlete in his moves, in the way he handled the
ball, even his light banter with other players.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Goodman has had a great deal of attention
thrust on him. It began when he played for Talmudical Academy in
his hometown, Baltimore. The Academy is a yeshiva, an Orthodox
Jewish parochial school, and he averaged 37 points a game. He
played point guard, shooting guard, small forward and anything else
that was needed, with a repertory that included effortless no-look
passes and spectacular dunks.
</P>
<P>
   He was being hailed as ``the Jewish Jordan,'' a hunk of pressure
capable of sinking the greatest of young talents, even emerging
pros, let alone a kid from a private school that emphasized Torah
study over the pick and roll.
</P>
<P>
   The yeshiva's gym held barely 100 spectators. When it was
announced that Goodman was headed to the University of Maryland,
the ensuing publicity and burgeoning interest forced home games to
be moved to the Loyola College Arena, which was filled to capacity,
with 3,000 spectators and hundreds turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Some yeshiva officials frowned upon the attention. Basketball,
they believed, was something too much of the material world, and
detracted from study of the Torah, the body of Jewish religious
literature that includes the Scripture and the Talmud.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year, seeking better competition, Goodman
transferred to Takoma Academy in nearby Takoma Park, Md., a
Seventh-day Adventist school that observed the Sabbath on the same
days he did. Goodman did well enough at Takoma that an assistant
coach for Towson University, Julius Allen, who scouted Goodman,
said: ``I'm a New York guy, and it's obvious that Tamir could go
into Harlem or anywhere and play well and be comfortable doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Takoma, Goodman averaged 25 points a game, but ``shared the
sugar,'' hoops jargon for providing assists, with an average of
nine a game. This generous attitude surely contributed to ``T,'' as
he was called there, being popular with his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   While the high school leagues Goodman played in were of less
than the highest caliber, the Maryland basketball coach, Gary
Williams, offered him a scholarship in his junior year. Goodman
accepted, saying that he could not play games or practice on the
Sabbath, from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He is from a family of eight children. One of his brothers is a
rabbi and another is studying to be a rabbi. Observation of
orthodox Jewish rituals and teachings is the center of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I wanted to play college basketball,'' Goodman
recalls, ``I knew that basketball is temporary, but God is forever.
I don't want to do anything that might put me in disfavor in the
eyes of God.'' He explained this to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's do-able,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Williams, having watched Goodman scrimmage against
some Maryland players, had second thoughts. ``In the spring and
summer he didn't play well _ he may have been hurting with a
knee,'' Williams recalled. In fact, Goodman had sprained a ligament
in his knee, and was given medical advice not to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play,'' he said, ``but I was a bonehead for doing
it when I was injured. I was just a 16-year-old kid, and I could
hardly move.'' Goodman shot 4-for-14 in the scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said, ``We called him in and said we would still honor
the scholarship, but would he be happy not playing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole story is that if he's a star player, you might make
more concessions,'' Williams added. ``But if you're an eighth or
ninth man, you take your chances. If you can't play, and the other
guy does the job in your absence, he should play. Every once in a
while, you make a mistake. We made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman did not want to go to a school that was no longer
interested in him. However, coaches at Towson University, a
Division I school in the American East Conference, located just 5
miles from Goodman's home, had followed his career, and wanted him,
seeing great potential primarily as a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we especially like about Tamir,'' Towson Coach Mike
Jaskulski said, ``is his attitude and floor leadership. He sees the
whole court, and he's one of these players who makes his teammates
better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What about the Sabbath restrictions on his playing? ``I told
Tamir and his parents that I would do everything I could to work it
out,'' Jaskulski said. Towson went to Chris Monasch, commissioner
of the America East Conference. Would the league make some
adjustments in the scheduling, and allow Towson to play on Thursday
and Saturday nights or Sundays whenever possible? The answer was
yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an educational setting,'' Monasch said, ``we're not about
to create anything that would be an obstacle to someone's religious
beliefs. Within the confines of cost, of building availability and
classroom requirements, we try to balance things out. This isn't a
first. We have Jewish coaches who we've made similar scheduling
accommodations for regarding Jewish holidays in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Division I basketball at Towson _ even though the
competition is considered a notch or two below that of Maryland and
the Atlantic Coast Conference _ is ``a dream come true,'' Goodman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life, people have been saying, `Put down the
basketball, it'll never be possible for you to go further than high
school ball,' '' he said.``And in the yeshiva, basketball was
looked down upon by a lot of people. Well, I live my life by the
teachings in the Torah. But I can't be sitting around and studying
the Torah all day. I need to be running and jumping. Basketball is
a great passion for me. It's been that way since I was seven or
eight years old. Trying to do what you do best is worthwhile.
That's got to be in the Torah somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``Torah and basketball go hand in hand for me. Torah
makes me a better basketball player because it emphasizes good
character, integrity and responsibility. You have to be on time,
respect others, and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he had been disappointed by Maryland's decision.
``I believe I could play for Maryland,'' he said. ``I respect them,
but I don't respect how they went about dealing with me. They
aren't enemies. I just move on. And I feel very privileged that
Towson did what it did for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Ginsburg, an assistant coach at Towson and assistant coach
for the U.S. Maccabiah team, said that Goodman knows he will not be
expected to carry the team at Towson, which was 11-17 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll play a role,'' Ginsburg said, ``but we have several
veterans returning and the responsibility will be shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's mother, Chava, is happy that he is going to Towson.
``Coach Jaskulski emphasized academics over basketball, and that
showed me proper priorities,'' she said. Goodman is an honor
student who would like one day to work in sports, with children,
though before that he would be open to a pro career ``some place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so proud of Tamir,'' Mrs. Goodman said. ``He's a young
man who always tries to do the right thing. He does the chores
required of him, runs errands, throws out the garbage. And he
brings me roses every week for shabbos,'' _ the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman had driven from Baltimore to Stony Brook last week,
spending Friday night in a rabbi's home and missing the Saturday
afternoon and evening workouts. He showed up at the gym around 9
p.m. Saturday, and shot baskets in some drills; he felt he never
quite got the stiffness out of his body, and was unhappy with his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Shyatt, the head coach at Clemson University who
volunteered to be head coach of the American basketball team for
the Maccabiah Games, observed Goodman's workout. ``He's a wonderful
kid,'' Shyatt said, ``but his shooting, that's his major
deficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Shyatt also described Goodman as a player with ``great savvy in
the open court, a very diligent worker and very serious about his
basketball, and all the hoopla has not ill-effected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman was so unhappy with his play on Saturday night that he
rose at 6 the next morning and, although practice was not scheduled
until 10, he was in the gym at 7 to work on his game. ``I'm
constantly being tested,'' he said. ``But I believe the saying that
God doesn't put on you more than you can handle.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought he could handle the competition in the tryouts. After
all, this summer he has played in a fast Baltimore summer league,
with local products like Sam Cassell of the Milwaukee Bucks. In the
Capitol Classic last April, a game that brings together the best
high-school players in the Washington, D.C., area, Goodman was
named co-most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   On defense in a full-court scrimmage at Stony Brook, Goodman
allowed his man to go backdoor on the first play. But Goodman
continued to hustle as a defender and played effectively from that
point. He looked for and hit the open man with passes, though on
occasion he forced a pass. He missed his first jump shot, from
3-point range. Undeterred, and without hesitation, he shot the next
time he was free, and scored from about 25 feet out.
</P>
<P>
   In quick order, Goodman took another shot from about the same
spot, and sank that one. Open in the corner, he swished another
3-pointer. In between, there were a couple of air balls, but also a
slashing drive for a hoop, a slashing drive and a good dish-off for
a basket, a rebound and a double-pump scoop under the basket for
two points and several more outside jump shots that found the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Shyatt said he had liked what he saw, especially the
shooting that seemed to improve overnight. ``He's got
deficiencies,'' Shyatt said, ``but they're correctable. He has a
good chance to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman had suffered bruises _ the competition was stiff and
uncompromising _ but he was not displeased with his play on Sunday.
Goodman went over to several of the other players, congratulating
them on their play, and paid his respects to the coaches. But he
did not have time to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   On his return to Baltimore, Goodman wanted to make a side trip
to a cemetery in Queens, N.Y., to visit the grave of Rabbi Menachem
Schneerson, the revered leader of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement,
who died six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask him for a blessing,'' Goodman said, tugging on
his sweats. And as quickly as he would make a move to the basket,
the tall redhead with the blue yarmulke, his equipment bag swinging
at his side, was out the door and on his way.

THE SEARCH FOR CREATIVE IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BIZ-BOOKS)  
(For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By FRED ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creative ideas for new businesses should emerge from every level
of a company, says Gary Hamel, author of ``Leading the
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamel works with companies on instilling a capacity for what he
calls ``radical innovation.'' He is also the co-author, with C.K.
Prahalad, of a business classic, ``Competing for the Future.''
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your earlier book was directed at the company. This one is
directed at the individual. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. The first book was really aimed for a rather senior audience,
strategic planners and so on. This book is aimed at any individual
anywhere who has a passion for creating something new.
</P>
<P>
   Probably what has changed in my thinking is really two things.
First, a realization that despite all the aphorisms to the
contrary, change does not start at the top. As I began to look at
how some really large companies had dramatically changed their
identity and their sense of direction, more often than not it was
not something that started at the top. It was started by people low
down who lacked any kind of formal power.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, there was a sense that many people in organizations
had become cynical, frustrated, even angry, at the sense of not
being in control. We've gotten an ever greater gap between rhetoric
and reality inside large companies. We no longer call employees
``employees.'' We call them ``associates'' and ``members'' and so
on, and yet they're more expendable than ever.
</P>
<P>
   So the goal was to see if we couldn't begin to turn back the
estrangement and cynicism so aptly symbolized by Dilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your book talks about Silicon Valley, but not about
start-ups. Aren't they revolutionary?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think we've drawn a false dichotomy between old economy and
new economy, which is not very helpful. Every new-economy company
is busily working to adopt the virtues of old-economy companies.
They're all trying to learn how to build a global infrastructure,
how to build a world-class brand, how to achieve operational
excellence, how to build up scale and size. Those are all things
companies have been doing for the last hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, all those old-economy companies are being
forced to learn to continually reinvent themselves, to exploit the
imagination of every employee, to substitute markets for
hierarchies, and so on. Where we're headed is a synthesis between
the virtues of new-economy companies and old-economy companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You say innovation is everyone's challenge. How so?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you went back to the 1950s and asked somebody where does
quality come from, they would have said either from the artisan or
from the inspector. It either came from somebody with magical hands
making luxury goods or from somebody at the end of a production
line weeding out the bad products.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deming (W. Edwards Deming, an industrial consultant who
theorized about quality control and emphasized teamwork and
communication over competition) and a few others in the mid-'50s
said it doesn't have to be this way. We can make quality everyone's
job and improve quality enormously. It is hard to understand how
radical that thought was.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a meeting with Deming when he was presenting his
ideas to the top management of one of America's big car companies.
And the audience there literally thought he was nuts. They said:
``Now tell us again, we're going to take people with eight years of
formal education and teach them statistical process control? We're
going to let employees stop a billion-dollar production line?'' And
of course now we take that for granted, but that would be radical
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And today the challenge is not quality; the challenge is
innovation. So we need to do for innovation what we did for
quality.
</P>

 By GREGORY PALAST    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PECONIC, N.Y. _ While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra
Streisand's bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los
Angeles, something important was being debated 100 miles to the
south in San Diego, where there was a real display of populism.
There politicians have enrolled two million citizens in a scary
economic experiment. This year, San Diego became the first city in
California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity
prices.
</P>
<P>
   When California's lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market
competition to electricity, they wrote into the law that
homeowners' bills would fall ``by at least 20 percent.'' In fact,
bills jumped 124 percent this August over last. Rather than
repudiate this mad market experiment, the federal government and 24
other states, New York included, have rushed to imitate
California's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Californians were lucky. Every hour of every day, San
Diego Gas and Electric, the local utility, must now buy its
electricity at a state auction known as a power pool. On the first
hot day this summer, during the noonday heat, the companies that
produce the power, newly deregulated, cranked up their bids to
$9,999 per megawatt hour. That's about 5,000 percent more than the
once-controlled price of $20, but it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to those inside the secretive auction agency, sellers
assumed the pool's computers could handle only four-digit bids. In
fact, the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and
bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day.
</P>
<P>
   One can trace California's electricity market plague largely to
a single source, Daniel Fessler. In the early 1990s, Fessler, then
president of the state's Public Utilities Commission, developed an
infatuation with one of Margaret Thatcher's free-market ventures:
the troubled England-Wales Power Pool.
</P>
<P>
   How strange. Britons pay about 70 percent more for electricity
than Americans. That's hardly a surprise, as each day around tea
time, when England's usage peaks, a small clique of power plant
owners take over the electricity auction, bidding up prices by 200
percent to 2,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, utilities vowed they would play no such
tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been
at the core of regulation policy for the past 100 years. The
promise lasted several months, during which time five giant
international electricity sellers _ all new to California _
imported the techniques they'd learned in Britain that were
designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month
produce profits once permitted for an entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The deregulation bug is now winging eastward. New York City, for
example, has reportedly succumbed to 43 percent increases in Con
Edison bills.
</P>
<P>
   But in San Diego, something extraordinary happened. This month,
thousands joined an unprecedented consumers' boycott. The power
companies can send out their bloated bills, but the tanned masses
won't pay. Refuseniks include the Council of Churches, the school
district and _ without a hint of shame _ Steve Peace, the state
senator who sponsored the deregulation law.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gore's
campaign. After all, it was Fessler and his fellow Republicans who
threw California's consumers to the meager mercies of the
marketplace. And Gov. George W. Bush pushed through deregulation in
Texas, which is widely expected produce hefty returns for a former
business partner, Sam Wyly, owner of the GreenMountain, a power
seller.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against ``powerful
forces,'' on this subject he's mum. No wonder: the Clinton-Gore
administration still promotes California-style deregulation as a
model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But someone's ready to feel California's pain, and it's not good
news for Gore. During the Democrats' big show, Ralph Nader went to
San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the
Utility Consumer Action Network, the 46,000-member local group
leading the anti-corporate uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is the first big U.S. industry formerly under the
tight control of states to be opened up to international operators
and their free market rules. For the first time, Americans feel the
bite of real globalization, and we don't like it one bit.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Each year the United States spends $98 billion
caring for 16 million people with diabetes, and researchers
reported this week that the disease is rapidly growing.
Overwhelmingly, we control diabetes but do not cure it.
</P>
<P>
   Most diabetics have adult onset, or Type 2, diabetes, which can
usually be managed with diet or pills. But as their disease
overworks the islet cells in the pancreas that produce insulin,
over time even many of these patients risk death without regular
insulin shots, as those do who have the more serious Type 1, or
juvenile onset, diabetes. In Type 1, the body's immune system
attacks and kills the islet cells.
</P>
<P>
   Pancreas transplantation is a cure for diabetes, though like all
transplant surgery it has complications and risks of its own. But
because there are only 5,000 to 6,000 donated pancreases a year,
from brain-dead donors, and not all are suitable, only about 1,000
transplants are done.
</P>
<P>
   There is an exciting new breakthrough in the treatment of
diabetes, reported last month in the New England Journal of
Medicine. Instead of using the entire pancreas, researchers in
Edmonton, Alberta, isolated the islet cells and simply injected
them into patients' livers. They were able to cure seven diabetics.
But to treat one patient, islet cells from two or more donor
pancreases had to be used.
</P>
<P>
   A way around the donor shortage is to grow islet cells in the
laboratory, but this sounds much easier than it is. Normal adult
cells cannot grow and divide indefinitely in a test tube.
</P>
<P>
   Yet special cells, called stem cells, do have this capacity. If
they could be coaxed to become islet cells, we would be able to
treat every diabetic with an islet cell transplant. Not only that,
but with stem cell technology we may be able to grow cells to treat
patients with brain and spinal cord trauma, stroke, Parkinson's
disease, Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, acute liver
failure, inborn errors of metabolism and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch, however. The only known source of stem cells
until recently has been the human embryo, and because there was a
strict ban on federal financing of research involving embryonic or
fetal tissues, progress has been slow. That is why Tuesday's
announcement that the National Institutes of Health has agreed to
finance research with certain embryo cells is so exciting to
doctors who perform transplants _ and to many who treat diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the announcement, using private money, scientists at
Johns Hopkins University and the University of Wisconsin took
embryonic cells and with painstaking effort grew stem cells from
them in the laboratory. These cells have now grown and divided so
many times that they are only remotely related to the original
cells that came from embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cells for this research came from frozen embryos _
the same source that the NIH has now approved for federal funding.
Because in vitro fertilization generates more embryos than are
used, some are frozen for a period of time and then discarded.
Opponents argue that embryonic stem cell research destroys a human
life. But these embryos would otherwise be thrown in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Other cells used in this stem cell project came from a source
the government still has not approved for federal funding, but
should: tissue from therapeutic abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A new argument against the use of embryos is that adult stem
cells can be used. But these cells are rare and difficult to
obtain. They are not well characterized, and it is unclear if they
will prove beneficial to the treatment of disease. For now,
research on both the adult cells and the embryonic cells should
continue, so that we can see which in the end will work best in
developing cures.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans suffer from dreadful chronic diseases; one
of them is diabetes, which threatens lives and can lead to kidney
failure, blindness, nerve damage, and susceptibility to heart
disease and stroke. We must support the research that may someday
help so many be cured.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The elections of July 2 brought the end of 71 years of virtual
one-party rule and inaugurated my country's first experience in a
democratic rotation of power. Mexico's electoral institutions,
built over several rounds of gradual reform, proved their maturity
and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   The smoothness of our transition, the civility shown by all the
political actors and the statesmanship demonstrated by President
Ernesto Zedillo are all reflections of our enormous transformation.
</P>
<P>
   That transformation frames the message I have brought this week
to President Clinton and the candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore.
The full advent of democracy will complement our economic reforms,
bring them to full fruition and better distribute their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against corruption, accountability of public
officials, the rule of law and security for all citizens will
provide the assurances that Mexico's partners are expecting. These
are the issues Mexicans strongly raised during the presidential
campaign, and they are also at the root of some doubts our friends
abroad _ investors, creditors, tourists _ have harbored. My first
priority after taking office will be to confront these challenges
forthrightly.
</P>
<P>
   I will also attempt to redress the age-old poverty and
inequality that, despite economic gains in several regions, still
plague too many Mexicans. We must accelerate economic growth,
promote local and regional development and above all ensure better
distribution of income. Strengthening civil society, democratizing
the labor movement, giving women a greater voice and defending
minorities are all steps in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   As we undertake these changes, we will also engage our neighbors
and partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA and
the current state of relations with the United States have been
good for Mexico, and we can build on what has already been
achieved. Within 25 years we envision a North American area of
shared prosperity, where goods, services, capital and people can
move more freely across borders.
</P>
<P>
   My administration will seek to ``deepen'' NAFTA in several ways.
The first involves expanding the resources and mandate of the North
American Development Bank, enabling it to finance infrastructure
projects in Mexico; the second, setting up North American public
and private regional funds to invest in human capital in the poor
areas of Mexico where most migrants to the United States come from.
Both would combat poverty and discourage undocumented immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, we visualize a more ambitious economic
integration as we actively pursue the narrowing of wage
differentials among Mexico, the United States and Canada. In the
meantime, negotiations should begin with a view toward providing
humane working conditions for Mexicans already in the United
States, and for exploring new and imaginative mechanisms to
organize and regulate future flows. These should include
institutional guarantees of the human and civil rights of Mexicans
and reduction of tensions along the border. The violent deaths of
my countrymen on the border are simply intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I believe that the changes wrought in Mexico by the
election will provide an impulse to greater effectiveness in the
war on drugs. We need to stop the blame game. The drug trade is
driven by both supply and demand and can only be dealt with through
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, we should eliminate the sources of gratuitous
tension. The yearly ritual of U.S. certification of other
countries' cooperation in drug enforcement strains our relationship
and diverts valuable political and diplomatic resources. It should
be replaced by an international mechanism to evaluate the efforts
of all countries in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is ready to do business with the United States. We want
to maximize the ``democracy bonus'' of good feeling generated
across the world by our July 2 elections, in order to significantly
increase direct foreign investment in our country and to engage
Washington in bold negotiations.

   The onset of democracy in Mexico provides the best chance in a
generation to build a forward-looking agenda that moves beyond
stale debates. I am sure we can set this process in motion during
my meetings this week and move ahead decisively early next year,
when both our countries begin the 21st century with new
administrations.

<P>
   Last week's report of three studies showing that children raised
by stepmothers are likely to receive less food, health care and
education than children raised by their biological mothers should
not have come as much of a surprise _ especially to mothers.
However impolitic it may be to ask, who really believes that
stepmothers can possibly replicate the care of the original mother,
notwithstanding the moist optimism of movies like ``Stepmom,'' in
which the earnest efforts of Julia Roberts are enough to secure a
stepchild's happy future?
</P>
<P>
   Mothering, be it by way of the womb, marriage or adoption, is
relentless, even under the best of circumstances. Despite the
cultural myth that mothers have an endless capacity to give, their
means of expressing love _ their time, energy and material assets _
are finite.
</P>
<P>
   And stepmothers, no matter how devoted, may be hampered by a
combination of factors unique to their situation: a lack of basic
factual knowledge about the child, the complicating presence of the
biological mother, the hostility of stepchildren traumatized by
divorce, the father's unwillingness to interfere, and their own
sense of alienation from the tribe of the original family.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies, while in no way suggesting that stepmothers are
wicked or consciously negligent, oddly dovetail with our culture's
traditional suspicion of them. Portrayed in fairy tales, the
stepmother is a grasping woman who favors her own offspring, no
matter how ill-deserving, over those of an earlier, presumably
dead, wife.
</P>
<P>
   As the stepchild's fortunes unfold in the original Grimm's
version of Cinderella, it's not the stepmother who dresses the
unloved stepdaughter for the prince's ball and thus vouchsafes her
future in the castle, but a magic hazel tree growing above the
grave of Cinderella's own dead mother, a tree inhabited by a
ministering white bird _ her mother's hovering spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Case, the Princeton economist who was the chief researcher
in the three studies, was surprised to find that contact two or
three times a month between the stepchild and his or her biological
mother was sufficient to raise the child's health care status to
the same level as that of those children who live with both
biological parents. But if the biological mother of the stepchild
is dead? Basic health care _ measured as a medical checkup within
the last year _ plummeted, she found.
</P>
<P>
   Stepmothers in fairy tales derive from a harsher agrarian epoch,
when resources were scarce and life, especially childbirth, a much
dicier proposition. If we can ignore their tendency to represent
good and evil unalloyed, such stories remain pertinent as
repositories of the human dynamic in our own post-industrial
society, when motherhood is increasingly nonbiological, though not
for reasons of morbidity.
</P>
<P>
   In Grimm's ``The Juniper Tree,'' a stepson is sacrificed to
safeguard the fortunes of his half-sister. Resurrected as a many
colored bird, he flies from the branches of the tree that bears his
mother's spirit. With eyes like stars and a song whose verses
enumerate the injustices he suffered, the brother ultimately
restores order to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we can use studies like the ones from Princeton to that
same end: to reveal inequality and achieve a finer balance. More
than half of today's children will live apart from at least one
biological parent by the time they reach 18. The stories of their
families will point up not only how hard it is to be a stepchild,
but how complicated and challenging is the role of the stepmother.

Chair: Or, A Visit From the Foot Emancipation Society.'')

HOW TO TURN INNOVATION INTO EVERYONE'S GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With sidebar, BIZ-BOOKS-HAMEL) 
(For release Sunday, August 27) 
 By FRED ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Hamel s a sophisticated business thinker, the co-author of
one of the finest business books ever written. Yet it is not
beneath him to include an oath in his new book on innovation. It is
meant to elevate the people in the office cubicles into champions
of inspired ideas for new ventures:
</P>
<P>
   I am no longer a captive to history.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever I can imagine, I can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   I am no longer a vassal in a faceless bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   I am an activist, not a drone.
</P>
<P>
   All this may sound silly, but Hamel has a crusade to pursue. He
is imploring everyone who ever dressed in business casual to start
thinking of fresh ideas for new businesses. His new book, ``Leading
the Revolution'' (Harvard Business School Press, $29.95), is a
handbook on how mavericks can originate novel ideas and actually
maneuver employers into entering new and profitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   How time does fly. Only six years ago, Hamel was co-author,
along with C.K. Prahalad, of ``Competing for the Future'' (Harvard
Business School Press, 1994), a cogent and elegantly reasoned work.
</P>
<P>
   That book spoke implicitly to those who run a company. It taught
that business success lay in foresight. A company should ask itself
what compelling customer benefits it could provide 5 or 10 years
down the road. And it should set about building the necessary
competencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel's latest book has nothing much _ and everything _ to say
about the future. Without dismissing his earlier work, he now
believes it is no longer possible to peer out 5 or 10 years and
conclude much of anything useful. His new book speaks to the
business rank and file, and only marginally to the executive suite.
Success now lies in becoming an incubator of new business concepts.
And the idea is far more important than the execution.
</P>
<P>
   But the future will be far different from all we have known.
Hamel declares that the ``age of progress'' has ended, and with it
the philosophy of continuous improvement, one of the engines that
have driven our prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached the end of incrementalism,'' he writes
sweepingly, ``and only those companies that are capable of creating
industry revolutions will prosper in the new economy.''
Rule-busting innovation is the way to win.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will agree, but Hamel argues passionately that
change unfolds so fast today and whips companies so furiously that
business survival depends on ``nonlinear'' responses.
(``Nonlinear,'' a favorite word, seems to mean anything different
that makes a big impact.) Companies will compete not in products
and services but in the ability to devise ideas for innovative
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in creating different business concepts is nothing
new. Henry Ford had one concept: A car that any working man could
afford. Alfred Sloan at General Motors had a better one: A car for
every purpose and purse. Everything from night baseball to pizza
delivery in 30 minutes was an innovative concept in its day.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that companies will have to spawn them one
after another, and the game will go to whoever produces the best
ideas the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel is describing the company as an idea factory _ or closer,
as Silicon Valley in miniature. There, people with ideas compete
freely for money, and people with money vie for both the best ideas
and the best people.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel teaches at the London Business School and leads a Silicon
Valley consulting firm, Strategos, that helps companies build a
capacity for ``radical innovation.'' No fan now of established
companies, he finds them biased toward conservatism and toward the
existing business and existing customers. Their investment
decisions are geared toward avoiding loss rather than toward
stretching for ``the enormous upside potential'' that one
successful venture might earn among a hundred flops.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel's book appears implicitly aimed at the young in
particular, with its breezy style and occasionally coarse language.
(``Are you a courtier, kissing corporate butt? Or a rebel
challenging your company to reinvent itself?'') Its pages are
jazzed up with quotations in large type, lots of whimsical
photographs and some paragraphs of text that drift around the page.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel walks the reader through the anatomy of a business concept
and the tactics of advancing an idea within a company. He excels in
laying down logical and instructive lists (the 4 dimensions of a
business concept, their 13 subcomponents, the 3 factors that
connect them, the 4 conditions that support them, etc.), but the
explanations of concepts like positive feedback and choke points
are often familiar. He does pose a catchy hypothetical or two,
asking, for example, why no one has devised a system permitting an
arriving hotel guest to go directly to the room, using a credit
card as the key.
</P>
<P>
   The book perks up when Hamel moves from the general to the
particular. He finds his heroes when one or two individuals emerge
from the ranks and manage to bring off big changes at their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   David Grossman, a programmer, and John Patrick, a staff
executive, coaxed and prodded IBM first into acknowledging the
Internet's importance, then into building a Web presence and
ultimately into becoming an e-business powerhouse. They did it by
talking it up, being persistent, showing off their wares, devising
large demonstration projects (like the Web site for the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta), gathering true believers, and, not least,
winning over Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   At Sony, Ken Kutaragi, an engineer, bucked criticism and
opposition for years while he developed a succession of digital
devices that ultimately led to the enormously successful
PlayStation, responsible for 40 percent of Sony's profits. Along
the way he sold chips furtively to Nintendo, a great rival that
valued his innovation more than Sony did. He had also managed to
attract Sony's president as a protector. Otherwise his superiors
would have crushed him.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel points out how Cisco Systems, in a fast-changing field,
has learned to rely on acquisitions as the equivalent of research
and development. Instead of developing a new product line, Cisco
acquires it, buying a young business and bringing it under Cisco's
umbrella. ``We do not have to play a guessing game about what
products we need,'' a Cisco executive said. It has made a routine
of strategic acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamel has more to say about big companies. Size and scope still
matter, he says, and some established enterprises manage to qualify
as ``gray-haired revolutionaries.'' His counsel to them conveys the
flavor of his approach: Set unreasonable goals. Define the business
broadly. Create a cause, not a business. Let new voices be heard
(newcomers, young people, people in distant offices). Create an
open market for ideas, capital and talent. Begin with low-risk
experiments. Divide big companies into cells. Be generous toward
people who really produce.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has some tough questions. In Silicon Valley, a
venture capital firm might consider 5,000 ideas a year and invest
in 10. Of those, five will fail, three will break even, one will
return twice the investment and one will pay off fiftyfold or a
hundredfold.
</P>
<P>
   How many companies can accept that failure rate? How many
careers can survive six failures in a row? How many companies
understand the logic of accepting the failures for a shot at the
fiftyfold return? It is the economics of the oil patch, with many,
many dry holes for every gusher.

COMMENTARY: FAST-FORWARDING THOSE CAMPUS VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they approach their freshman year of college, our
soon-to-be-unaffordable children give us a taste of expenses to
come when we take them to visit the schools that have caught their
eye. Some of them are in places that might as well be Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   The wish lists are usually long, involving colleges in different
parts of the country, so some parents stagger these exhausting
trips over the course of a year _ generally their child's junior
year of high school. That can get expensive.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbors in Connecticut traveled with their daughter this
month to visit schools in Chicago, and will go later to California.
A family I know in the Midwest hit the Boston area last month, as
well as Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut; they plan to go to
Chicago and Indiana in the fall and California next spring. By
using frequent-flier miles and staying with friends, they are
keeping the total cost of the trips to about $4,000; the father is
even borrowing a video camera to record some of the visits.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is a way that he could have stayed home. Parents
can reduce the cost and trouble by taking advantage of videotapes
now available for many colleges around the country. Some come from
the colleges, and some from independent companies. Some can even be
viewed on the Internet. Although most people involved with these
videos caution that a tape is no substitute for an actual visit,
they do say it is a good way to cull a long list of college choices
and save a few stops on that junior-year marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're considering making a trip that is more than a day's
drive away, you might look at the tape to see if it's worth it,''
said Christopher Klass, president of the Klass Report of Manhattan,
which sells college videos. ``When you get back, you can use the
tapes to review and refresh your memory. The videos are also good
for people who can't afford to visit the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klass Report (www.klassreport.com, $19.95 a school) has
tapes of 40 colleges, but the company has not shot any new videos
since 1997, so some information may be outdated; Klass said he
hopes to add more schools this fall. His tapes are professionally
shot, edited and narrated and include topics like student-teacher
ratios, on- and off-campus living arrangements and what there is to
do off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes offered by Collegiate Choice ($15 a tour,
www.collegiatechoice.com) are far from professional, and that is
part of their charm. They look as if they were shot by someone's
dad. And they were.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Kramon of Tenafly, N.J., who makes the tapes and is the
father of two adult sons, is a salesman for his family's Manhattan
clothing company; he travels around the country on business. His
wife, Sami, a college adviser, urged him to videotape a couple of
college campuses for her during a business trip a few years ago. He
now has about 350 tapes.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a ``you are there'' approach, taping the campus and then
recording the tour that the college gives to visiting parents and
students. He asks the student guide the kinds of questions a parent
would ask; he adds no narration or other comments of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear the school say what the student-faculty
ratio is; I ask the tour guide,'' he said. ``I want to know how
safe the area is. I want to know if the school empties out on the
weekend. No school wants to admit it is a suitcase school.''
</P>
<P>
   Search Communications in Philadelphia (www.searchbyvideo.com, $8
a school) doesn't shoot its own videos; it distributes tapes made
by about 300 colleges. The company's Web site also offers the
online videos of 10 colleges and plans to add more.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Smith, executive director of the National Association for
College Admission Counseling in Alexandria, Va., said parents
should find out what a college offers free before buying a
commercially distributed tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes parents get caught up in this college transition
thing and spend money they didn't have to spend,'' she said.
``There's lots of free good information available from the college
if parents just ask.''
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed views about the tapes. I didn't care for the
editorial comments in the Klass tapes, but they gave a good view of
the college. Collegiate Choice had the most unvarnished approach,
but when a tour guide was boring, so was the tape. The tapes
offered by the colleges and by Search Communications give a good
overview, but they are part of the schools' marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some tapes were incredibly dull, but the one for Virginia Tech
was so clever, and the student narrators so talented, that I hoped
the school would end up as one of my own children's choices.
</P>
<P>
   So much for culling the list.

TURKEY ACCUSES AN ISLAMIC MODERATE OF TRYING TO TOPPLE GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Pa.)   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Onur Elgin, a Turkish teen-ager, has no
doubts about why he spent his summer vacation studying physics. In
fluent English, he explains that he wants to succeed for his
school, his country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Onur's high school, Fatih College, is part of a prospering
Islamic network associated with Fetullah Gulen, a 62-year-old
religious leader who lives in Pennsylvania. In addition to hundreds
of schools in Turkey, the Balkans and Central Asia, the loose-knit
brotherhood runs a television channel, a radio station, an
advertising agency, a daily newspaper, and a bank; all pro-Islam
and all centered in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Though little known in the United States, for many years Gulen
was an unofficial ambassador for Turkey who promoted a moderate
brand of Islam. He preached tolerance, meeting with Pope John Paul
II and other religious and political leaders, among them Turkey's
prime ministers and presidents.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, after a yearlong inquiry, a state security court
issued an arrest warrant for Gulen. A prosecutor has accused him of
inciting his followers to plot the overthrow of Turkey's secular
government, a crime punishable by death. The authorities have not
tried to extradite Gulen, but the warrant sent a chill through his
circle of admirers and raised anxieties among liberals who are not
associated with his movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government has been involved in a highly
public dispute over its attempt to fire thousands of civil servants
suspected of ties to pro-Islamic or separatist groups. Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit sought the authority for the dismissals
through a governmental decree, but the president, Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, has twice refused to sign the measure into law. Sezer argues
that the authority can be created only by Parliament. The
government agreed Thursday to submit the matter to Parliament in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock has led to calls for the resignation of Sezer, who
took office in May. It has also contributed to the almost
continuous tension between hard-line backers of the country's
secular order and people who advocate more tolerance of religious
views and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to questions from The New York Times,
Gulen recently broke a year of public silence about the accusations
against him. He described the charges as fabrications by a
``marginal but influential group that wields considerable power in
political circles.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not seeking to establish an Islamic regime but
did support efforts to ensure that the government treated ethnic
and ideological differences as a cultural mosaic, not a reason for
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standards of democracy and justice must be elevated to the
level of our contemporaries in the West,'' said Gulen, who has been
receiving medical care in the United States for the last year and
said his health prevented his return to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's military leaders have long regarded Gulen as a
potential threat to the state. Those fears seemed confirmed a year
ago, when television stations broadcast excerpts from
videocassettes in which he seemed to urge his followers to
``patiently and secretly'' infiltrate the government.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen said his words had been taken out of context, and some
altered. He said he had counseled patience to followers faced with
corrupt civil servants and administrators intolerant of workers who
were practicing Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements and words were picked with tweezers and montaged to
serve the purposes of whoever was behind this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulen's explanations are unlikely to satisfy the secular
hard-liners who see themselves as the guardians of modern Turkey,
which was founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. For them, the
businesses and schools run by his followers sow the seeds of an
Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Turks see such Islamic-oriented schools and
businesses as an attempt to fill a gap left by government policies
and discrimination. A study by the private Turkish Economic and
Social Studies Foundation found that these Islamic groups appeal
not only to the poor but also to strict Muslims who often feel
excluded from the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulen-oriented schools teach only government-approved
religious instruction, in Turkish and English. Tuition payments are
several thousand dollars a year, and students face rigorous
academic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically speaking, the schools are something that should
be supported by the state because you have a Turkish presence in
these countries,'' said Ozdem Sanberk, director of the Economic and
Social Studies Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At Fatih College outside Istanbul, the young Onur, 16, has no
intention of overthrowing the state. His sole goal right now is
learning enough physics to compete on the Turkish national academic
team.  &QL;

RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS: SOMETIMES, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers at the 15 retail stores of the Tile Shop do not receive
many of the perks that many a new-economy employer may dish up to
attract talent. They get no stock options, no nap rooms and
certainly no on-site pet care.
</P>
<P>
   But the company does offer a big lure for new hires: Instead of
waiting months or years to be eligible to join the 401(k)
retirement savings plan, workers at Tile Shop can join as soon as
they walk in the door.
</P>
<P>
   As job-hopping has become common in many industries, employers
say that the traditional waiting periods for benefits have become
an obstacle to recruiting. Qualified workers who already have
benefits are loath to do without them, even temporarily, to take a
new job.
</P>
<P>
   So more employers are reducing or eliminating the probationary
periods for savings plans, vacation time, profit sharing and
sometimes even medical insurance coverage, benefits experts say.
And companies that have not formally changed their waiting periods
are increasingly willing to waive them if a potentially valuable
new employee asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current job market, this is a highly desirable thing to
offer,'' said Dallas L. Salisbury, president and chief executive of
the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hard statistics are scant, but many companies say they see
anecdotal evidence that when benefits are available quickly,
vacancies are filled faster and turnover among new employees is
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The short-wait or no-wait approach seems to spreading fastest
for retirement savings plans. According to surveys by the
Profit-Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a nonprofit organization
that includes both sponsors and providers of plans, 40 percent of
companies let new employees join 401(k) plans within their first
three months in 1999, up from 32 percent the previous year. And 18
percent made them eligible for profit-sharing plans that quickly,
up from 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Liberto, a vice president at Segal Advisors, the
investment consulting unit of the Segal Co., a benefits consulting
firm based in New York, estimated that over the last year, at least
one-third of his company's clients have shortened or eliminated
waiting periods for 401(k)'s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing clients moving away from one-year eligibility to
either immediate eligibility or eligibility the month following the
beginning of employment,'' he said. ``Companies see it as a
competitive issue. Allowing people to come into a plan immediately
doesn't penalize them for coming from another job.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a tight labor market is at work. Federal rules
governing 401(k) plans oblige employers to enroll as many middle-
and low-paid workers as possible, to ensure that the plan is not
deemed to unfairly favor highly paid workers, though recent rulings
have eased some of the restrictions. Companies can now enroll
workers automatically, and the Internet has made benefits
administration easier for employers.
</P>
<P>
   But recruiting is the primary motive. Pearson Inc., the American
arm of Pearson PLC, the media conglomerate based in London,
eliminated its three-month wait for medical benefits in January
1999. A year later, it trimmed the wait for 401(k) plan eligibility
fromas long as six months to no more than 30 days, depending on
the date of hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten positive feedback that this has been an effective
recruiting tool,'' said Randall Keller, senior vice president for
human resources.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tile Shop chain, based in Plymouth, Minn., executives
were also concerned about retention; Minnesota, after all, has an
unemployment rate of just 2.5 percent. Historically, turnover in
the company's sales and manufacturing divisions ran to 80 percent a
year, and personnel officers found themselves having to fill the
same jobs every few months. Scrapping the 90-day wait to join the
401(k) has given new workers a greater stake in staying, said
Dianna Kincade, the human resources director at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate eligibility for medical plans, however, is not yet as
common, but it, too, is spreading. Kenneth Jacobsen, who leads the
national health practice at Segal, said many more companies were
shortening the wait for medical coverage from 90 days to 30.
``We're seeing this trend in mid- to large-sized companies, and
we're seeing it at a pace that is three to four times higher than a
year or two ago,'' Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all waiting periods appear headed for the out box. Employee
stock ownership plans, for example, still tend to have one-year
eligibility requirements, because they are explicitly intended to
reward longevity, said Corey Rosen, director of the National Center
for Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that ``immediate eligibility'' can mean
different things at different companies. Prospective employees
should check the fine print to make sure that they understand a
company's rules. ``It might be the first day of earnings, or it
might be the first day of the first month after you start work, or
even the first day of the second month,'' said David Wray,
president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council. The variations
sometimes reflect differences in how quickly companies process a
new employee's paperwork, he said. Knowing when coverage will
start, of course, helps job changers decide whether to extend their
former employers' medical coverage under the federal Cobra law to
cover any gap.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether they kick in immediately or almost immediately,
accelerated benefits are making a difference. Carl Randazzo, a
regional manager at the Tile Shop, said turnover had dropped
sharply at the five stores he manages since his company eliminated
the waiting period for its 401(k) plan. The change, Randazzo added,
is also making a big difference in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are looking at two job offers, this benefit can
cinch it so that they go with us,'' he said.

ONCE AGAIN, BUSH PUTS THE FOCUS ON TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (See also BUSH-AD) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Gov. George W. Bush sought to seize the offensive
Thursday on the issue of tax cuts, charging that Vice President Al
Gore's plan was so narrow and complicated that it would fail to
lower taxes for many middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To make his case, Bush expanded his previously arranged schedule
to include two events where he introduced families whose taxes, he
said, would be lowered significantly under his own plan, but very
little, if at all, under Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called `targeted' tax cut means that some are targeted
out of tax relief,'' Bush said at an airport event in New Orleans,
referring to Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the example of the man standing beside him, Andrew
Bechac, a high school teacher and football coach who supports a
wife and two young children on $40,000 a year. Bush said that if
his tax cut was enacted, Bechac would pay the federal government
$475 a year _ about $1,600 less than he now does.
</P>
<P>
   In a later speech, Bush returned to the example of the Bechacs,
making a more concrete pitch for his tax-cut proposal than he was
able to muster earlier in the week, when he stumbled over some
numbers and then conceded that he had to do a better job of selling
his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under my opponent's plan, he gets no tax cut,'' Bush said of
Bechac. ``He gets no tax cut. I ask you, I ask Americans, to look
at the facts in these tax plans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, when Bush arrived in Miami, he introduced yet
another family that he said would benefit under his plan.
</P>
<P>
   With these events and examples, which Gore's aides derided as
selective and misleading, Bush was clearly trying to recover from
his earlier missteps. At the same time, he sought to make light of
those fumbles, which threw him off the education message that he
had said he would be focusing on this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I didn't explain what I was trying to explain very
well,'' he told reporters aboard his campaign plane, a smile on his
face. Asked if he wanted to take another crack at it, he said,
laughing, ``Yeah, exactly, let me start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also signaling that he was not going to back away from
his sweeping proposal to cut taxes by about $1.3 trillion over the
next decade, which many polls suggest may not be in line with the
priorities of most American voters. Gore has proposed a more
limited tax cut of $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush was confronting head on two of the principal obstacles
to selling a big tax cut: Many voters' belief that politicians are
not really going to deliver the goods, or that the total savings
would ultimately be pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   Bechac, a man with a history of activism in the Republican party
in Louisiana, said during the airport event that $1,600 ``will go a
long way for us each year.''
</P>
<P>
   But while ush presented Bechac as a typical example, Gore's
aides said he was an aberrant one. ``They finally found one working
family that does better under the Bush plan than the Gore plan,''
said Ron Klain, a senior adviser to Gore. ``While Governor Bush can
play games with particular examples, he can't change the truth that
most working families do better under Gore than Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign quickly released an analysis that it said
showed that if the Bechacs did some of the things that trigger tax
breaks under the vice president's plan _ like paying for day care
for their children, taking a standard deduction instead of
itemizing, putting money in certain kinds of savings accounts _
they might get an even bigger tax cut than the $1,600.. The Bush
campaign said that none of that was relevant to the Bechac family.
Bush's plan cuts the income tax rate for all taxpayers in all
income brackets, including the wealthiest Americans, who would get
by far the most money back in simple dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does not cut rates, but rather provides breaks for
people who incur expenses for particular needs, like child care,
elderly care and school tuition, or who are saving money for
retirement or college. Those reductions in taxes apply, for the
most part, only to families with combined incomes of less than
$100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said Thursday that because Gore's plan has an
income ceiling and pivots on certain conditions, about 50 percent
of taxpayers _ about 50 million people _ would not see their taxes
lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Klain said that only about 30 million taxpayers would not
qualify for Gore's tax cuts, and that most of those people have
family incomes exceeding $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth over taxes suggested how large the issue
could loom in this election. Gore and his aides have asserted that
Bush's tax cut would gobble up surpluses and endanger prosperity.
Bush and his aides have levied the same accusation about Gore's
spending proposals, which are larger than Bush's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Texas governor had previously employed the strategy of
showcasing middle-class people and the kind of tax breaks they
would get during his battle in the Republican primary against Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. Like Gore, McCain complained that Bush was
lavishing too much of his tax cut on wealthy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Bush would continue throughout the coming weeks
to introduce families like the Bechacs. But he had not, at the
start of the week, intended to do that Thursday, when he was also
unveiling a new education proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for $437 million more in federal financing over five
years for historically black colleges and universities and an an
additional $166 million for similar institutions that have
primarily served Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his plane had left Austin, Texas, Thursday morning,
Bush was talking about tax cuts, saying that his belief in them was
impervious to polls. ``That should speak volumes about me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Orleans airport, Bechac, 33, held his 4-year-old
daughter, Meredith, while Margaret Bechac, 29, held the couple's
1-year-old, Camille.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Bechac, Bush said, ``Somebody asked me today on the
plane, `You know, the polls said people, hard-working people, don't
want tax relief.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I mentioned that,'' Bush added, ``and I think your
reaction was to laugh out loud.''

ANALYSIS: AS SUPPORT GROWS, GORE IS IN A POLITICAL GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., N.J., Calif., Mo., Iowa, Wis.)   (Adds ``almost'' to 2nd graf)  
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore entered a convention hall in Chicago on
Tuesday afternoon to a raucous ovation from union carpenters that
would have been hard to imagine during the many dark days of his
lengthy campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The union members, packed six deep behind rope lines, reached
frantically toward Gore as he high-fived his way through the hall.
At one point, the candidate found himself almost spread-eagled as
he reached for one hand beyond the rope line on his left and
another beyond the line on his right.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally made it to the lectern, Gore placed his hand
over his heart in what seemed an earnestly emotional gesture and
thanked the laborers for their welcome. ``I felt a little bit like
it was the Super Bowl,'' he said, ``and I was the last player
introduced running through the gantlet of all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a new feeling for Gore, whose campaign has struggled to
catch a break through months of misfortune, some of it
self-inflicted, some not. But in the last three weeks, as he has
watched the country and the polls respond approvingly to his
selection of a running mate, to his separation from President
Clinton, to his speech to the Democratic National Convention, and
to a picturesque post-convention cruise down the Mississippi, Gore
is finally in a political groove.
</P>
<P>
   It has clearly made him a better candidate, firmer in his
purpose, confident in his message, comfortable in his skin. And it
has happened not just at an opportune moment, but at a critical
one. If Gore had emerged from the convention without this kind of
lift, not just in the polls but in the energy of his crowds and his
campaign, the race might well have been lost. As it is, if Gore
defeats Gov. George W. Bush in November, historians will
undoubtedly see this period as a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   And voter surveys released Thursday show that Gore is on a roll,
erasing Bush's lead nationwide and receiving good news in several
key states. He has pulled even in Michigan and has increased his
lead in New Jersey and California.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment at least, the transformation has reinforced the
legend of Gore as a political clutch performer. And it has been all
the more striking because it has coincided with a rare moment of
off-message unsteadiness for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   After such prolonged adversity for Gore's campaign _ the
scandals involving Monica Lewinsky and campaign fund raising, the
perceived pandering on Elian Gonzalez, the constant tweaking of
message and image, the profligate spending, the bickering at
headquarters _ Democrats and Republicans alike have noticed the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster not affiliated with the Gore
campaign, conducted a focus group on Wednesday night in a suburb
outside St. Louis and was amazed by the shifting perceptions of
Gore. The voters interviewed, he said, now see Gore more as a
leader and less as Clinton's subordinate. They understand his
agenda, he said, and can verbalize reasons to vote for Gore, not
simply against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable,'' Hart said. ``Gore's lift off the
convention is much more than a numerical lift. It's a platform and
a platform for him to build upon.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, a Republican strategist and the publisher of
The Weekly Standard, said Gore had benefited immensely from the
transition of the Democratic ticket from Clinton-Gore to
Gore-Lieberman. And he said that Gore had demonstrated boldness by
selecting Sen. Joe Lieberman as his running mate and by using his
convention speech to lay out a forward-looking agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush may actually have to win this campaign now instead of
just watching Gore lose it,'' Kristol said, ``and that's starting
to sink in with some Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, both Hart and Kristol emphasized that such
moments can be transitory, and that Gore could squander his
newfound appeal by returning to the plodding, awkward form of his
not so distant past.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, Gore is having fun. On his riverboat
trip down the Mississippi, he stood atop the upper deck and waved
boyishly to hikers on the distant bluffs. Like Clinton, he has
discovered the joy of wading into crowds and lingering along a rope
line. He grabs pens to sign T-shirts and, at one stop this week, a
cantaloupe. The raspy hoarseness that afflicted him all week made
him sound positively Clintonesque.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, Gore broke a deep freeze with his campaign
press corps by inviting reporters to an off-the-record gathering on
the riverboat. It went so well that he invited the reporters back
for another get-together on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, Gore cannot always excite a crowd purely with
the force of his personality. But Gore can take the energy from a
crowd and make it his own.
</P>
<P>
   His crowds, while not approaching the 25,000 that showed for
Clinton and Gore in St. Louis on their 1992 bus tour, have been
respectable in their size and expressive in their support. In
little Keokuk, Iowa, on Sunday night, some 2,000 people waited in a
park for his arrival at 10:10 p.m., about an hour late.
</P>
<P>
   Those who travel to see him say they find Gore to be
down-to-earth, a trait not always associated with him in the past.
Debbie L. Mundy, a self-employed house cleaner who listened to Gore
in Moline, Ill., last Sunday, said she would vote for him at least
partly because the new prosperity had provided plenty of work for
her husband, a union electrician. But she also said she and others
in the area now viewed Gore as he wants them to _ as his own man
with his own message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have all these people here otherwise,'' she said
at a rally that jammed a downtown street. ``I think everybody's
trying to get in close to get a look at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore does, in fact, seem comfortable with his message. He
explains it forcefully, but without the shouting that once seemed
so contrived. The recent prosperity has been great, he says, but
some have been left out, and he will broaden the impact through tax
cuts and new spending aimed at the middle class. The enemy, he
makes it clear, is not big government but selected big industries,
including oil, insurance and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll taken just after the Democratic convention, one
of several that now show Gore with a slight lead, found that 61
percent of those questioned said Gore was articulating what he
wanted to accomplish. In a poll taken two weeks earlier, only 36
percent said so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether his message works or not I don't know,'' said Charles
O. Jones, a retired political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin. ``But at least you can fathom that they have a strategy.
Before they seemed to have been all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor has been Lieberman, the Connecticut senator and a
friend of Gore's for 15 years. He clearly puts the vice president
at ease and his sense of humor encourages Gore to show his own. The
public approval of the selection has given Gore confidence in his
own judgment, and after eight years as second fiddle he seems to
relish sitting in the first chair. The two men plan to campaign
together a lot, often on ``double dates'' with their popular wives.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Gore campaign moves toward Labor Day with the sense
that it is clicking on all cylinders, at least for now. ``This
campaign,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, ``was like a
car where you turn the engine and it almost catches and almost
catches. And then, last week, it finally caught.''

AT THE FRONT LINES OF THE TIRE RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I.)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Tasca Tasca Sr. has kicked plenty of tires in his 72 years.
He estimates that he, his sons and his grandson, who own a
Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Massachusetts and a Ford dealership
in Rhode Island, have sold 330,000 cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Tasca once told Henry Ford II that he made ``lousy cars.'' Since
then, Tasca has made more than 600 assembly-line inspections,
telling Ford Motor executives how to fix flaws. He chronicled his
exploits in accountability in a book, ``You Will Be Satisfied''
(Harper Business, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 9, when Bridgestone/Firestone announced the recall of
6.5 million tires, two-thirds of which were sold new on Ford sport
utility vehicles and trucks, customers have flooded Tasca's service
bays, demanding replacements. This week, before leaving to inspect
a Ford plant in Detroit, he talked about the recall. Here are
excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How well has Ford handled the recall?
</P>
<P>
   A. There was too much hesitation. They kept it hush-hush and
didn't bring it out in the open. At the time that they were aware
that a problem could have existed, that's when it should have
happened. Now we've got all this hullabaloo. When we changed tires
in Saudi Arabia, we should have changed tires in Texas. They should
have announced it that day. I would have preferred to see anybody
with a Firestone tire have the option of changing, but I don't
think it's going to happen. They aren't going to be able to produce
enough tires.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do customers say?
</P>
<P>
   A. They are fearful of putting their children in the car. When
you saw the accidents on the TV and in the newspaper, it didn't
look like the chance of surviving was going to be too good. People
are saying, ``I don't want to buy a Firestone tire; I don't want to
drive a car with a Firestone tire.'' There are people just scared
stiff of the name Firestone, which is unfortunate. I've always had
good experience with Firestone. I'm driving an Explorer Sport Trac
with Firestones.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 200 (vehicles) we checked, we changed about 36 sets, or
144 tires. I had to change ones that didn't have the defective
code, too. I had one elderly lady whose Firestone tires were not
that code who said: ``I am not going to drive the car. I'm going to
park the car right here.'' So I took the Goodyear tires off another
car and put them on hers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is this the biggest crisis you have seen with Ford?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've had callbacks my whole life. It is probably a scarier
callback than most of them, but we've had callbacks where the car
can catch fire because the fuel line was not routed properly,
callbacks where a bolt was not tempered properly and the front end
can fall off. But this will go down in the top 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long do you expect the clamoring to last?
</P>
<P>
   A. Today was one-fifth of yesterday. It's tapering off. It could
take three or four weeks. It might take some time to convince
people that if you've got a Firestone and it's not one of the bad
ones, you're OK If you can get people to believe that, you're over
the last hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   It's costing me money, between $5,000 and $20,000, but I never
worry about what it costs me to satisfy a customer. Obviously I
don't want to go bankrupt. But I've been with Ford for 57{ years.
It's too late to get divorced now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the recall frighten people away from Explorers and sport
utility vehicles?
</P>
<P>
   A. I sold nine Explorers the day before yesterday _ that's the
biggest Explorer day I've had all year. I changed the tires for
Goodyears on two of them. But the people like SUV's. Sure, they're
worried about safety, but we know how to make them safer, we know
how to make them more economical, and if that's what the market
wants, we'll do it. We're going to see a lot more SUV's, but
they'll be a different type SUV's. We've got an Explorer, an
Expedition and an Excursion _ I don't think we need them all.
You'll see the biggest ones trimmed down in size.

episodes are in production right now. Audiences Unlimited in
Universal City (818-753-3470) and Audience Associates on Melrose
Avenue near Gardner (323-653-4105) have free tickets to tapings of
popular returning comedies such as ``Everybody Loves Raymond,''
``The Drew Carey Show,'' ``Just Shoot Me'' and ``3rd Rock From the
Sun'' and newcomers like ``The Geena Davis Show'' and ``Bette.''
They also offer game shows such as ``The Price Is Right,''
``Hollywood Squares'' and ``Wheel of Fortune'' or late-night fare
like ``Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher'' and ``The Dennis
Miller Show'' _ the HBO one, not the ABC Monday Night Football one.
</P>
<P>
   To get into ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' line up at NBC
Studios, 3000 W. Alameda Blvd. in Burbank, by 4 p.m. the day of the
telecast. (If there's a big star or a hot musical guest on the
bill, plan on getting there early in the morning.) Tickets are
given on a first-come, first-served basis, with a limit of two
tickets per person. For more information, call (818) 840-4444 and
ask for audience services.
</P>
<P>
   There are standard rules to most television tapings: Leave those
cameras, video recorders and cellular phones behind, along with
children under the show's minimum age. And keep in mind most shows
hand out more tickets than the studio has seats to assure a full
house, so arrive early unless you want to feel like the loser in
musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   _Universal Studios Hollywood still has its famous features
including ``Jurassic Park: The Ride,'' ``Back to the Future'' and
the year-old ``Terminator 2: 3D,'' but it also has a few
attractions added this summer, among them the ``Rugrats Magic
Adventure!'' stage show; The Klumps, a special effects production
built around Eddie Murphy's ``Nutty Professor'' sequel; and the
``Chicken Run'' maze featuring clay animation models from the
movie. And now through Sept. 5, Universal is displaying all 27 real
Emmys (without winners' names, of course) that will be handed out
Sept. 10 at the 52nd annual Primetime Emmy Awards. It is the first
ever public display of the TV academy's winged statuettes.
Universal's Studio Tour tram ride recently underwent a face-lift,
with the addition of on-board monitors that show movie scenes
filmed in the backlot locations pointed out by the guide. For more
information, call (818) 622-3801.
</P>
<P>
   _Universal isn't the only studio offering tours. It's just the
one with the biggest advertising budget. Paramount (5555 Melrose
Ave., Hollywood), Warner Bros. (Hollywood Way and Olive Avenue,
Burbank) and NBC welcome the public for an inside look at the
movie- and TV-making process. Prices vary: $7 for a 70-minute
stroll around NBC (818-840-4444) with peeks at the ``Days of Our
Lives'' and ``Tonight Show'' sets; Paramount (323-956-1777) gives
escorted two-hour walks for $15 per person; and Warner Bros.
(818-954-1744) charges $32 for two hours, part on foot and part in
golf carts. Most tours set a minimum age, and tickets are given out
on a first-come, first-served basis except for groups' advance
reservations. There's no guarantee you'll see real movie stars or
get into busy soundstages; these are working lots and their first
priority is making movies and TV shows, not catering to the
curious. But tours offer a great opportunity to see how movie magic
is made.
</P>
<P>
   _If you've seen all the summer's best movies _ or should we say
``both''? _ head to the neighborhood video store and walk right
past that new releases section. Instead try the foreign language
aisle for an Akira Kurosawa epic such as ``The Seven Samurai'' or
his melodramatic ``Rashomon,'' Mexican director Alfonso Arau's
bittersweet ``Like Water for Chocolate'' or wonderful comedies such
as Jacques Tati's ``Mon Oncle'' or ``Mr. Hulot's Holiday.''
Although Italy's ``Life Is Beautiful'' is available dubbed in
English, it's only right to see it in the language that helped
writer-director Roberto Benigni earn his best-actor Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a total aversion to subtitles, there are many gems
hidden in the mainstream comedy, drama and action aisles. Consider
a few hot stars of the moment and look for one of their early
films, such as Tom Cruise's ``Risky Business,'' Minnie Driver's
``Circle of Friends'' or Martin Sheen's ``Badlands.'' There are
videos out there for nearly everyone. Ever appear in a community
theater production and laugh at yourself in the process? See
Christopher Guest's mockumentary ``Waiting for Guffman.'' Going
through home construction or remodeling hell and need
commiseration? Watch Cary Grant and Myrna Loy in the 1948 comedy
``Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House.''
</P>
<P>
   _Dodgers got you blue? Try an alternative sport once in a while,
such as polo at Will Rogers State Park, home field of the Will
Rogers Polo Club. There are games every weekend through Sept. 24 in
Pacific Palisades, with matches running 2-5 p.m. Saturdays and 10
a.m.-1 p.m. Sundays. And it's a bargain among L.A. sports _ just $3
per carload. Call (310) 573-5000 for schedule details, or (310)
454-8212 for other information.
</P>
<P>
   _It's hard to beat a beautiful summer evening at the Hollywood
Bowl, unless it's a beautiful summer day there watching a rehearsal
for free. The Los Angeles Philharmonic practices mainly Tuesday and
Thursday mornings, and there's a jazz soundcheck usually on
Wednesday afternoons. On Friday mornings you usually can catch the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra rehearsing, more often than not with the
weekend headliner. While you're there, stop in at the museum to see
photos, videos and interactive displays of the landmark's history.
There is no admission charge for daytime rehearsals or the museum.
Parking on the grounds is free until 4:30 p.m. For more information
call (323) 850-2000.
</P>
<P>
   _Of course, in Los Angeles entertainment is not merely a
spectator sport. In addition to tapings tickets, Audience
Associates (323-653-4105) also can get fans in front of the camera
through its aptly named Big Crowds business. You may be needed to
play a screaming groupie in a concert scene, a football fanatic or
a loyal party member cheering a candidate's speech. These are
unpaid extra positions but Cash Oshman of Audience Associates/Big
Crowds say they sometimes lead to paid assignments and membership
in the Screen Extras Guild. Oshman said groups of 50 or more can
use one of his assignments to raise money for their favorite
non-profit organization while working on a real film or TV shoot.
No promises that you won't be left on the cutting room floor, or
even that your face will be caught on camera, but at least you can
say you worked on a movie. That could be a good bragging point when
it comes time to rehash what you did on your summer vacation.

RECLIMBING THE REAL ESTATE CHARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 27) 
 By KATE MURPHY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ His hair is thinner, though still tinted red, and his
posture is slightly bent, but certainly not bowed. Harold Farb, the
flamboyant Houston apartment developer who gained national
attention for his excesses before he fell hard in the 1980s, is
back.
</P>
<P>
   Farb, 77, has spent the last 15 years selling office buildings
and trimming his apartment portfolio by 90 percent, in order to pay
off $455 million in debts from real estate deals that went bad when
the price of oil hit the skids and took the Texas economy with it.
He has also put behind him such costly indulgences as a supper
club, where he headlined as a lounge singer, and a glossy magazine
catering to Texas' rich and self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Farb is putting the finishing touches on a $25 million,
372-unit apartment complex in the suburban Kingwood section of
Houston _ his first project in a decade and a half. This time
around, Farb said, he will keep his business on a firmer
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Like many developers who lost their French-cuffed shirts when
the Texas real estate market crashed in 1983, Farb has become more
cautious. Gone are the days when he built 1,000-unit apartment
buildings and office towers as if he were playing with Legos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned I'm not invincible,'' said Farb, who before the
real estate collapse made the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest
people in America with an estimated net worth of more than $200
million. Yet, he added, ``I'm not running scared, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A cinema buff who has financed five albums of himself singing
show tunes, Farb has named his latest venture the Paramount, in
honor of the studio that made many of the films he enjoyed watching
as a boy in his father's two Houston movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The new apartment complex was built using the same builders,
landscapers, finance officers, accountants and lawyers whom Farb
hired in his heyday. But now, he said, they are contract workers,
not employees. Farb was also more selective about the location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingwood is zoned,'' he said, ``so I know there isn't going to
be a lot of junk going up around the property, like pawn shops and
liquor stores,'' which would diminish its value.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Inselmann, president of the American Metro/Study Corp., a
Houston company that compiles and analyzes housing data, said Farb
is emblematic of most developers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the Texas market getting sucked down the drain before
we started seeing a more studied and restrained approach to
building,'' Inselmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at the slightest hint that the Houston market was
going soft, new building permits started to tumble. They are
projected to fall to 4,000 this year from 20,000 in 1998, Inselmann
said. And the decline has come despite surging oil prices that have
buoyed the local economy and forecasts that 60,000 jobs, mostly
unrelated to energy, would be created this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would prefer to be safe than sorry,'' he said, adding
that Farb's new development could cash in on local builders'
overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   Farb said he couldn't be happier about his timing or about his
return to the apartment business. He is looking to develop more
residential properties in Houston as well as in Atlanta.
``Apartments are what I know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying away from office buildings and ventures like the
supper club and magazine that Farb said got him into ``trouble with
a capital T.'' (He is not as shy about marriage, despite his highly
publicized divorce in 1983 from his second wife, the socialite
Carolyn Farb, which cost him a reported $20 million, though he
disputes that figure. He has married four times since then,
including three separate ceremonies with his current wife, Diane
Lokey.)
</P>
<P>
   In focusing on apartments, he is playing to his strength. After
all, Harold Farb apartments were once the hip places to live in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were young and single and upwardly mobile in the 1970s,
you lived in a Farb,'' said Liz Dantone, a project manager for the
Friendswood Development Co., a former Exxon subsidiary that has
built several residential communities around Houston. ``He's still
a master at branding.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike apartments owned by an anonymous real estate investment
trust, Farb's have always been identified with their owner, with
his name and logo (showing him holding a rolled-up blueprint)
plastered all over the place. Comment cards addressed ``Dear Farb''
are in every manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landlords have such a negative image,'' Farb said. ``I've
always let my tenants know who I am and how they can get in touch
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, Farb personally answers complaints written on those
cards. He also visits his four properties daily, making
inspections, talking with maintenance men and striking up
conversations with tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone back to my roots of providing people with a nice
place to live at an affordable price,'' Farb said. Even while
charging cut rates _ his credo is ``rent $10 below market'' _ he
pays extra for amenities like resort-quality pool furniture and
high-end exercise equipment. ``I want it to be a poor man's country
club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pool at the Paramount will be graced with a 7-foot-high
statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, that he salvaged
from his defunct marble-and-mirrored supper club, the Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid $50,000 for that statue and now I have a place to put
it,'' he said, pleased with his thrift. ``My daddy told me to
always eat hot dogs, even if you can afford steak,'' Farb said.
That way, a reversal of fortune will not seem as severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still eat hot dogs,'' he said.

REPUBLICANS PRESS AHEAD WITH BILL TO REPEAL ESTATE TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shrugging off a veto threat, Republican
congressional leaders revved up a red tractor Thursday and
dispatched a Montana cattle rancher to ride from Capitol Hill to
the White House to deliver their latest tax-cutting proposal _ a
bill to repeal the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would phase out the tax over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But there is as much political symbolism in the bill's passage
as in the tractor ride through busy Washington streets.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's proponents say it will help those families who pass
down their farms and small businesses from one generation to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton is expected to veto the legislation in the
next few days on the ground that it will benefit mostly the rich,
not farmers and owners of small businesses. The estate tax is
levied on about 2 percent of all estates _ usually those worth more
than $675,000, but provisions of the tax code lift the threshold to
$1.3 million for family-owned farms and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they prefer smaller, more focused tax cuts that
preserve more of the budget surplus for other proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people learn about the dangerous exploding nature of
this tax plan, the less they like it,'' said Jake Siewert, a White
House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown over tax cuts comes just as the presidential and
congressional campaigns kick into high gear, giving Democrats and
Republicans a classic issue they can take to voters to underscore
their differences. ``It draws the contrast between: `What do you do
with the surplus?' '' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. ``Republicans want
to give the surplus back and Democrats want to spend it. Since we
can't agree, it goes to paying down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, who spent
the day discussing his overall tax-cutting plan, supports repeal of
the estate tax. His Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore,
prefers a narrower retooling of exemptions to benefit farmers and
small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a farmers market in South Carolina, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert appealed to Clinton to ``listen to the
farmers and small businesses of our country'' and not veto the
repeal of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unfair tax is so steep that sometimes the deceased
owner's children must break up a farm or sell a business just to
cover the tax,'' said Hastert, R-Ill. ``Your children should not
have to sell what you worked your whole lives to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the
House Ways and Means Committee, said Democrats empathize with
farmers and would like to offer them a tax break. But the tax break
should not be geared toward the rich, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leaders aren't really interested in getting
anything enacted that benefits the family farmer or small-business
owner,'' Rangel said. ``All they want is an excuse to hold more
political stunts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spearheaded a strategy this year that chopped up a
larger Republican tax cut package, which Clinton vetoed last year,
into smaller chunks. The estate tax bill is one of them. That
approach has made it more difficult for Democrats to oppose the tax
cuts, which are popular with voters, and it has allowed Republicans
to fend off accusations that they dominate a do-nothing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   To override a veto, a two-thirds majority is needed in the House
and the Senate. But the bill is not expected to pull that many
votes in the Senate, and perhaps not in the House, either.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Clinton vetoed another Republican tax cut proposal,
one aimed at married couples. Republicans are expected to try to
override that veto as well.
</P>
<P>
   If the estate tax bill is also vetoed, Republican leaders could
hold votes to override the two vetoes soon after Labor Day.

ADVERTISING: WITH A LAUNDRY TABLET, UNILEVER SELLS CONVENIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Campaign season is usually a time for airing dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case at Unilever's laboratory in Edgewater, N.J.,
where filthy socks fetch $3 a pair and soiled shirts are bought for
$15 each _ all in service of a coming marketing campaign to
introduce a revamped old product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a constant search for dirty clothes,'' said Sebastian
Munden, the British-Dutch company's North American laundry projects
director. ``We can never get enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever is locked in a race with Procter &AMP; Gamble to reacquaint
American consumers with the laundry tablet, a product they have not
seen since the late 1970s. The repackaging effort is part of a
strategy to shed its more obscure, ancillary products and pour
resources into marketing Wisk detergent and other core brands
including Ragu spaghetti sauce, Wish-Bone salad dressing and Lipton
tea.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes that coming up with new ways to squeeze
more sales from its stalwarts is the surest path to growth in a
slow-moving, somewhat beleaguered industry. Hence, the new Wisk
Dual Action Laundry Tablets, bound for stores in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often heard people talk of mature categories and tired
brands, but in the consumer products market I don't buy it,'' said
Charles Strauss, president and chief executive of Unilever's United
States operations. ``There are no tired brands; there are only
tired brand managers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Wisk tablets, according to the company's news release
announcing the planned introduction, ``offer the convenience of a
measured dose with excellent cleaning.'' They are ``designed to
dissolve quickly at the beginning of the wash cycle,'' correcting a
critical failure of tablets' first go-round.
</P>
<P>
   For Procter &AMP; Gamble, whose Salvo tablets were introduced in
1960 and then taken off shelves in 1978 because they did not always
dissolve well, the stakes are also high. After several quarters of
disheartening financial results that led to a management shake-up,
P&AMP;Gs stock has plunged more than 40 percent this year. The company,
which has been casting off brands to concentrate on market leaders,
hopes that Tide Rapid Action Tablets, the new incarnation of one of
its flagship brands, will help ease the pain. The tablets, which
have a special coating so that they dissolve immediately in the
washer, will be available in stores in September.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company expects consumers will suddenly do more laundry,
just to satisfy their curiosity over chalky tablets that fizz up
like giant Alka Seltzers in the washing machine. But the products'
widespread popularity abroad has convinced the two rivals that
convenience commands a premium price, resulting in greater revenues
as consumers abandon their measuring cups in favor of the no-mess
tablets.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where Unilever introduced a laundry tablet in 1998,
followed by Procter &AMP; Gamble roughly a year later, tablets make up
more than 20 percent of the $1.5 billion laundry market; together,
the companies' tablets command more than 50 percent of that market.
Propelled by a blitz of advertising created by agencies like
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, for P&AMP;G, and Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners Worldwide,
part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, for Unilever, and the
muscle of the two consumer products giants, the tablets have been
introduced into dozens of countries across the globe in little more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why the delay in bringing tablets to the United States market,
with roughly $6 billion in laundry detergent sales annually?
Strauss says the technology was developed overseas and had to be
adapted for this country's top-loading, quick-cycle machines that
tend to use colder water.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever said that it was reviewing marketing approaches it has
used elsewhere in the world and that Lowe Lintas was just starting
to look at how to market the tablets in the United States. The
campaign, the company said in the news release, would include ``TV
and print advertising, Internet, and promotional special events,''
with Alcone Marketing Group, a unit of the Diversified Agency
Services unit of the Omnicom Group, assigned to promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble declined to discuss details of its tablet
strategy, but did say that Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi would conduct the ad
campaign in this country.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brandweek, print ads for Tide tablets are set to
begin in November and run for six months, and TV ads will appear
from January through June.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing in tablets in most international markets, P.&AMP; G.
is poised to leapfrog its competitor and get Tide tablets into
stores in the United States about three months before Unilever's
Wisk tablets. But Unilever has sent assembly line workers from a
plant in Georgia to Italy to learn how to pack its new product
quickly, hoping to shave days off the time to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose days and weeks then you get worried,'' said Munden
of Unilever. ``Because you know those days and weeks count.''
</P>
<P>
   For Unilever, the tablets are one outcome of more than a decade
of whittling away extraneous business ventures. Since the 1980's,
it has cast off its fish restaurants, trucking business, printing
and chemical companies. In February, the company said it would pare
its 1,400 consumer products to 400 core brands that generate about
80 percent of its income.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Unilever has posted two strong quarters and
surpassed analysts' forecasts, quite an achievement in a sector
where warnings of missed earnings have become commonplace. It has
also gone on a shopping spree, buying Slim-Fast Foods, Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Homemade and Bestfoods within months of one another, a
strategy consistent with the company's singular attention to
big-name products.
</P>
<P>
   But other than the introduction of Dove deodorant earlier this
year, none of the surviving Unilever brands has received the
attention the company is now dedicating to Wisk tablets. Unilever
hopes these throwbacks to the 1970s will take as much as 20 percent
of the laundry market within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger things have happened. After all, platform shoes and
skin-tight jeans are back in style.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Thursday that if
peace talks with the Palestinians failed, he was prepared within
``a few weeks'' to invite Israel's conservative opposition to join
in a broad government of ``national unity.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was immediately rejected by the leader of the
opposition Likud, Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former general, who was
suggested by Barak as a possible foreign minister in a coalition
government. But it was widely perceived as a warning to the
Palestinians that if they fail to break the negotiating deadlock
soon, they may ultimately be confronted with a government far less
amenable to compromise on central issues of territory and
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was also seen as a warning to Orthodox religious
parties that have quit Barak's coalition in protest over the peace
negotiations. Last week, the prime minister said he planned to
launch a ``civic revolution'' that would challenge many of the
powers and privileges of the Jewish religious establishment, and a
coalition with the secular Likud could advance that initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader, in two radio interviews, coupled his
proposal for a governing alliance between his Labor Party and Likud
_ an uneasy left-right coalition that Israel last saw in the late
1980s _ with a challenge to Sharon, the Likud leader, to prove
Likud's credentials as a secular party and join him in such a
``civic revolution.'' Barak's plan to challenge the entrenched
power of ultra-Orthodox groups, and even of more moderate Jewish
institutions, stunned Israelis when he unveiled it last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Likud, under Ariel Sharon's leadership, is certainly a
natural partner to this social and civil agenda,'' Barak said in an
interview with Israel radio. He added: ``I call on the Likud people
to lend a shoulder to this march _ they are people who, just like
you and me, want security and peace and a proper civil society. On
this issue we are in the same boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon has said he opposes every major component of a peace deal
that President Clinton put forward and Barak tentatively accepted
at the recent summit meeting at Camp David. The deal included a
compromise on Jerusalem and an Israeli withdrawal from 90 percent
of the West Bank, including the strategic Jordan Valley. The Likud
leader has also rejected the proposal to reduce the power of the
Jewish religious establishment, calling it a political stunt that
goes far beyond anything most Israelis would accept.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Barak's proposals, Sharon said that the prime
minister should accept ``his failures,'' including the Camp David
collapse and the disintegration of Barak's majority in the Israeli
parliament, and bow to an early election _ an event many Israelis
believe would put Barak at a disadvantage because he might be
forced to defend the controversial concessions offered at Camp
David without the countervailing benefit of a final peace to offer
voters. ``Given his numerous concessions, particularly on
Jerusalem, and his failures on the domestic scene, there is no
place for us in the Barak government,'' Sharon said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In making these proposals, Barak appeared to have staged a
high-risk political raid, one aimed at breaking the mold of current
Israeli politics and reversing the tables on his domestic opponents
_ all apparently without consulting most of his closest political
associates.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, and uncertainty about Barak's motives, were all
the greater for the fact that it was only 15 months ago that he won
a landslide victory in Israel's first direct election contest for
the post of prime minister. That event, coupled with Barak's
forging of the broad One Israel coalition that united parties of
the left, center and right, raised widespread hopes among Israel's
5.9-million people, tired by the controversy and combativeness of
the previous prime minister, Benyamin Natanyahu, that Israel might
be in for a period of greater political stability.
</P>
<P>
   As Israelis struggled to absorb Barak's moves, two views
prevailed, reflecting the increasingly sharp divide among Israelis
over Barak. One, put forward by Sharon and his Likud associates,
was that Barak is ``flailing about'' for more promising political
ground as he sees his peace bid foundering, and seeking by any
means to avoid an election he would be far from certain of winning.
The other, favored by Israelis who badly want a peace agreement,
and by those who have exhausted their patience with the power of
ultra-Orthodox Jews, was that Barak had come up with a one-two
knockout punch that at a stroke put him back into the driver's seat
of Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, Barak, with his warning of an early Likud
alliance, maximized whatever slim chance there might be of reaching
an early peace agreement with Arafat, and prepared a political
fallback position in the event that no peace pact is forthcoming.
Likud, Barak's supporters said, would have to be wary of entering
an election in which Barak could present himself as the weary
battler for what he has called ``a brave peace,'' and as the first
Israeli prime minister ready to confront the Jewish religious
establishment head-on. Alternatively, it could join in the alliance
proffered by Barak, but with the dual handicap of being a minority
partner and prolonging Barak's power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In making his proposal, Barak's overriding concern appeared to
be with the peace process, and on this he struck a deeply cautious
note. In the face of Arafat's insistence that Palestinians want all
of east Jerusalem in a peace agreement _ or no agreement at all _
Barak said, in effect, that Israel could live without a peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it should become evident that we are unable, despite our
tremendous efforts, to reach a peace of the brave _ and I will no
make peace at any price or by any date, and certainly not the peace
of an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand _ if this is
impossible with our neighbors, then the proper thing to do is to
expand the government and establish a broad coalition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, prospects for a peace agreement have appeared to darken
in recent days, with Arafat returning from a 20-nation foreign tour
insistent that he will not compromise on Jerusalem, and Dennis
Ross, the State Department's peace envoy, shuttling between the two
sides here in the past week with no apparent success in breaking
the deadlock. Barak and Arafat have been exchanging long-distance
taunts, with Thursday being Barak's turn. ``The ball is entirely in
the other side's court,'' he said. ``It is in Arafat's court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Israelis think that the really explosive issue for Barak
may not be his peace proposals, but his challenge to Israel's
religious powers. In outlining those changes, he said it was time
for Israel to have a constitution that would give it a fuller
panoply of equal rights protections. He also called for the
dismantling of the religious affairs ministry, provisions for civil
marriages that would not require the approval of the rabbinate, and
a new military call-up law that would oblige members of
ultra-Orthodox families, currently exempted from army service, to
do service in the civilian sector.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals appear to have finalized the divorce between Barak
and the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, with a politically crucial bloc
of 17 parliamentary seats, which quit the ruling coalition in July
in protest against the concessions Barak carried to Camp David.
Shas leaders have said that Barak has ``declared a holy war on
religion, which he wants to eradicate from the state,'' but Barak
said on Thursday that this was nonsense. ``We have no intention of
leading anything which is anti-religious,'' he said. ``We will do
everything in the context of dialogue. Everything will be done with
an endeavor to reach a common position, but not at the price of
paralysis.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN PONDERS STRATEGY ON ATTACK ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cancellation this week of a harsh Republican
Party television ad attacking Al Gore's trustworthiness has exposed
tensions within the Bush campaign over whether _ and when _ to go
negative against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday morning that he had personally
stepped in to block the ad. But despite his insistence that voters
abhor negative advertising and yearn for an elevated discourse,
some of his advisers had argued that the party should run the ad,
according to officials close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's objections aside, the officials said that his campaign
was still poised to run other commercials that raise questions
about Gore's truthfulness and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty to let loose on,'' said one Bush adviser. ``We
can have a pretty effective fusillade. All the research has been
done. It's all there.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which the Republican Party pulled on Wednesday
after Bush intervened, used misleading excerpts from a six-year-old
interview in which a stammering Gore said President Clinton had not
lied in his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters Thursday that he objected to the
advertisement, which was financed by the Republican National
Committee. ``I think it's appropriate to challenge the man's
credibility,'' Bush said, referring to Gore. ``I don't think it's
appropriate to challenge the man's credibility in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, acknowledged that
some Bush advisers wanted to run the commercial. ``There were some
people who felt the ad was fine,'' she said. ``Some people felt the
ad was not fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush advisers were so determined that the campaign play
hardball against Gore that they urged that the commercial be used
even after concerns were raised about its fairness, according
people close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   And the night before the advertisement was pulled, Matthew Dowd,
a Bush campaign official, attended a focus group at which the
Republicans sought reaction to an assortment of possible
advertisements, including the one that was shelved.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions in the Bush campaign and at the Republican Party
over the advertisement reflect a continuing debate among Bush
advisers over strategy toward the Gore campaign. They take on an
urgency as polls show the race is tightening _ and each side is
struggling to gain an upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small matter given the tens of millions of dollars
that the campaigns will spend to frame the political discourse
through 30-second ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials and outside advisers said the campaign
had every intention to run commercials that could be defined as
negative. But they insisted that they had not settled on when _ and
that the timing and exact content is a matter of continued
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't mapped out,'' said one person familiar with the
advertising plans. ``This is all very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Bush campaign had a commercial that featured
Gore's infamous appearance at a Buddhist temple for a fund-raising
event, Hughes said: ``I will choose not to answer that question at
this point. I don't want to tip our hand.'' But, she added, ``We
believe that Vice President Gore's lack of credibility is an issue.
There are a variety of different scripts that are in the works that
deal with issues including credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people connected with the campaign said they were
mindful that critical advertisements, while often effective, could
also trigger a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, running advertisements against Gore would be
the best way to, as one Bush adviser put it, ``clip Gore's wings.''
The intention would be to drive up Gore's negative ratings _ and
halt his rise in the polls _ in the week since the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers said such a move could be particularly risky
for their campaign because Bush has tried to make a virtue out of
his desire to stay upbeat. In a commercial during the primaries,
Bush asserted, ``I believe oftentimes campaigns resort to mud
throwing and name calling. And Americans are sick and tired of that
kind of campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore also has to take care not to be labeled as too harsh
in his advertising, the Democrats have been skillful in cloaking
their negative advertising as part of issue advertisements. During
the Republican convention, the Democratic Party unleashed several
negative advertisements that, among other things, assailed the
record of Dick Cheney, Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign is not in quite the predicament of the
Bush campaign because the vice president never emphasized a desire
to remain positive. Another factor is that given the questions that
have been raised about Gore's fund-raising practices _ and the
scandals of the Clinton administration _ there are more questions
of a personal nature to raise about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go negative when you have promised not to go
negative because it raises the specter of hypocrisy,'' said Darrell
West, director of the Taubman Center for Public Policy at Brown
University. ``They have to follow the Clinton model. Those ads in
'96 often had 15 seconds of attack and 15 seconds of positive
appeal. It's a great way to shield yourself from the backlash.''

 WASHINGTON: the backlash.''

</P>
<P>
   West also said Gore should be careful in how he attacks. ``Gore
has the risk of coming across as an attack dog just because people
seem to like him a little less personally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has to be especially careful about advertisements that
attack Clinton because _ as the Republican Party found in the 1998
congressional campaign _ attempts to revisit the Lewinsky scandal
and others that have roiled the White House can backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Bush campaign does, the Republican Party intends to
run tough commercials against Gore. ``We will have ads that raise
questions about Al Gore's credibility and integrity,'' said
Clifford D. May, the party's communications director, ``because
there are plenty of questions to be raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party commercial, which was never broadcast,
suggests that Gore, in saying Clinton has not uttered an untruth,
was not acknowledging Clinton's misstatements about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But the advertisement was based
on an interview in which Lisa Myers, a correspondent for NBC News,
asked Gore about an attack he made on Oliver North, who was then
running for Senate from Virginia. The exchange about North was
edited out of the advertisement, which had the tag line, ``The tag
line: ``Think Al Gore will say anything?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he objected to the commercial because ``it had nothing
to do with the affairs of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   While the advertisement was pulled, clips of it were broadcast
on national television, including ABC News and NBC News programs,
as parts of stories about the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But even William Daley, the chairman of the Gore campaign, said
he did not think the Republicans were behind a plot to get free
publicity for the advertisement _ while making Bush look virtuous
by objecting to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little Machiavellian,'' he said.

POLITICS RUNS   THROUGH MORE   THAN CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ This town tends to generate hot air of one kind or
another year round, and the weather can get spectacularly toasty,
even in a coolish summer like this one. Luckily, the city
compensates with acres on acres of air-conditioned museum space,
and a lot of very good art to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the big museums aren't necessarily the main
attractions. The National Gallery of Art is focused on an Art
Nouveau blockbuster to open in the fall. The much-traveled Norman
Rockwell survey is at the Corcoran but will be heading to New York.
So, after you have seen the smart, laconic Ed Ruscha retrospective
at the Hirshhorn, you would do well to check out a few local art
paths less traveled by.
</P>
<P>
   My vote for most far-out show of the moment goes to ``Amazons in
the Drawing Room: The Art of Romaine Brooks'' at the National
Museum of Women in the Arts. The museum itself, two blocks from the
White House, is a trip, architecturally speaking. It was built in
1908 as a Masonic temple and later did active duty as an X-rated
movie theater. Its outstanding architectural feature is a soccer
field-size atrium with oddly disposed galleries running off it on
different levels. This unorthodox layout is actually well suited to
the art and life of Romaine Brooks (1874-1970), an expatriate
American painter who in a series of memorable portraits of women
succeeded in establishing a lesbian visual presence in
early-20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   Born Beatrice Romaine Goddard in Rome, Brooks was a daughter of
wealthy Americans. She had a dreadful childhood. Her father
deserted the family soon after she was born. Her unstable mother
alternated between sadistically punishing and ignoring the
children. (There was another daughter as well as a boy, St. Mar,
who died insane.) The artist worked for years on an
autobiographical account of her youth. She titled it ``No Pleasant
Memories.''
</P>
<P>
   She lived mostly in New York until 1896, when she went to Italy
to study art. On the island of Capri, she found a resort favored by
upper-class Europeans and Americans, with an extensive gay circle.
One of its members was John Ellingham Brooks, to whom she was
briefly married. She also met Somerset Maugham and Charles Lang
Freer, founder of the Freer Gallery of Art here. Freer may have
introduced her to the art of James McNeill Whistler, whose somber
palette she emulated.
</P>
<P>
   When her mother died in 1902, Brooks became rich and
independent. She settled in Paris, where she was an integral part
of the city's artistic haute monde. Her career flourished. Her
first one-person show was at the renowned Durand-Ruel Gallery and
was made up almost entirely of paintings of women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910 she had a fling with the Italian poet and politician
Gabriele D'Annunzio. The romance was brief, but they remained soul
mates, and his proto-fascist ideology had a lasting effect on her
thinking. (She painted a portrait of him as a kind of martyred Mr.
Sensitive; it's in the show.) They were also rivals for the
affections of the dancer Ida Rubinstein, a star of the Ballets
Russes. Brooks won the contest. Rubinstein became her lover and the
subject of a series of sensually zany portraits.
</P>
<P>
   In one morbidly erotic, Symbolist-tinged piece, Rubinstein
floats nude and dead pale on an Art Nouveau swirl of white paint
that suggests a bird's wing or a shroud. In another, she's dressed
in the uniform of a Red Cross nurse, with a starchy wimple. For
this patriotic image, painted during World War I, Brooks was
awarded the French Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   The affair with Rubinstein was soon over. In 1915 Brooks met the
Paris-based American writer Natalie Barney, with whom she began a
nearly lifelong relationship. Possibly as a result of Barney's
forthright Sapphist views, Brooks' portrait style became more
realistic and more intent on shaping a new concept of femininity.
</P>
<P>
   She tried various approaches. In a brash 1924 portrait of the
British aristocrat Una Troubridge, the companion of the novelist
Radclyffe Hall, her subject wears mannish clothes and a monocle
that contrast with her girlish bob and lipstick. Troubridge's prize
Dachshunds are by her side. Brooks, who had mixed feelings about
Hall, later hinted that she had meant the portrait as a joke, but
whatever her intentions, it's a groundbreaking, gender-bending
image.
</P>
<P>
   She could also be tender, as she is in ``Peter, a Young English
Girl,'' a portrait of the androgynous-looking British artist Hannah
Gluckstein, who went by the name of Peyter Gluck. Her well-known
1920 portrait of Barney, titled ``The Amazon,'' is done mostly in
soft gray-lavenders and furlike textures against a background of
falling snow.
</P>
<P>
   The two women came to lead a strangely insular existence in a
rapidly changing Europe. They were ahead of their time in their
attitudes about sexuality and gender. But as the art historian
Whitney Chadwick suggests in the exhibition catalog, they
subscribed to an ideal of a social, sexual and even racial elite
that led them to view Nazism favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Their insularity is also reflected in Brooks' art. Although she
lived in Paris during an epoch of exhilarating aesthetic
experimentation, she stayed, as many other artists did, with the
figurative style of an earlier day, branching out only slightly
with a series of automatist drawings in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no artist like her. In a 1923 self-portrait,
she presents herself, at age 49, with close-cropped hair, wearing a
top hat and a black hacking jacket, the scarlet Legion of Honor
ribbon in its lapel. Her pallor is intense: she has applied white
paint as if it were stage makeup, and her eyes are half-hidden by
the hat brim. Alert, glittering, self-possessed, they're barely
visible in reproductions, so it's a bit startling to see them when
faced with the picture itself in the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has carefully set up that reaction. One of the points of
the picture is that she's watching you before you get close enough
to look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's
deciding whether you're worth bothering with. Chances are, you're
not, at least not if you're approaching with the conventional
notions of what male and female mean. Whereas in the Troubridge
portrait, Brooks is still separating out signs of gender (pants,
lipstick), here she has created a new kind of being,
uncategorizable and unitary, in total control of her own identity.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also took control of her artistic legacy. Although she
lived most of her life in Europe, she left nearly two dozen of her
best portraits to the Smithsonian's American Art Museum, formerly
the National Museum of American Art, and they make up about half of
this show, which was organized by Joe Lucchesi, professor of art
and art history at St. Mary's College of Maryland. Whatever one's
quarrels with Brooks' unconscionable politics, her outspoken
lesbian presence in don't-ask-don't-tell Washington is a stroke of
poetic justice.
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR M. SACKLER GALLERY
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of politics and art is also an underlying theme
of three very different modest-size shows at the Freer and Sackler
galleries, adjoining museums that house the Smithsonian's
collection of Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heroic Past: The Persian `Book of Kings,''' organized by
Massumeh Farhad at the Sackler, is a visual essay on the
quasi-mystical role that kingship played in the culture of Iran.
Among the earliest items here is a superbly wrought fourth-century
Sasanian silver-and-gilt plate with an image of a ruler, probably
Shapur II, in the muscle-flexing pose of cosmic hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, leaping centuries, come manuscript paintings of scenes
from the ``Shahnama,'' or ``Book of Kings,'' the Persian royal
epic. The poem is endless _ some 50,000 verses _ but every newcomer
to the throne felt compelled to commission a freshly illustrated
version of it, as a symbolic seal of legitimacy for his reign.
</P>
<P>
   This is nice for the viewer, because the vivid narratives
frequently brought out the best in court artists. A page from one
of the greatest of such books, produced in Tabriz around 1525,
shows the heroic warrior Rustam being saved from a lion by his
horse, Rakhsh. In this case, the perilous encounter is turned into
an exotic ballet with a Leon Bakst set, gilt and baby blue, with a
lion as sweet as a kitten.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier painting of a battle scene, the sprightly and the
grisly are balanced. The Persian king Kay Khusraw may have the
benign face of an overgrown baby, but he is slicing off an enemy's
arm with his sword. Beneath him lies the corpse of a soldier, cut
in half and gushing blood. He's been placed in the margin of the
page, outside the picture itself, as if to push the realities of
war into the reader's sphere.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the intention of the work in a second Sackler
exhibition, ``A Well-Watched War: Images From the Russo-Japanese
Front, 1904-1905.'' The Japanese woodblock prints gathered here by
James Ulak, along with paintings by British magazine illustrators,
were designed as journalistic reports on the struggle between Japan
and Russia for the possession of Port Arthur, a warm-water harbor
in northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures are pure propaganda and sometimes almost as
fanciful as the ``Shahnama'' paintings: military leaders striking
valiant poses, enemies cut (or in this case blown) to bits.
Accuracy is blocked out by wishful thinking. One woodblock print
shows a Russian ship being attacked and destroyed by Japanese
torpedoes; but apparently the face-off never happened, or happened
differently; the ship was seen later intact and afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Many photographs of the war were taken, but the medium was still
regarded with suspicion, as either too realistic for public
consumption or not realistic enough. Instead publishers and
audiences alike favored cushioning, interpretive hand-wrought
images that turned war into an operatic spectacle.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   FREER GALLERY OF ART
</P>
<P>
   At the Freer, political realities run, however subtly, through
``Brushing the Past: Later Chinese Calligraphy From the Gift of
Robert Hatfield Ellsworth,'' a showcase of 20 works of late-18th-
through 20th-century calligraphy selected from the 260 given to the
museum by Ellsworth, a well-known New York collector, dealer and
historian.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Joseph Chang, the show is a modern history in a
nutshell of this most revered of Chinese art forms. Stylistic
currents are clearly traced. So is an organic, discursive pattern
of lineal descent, with artists taking cues from their immediate
forebears but also rummaging through the past, rejecting and
rediscovering and always extending the thread of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   This process was rocky in the later 20th century, particularly
during the Cultural Revolution, with its manic swings between
denunciation and approval of traditional forms. But resilient
voices persevered, and the Freer show, which comes with an
excellent catalog, is like an intimate party of mature, quietly
forceful personalities who seem young beyond their years.
</P>
<P>
   MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART
</P>
<P>
   Parties are also in progress at the National Museum of African
Art. The livelier of the two is titled ``A Concrete Vision: Oshogbo
Art in the 1960's'' and highlights the work of a group of artists
in the town of Oshogbo, a Yoruba commercial and religious center in
southwestern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Oshogbo was celebrated for its theater and dance
troupes. Then local visual artists joined forces with a few
European residents, notably Ulli and Georgina Beier, to explore
styles that combined African and modern Western elements. (Jacob
Lawrence lived and taught here in 1962.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work is figurative and refers to Yoruba myths and
beliefs, appropriate for a town that is a pilgrimage site for
Oshun, the goddess of waters. Of the 11 artists in the show,
organized by David Binkley, the best known is the man who calls
himself Twins Seven-Seven. (He was the only surviving child of
seven sets of twins.) He came to Oshogbo as a dancer, met the
artists and started to draw. He eventually settled on a format of
paint and ink on plywood with which he depicts spirits and
fantastic animals in intricate nets of color and line. He remains
active in the town today in art, music and local politics.
</P>
<P>
   A second exhibition, ``Trans-Atlantic Dialogue: Contemporary Art
in and Out of Africa,'' organized by Michael Harris, also deals
with cultural interaction, specifically between African-American
artists who have spent time in Africa and African-born artists who
have come to the West.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be affinities between the decorative paintings of
Skunder Boghossian from Ethiopia and those of the American artist
Jeff Donaldson, and between the puzzlelike geometries of certain
pieces by John Biggers and those of the African-born Moyo Okediji.
But the most dynamic pairing by far is in a compact room of
paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Nigerian-born Ouattara.
They met in Paris in the 1980s, by which time Basquiat had been to
Africa, and were friends in New York. Seen side by side, their
works generate a mutual energy that goes beyond a mere sharing of
motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the show feels tepid by comparison. This has to do
partly with the art, but the disjointed installation, which
straggles over two large rooms, has to take some of the blame. This
museum consistently exhibits contemporary work, which is great, but
it is still in search of an effective way to present it. The
pressure-cooker effect of the self-contained Basquiat-Ouattara
hanging may suggest a solution.
</P>
<P>
   TEXTILE MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   For a last look at the intricacies of cultural sharing, head
away from the Mall for the Textile Museum, on a leafy street near
Dupont Circle. Founded 75 years ago by the businessman and
collector George Hewitt Myers, it occupies a pair of brick town
houses that retain signs of their domestic origins. The museum has
some 16,000 textiles and carpets, a substantial research library
and permanent and temporary exhibition spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Its current show, ``Tribal Traditions: Village and Nomadic
Weaving of Anatolia,'' which opens Aug. 25, is drawn mostly from
the permanent collection and adds up to a rich little primer in the
flat-weave rug styles that have emerged around four cities in
Anatolia _ Bergama, Konya, Malatya and Erzurum _ in the last two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the designs, assertive and brightly colored, originated
in nomadic cultures and were meant to be clearly readable from a
distance. When nomads were forced to settle in one place, to
facilitate taxation by the Turkish government, rug patterns came to
be associated with particular villages. Some of these connections
are intact, though with more and more work done for commercial
markets, certain motifs have floated free for general use.
</P>
<P>
   Sara J. Wolf, the curator, manages to throw a light on all
aspects of this complex dynamic. In one inspired installation, six
prayer rugs seem suspended in mid-air: they represent the
distinctive and almost unvarying rug style perpetuated by a single
village group. By contrast, a rug completed just last year by a
village weaver named Hediye Ustun, in a region around the city of
Konya, is based on a motif borrowed from a neighboring village and
turned into a different, virtuosic variations-on-a-theme design.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get absorbed in this fascinating material, but be
sure to see ``Considering Excellence: Great Works From the Textile
Museum's Collections,'' the small show upstairs, through Nov. 5. It
includes a gorgeous tapestry-weave Peruvian poncho, a gold-threaded
Indian shawl and a sheer gauze-weave summer coat of yellow silk
from China. Perhaps most fetching of all, though, is an Iranian
prayer cloth from the 18th or 19th century: all white,
handkerchief-size, embroidered with minute silk flowers, it looks
as light and cool as a perfect summer day. &QL;

<P>
   BIALA RAWSKA, Poland _ In the past 10 years, Urszula Malinowska
and her husband have transformed their lives, turning a tiny farm
and orchard into a wood-processing factory that employs 35 people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after failed farming ventures, they bought a used
American machine to cut timber, a Wood-Mizer, and created a
business of making timber into lumber for the construction boom
that has transformed this area near Mszczonow, some 35 miles
southwest of Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they have $500,000 a year in revenue, produce their own
power and heat from the waste wood and sawdust and are planning a
more modern plant to work on more expensive woods for higher-profit
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Ursula Malinowska, at 48, could be a billboard for the new
market economy that has taken hold in Poland, the largest and most
successful country in central Europe in this transformation. She is
the active boss of one of 2 million small and medium-sized private
enterprises in a country of 42 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But like many Poles, she is not especially happy with the way
things are, and she is likely to vote for the reformed communists
of the Democratic Left Alliance in the parliamentary elections
expected next spring, dumping the more conservative Solidarity
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   To Malinowska, the changes have come with mixed blessings. ``The
great satisfaction is that we've built something new, and without
permission from anyone,'' she said, as her workers took large pine
logs and began to turn them into lumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``As owners, there is a great feeling of responsibility, and we
work from 6 to 6,'' she added. ``But there is a sense of achieving
one's goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, `` There are lots of problems.'' Small
businesses do not get much help from the state; the tax laws are
complicated and contradictory; there is an effective state monopoly
on the supply of lumber, given the difficulties of trade with
Russia, Ukraine and Belarus; and with Poland still outside the
European Union and membership probably four years away, she feels
that ``our Western partners take advantage of our weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The sourness is widely felt by Poles, whose rapid progress is
nonetheless falling behind their own expectations. While young
people are full of confidence, many Poles still have a deep fear of
being marginalized, of falling behind, both as individuals and as a
nation striving to join the rest of Europe as an equal, said Jacek
Kucharczyk, deputy director of the Institute of Public Affairs, an
independent Polish research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poland is a country doing better than it feels _ it's doing
better than it thinks it's doing,'' Kucharczyk said. Surveys show
that more than 50 percent of Poles think theirs is a better country
than it was 10 years ago, and only 30 percent disagree, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But change is still frightening to those who are over 40. And
the current Solidarity government's biggest undertakings _ to
decentralize and streamline health care, education, pensions and
provincial administration _ have caused enormous anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   With more to lose, there is also a growing concern about
personal safety and crime, and a feeling that the police are not
keeping up with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even the prospect of joining the European Union has raised
considerable fear _ not just among the many farmers who fear
European competition, but also among those who worry that Poland
will give up some of its precious identity, after centuries of
struggle to shape and preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   What is the Polish nightmare? ``To be the Mexico of Germany:
proud, important, too big to fail but deeply unbalanced next to a
neighbor that is too rich and too big,'' one European ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
   Poles are more pessimistic these days, said Halina Binczak,
economics editor of the respected daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
In polls, only about 8 percent of Poles think the reforms are going
well. Five years ago, she said, 60 percent of households had
trouble making ends meet. Today, it's some 40 percent. ``Yet five
years ago, people were more optimistic than now,'' she said. ``Our
aspirations are rising faster than our possibilities. People are
less satisfied with what they have, even though they have more.''

</P>
<P>
   Yet the signs of new prosperity are everywhere in Poland. In
Mszczonow, a small town of some 6,000, there are scores of new
shops _ bakeries, groceries, hardware stores, hairdressers _ that
did not exist 10 years ago. The town has streetlights now, put up
four years ago. Farmers are growing a special kind of apple that
feeds good, tart concentrate into blended juices. There is one
large industrial park, Europark, already in operation, with another
soon to open.
</P>
<P>
   On this main route near Warsaw, there are hundreds of trucks
from all over Europe and the former Soviet Union. Servicing them
are large gas stations, looking like modern palaces, with cafes and
small grocery stores attached. (And in a sign of the increased
traffic, numerous prostitutes line up at intervals along the
roadway.)
</P>
<P>
   The roads are crammed with new cars. Poles have bought more than
500,000 new cars each year for the last four years, reflecting the
prosperity and an explosion in consumer credit, but posing dangers
for more inflation, already at 11.6 percent in July, a two-year
high.
</P>
<P>
   And they use their cars to shop at huge supermarket complexes in
the suburbs, where Ikea rubs up against KFC and McDonald's and
Carrefour and Geant superstores.
</P>
<P>
   But for all this wealth, the infrastructure lags far behind.
Warsaw traffic is bad, and there is barely a subway system, with
only one short route. The telephone system, reluctantly changing
from a state monopoly, is inefficient, compared with the Czech
Republic's or even Romania's, and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   There are few highways, and the two-lane roads _ effectively
three-lane, with expensive cars zooming around buses, trucks and
the little old Polski Fiats that can't go much over 60 miles an
hour _ are often seamed and channeled, with heavy traffic punishing
roadbeds built for less booming times.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Road fatalities are consequently a major issue, with large green
and black signs displaying the number of dead and injured at
particularly bad spots. A billboard campaign shows wrecked cars
with large, one-word slogans: ``Autoagresja'' and
``Autodestrukcja.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Like its roads, Poland's politics are messy and crowded, still
driven by the ideologies of the battle, 20 years ago, against
communism: Reformed communists versus the Solidarity coalition,
which itself is a very broad group of some 30 parties. Although its
roots are in a trade union, Solidarity is center-right in politics.
Some of the best-known intellectuals associated with Solidarity,
like the historian and former Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek,
formed the Freedom Union, further to the right. And then there are
farmers' parties and some Roman Catholic parties that veer toward
ultranationalism, exemplified byRadio Marya, a radio station
supported by a vocal minority of Poland's priests.
</P>
<P>
   But as everywhere in the former Soviet-bloc countries, patronage
and corruption still play too large a role in politics, with
parties and ministers often getting kickbacks from businesses and
lobbyists for contracts or favors.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish government itself asked the World Bank to look into
corruption last year, and was told that the main problem is graft
among legislators, ministers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, everyone agrees, Poland's biggest problem is the
deficit in the current trade account _ with imports, fed by new
prosperity and credit, growing more rapidly than exports. The gap
is now almost 8 percent of gross domestic product, said Binczak of
Rzeczpospolita. The government has to do more, she said, to support
exporters with credits and tax breaks or risk a currency crisis and
a reduction in foreign capital flows that finance the budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Polish exports have at least quadrupled in the past
decade, with more than 70 percent of exports going to countries of
the European Union and only 10 percent now going to Russia, said
Witold M. Orlowski of the Independent Center for Economic Studies.
The economy has grown an average of about 5 percent a year over the
past several years, and the government estimates $12 billion this
year in foreign direct investment, after last year's record $8
billion _ a serious vote of confidence by hardheaded foreign
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and analysts are concerned that the minority
Solidarity government, facing likely elections in the spring over
the 2001 budget, will increase the budget deficit too much with
populist spending, to try to fight slowly rising unemployment,
estimated at 13.5 percent this year. But Binczak and others believe
that the fundamentals of economic policy are set, in part by the
markets and the pressure to join the European Union, and that the
politicians will not want to disrupt them too badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming sense is that the Poles are going in the
right direction,'' a Western ambassador said. ``This is no longer a
grimy little East European country trying to keep its head above
water, but a country taking its place in Europe.''
</P>

<P>
   Agriculture remains the biggest structural challenge to a
modernizing Poland _ and to its entry into the European Union. Some
25 percent of Poland's work force lives in the poorer countryside,
many of them on small farms. But of the country's 2.1 million
farms, only half sell significant amounts to the market. The other
half are subsistence farmers whom no one wants to suddenly move
into the cities. The European Union will help, but wants to contain
the size of the subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, protected by socialism, are the ones most concerned by
the new Poland, which they see as a land of high taxes, falling
farm prices and rising prices for fertilizer, fuel, seeds and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In Skorzec, a tiny village about four miles south of
Ciechanowiec, two farmers, Czeslaw Bojar, 59, and his neighbor,
Kazimierz Murowski, 64, stopped work to chat and complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bought my first tractor, under communism, it cost 27
pigs,'' Murowski said. ``Today, it costs 100 pigs.'' He stopped to
scratch. ``It's not that we liked communism, but life was better
for us then.''
</P>
<P>
   Bojar has six sons and worries that his farm, roughly 25 acres,
will not be big enough for all of them and that some will find
themselves in the cities, unemployed. As for the European Union, he
said: ``I can't know the future, and people disagree. But when we
join the E.U., it will be like a bulldozer and break down all the
walls, and then who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Murowski said everything was comparative. ``I remember how it
was after the war, with everything destroyed and nothing to eat,''
he said. ``Well, it's better to be poor in peace than rich in
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the farmers have cars, heat, telephones and television, a
big change from 15 years ago, they admit, and their neighbors, with
a new roof and siding on their house, are off working in Belgium,
earning good money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were a communist country, they said we'll be in heaven
one day, and now they say it'll be even nicer that we're not
communists anymore,'' Bojar said. ``And we, we still hope it will
be better than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Karol Szyndzielorz, a former journalist turned businessman, put
it simply. ``Poles cannot believe it, but it's true,'' he said.
``Poland is now a lucky country.''

 &HT;    Clinton to laud Nigeria for transition from ``pariah to
partner'' &HT;    By MICHAEL HEDGES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After snubbing Nigeria's military dictatorship two
years ago, President Clinton will visit the sprawling African
nation Saturday and laud its dramatic transition from ``pariah to
partner'' when he meets with its democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit to Nigeria signals our strong support for the most
important democratic transition in Africa since the collapse of
apartheid,'' national security adviser Sandy Berger said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It underscores opportunities opened by Nigeria's shift from
pariah to partner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there is promise in the three-year shift to democracy by
Africa's most populous nation led by President Olusegun Obasanjo,
there are also reasons for caution, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria is still in really deep political trouble,'' said
Larry Diamond, a senior analyst at Stanford University's Hoover
Institution. ``I'm not certain the Clinton administration realizes
how deep that trouble is.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Clinton's trip is democracy, but pragmatic foreign
policy, economic and business items also appear on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian official hope the visit will signal relief from the
country's crushing international debt of about $32 billion. While
U.S. officials said agreements on debt relief are not expected
during the visit, Clinton will likely increase U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   The president will also offer help on combating AIDS and other
infectious diseases, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton will push Nigeria, a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Counties, to increase its oil output from the 2
million barrels a day it now produces.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 trade and business agreements will be signed during
the visit, according to U.S. officials. That includes deals with
private companies for everything from sugar to telecommunications,
as well as some government-to-government accords.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit coincides with the arrival this week of the
first of 400 U.S. troops who will train Nigerian soldiers as
peace-keepers in neighboring Sierra Leone. But Berger said Clinton
is not expected to meet with any of the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   After two days in Nigeria, Clinton will journey to Tanzania at
the request of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela. There,
Clinton and Mandela hope to witness the signing of an initial
agreement aimed at ending a war between Hutus and Tutsis in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Clinton leapfrogged Nigeria while on a tour
of Africa, a snub designed to express displeasure at the brutal
dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, four of the nations visited by Clinton _ Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Rwanda and Uganda _ have embroiled eastern and central
Africa in war, while Nigeria has stunned some analysts by taking
the first shaky steps toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials vigorously made the case this week that Nigeria
represents ``our best chance to save western Africa,'' as one State
Department expert said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger and others have credited President Obasanjo with trying
hard to restore order, bind ethnic wounds and heal the country's
critical-list economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Diamond, the Hoover Institution analyst, noted that Clinton,
for security reasons, is only going to Abuja, a sterile capital in
the center of the country, far away from the turmoil in its south,
north and east.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it say when the Secret Service feels that the
president shouldn't even leave Abuja?'' Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's transformation began in early 1998 when Abacha
mysteriously died, paving the way for a return to power of
Obasanjo, who had briefly ruled in the 1970s but had later been
thrown in prison during one of the country's intermittent military
coups.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha ``stole more than $5 billion from the state, protected
drug cartels and crime syndicates, arrested his adversaries,
including Obasanjo, and murdered others and turned Nigeria into the
poorest oil-rich country in the world,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The political and social upheaval unleashed during the
dictatorship has not diminished in the past two years of Obasanjo's
government, even by the most optimistic assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obasanjo is sitting on an extremely chaotic situation,'' said
Diamond. ``The country is being pulled apart by religious groups in
the north and by people in the south who feel they should have more
control over the oil in that region.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and other groups have criticized Obasanjo
for human rights abuses. Earlier this year he ordered a town of
insurgents destroyed in the oil-rich Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption remains widespread in both the private sector and
among government officials, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   Religious differences threaten to split the country.
Christianity is practiced in much of Nigeria. But in eight northern
states which are predominantly Muslim, Shariah, or fundamentalist
Islamic law, has been declared the legal code by local governors.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this ``years of neglect of the people, poor governance
and corruption and you don't fix that overnight,'' said Jerry
Kepes, a director at the Petroleum Finance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kepes said a failure to distribute Nigeria's profits from its
immense oil reserves _ the country sells 2 million barrels of
high-grade crude oil a day _ have led to horrific episodes where
locals puncture pipelines to steal gasoline, leading to fireballs
that have incinerated hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   But, Berger insisited, ``for the first time in 20 years the
people of Nigeria are aggressively addressing these challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous for Africa, and high for the rest of the
world, Berger said. With an estimated 120 million people and
billions of barrels of oil, Nigeria could become a stabilizing
influence on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation remains crushingly poor, with a per capita income
measured in hundreds of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a make or break transition,'' Berger said, ``not just
for Nigeria but for Africa. If Nigeria succeeds, this could help
lift the whole region to prosperity and peace. If it fails it could
swamp the whole region in turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond agreed with the stakes. ``We badly need Nigeria to join
South Africa as an anchor of stability in Africa,'' he said. ``I'm
just not sure the Clinton administration appreciates the depths of
the problem.''

CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT SUPPORTS MAVERICK THEORY ON ORIGINS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A maverick theory about the origin of life has received striking
support from an experiment that mimicked the violent interactions
of deep seated rock and common gases during the Hadean epoch, the
days when the earth had just formed as a planet.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found to their surprise that even in these hellish
conditions they created a chemical known as pyruvate, which is
crucial for the metabolism of living cells.
</P>
<P>
   Pyruvate is the fuel for a universal energy-producing process
known as the citric acid cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The work, by George D. Cody and his colleagues at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory, is being
reported Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding does not explain how or where life began but it
supports a theory that proposes a new way of looking at this long
intractable problem. The theory, proposed by a German patent
attorney, Guenther Waechtershaeuser of Munich, holds that the
origin of life should be sought by looking for a metabolism, some
repeated cycle of chemical change, that may have taken place on the
early earth and that may then have built itself up into more
complex molecules and organisms.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts with the conventional approach, which is to take
familiar parts of today's cells, like nucleic acids, and try to
figure out the conditions in which they may have formed
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Waechtershaeuser dismisses the latter approach as the broth
theory because even when a researcher has found conditions under
which the individual chemical ingredients of life may have been
formed, it is hard to explain why they should then assemble
themselves into living cells.
</P>
<P>
   He calls his own proposal the iron sulfur world theory because
he believes that the metallic surfaces, particularly those of the
common mineral iron sulfide, would have been promising
facilitators, or catalysts, of the chemical reactions that created
the precursor chemicals of living cells.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for amateurs, even qualified chemists like
Waechtershaeuser, to contribute to the specialized worlds of modern
science. And his ideas, being only theoretical, did not arouse much
enthusiasm until 1997 when he showed that an iron sulfur surface
could promote the conversion of carbon monoxide to a two-carbon
chemical important in biochemistry of living cells.
</P>
<P>
   To biochemists, his finding had particular resonance because at
the center of many enzymes are iron and sulfur atoms that transfer
electrons in ways vital the cell's energy requirements. The idea
that living cells result from some primitive chemical cycle that
got going on an iron sulfur surface is to them not so alien.
</P>
<P>
   Cody and his colleagues decided to use a special high pressure
apparatus to explore how Waechtershaeuser's proposed system might
work in locations like the volcanic vents in the deep ocean. This
kind of chemistry is a dangerous pursuit since at high pressures
water becomes a violent acid and carbon monoxide eats through
steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to explore the ability of minerals to catalyze
reactions that would be important in a primitive metabolic sense,''
Cody said. Putting iron sulfur, a source of carbon monoxide, into
their reaction tube, ``we came across an unanticipated result,'' he
said, referring to the large amount of pyruvate formed. The tube
also contained a hydrogen sulfidelike chemical to mimic the
hydrogen sulfide produced by volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Pyruvate consists of three carbon atoms linked together, and is
an obvious building block from which sugars and the other
carbon-based molecules of life can be constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Waechtershaeuser believes the origin of life lies in a process
known as autocatalysis, the emergence of some natural chemical
process, like the pyruvate-producing one, in which the products
help the reaction go faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution is better and better autocatalysis,'' he said in a
phone interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If one of these autocatalytic processes started to generate the
class of fatty chemicals known as lipids, these might form a bubble
around the system, and the first cell would be generated. The cell
would have left the surface on which it was generated. And later,
it would have developed, as a byproduct, the elaborate
information-storage system embodied in today's DNA molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W.W. Adams, a biochemist at the University of Georgia
who studies early life, said Waechtershaeuser had developed a very
reasonable and testable hypothesis for the origin of organic
material relevant to life. ``It makes so much sense to have metal
catalysts involved at the dawn of life, especially metal sulfides,
because these are essential to most energy conserving processes,''
Adams said. ``I very much think he is on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written commentary on Cody's report Waechtershaeuser said
that, with the creation of pyruvate, all of the eight sequential
steps needed to make peptides from carbon monoxide had now been
shown to be chemically possible. Peptides are short chains of amino
acids, the components of the protein molecules that are the
workhorses of the living cell.
</P>
<P>
   The new results ``greatly strengthen the hope that it may one
day be possible to understand and reconstruct the beginnings of
life on Earth,'' he wrote.

TEST GAP WIDENS BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich., Pa.)   (ADDS 4th graf to put stats in context)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gap between test scores of black and white students that had
narrowed through the 1980s widened from 1990 to 1999, according to
results released Thursday by the federal Department of Education,
with the average black 17-year-old reading only about as well as
the average white 13-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Most perplexing, officials said, is that the gap is widest among
children of the best-educated parents, where average scores by
white students remained relatively steady while those of blacks
fell back toward the lower achievement of the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That data suggest that what was once considered an urban
problem, the consequence of poverty and disadvantage, has become a
suburban problem, too, one that may result from lower expectations
by teachers, a lower number of black students taking tougher
courses, or different attitudes about education among black
students.
</P>
<P>
   Such disparity in test performance, which has also been seen
from analysis of SAT scores, has become one of the most challenging
issues in American education. Evidence of a similar pattern in
these tests, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, is
more indicative of the situation in U.S. schools because it
includes students from all groups, not merely those who are seeking
to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and officials say there is no clear explanation for
why progress slipped after the gains of the 1980s in the next
decade of remarkable prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a depressing reversal of the gains made over the past
two decades,'' said Michael T. Nettles, vice chairman of the
National Assessment Governing Board, which monitors results of the
test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress. ``The
alarming part is that since 1992, the gaps have been getting
wider.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are still gaps between white and Hispanic students,
those continued to narrow over the past few years, the test results
show.
</P>
<P>
   And while blacks are catching up to whites in performance of the
basic skills, showing an ability to do simple arithmetic, for
example, they are slipping further behind whites when asked to do
more complicated work, like fractions, percentages or decimals.
This, officials said Thursday, suggests that efforts by states like
Texas to make sure more students know the basics before they
graduate from high school have paid off. The challenge now, they
say, is for states to demand even higher levels of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we take action to address the gap, then we should
expect it's going to continue in this direction,'' said Nettles, a
professor of education and public policy at the University of
Michigan. ``What we've learned from this trend report is that when
we take action, we get results.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests are given every few years, in different intervals,
depending on subject, to samplings of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds.
While other versions of the national tests have changed to reflect
changing curriculums, this test, known as the long-term trend test,
has stayed essentially the same over the 30 years it has been
administered to about 16,000 students around the country. It is
considered the most reliable and unbiased survey of U.S. students'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The overall results revealed some positive signs. Girls, in
particular, have made striking gains in math and science, and math
scores overall have improved consistently from the 1970s through
1999. But reading scores remained flat or dropped. And science
scores of 17-year-olds were lower in 1999 than they were when the
test was first given in 1969.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley and other officials emphasized
Thursday that blacks had made progress since the tests were first
given. In almost every subject at every age level, the average
scores of black were higher than they were in the late 1960s or
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, they said, is a new pattern of slipping. Among
9-year-olds in science, for example, the gap in scores between
blacks and whites narrowed to 41 points in 1999 from 57 points in
1970. But that 41 points is up from 37 points in 1996. Among nine
indicators _ three age groups in three subjects _ the gap has
widened in seven since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it has slipped back to where it was in the early
1970s. Among 17-year-olds, for instance, the gap in science scores
widened to 52 points in 1999 from 47 points in 1996, almost back to
the 54-point difference noted in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has grown most strikingly in ranks of children of the
better-educated parents.
</P>
<P>
   In reading scores of 17-year-olds in 1971, there was a 44-point
difference between whites and blacks whose parents had gone beyond
high school. That narrowed to 27 points in 1990, but then grew
again to 36 points in 1999. While the average white score remained
relatively stable, the average black score rose to 279 in 1990 from
261 in 1971 and then slipped back to 268 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said Thursday that the gap was not a reflection of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can say with total confidence is this is not an IQ
story,'' said Abigal Thernstrom, author, with her husband, Stephan,
of ``America in Black and White'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997) as well
as a forthcoming book on the test gap. ``Black IQ scores haven't
gone down, and we are seeing too many success stories. This is a
story about schooling. You look at places that really are doing a
great job with highly disadvantaged urban kids _ and they exist all
over this country _ and you know it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great
City Schools, a coalition of about 60 school districts, said that
cities where the gap had narrowed significantly, like Houston and
Philadelphia, offer preschool to all children, successful
after-school programs, smaller class sizes and require students to
take rigorous courses.

   No Lasting Problems Seen for Mitsubishi in Japan
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public humiliation that it had concealed customer
complaints about defects for more than two decades, Mitsubishi
Motors, Japan's fourth-largest carmaker, is not likely to suffer a
significant loss in sales or damage to its brand image in Japan,
analysts say. For one, analysts said, both Fuji Heavy Industries,
the maker of Subaru, and Daihatu Motors were forced to recall cars
in the late 1990s, with little effect on sales. And despite the
deception in Mitsubishi's case, there was no evidence that the
defects had caused any fatal or otherwise serious accidents,
further limiting potential public reaction to the recall of 620,000
cars and trucks.

   Medical `Buyers' Clubs' Crop Up
</P>
<P>
   Some new companies are beginning to offer below-market prices on
prescription drugs and services like doctor, dental and eye care
and medical tests. Like buyers' discount clubs such as Costco, the
companies attract people looking for a better price.

   Nintendo Announces New Console
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo offered the opening gambit in what is certain to become
a bitter battle of new technology and cost-cutting in the home
video game industry. It announced both a new home console based on
an IBM PowerPC chip and a new version of its handheld Gameboy
system. Neither system is scheduled to arrive in the United States
market before next year. The American depository receipts of
Nintendo fell 25 cents, to $21.75.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Up on Good Corporate News
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose as Wall Street cheered upbeat corporate news and
signs that interest rate increases may be coming to an end. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 38.09 points, to 11,182.74, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.34 points, to
1,508.31. The Nasdaq composite index gained 42.27 points, or 1.05
percent, to 4,053.28.

   Ex-Fund Manager Charged in Fraud

   Michael Berger, who managed the Manhattan Investment Fund, was
charged with defrauding 300 people who invested about $575 million
while losing about $400 million.

   Ford Rejects Broader Tire Recall
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor officials lashed out at plaintiffs' lawyers suing the
automaker and Bridgestone/Firestone, accusing them of endangering
public safety by calling for a broader recall of tires and of
distributing Ford documents out of context to journalists. ``A
broader recall is wrong,'' said Helen Petrauskas, a Ford executive.
``It's wrong because many good tires will be delivered and used to
replace good tires _ and people who have tires which should be
replaced will have to stand in line and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   No Rush Seen on Fuel Economy
</P>
<P>
   A government report to be released as early as today reaches few
conclusions about the effects of tightening federal fuel-economy
regulations for cars, making it virtually certain that the rules
will not be changed by Congress before the end of this year.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN IN NEW YORK,' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder.
Directed by Joan Chen (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this embarrassing
1940s-style weepie, Gere is a superstar Manhattan chef and ``older
man,'' a la Cary Grant, and Ryder the kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old
hat designer who reforms him. Oh yes, she happens to be dying of a
rare heart disease and has only a year to live. It isn't the
actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture of 40s suds ( Ryder's
character grows more ethereally beautiful the sicker she gets) and
millennial sexual angst doesn't jell (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `BLESS THE CHILD,' starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy
Smits. Directed by Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes). A runny
supernatural soap opera _ the first thriller of the ``Touched by an
Angel'' era _ that tries for the elegant calm of ``The Sixth
Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its flamboyantly
cheesy reflexes. Basinger is the protector aunt of a child (the
gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her the target
of an evil cult leader ( Sewell, chewing his English accent as if
it were sunflower seeds). He means to kill her before Easter; you
may feel the need to leave long before then. ``Bless the Child''
seems derivative of so many other movies that you're surprised it
doesn't have to credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when
they sample songs. With Smits as an FBI agent and Ian Holm as a
priest who does a laughable steal from ``The Usual Suspects''
(Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CECIL B. DeMENTED,' starring Melanie Griffith, Stephen Dorff,
Ricki Lake and Patricia Hearst. Written and directed by John Waters
(R, 88 minutes). Waters' newest comedy portrays the ultimate cult
director ( Dorff) as a punk madman, part Charles Manson, part Andy
Warhol, leading a band of freaky ``cinema terrorists'' in blows
against the Hollywood empire. When they kidnap a spoiled star (
Griffith) and force her, Symbionese Liberation Army style, to
commit terrorist acts that become their movie in progress, she
gleefully takes to her new role. The targets range from Pauly Shore
to ``Patch Adams'' to ``Forrest Gump.'' Although smart and funny,
the movie lacks the maniacal edge of Waters' most memorable work
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELL,' starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince
Vaughn. Directed by Tarsem Singh (R, 110 minutes). A serial killer
named Stargher ( D'Onofrio), who abducts women and imprisons them
in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with water, has a seizure and
goes into a coma. His latest victim is trapped in his cell, and she
has to be found before the automated torture takes her life. An FBI
agent ( Vaughn) talks a child psychologist ( Lopez) into using an
experimental technique to enter the killer's subconscious. Singh's
talents haven't quite jelled into storytelling yet. He folds this
tale over and over on itself, working with a script that blends
elements of ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,'' ``The
Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape'' and ``Spellbound'' with the
stop-motion animation of the brothers Quay (``Street of
Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt Mahurin, the paintings
of Francis Bacon and so many other things that there's no there
there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLLOW MAN,' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Directed
by Paul Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes). Verhoeven's sluggish new
special-effects thriller takes a tantalizing premise _ the
corrupting effects of invisibility _ and drowns it in horror-movie
hack work. Bacon plays an egomaniacal scientist who injects himself
with a serum that disrupts his ``quantum synchronization with the
visible universe.'' You can guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his
colleagues (including his ex-girlfriend, played by Shue) through a
labyrinthine underground laboratory, looking, thanks to
computer-generated imagery, like a plasticine anatomical model on a
rampage (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY,' starring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike
Lee (R, 117 minutes). Filmed before a live audience on two nights
in February in Charlotte, N.C., the self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy
swagger across the stage, urban legends in resplendent outfits.
Until a couple of years ago the comedians' exposure was limited
mostly to cable television. Here their comedy gives audiences that
have never seen anything like it a hilarious window on a new world.
They display their chops when they talk about family, specifically
African-American family with roots in the South (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,' starring Eddie Murphy and
Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In
this sequel Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he
deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation on
the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every scene in
which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth of
transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family _
all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE REPLACEMENTS,' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
Directed by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes). This negligible
jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho clowns who suit up for
pro football during a players' strike, just wants to be loved: is
that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate picture stars Reeves as
the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback. (He glides through.)
Hackman musters his requisite command as the honorable, stoic
fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry Collection,
mouthing dialogue from ``Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines
commercials. The unvaried ragtag scab players include a pair of
violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael Taliferro), a
violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan to the league
(Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who resolves not
to date players and dates Reeves anyway. It's a peculiarity from
L.A., a union town: a film that celebrates anti-union activity
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING GRACE,' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of
comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British
eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case
a Cornish village. Blethyn is Grace, a widow whose husband
committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of
losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener (
Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay) convert her greenhouse
into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee
hybrid of ``The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and
Chong (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SPACE COWBOYS,' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Directed by Eastwood. The
second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the
standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood himself leading a
heroic team of astronauts that also includes Jones, Sutherland and
Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic,
tough-old-guy interplay among these four sublime actors, is a
boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Sutherland
and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden,
playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the
villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot
at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   `STEAL THIS MOVIE!,' starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Janeane
Garofalo, Directed by Robert Greenwald (R, 108 minutes). The
likable but muddled screen biography of the yippie activist Abbie
Hoffman paints that left-wing merry prankster and inventor of the
``politics of joy'' as a free-spirited innocent who became a
political martyr. D'Onofrio may not look much like Hoffman, but he
radiates the right antic, rabble-rousing energy. Garofalo, as his
loyal wife, Anita, conveys a brooding critical intelligence. But
the movie, to its detriment, glosses over the highlights of
Hoffman's late-1960s activist career to concentrate on the sad
story of his persecution by the FBI and his years as a fugitive
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances and those of Ehle and
Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TAO OF STEVE,' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ``Steve'' in the
title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by
Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-O'') and Steve Austin
(``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and
amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic
comedy, Dex ( Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas
Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless pleasure
seeking in this rather aimless movie. Logue's performance as a
nice-guy player _ his weight doesn't keep him from scoring with the
ladies _ makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee over what
he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less interesting when it
rolls around to the inevitable quest for a steady relationship with
a woman ( Goodman) whose feelings were trampled in Dex's compulsive
fox hunting. ``Tao'' can't redeem the moves to its predictable end,
but its protagonist has a great time getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT LIES BENEATH,' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Zemeckis'
film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (
Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria regularly. Her daughter
has just gone off to college, and Claire is still recovering from
the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts showing signs
of being haunted. Her husband, Norman ( Ford), is a driven research
scientist with a secret. This thriller is as implausibly chilling
as any ``X-Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes, your interest
will have long vanished (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WIND WILL CARRY US,' starring Behzad Dourani. Directed by
Abbas Kiarostami (not rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by this
Iranian director, widely considered one of the greatest living
filmmakers, is oblique, evocative and visually stunning.
Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary
trees seem almost otherworldly in their clarity and depth, and his
story, about a morose engineer who has come to a remote Kurdish
village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a
folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb
your attention and demand your concentration while you're watching,
and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more powerful,
for a long time afterward (Scott).

MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT WARMLY GREETED IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vicente Fox, the next president of Mexico _ a land
he envisions far closer to the United States, with borders no more
than lines on a map _ started laying out his vision to the present
and future leaders of the United States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office on Dec. 1, met with President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore; he is to meet Gov. George W. Bush in Texas
on Friday. At the White House, the State Department and the vice
president's residence, he was congratulated for winning the fairest
election in Mexican history on July 2, defeating the ruling party
and ending its seven decades of often authoritarian and corrupt
government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the Mexican leader's victory ``a truly historic
affirmation of genuine democracy.'' A measure of good will _ rare
among many of the two men's predecessors _ appeared to flow between
Clinton and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're walking on clouds,'' Clinton told Fox during their
private meeting, according to aides. The thorniest issues dividing
the two nations _ drugs, migration, trade disputes _ were
discussed, but not debated, aides on both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's vision of a future in which people and their possessions
can move far more freely across the 2,000-mile border is not shared
by official Washington, or by either presidential contender. That
frontier has become a battle front, as the United States fights its
long and often unsuccessful war against drug traffickers and
illegal immigrants heading north.
</P>
<P>
   Gore found the idea of open borders ``clearly problematic,''
said his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, and Bush repeated
Thursday that he thought ``we ought to enforce our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said much the same thing. ``Obviously, we have borders
and we have laws that apply to them and we have to apply them, and
so do the Mexicans,'' he said. ``But I think over the long run, our
countries will become more interdependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has become the United States' second-largest business
partner (Canada is No. 1, Japan No. 3). Trade between the two
nations is expected to exceed $240 billion this year. And Fox
believes that a growing economic integration will inexorably erode
the border _ and the development gap _ in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, he says, can develop in the next two or three decades
from a client trading with a superpower into a full-fledged
partner, if it can answer questions like those he posed today:
``How can we narrow the gap on income on both sides of the border?
How can we in the long term equal the levels of development between
our countries so that we become real friends, real partners and
real neighbors?''
</P>
<P>
   If the economy of Mexico grows stronger, if living standards and
wages rise _ per-capita income is barely $5,000 a year, and 40
million Mexicans are poor by any standard _ then, Fox argues, there
will be far less incentive for illegal immigration, which has risen
to perhaps 150,000 cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we build up the opportunities in Mexico so that our
kids, 12- , 14-year-olds, don't have to leave home, don't have to
move to the United States looking for opportunities?'' he asked.
Not by beefing up border patrols, he said, but building up Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton expressed concern that the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which reduced crossborder
trade barriers dividing the United States, Mexico and Canada, had
not raised real wages in Mexico. And they said that Gore had asked
Fox's help in building support for free trade among environmental
and labor groups, which have often viewed NAFTA as a malevolent
force.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Fox spent an hour talking, Fuerth said, touching on
trade, the environment, human rights, democracy and two interwoven
problems confronting Mexico: The international traffic that fills
the enormous demand for drugs in the United States, and the
official corruption that smooths the flow of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox pledged to ``attack corruption profoundly within
government,'' beginning with Mexico's police and security agencies.

KAPLER JUST SAYS YES TO DRUG-TESTING PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, Gabe Kapler swears he's not a steroid freak.
Never used them. Never will.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you were wondering.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time the Texas Rangers' outfielder has
addressed that question and it likely won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never look myself in the mirror again knowing that I
cheated,'' Kapler said by phone Wednesday from the visiting
clubhouse at Yankee Stadium. ``I think they're unsafe. I think
they're unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult thing for a lot of people to talk about.
It's not difficult for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, because precious few others feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's dirty little secret is sneaking out of the closet
faster than a Mark McGwire blast can leave the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Is America's pastime overrun with steroid use? Is that the real
reason for the power explosion in the game? Is it the players who
are juiced, not the ball, as columnist Rick Reilly charged in
``Sports Illustrated'' last week?
</P>
<P>
   If it is, then baseball, the only major sport with no drug
testing program in place to protect its participants, has no one to
blame but itself. It is the single-most shameful omission in
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers strength coach Mike Arndt told Reilly that ``15 to 22
percent'' of major-leaguers are on ``illegal substances,'' meaning
performance-enhancing steroids. Rockies strength coach Brad Andress
told the ``Denver Post'' it's even higher, maybe 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take Arndt's estimate and work with that. If 20 percent
are steroid users, that means one out of every five players is
doing it. Translation: The average team _ which eliminates the
Rangers, because they're not even average this year _ has five
players in the clubhouse using illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But let's get down to specifics. OK, Mike, how many Rangers
players are using steroids? Five? Six? More?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say I don't believe anyone on our roster is
using,'' said Arndt, in his first year as the Rangers' strength
coach. ``I can say that based on the relationship I've had with
these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys who are very adamant in their feelings
about it as far as anti-use. They're very vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Kapler. But fate works in strange ways. At about
the same time that Reilly's column was raising eyebrows, ESPN was
showing a photo of Kapler on the cover of a fitness magazine during
its Sunday night telecast from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, he's not called ``Abs'' for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Here's the Rangers' strength coach talking about steroids
running rampant in baseball and here's Kapler's rippling physique
for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Deduction? Well, you know where this goes and so does Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe strongly that it stems from jealousy of some sort,''
Kapler said. ``It's also a compliment. It's someone saying, `you
can't look that way naturally.' It's frustrating, though, because
they don't understand the time and effort you put into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Arndt, who came up with his percentages from talking to
strength coaches from other teams, to compile a list of Rangers
players he believes absolutely don't use steroids, and Kapler would
be right at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most vocal against it,'' Arndt said. ``Gabe
doesn't even like to drink coffee because he feels it hurts his
overall performance. He's very much against steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't know the work that Gabe puts in to have that
physique. It comes from a lot of hard work and good genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplements? Sure, Kapler has tried more than a few. He's a big
believer in multivitamins. He has tried creatine, a supplement
that's usually blended like milkshake, that's supposed to build
muscle mass and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look at something that's found naturally in food,''
Kapler said. ``If they can condense and put it in a powder or
tablet form, I might try it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has never crossed general manager Doug Melvin's mind that
Kapler might be a steroid user. Not once.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assumption that if you have a good physique, you
must be doing that,'' Melvin said. ``That's pretty unfair. Kapler's
been that way for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be more concerned if, in a short period of time, you saw
someone suddenly bulk up. If Darwin Cubillan comes to camp next
spring at 225, we might be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubillan is the slender right-hander who came to Texas in the
Esteban Loaiza trade with Toronto. On a good day, after three
double cheeseburgers, he might weigh 165 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that the Rangers haven't had players who used
steroids. There have been clubhouse whispers about this player or
that over the years. This guy's using. That guy has suddenly bulked
up and it's affecting his play.
</P>
<P>
   You could probably name them yourself. But it's all just rumor
and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think Mike's assessment of the percentages is
way too high,'' Kapler said ``I know of just one (user) for sure.
The other ones, I could guess, but I don't even want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do that to me. They think I'm obviously a user when I'm
not. I'm not going to make the same mistake and do that to other
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler would love to see baseball develop a comprehensive
testing program, to end the questions once and for all, as well as
provide more education on the subject for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, you should level the playing field and
everything should be tested for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd just like to make sure there's a level field of play
between the pitchers and the hitters,'' said Melvin, who also
believes baseball needs a testing program. ``Let the union do it if
that's what it takes, and they can reprimand the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's nothing to hide, then what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Union mouthpiece Gene Orza told Riley there is no evidence that
steroids ``alter the playing field'' or provide a health and safety
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that Orza is (a) blind; (b) deaf; and (c) somehow
doesn't consider the increased risk of testicular cancer, heart
disease, stroke, depression and raging mood swings a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guarantee you that Old-Timers' games are not going to be
``near'' as much fun,'' Riley zinged.
</P>

QUARTERBACK DEPTH NO CONTROVERSY AT KANSAS STATE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Kansas State quarterback Jonathan Beasley started 11 football
games last season, of which the Wildcats won 10. In another, he
came off the bench to trigger a comeback victory against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His reward, heading into Saturday's opening game of his senior
season, has been a spot in the Wildcats' lineup with a clear view
of the rearview mirror. In it, he sees redshirt freshman Ell
Roberson gaining favor each day in the eyes of coach Bill Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it heat, but there is competition,'' Beasley
said. ``It makes me better and it makes Ell Roberson better. He's
pushing me and I'm pushing him. If one goes down, the other is
capable of coming in and taking over the job.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Wildcats' fans, the lingering question is whether
Roberson _ already dubbed the team's ``quarterback of the future''
by Snyder _ can commandeer the starting job on his own merits
during a season that will begin with national championship dreams.
Kansas State, ranked eighth in The Associated Press' preseason
poll, plays Iowa at 1 p.m. Saturday in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley has earned the starting nod, Snyder said, based on
superior knowledge of the Wildcats' offense. But his status is not
etched in stone because coaches are intrigued with the progress of
Roberson, a former standout at Baytown Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap has closed,'' Snyder said. ``We'll go into the season
with Jonathan Beasley as our No. 1 quarterback. But the position
will remain competitive, provided the quarterbacks make it so.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is quick to praise Beasley, who completed only 44.3
percent of his passes last season, for his leadership skills and
veteran savvy. A team captain, Beasley is 10-1 as the Wildcats'
starting quarterback. But he lacks the mobility and arm strength of
Roberson, who has been compared favorably to Michael Bishop, the
Wildcats' starter in 1997-98 and winner of the 1998 Davey O'Brien
National Quarterback Award.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school senior, Roberson passed for 1,678 yards and
rushed for 1,123. He accounted for 28 touchdowns (10 passing, 18
rushing). He's been impressive enough in drills that Snyder plans
to play Roberson in nonconference games, like the one against Iowa,
to gauge his progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be remiss if we didn't find opportunities to play Ell and
make him the quarterback of the future. How soon that future comes,
I can't say,'' Snyder said. ``My thoughts are that he's an
extremely fine football player and a fine athlete. But he needs to
make an extremely firm commitment to make the progress he needs to
be the No. 1 quarterback at Kansas State. How soon he can
accomplish that, I can't tell you. It depends on that firm
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   From his perspective, Roberson said he is committed to expanding
his knowledge of the Wildcats' offense and mastering the
``intangibles'' that Snyder identified as the reason to keep
Beasley in the lineup. Beasely, who played much of last season
while nursing a sore shoulder, said he is not prepared to surrender
the starting job without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said the offense ``didn't execute at times'' last
season, most notably during a 41-15 loss to Nebraska in which
Kansas State quarterbacks completed only 8 of 32 passes. Beasley
was 3 of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still room for me to improve,'' said Beasley, who
passed for 1,805 yards and accounted for 22 touchdowns (14 passing,
8 rushing) last season. ``I need to make sure I always get us into
the right checks, so we can execute better. And the completion
percentage is something I need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he is optimistic Beasley will be more productive
this season because outsiders do not understand the physical
ailments he faced last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went a long time last year without disclosing the fact that
Jonathan's arm had been injured,'' said Snyder, whose policy is not
to discuss the status of injured players. ``He's far healthier now
than at any time last season. That will add to his assets.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he have enough assets to hold off Roberson?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan Beasley is a better athlete than people realize,''
Snyder said. ``But he's been sandwiched between Michael Bishop and
Ell Roberson. Jonathan is not as athletic as those two. That's
accurate. But he's not a washout, in that respect. He's got a good
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan epitomizes what college athletics are all about, what
teamwork is all about. He's always willing to sacrifice for the
good of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The lingering question is whether Beasley will eventually be
asked to sacrifice his starting job for the good of the Wildcats.

FOR NOW, EXPERTS DISCOUNT RADIATION PERIL FROM SUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use with RUSSIA-SUBMARINE, already moved)  
 By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two nuclear reactors in the sunken Russian submarine Kursk
should pose no immediate risk to the surrounding environment and
only a moderate risk in the coming decades, naval experts and
environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not high on the list to worry about,'' said Thomas B.
Cochran, director of the nuclear program for the environmental
group Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements indicate no radiation leaks from the submarine at
present, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the radioactive elements within the Kursk remain of
concern, because the submarine lies in relatively shallow water _
350 feet down _ in a rich fishing area. Should radiation leaks
occur, currents could spread the radioactivity over a large portion
of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental group Greenpeace urged on Tuesday that the
Kursk be pulled off the ocean bottom if possible. ``It's not a
matter of if radiation will be released from the Kursk,'' said
William Peden of Greenpeace. ``It's a matter of when. We hope the
international community will spare no effort, spare no expense in
making the Kursk safe.''
</P>
<P>
   With apparently no immediate radiation danger, there is time to
first survey the Kursk before deciding what to do, said Thomas
Nilsen, a researcher with the Norwegian environmental group
Bellona. ``We could actually make things worse than it already is
by shaking the submarine,'' he said. ``We say we are in a hurry,
but we should not rush.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kursk is so badly damaged that it might break apart
during a salvage effort, other options should be considered, such
as cutting out the reactor compartment or entombing the submarine,
Peden said.
</P>
<P>
   Including the Kursk, seven nuclear-powered submarines _ two
American, five Russian _ have sunk. So far, none appears to have
leaked nuclear fuel into the surrounding water. Submarine reactors
are sealed within thick steel walls, and most experts believe
decades or longer will pass before seawater corrodes through the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has sent remote-controlled underwater vehicles to
the wreckage of the submarine Thresher, which went down in 1963 off
Cape Cod, and the Scorpion, which sank in 1968 off the Azores,
about six times each, collecting samples of sediment, water, and
plant or animal life around the wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done surveys at those sites and have seen very, very
little radioactivity coming out from the ships,'' said Jonathan
Kiell, a spokesman for the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The sediment within a few feet of the submarines contain
slightly raised levels of radioactivity, believed to come from the
reactor's coolant, and not the fuel. The coolant becomes slightly
radioactive through the normal operation of a nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our surveys have shown there is no environmental threat
created from those two submarines,'' Kiell said.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian monitoring of the Russian submarine Komsomolets, which
sank in waters a mile deep in the North Atlantic, 300 miles off the
coast of Norway, also shows slight radiation leaks from the cooling
fluid, not the reactor core.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dangerous radioactive elements in spent nuclear fuel
decay away within weeks and months. The two of most concern _
strontium-90 and cesium-137 _ have half-lives of about 30 years,
and will take about 300 years to decay away.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Nikitin, an environmental activist who was once an
engineer on a Russian nuclear submarine, has been the most
alarmist, saying that the Kursk will start leaking radiation within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, I'm sure about it, that in a month or two months,
the submarine will no longer be hermetically sealed,'' Nikitin said
in an interview through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   But even Nikitin said the radiation would come from the cooling
water, not the reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be a major hazard,'' said Cochran of the
Natural Resources Defense Council.

 IN BLOW TO GOVERNMENT CASE, LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST IS GRANTED BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saying the government case against the accused Los
Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee ``no longer has the requisite clarity
and persuasive character'' needed to keep him in detention before
his trial, a federal judge Thursday ordered his release on bail.
</P>
<P>
   The order is a symbolic but humiliating blow for government
prosecutors, who have had Lee held in jail for more than eight
months under unusually harsh conditions on charges that he had
mishandled the ``crown jewels'' of the country's nuclear weapons
program and posed a grave threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James A. Parker of U.S. District Court in Albuquerque,
N.M., said in his order Thursday that Lee would be required to post
$1 million in bail. Lee may remain in prison for a week or so while
the tough conditions the judge outlined, amounting to home
detention, are finalized. In addition, the government could attempt
to halt the order with an appeal and a request for a stay.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision represented a stunning turnaround in this
politically charged trial and was another in a string of recent
developments suggesting that, at least in some respects, the
prosecutors' case appears to be unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   At a bail hearing in December, Parker had agreed with the
government and found that Lee, a former scientist at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, posed such a threat that he could not be
released under any condition before his trial, which is scheduled
for November.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the assistant U.S. attorney leading the prosecution,
George Stamboulidis, said that if Lee were released and managed to
hand over to a foreign power the secrets he had improperly
downloaded, ``It's of a caliber where hundreds of millions of
people could be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same hearing a senior FBI agent acknowledged that
earlier he had provided inaccurate testimony about Lee's supposed
deceptions on several critical issues, which the judge had cited in
his detention order in December.
</P>
<P>
   Also, two highly respected weapons experts appearing for the
defense contradicted several government witnesses and said that the
data Lee is accused of illegally downloading onto portable computer
tapes would not be of great use to another country and that most of
it had already been made public in scholarly journals and the like.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge did not detail his reasoning in the order,
released late Thursday, he clearly rejected the government's
assertions this time about the threat from Lee. In court last week,
Parker said he would not rule until he had read the full transcript
of the unusually long and detailed three-day bail hearing. But in
his decision Thursday, he wrote that he now felt able to render the
decision before the transcripts had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply delighted,'' said Brian Sun, an attorney for the
family of Lee. ``I wish I could wax on further, but we're just
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's daughter, Alberta, 26, a fervent supporter throughout the
case, was highly emotional. ``I'm just thrilled that he will
finally be at home,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``I can't
wait to see my Dad and hug him.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I think it just means that the government's case is
crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Holscher, one of Lee's lawyers, said that the terms Parker
described in his order, while tough, were agreeable. The judge
scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to discuss and finalize the
conditions of Lee's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gratified by the court's decision,'' Holscher said.
``Dr. Lee and his family are grateful to the scientists and members
of the community who have supported him. We have always indicated
to the court we would comply with any of its conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The only government response came from Patricia Chavez, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney in Albuquerque. ``The court's
order is being reviewed,'' Chavez said in a written statement.
``The government will be responding in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker listed 12 conditions in a draft order for Lee's release.
In addition to requiring the large bond secured by his own assets
and the assets of family members and friends, they include his
being held in detention at his home in White Rock, near Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   His next door neighbors, Don and Jean Marshall, who also work at
the government lab in Los Alamos, would serve as third-party
custodians.
</P>
<P>
   Lee would be monitored electronically at all times and would
have but a single telephone in his house, with no computers or
other electronic communications devices. Officials would be able
immediately to block any phone calls that appeared to involve
sensitive information. The government would be able to inspect all
his mail, and he would be able to leave his house only with one of
his attorneys to work on his case or to go to a hospital for
emergency medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered that only Lee's wife, Sylvia, would be able to
reside at his home with him. She would be able to leave the house
only after notifying government officials of the time of her
departure, her destination and the purpose of the trip. Law
enforcement officials would have the right to search her on leaving
and re-entering the house.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's two children, his daughter, Alberta, and his son, Chung,
27, would be able to visit only in the daytime and only after
arranging the visits in advance with the government, which would
have the right to have a law enforcement official present in the
house during the stay.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the terms represented a marked improvement from the
conditions under which Lee has been held since he was arrested and
indicted in December.
</P>
<P>
   He is held in something close to solitary confinement in a
prison in Santa Fe, N.M., had been shackled until recently for his
brief periods in an exercise yard, is shackled when he travels to
the courthouse to work on his case with his lawyers, and can see
his family for one hour a week, and then only with a law
enforcement official close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has insisted in several hearings that
Lee was engaged in what amounted to one of the most serious cases
of espionage since the dawn of the nuclear era, he is not actually
charged with spying in his 59-count indictment. He was investigated
for several years on suspicions that he passed secrets on a
sophisticated warhead to the Chinese government, but prosecutors
now say there is no evidence for this and that they will not raise
the matter at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is charged with illegally downloading a vast amount of
nuclear weapons secrets to an unsecure computer at Los Alamos and
then putting the information on 10 computer tapes, seven of which
are missing. Lee has indicated through his lawyers that he
destroyed the seven tapes after he was fired in March 1999, and he
offered to take a lie detector test on this question.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not taken him up on the offer, and
prosecutors have used the question of the tapes' whereabouts as a
critical issue in the three bail hearings that have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are still unaccounted for, but new testimony was
provided at the hearing last week that clearly cast the
circumstances of Lee's actions in a far different light. Earlier,
FBI agent Robert Messemer said that Lee had lied to a colleague
whose computer Lee had used to complete the downloading. Last week,
Messemer said that had not been the case.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has also said that Lee downloaded the
information to enhance his job prospects with several scientific
institutes in foreign countries like Australia, Germany and
Singapore. But last week Messemer said that though letters to those
institutes had been found on Lee's home computer, the government
had no evidence the letters had ever been sent or received.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, several government witnesses had
described the codes and other information Lee downloaded as the
``crown jewels'' of the nuclear weapons program, but several
respected scientists rebutted those assertions, apparently
undermining, at least in Parker's eyes, the need to continue
holding Lee in the kind of conditions reserved for the most
nefarious spies and criminals.

MEXICO COURT MAKES HISTORY BY SIDING WITH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a ruling that justices described as a judicial
watershed, the Mexican Supreme Court ordered President Ernesto
Zedillo Thursday to turn over to Congress secret banking data
relating to questionable financing of Zedillo's 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was the first in modern history in which the court,
the weak sister in Mexico's system of government, has ruled in a
constitutional dispute between two competing federal powers. The
court's decision to uphold a congressional challenge to
presidential powers marked a clear declaration of independence by
the court from the all-powerful executive branch, which has
dominated the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a suit filed by opposition lawmakers last year, the
court found that Congress had every right to demand full disclosure
by Zedillo's government about the dealings of Banco Union, a bank
that oversaw millions of dollars in donations to the president's
1994 campaign even as it was sliding into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Zedillo later intervened in Banco Union's case, turning
its liabilities into public debt and arguing that bank secrecy laws
barred any public accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, the court gave Zedillo 30 days to turn
over to Congress a series of files from Banco Union. The court's 11
justices endorsed the order unanimously. In a statement hours
later, Zedillo's office pledged to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a profoundly historic decision,'' Olga
Sanchez Cordero, the justice who presided over the previous
deliberations in the constitutional challenge, said at a news
conference. She said it marked the first time the high court had
refereed a dispute between two branches of the federal government,
and also because it limited bank secrecy laws here by stipulating
that they may not be used to shield potentially illegal
transactions in which taxpayers must pay for the reckless
management of private assets.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, its judicial
system has been hobbled by frequent presidential interference, and
three presidents in this century have simply dismissed the entire
high court. One was Zedillo himself, who in his first month in
office dismissed all 26 justices, installing the new 11-member
court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the justices elected a new chief justice, Genaro
Gongora Pimentel, who has championed initiatives aimed at
increasing the judiciary's power and independence. Under his
influence, the court's powers to broker constitutional challenges
have been growing.
</P>
<P>
   It has ruled in constitutional disputes between two cities,
between cities and states, between states and the federal congress.
But it had never ruled in a dispute pitting the congress against
the presidency, Sanchez said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes eight weeks after Zedillo's governing party
suffered its first defeat in seven decades of presidential voting,
and some analysts suggested that the July 2 election of an
opposition candidate, Vicente Fox, had strengthened the court's
willingness to rule against Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Zedillo said he had already ordered the
treasury secretary and the president of the National Banking
Commission to turn over the Banco Union files requested by
Congress.

HONG KONG'S MASTER TRADER STILL KNOWS WHEN TO SAY NO

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In his hometown, Li Ka-shing, the tycoon known here
as Superman, still vaults tall buildings with ease. But in Europe,
where Li is just another mogul, he seems to have lost his
extraordinary powers.
</P>
<P>
   Li earned his nickname among Hong Kong investors by amassing
more wealth and influence than any other local businessman here
ever had. His flagship conglomerate, Hutchison Whampoa, reinforced
that reputation Thursday when it reported earnings of $4 billion in
the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hutchison's profit, however, came from a special
one-time gain after the sale of its European mobile phone
operations. The company's encore, an ambitious plan to offer
next-generation cellular services throughout Europe, is in doubt.
Last week, Hutchison unexpectedly gave up a coveted license to
offer advanced mobile services in Germany, saying it was too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, even as Li and his lieutenants basked in the glow of
rich earnings, they had to explain why the German setback had not
scrambled their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't for a moment concede that we will be out of
Germany,'' Canning Fok, the group managing director of Hutchison,
said in an interview. ``But we have to be more creative about
getting into that market. To throw money around is not the way to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the great race to carve up Europe's electromagnetic spectrum,
Hutchison Whampoa has emerged as an unpredictable outlier.
Aggressive in bidding for a British license, abrupt in backing out
of Germany, Hutchinson Whampoa, a conglomerate that can trace its
roots to Hong Kong's early colonial days, has left many
telecommunications experts scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Fok insists that there is no mystery. The company could someday
buy back its share of the German license from its partners, Royal
KPN of the Netherlands and NTT DoCoMo of Japan. Even if it never
breaks into Germany, he said, Hutchison will create a valuable
cellular franchise in Britain, where it recently won a license, and
in other countries like Italy, where it is still in the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each asset is valuable as long as you get it at the right
price,'' Fok declared. ``We haven't lost anything from Germany. I
won't say we've gained, but we haven't lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their qualms, most analysts are willing to give Li the
benefit of the doubt. Hutchison has become one of the most highly
valued companies in Hong Kong on the strength of its chairman's
ability to sniff out good deals and steer clear of bad ones. At a
price for the three partners of more than $7 billion, Hutchison
considered the German mobile license extremely expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hutchison is a company where pragmatism is very much the
watchword,'' said John Tysoe, a telecommunications analyst at the
investment firm WestLB Panmure in London. ``They avoid the mistake
that other telecom operators make, which is to fall in love with
their businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   By ceding Germany, however, other analysts say that Hutchison
has effectively abandoned its dream of building a pan-European
cellular network. Had the company been able to assemble such a
network, it would have been an enormously valuable franchise _
perhaps even more valuable than Orange, the British mobile network
that Hutchison sold last year to Mannesmann of Germany for $14
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason everybody owns Hutchison's stock is because they
expect Li Ka-shing to pull off another massive deal,'' said Anil
Daswani, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst. ``We were all expecting
them to build a European network, and then sell it off or spin off
part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's recent attack of caution has deflated its
shareholders. The company's stock has declined 6.4 percent since
Aug. 18, when it gave up the German license. The shares fell 1.8
percent on Thursday, to 110.5 Hong Kong dollars, or $14.17, though
the earnings were released after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   Those earnings show a generally healthy company, even
subtracting the one-time gain of $3.2 billion. Operating earnings
rose 32 percent, to $1.3 billion. Hutchison's container ports,
telecommunications and energy divisions turned in particularly
strong performances, while the results of its property group
remained lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have reported even greater profit if it had
not taken a $3.8 billion provision against fluctuations in the
value of its 3 percent stake in Vodafone AirTouch, the British
cellular giant. Hutchison picked up the stake when Vodafone
acquired Mannesmann earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that Li's phenomenal record as a deal maker has
placed unreasonable expectations on the company. Last year, after a
previous round of blockbuster asset sales, Hutchison reported a
profit of $14.25 billion. On that basis, it made the company, whose
annual sales were around $7 billion, the most profitable in the
world, ahead of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shareholders have gotten accustomed to big numbers,'' Fok
said. ``We've done it for two years now. But I won't guarantee it
for every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fok said Hutchison's investors recognize that no one can produce
an endless stream of $14 billion transactions. The trouble is, they
may have become spoiled: Li has pulled off more lucrative deals
since the sale of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's earnings do not include the roughly $10 billion
profit it reaped last month when Deutsche Telekom agreed to acquire
Voice-Stream Wireless, a United States cellular company, for $53
billion. Hutchison began investing in Voice-Stream late in 1997. It
paid a total of $1.2 billion for a 23 percent stake, which is now
worth about $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If Hutchison's shareholders seem hungry for deals, it is because
they have been trained by Li. Since he took over the company in
1981, he has treated it more as a collection of assets than an
industrial empire. This reflects Li's background _ he came to Hong
Kong from mainland China in the 1940s and traded his way up from
selling plastic flowers to building skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects Hutchison's roots in the mutable world of
Hong Kong. Founded in the 1860s as the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock
Co., it built dry docks and ship-repair yards on the South China
seacoast when Hong Kong was a young British colony. Over the years,
it cobbled together a disparate array of assets, ranging from
drugstores and supermarkets to container ports.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, Hutchison was losing money and was ripe for the picking
by Li, the most aggressive of a new generation of Chinese
entrepreneurs eager to supplant the British. Under Li, Hutchison's
reach expanded beyond Hong Kong and into new industries like
telecommunications. But its trading mentality never changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a strategy to dominate the world,'' said Simon
Murray, a British investor who was managing director of the company
in the 1980s and still sits on the board. ``Hutchison always moved
forward on an add-on basis, accumulating assets, building on the
bricks we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the company's telecommunications holdings have
accounted for its multibillion-dollar asset sales, they contribute
only 6 percent of the operating profits. Hutchison has made much
more money selling telephone networks than running them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its retreat in Germany, Fok said Hutchison was ready to
``go for it'' in bidding for a third-generation license in Italy.
He said the company would also consider investing in such networks
in the United States, when Washington begins auctioning the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Further down the line is China, which is still building its
first generation of mobile phone networks. Hutchison has a $400
million stake in China Unicom, the second-largest telephone
operator nationwide. Fok said, however, that Hutchison would not
expand its presence there until the rules on foreign investment in
the telecommunications industry became clearer.
</P>
<P>
   For all his prudence, Fok seems exuberant when discussing the
prospects for third-generation mobile service. With its emphasis on
data transmission, Fok says this technology has more in common with
the Internet than with traditional cellular service. The German
pullback notwithstanding, he says the scramble for licenses in
Europe is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seize a dominant
position in a new industry in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like there is a piece of triple-A land available for
development in every major city in the world at the same time,''
Fok said. ``When do you see that? You don't.''

Fox finds warm reception for U.S. visit, not ideas &HT;     &HT;    By JOHN C. HENRY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton praised Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox's aggressive plan to reshape Mexico's economy Thursday,
but his proposal to open the U.S.-Mexico border got a less than
neighborly response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have borders and we have laws that apply to them, and we
have to apply them. And so do the Mexicans,'' Clinton said,
standing alongside Fox during a Rose Garden press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's cautious response was echoed by Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the two leading candidates to
succeed him in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met early Thursday with Gore, who characterized the open
border proposal as ``very problematic in the U.S.,'' said Leon
Fuerth, the vice president's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is scheduled to meet with the new Mexican leader
(FRIDAY) today in Dallas, was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's fully explained open borders,'' Bush said.
``As you know, I believe we ought to enforce our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, an undaunted Fox predicted that free movement across the
2,000-mile border will come within a decade when Mexico's standard
of living more closely resembles its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on PBS' The NewsHour, Fox said the gap in
salaries and income between the United States and Mexico can be
significantly reduced in 10 years. Then, he said, ``we can open up
the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's forecast came during his first visit to Washington since
winning election last month and ending the Institutional
Revolutionary Party's, or PRI, 71-year grip on power in Mexico.
Fox, a member of the pro-business Action National Party, or PAN,
takes over from President Ernesto Zedillo Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was ``a great honor'' to meet with Fox, Clinton said
his election was a ``truly historic affirmation of democracy'' in
Mexico. The election ``is an example to people who are friends of
freedom everywhere in the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime advocate of closer ties with Mexico's northern
neighbors, Fox told reporters after his meeting with Clinton that
they ``explored solutions'' to the surging number of Mexican
migrants in the United States, currently estimated at about 7
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions have to do with economic development, with growing
the Mexican economy at rates of 7 percent, which will give us the
opportunity of building up 1.35 million new jobs,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants the United States to allow more legal migrants from
Mexico, and in exchange his government would do more to limit
illegal border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has called for a European Union-style partnership involving
Mexico, Canada and the United States, an economic integration that
Clinton and Gore said is not coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, you will see growing interdependence in our
hemisphere, and I think the Canadians will be a part of that, and I
very much hope our friends in Central America and South America and
the Caribbean will be a part of that,'' said Clinton, who leaves
office in January. ``I regret that I won't be around for a lot of
it, but I think it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During an hourlong visit to the vice president's official
residence at Washington's Naval Observatory, Gore and Fox discussed
his plan for expanding the Mexican economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore adviser Fuerth said the vice president at one point in the
conversation said full implementation of Fox's ideas would take 25
to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident President-elect Fox will be a strong partner of
the United States,'' Gore said in a statement released by his
office.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling news conference, Fox touched on plans to invest
heavily in education and infrastructure, creating an economic
climate favorable to small businesses and ending official
corruption and fighting drugs. He said the Mexican government needs
to do more to draw Mexicans out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the United States' and Canada's obligation _ it is
ours _ to better the quality of life and the living conditions in
Mexico,'' he said.

ONCE AGAIN, BUSH PUTS THE FOCUS ON TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   (CORRECTS quote in 13th graf;   ADDS 23rd and 24th graf with
another example)  
(See also BUSH-AD) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Gov. George W. Bush sought to seize the offensive
Thursday on the issue of tax cuts, charging that Vice President Al
Gore's plan was so narrow and complicated that it would fail to
lower taxes for many middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To make his case, Bush expanded his previously arranged schedule
to include two events where he introduced families whose taxes, he
said, would be lowered significantly under his own plan, but very
little, if at all, under Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called `targeted' tax cut means that some are targeted
out of tax relief,'' Bush said at an airport event in New Orleans,
referring to Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the example of the man standing beside him, Andrew
Bechac, a high school teacher and football coach who supports a
wife and two young children on $40,000 a year. Bush said that if
his tax cut was enacted, Bechac would pay the federal government
$475 a year _ about $1,600 less than he now does.
</P>
<P>
   In a later speech, Bush returned to the example of the Bechacs,
making a more concrete pitch for his tax-cut proposal than he was
able to muster earlier in the week, when he stumbled over some
numbers and then conceded that he had to do a better job of selling
his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under my opponent's plan, he gets no tax cut,'' Bush said of
Bechac. ``He gets no tax cut. I ask you, I ask Americans, to look
at the facts in these tax plans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, when Bush arrived in Miami, he introduced yet
another family that he said would benefit under his plan.
</P>
<P>
   With these events and examples, which Gore's aides derided as
selective and misleading, Bush was clearly trying to recover from
his earlier missteps. At the same time, he sought to make light of
those fumbles, which threw him off the education message that he
had said he would be focusing on this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I didn't explain what I was trying to explain very
well,'' he told reporters aboard his campaign plane, a smile on his
face. Asked if he wanted to take another crack at it, he said,
laughing, ``Yeah, exactly, let me start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also signaling that he was not going to back away from
his sweeping proposal to cut taxes by about $1.3 trillion over the
next decade, which many polls suggest may not be in line with the
priorities of most American voters. Gore has proposed a more
limited tax cut of $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush was confronting head on two of the principal obstacles
to selling a big tax cut: Many voters' belief that politicians are
not really going to deliver the goods, or that the total savings
would ultimately be pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   Bechac, a man with a history of activism in the Republican party
in Louisiana, said during the airport event that $1,600 ``will go a
long way for us each year.''
</P>
<P>
   But while ush presented Bechac as a typical example, Gore's
aides said he was an aberrant one. ``They may have finally found
one working family that does better under the Bush plan than the
Gore plan,'' said Ron Klain, a senior adviser to Gore. ``While
Governor Bush can play games with particular examples, he can't
change the truth that most working families do better under Gore
than Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign quickly released an analysis that it said
showed that if the Bechacs did some of the things that trigger tax
breaks under the vice president's plan _ like paying for day care
for their children, taking a standard deduction instead of
itemizing, putting money in certain kinds of savings accounts _
they might get an even bigger tax cut than the $1,600.. The Bush
campaign said that none of that was relevant to the Bechac family.
Bush's plan cuts the income tax rate for all taxpayers in all
income brackets, including the wealthiest Americans, who would get
by far the most money back in simple dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan does not cut rates, but rather provides breaks for
people who incur expenses for particular needs, like child care,
elderly care and school tuition, or who are saving money for
retirement or college. Those reductions in taxes apply, for the
most part, only to families with combined incomes of less than
$100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said Thursday that because Gore's plan has an
income ceiling and pivots on certain conditions, about 50 percent
of taxpayers _ about 50 million people _ would not see their taxes
lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Klain said that only about 30 million taxpayers would not
qualify for Gore's tax cuts, and that most of those people have
family incomes exceeding $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth over taxes suggested how large the issue
could loom in this election. Gore and his aides have asserted that
Bush's tax cut would gobble up surpluses and endanger prosperity.
Bush and his aides have levied the same accusation about Gore's
spending proposals, which are larger than Bush's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Texas governor had previously employed the strategy of
showcasing middle-class people and the kind of tax breaks they
would get during his battle in the Republican primary against Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. Like Gore, McCain complained that Bush was
lavishing too much of his tax cut on wealthy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Bush would continue throughout the coming weeks
to introduce families like the Bechacs. But he had not, at the
start of the week, intended to do that Thursday, when he was also
unveiling a new education proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for $437 million more in federal financing over five
years for historically black colleges and universities and an an
additional $166 million for similar institutions that have
primarily served Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his plane had left Austin, Texas, Thursday morning,
Bush was talking about tax cuts, saying that his belief in them was
impervious to polls. ``That should speak volumes about me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a desire for tax cuts ``may not show up in that survey
you read, but it's going to show up in this guy's wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently referring to taxpayers like Larry Melow, who
appeared in Miami with Bush, who said Melow's $3,458 federal tax
bill would be reduced by about $2,100 under his proposal. Melow
makes about $62,000 a year working for the state of Florida, where
Mr. Bush's brother Jeb is governor.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Orleans airport, Bechac, 33, held his 4-year-old
daughter, Meredith, while Margaret Bechac, 29, held the couple's
1-year-old, Camille.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Bechac, Bush said, ``Somebody asked me today on the
plane, `You know, the polls said people, hard-working people, don't
want tax relief.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I mentioned that,'' Bush added, ``and I think your
reaction was to laugh out loud.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRINIDAD, Texas _ With a revolver and a bowie knife strapped to
his hip and a semiautomatic rifle resting next to him on a barbed
wire fence, Jonathon Gray pondered the question: just what would
happen if law enforcement officers tried to enter his father's
47-acre homestead?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing,'' he said. ``They ain't coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Gray stood guard Thursday with two of his
brothers, who were also armed, at the locked gate of their family's
property on the Trinity River just north of here, some 60 miles
southeast of Dallas. Seeking shade from a grove of hickory trees in
blistering summer hear, they wondered just which day the
authorities would come to arrest their father.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 months, Gray and his mother, father and five
adult siblings have defied a court order to turn over the 2- and
4-year-old sons of his sister Lisa, who lost custody of them to her
former husband by default when she failed to appear at a hearing in
divorce court. Gray's father, John Joe Gray, 51, is also wanted by
local officials for failing to show up in court to face charges
that he assaulted a police officer in nearby Anderson County last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The family, believed to be heavily armed, has resolved not to
participate in court proceedings or any other government
activities, because, Gray said, its religious and political beliefs
do not permit doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secular courts don't have any authority over us,'' he
said. ``We go by the Bible and the Constitution, and I don't see
anything in either one about child custody cases. We don't want
anyone to get hurt, but we're not giving up them kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The local authorities are proceeding with caution. Ronnie
Brownlow, chief deputy for the Henderson County Sheriff's
Department, said: ``We're in no hurry to make a move. The last
thing we want is for someone to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownlow said that because of John Joe Gray's past associations
with right-wing groups, including the secessionist Republic of
Texas, which engaged in a standoff with law-enforcement officers
three years ago, the authorities here had informed the Federal
Bureau of Intelligence about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Rangers are also involved,'' he said, ``and we're
keeping them, the Grays, under surveillance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathon Gray said the family belonged to the Sabbatarian sect,
a derivative of the Seventh-day Adventists that strictly interprets
the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The family patriarch refused to talk with reporters Thursday,
but last weekend he told The San Antonio Express-News that he did
not intend to surrender the children ``as long as God allows us to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more afraid of God than of them,'' he said of the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gray, who has lived on his spread for 16 years, is
known to his neighbors as a quiet man with a disquieting hobby: for
years, he tried to recruit townspeople to become members of a
militia group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to come in here all dressed up in those military
outfits and camouflage gear, trying to get people to join up with
him,'' said Susan Stansfield, a secretary at the city hall in
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   The Gray family homestead is situated in thickly forested hills,
more than a mile from the closest neighbors. Visitors have said it
is fortified with sandbagged shooting positions, trenches and an
underground bunker built of concrete and wood. The family has been
without electricity for nearly six months, after not paying the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Fence lines and trees carry hand-lettered signs like
``Disobedience to Tyranny Is Obedience to God,'' ``90% of Catholic
Priests Are Child Molesters'' and ``We Are Militia and Will Live
Free or Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday whether he or his father was a member of a
militia group, Jonathon Gray only smiled and said, ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   But last weekend, by the account of both Gray and the local
press, members of various militia groups as well as religious
fundamentalists _ more than two dozen people in all _ visited the
family to offer support, many bringing food and other supplies.
Even Thursday, as Gray and his brothers stood watch, a neighbor who
would give her name only as Punky stopped on the dirt road running
alongside their property and told Gray: ``You keep them out of
there. Don't let them in. If you need anything, give us a call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't let them take my grandchildren either,'' she said.

A LIFE CUT SHORT BY THE NAZIS ENDURES IN A PAINTED `OPERA' 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The short stay on earth of Charlotte Salomon
(1917-1943) didn't draw much notice while it lasted. A loner
crushed by family tragedy and remembered as unmemorable by
schoolmates who survived her, she had few friends. When she and her
unborn child died at Auschwitz, oblivion awaited. Yet she defeated
it, leaving behind an astonishing work of art that transformed her
life into a poignant opera of paintings, words and music.
</P>
<P>
   Composed from 1940 to 1942, this ``play with music,'' as Salomon
called it, came to notice only some years after her death. The
work, now owned by the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, has
since been shown in Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United
States, Israel and Japan. It has been translated into four
languages, made into an impressive book and abridged in several
catalogs; it has also served as the subject of several films, as
well the inspiration for biographical studies of Salomon. Above
all, it has earned her a place in the world's memory and once again
proves the power of the spirit over earthly horrors.
</P>
<P>
   The work is made up of nearly 800 small gouaches, Expressionist
in style, that cover Salomon's life and times. They are done in a
filmic technique with closeups, long shots, montage and flashbacks,
carrying the narrative from episode to episode like storyboards.
The unbound gouaches are accompanied by a handwritten text that
sometimes appears on transparent sheets laid over the paintings and
other times on the paintings themselves. They incorporate cues to
the musical themes _ from opera, classical, pop and folk _ that
Salomon apparently hummed from memory as she developed her
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 400 of the gouaches can be seen again in
``Charlotte Salomon: Life? Or Theater?'', an exhibition organized
by the Royal Academy of Arts in London and on view here at the
Museum of Fine Arts. (Some of the texts and musical themes are
recorded on an audio guide available to viewers.)
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the Salomon work is ``Reflexion,'' an installation
by the French artist Christian Boltanski that suggests the
ambiguity of visual experience and relates in some ways to
Salomon's grand epic.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Life? Or Theater?'', like that of most operas, is,
to say the least, unwieldy. The narrator, also called Charlotte,
presides over a cast of more than 20 characters based on real
people but given fictional names. Charlotte and her father, a
Berlin surgeon named Albert Salomon, have the surname Kann, meaning
able. Her stuffy grandparents, Dr. F. Grunwald and M.
Benda-Grunwald, become Dr. and Knarre, a word for rattle, used here
in the sense of an unmusical instrument. To her adored stepmother,
Paulina Lindberg, a singer, she gives the name Paulinka Bimbam.
</P>
<P>
   Her story _ by turns funny, philosophical and visionary,
sometimes tiresome and repetitious, but always in a vivid,
authentic voice _ is a tragedy touched by moments of intense
happiness. It begins with the suicide by drowning of her mother's
sister, also named Charlotte, in 1913, four years before the
narrator was born. A dark scene painted in deep blues depicts the
street where the young woman lived and the nearby lake in which she
threw herself.
</P>
<P>
   Many hundreds of paintings later, ``Life? Or Theater?'' ends
with a self-portrait of the narrator facing the sea, back turned to
the viewer as she sketches on a transparent easel at the Riviera
resort where she joined her grandparents in a futile attempt to
escape the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the voluminous saga records important events like
the suicide of Charlotte's mother when she was 9 (she was told her
mother had died of influenza); her father's remarriage to Paulinka,
who became her idol; and the appearance of a hapless,
theory-obsessed singing teacher, Amadeus Daberlohn (Alfred Wolfsohn
in real life), who falls madly in love with Paulinka but is
rejected by her.
</P>
<P>
   Daberlohn is, after Paulinka, the crucial figure in the
narrator's life, and hundreds of pages are devoted to him as he
explains his musical theories and tries to convince Paulinka that
he can make her a great singer. Meanwhile, he becomes Charlotte's
lover. ``May you never forget that I believe in you,'' he tells her
before she leaves Germany for a refuge in France.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis' rise to power is introduced in the story by an
ominous painting of marching troops parading with a swastika
banner. (Salomon always inverted the swastika.) The increasingly
repressive measures against Jews are chronicled: Dr. Kann can no
longer practice medicine except in a Jewish hospital, Paulinka's
voice is banned from the Aryan musical world, and Charlotte's
school becomes steeped in Nazism. She drops out.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeds in attending the Berlin Art Academy, where she is
the only Jewish student, admitted because her father served as a
doctor at the front in World War I. Then, in January 1939,
Charlotte leaves Germany for Villefranche, in the south of France,
where the Knarres, her grandparents, have taken shelter with an
American woman, Otillie Moore, who is identified only in the work's
dedication. Moore, who made it her business to assist refugees,
particularly children, supported Salomon and bought her paintings.
</P>
<P>
   From here on, the saga goes steeply downhill. In 1940 a
distraught Grandmother Knarre commits suicide, as have her two
daughters and several others in her family before her. Charlotte
and her grandfather are briefly sent to a concentration camp in the
Pyrenees but are allowed to return to Nice. Charlotte moves into a
small hotel at St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and begins ``Life? Or Theater?''
</P>
<P>
   The chronicle ends with a prophetic statement: ``And with
dream-awakened eyes she saw all the beauty around her, saw the sea,
felt the sun, and knew she had to vanish for a while from the human
plane and make every sacrifice in order to create her world anew
out of the depths.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon's life ended this way: Moore departed for America,
taking many of her refugee children. Two stayed behind at the villa
with an Austrian refugee, Alex Nagler, with whom Moore had had an
affair. After her grandfather died, Salomon returned to the villa,
a fatal mistake, and shortly thereafter married Nagler. Soon, on
Sept. 24, 1943, the couple were picked up by soldiers from SS
headquarters at Nice who had found their address on the wedding
certificate. They were shipped off to Auschwitz, where the pregnant
Salomon was killed on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   But she had taken the precaution of giving her precious ``play
with music'' to Georges Moridis, a local doctor and resistance
leader, with the plea: ``Keep this safe. It is my whole life.'' He
later gave it to Moore, who returned to her villa in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Visited the next year by Salomon's father and stepmother, who
had escaped to the Netherlands, Moore grudgingly turned over the
work to them while refusing to sell back all but one of Salomon's
other paintings in her possession. In 1971 the Salomons gave
``Life? Or Theater?'' to the Jewish Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon's work can look naive and raw, but she was by no means
an outsider artist. She had thorough professional training and came
from a deeply cultured family. Her father and stepmother's circle
of friends included the architect Erich Mendelsohn; the theologian
Albert Schweitzer; Rabbi Leo Baeck, a prominent Jewish leader in
Berlin; and Kurt Singer, a psychiatrist, musicologist and director
of the Berlin Municipal Opera.
</P>
<P>
   In her narrative Salomon makes sophisticated allusions to fine
art, literature, music and philosophy. Her acquaintance with art
history led her to distill the work of many eras and artists _
Michelangelo, Modigliani, Edvard Munch, George Grosz and Marc
Chagall, among others _ into her own distinctive style, at times
reminiscent of the quirky, very personal work of the American
painter Florine Stettheimer. In analyzing her characters, she
produces a telling account of the increasingly repressive milieu of
her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her description of the pleasures and sufferings, the
sophistication and hypocrisy, the dislocations and crudities to be
found in this milieu amounts to as convincing an analysis as any of
the terrible tragedy that ultimately allowed the Holocaust to take
place,'' writes Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary of the
Royal Academy, in an article for the 1998 book that serves as the
exhibition's catalog.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a darkened space next to the galleries that display ``Life?
Or Theater?'' Christian Boltanski has hung hundreds of pieces of
glass of varying sizes on the walls. Acting as mirrors, they
produce images so dim that a viewer is hard put to see his or her
own reflection. Placed upright on the floor are nine metal frames
displaying archival images of anonymous faces (actually victims and
perpetrators from old newspaper crime clippings), photographed on
translucent fabric. An audio component, using excerpts from random
memories recorded by students who helped set up the exhibition,
adds to the ethereal effect.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, which, in juxtaposition with ``Life? Or
Theater?'' suggests the terrible anonymity the Nazis conferred on
their victims, is a haunting, although very different, experience.

LA GUARDIA AIRPORT, WHERE UNLIMITED DEMAND MEETS A LIMITED
INFRASTRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony D. Layne, the terminal duty manager at La
Guardia Airport, looked through his van's swishing windshield
wipers and sized up the traffic jam of jumbo jets idling before him
on the taxiway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' he said, in a nice bit of understatement, ``that
things could get a little hairy out here today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a summer Friday, one of the busiest days at La Guardia.
Yet as summer Fridays go, this one was relatively tame. In the
terminal, flight information screens flashed only a few delays. The
Mimlitsches of Colorado Springs, Frank and Martina and their three
children, were not even particularly upset about the long line at
the American Airlines counter. They made it up to the ticket agent
in nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not so bad,'' Mimlitsch said.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no air rage raging inside the airport, no
teeming of crowds familiar to the veteran La Guardia traveler,
there was a whole airport's worth of angry people teeming somewhere
else: out on the tarmac, in their respective planes, which by early
afternoon were lined up 25 deep waiting to take off. This situation
meant that although most airplanes pushed away from the gates on
time that Friday, it was at least an hour, and sometimes more,
before they were airborne.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant that untold numbers of connections to final
destinations were missed, dozens of gates at other airports were
kept idle waiting on those late planes, dozens of other flights at
those airports were delayed as a result and so on around the
country, like a bad echo.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was a result of anything extraordinary, just a few
minor storms hovering near the New York region and a volume of
flights that meant even the slightest delays quickly became big
delays. All this happened on a day of only average traffic: 846
takeoffs and landings on La Guardia's two runways, which on a very
busy day handle 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   But to spend a day at La Guardia, in Queens County, is to
examine through a magnifying glass the factors that have converged
to make this summer the worst for airline delays in history, not
only here but around the country, provoking a debate about whether
the nation's air transportation system is overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   La Guardia is a good case study not necessarily because of the
way it is run or because of its delays, though it does often rank
among the worst in the country for delays and long taxi times. It
is a good example, instead, because it is probably the most extreme
case of what many experts say is a chief cause of air travel
problems: an airport infrastructure that has not kept pace with the
increase in air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of La Guardia, this is because it is hemmed in
between Flushing Bay and the Grand Central Parkway, with little
room to grow. Two oversized photographs hanging in the airport's
Port Authority operations office tell this story better than any
statistics can.
</P>
<P>
   One picture is from 1964, when the airport's new main terminal
opened. The other picture is an aerial view of the airport a few
years ago, showing a virtually unchanged setting: a crescent with
four arms stretching out behind it for jet gates; a tangle of
taxiways; the same two runways, now slightly longer.
</P>
<P>
   There is one big difference. In the 1964 photo _ taken when
there were about 200,000 takeoffs and landings a year at the
airport _ a couple dozen jets are parked at gates or moving toward
the runways. In the recent photo, taken when the number of takeoffs
and landings were more than 350,000 a year, it seems as if nearly
every square inch of tarmac is covered with jets.
</P>
<P>
   Because La Guardia serves so many airlines, which fly to so many
cities, it is like a finely calibrated instrument that can be
thrown into disarray by the smallest disruption _ bad weather here
or anywhere else, late arrivals, air traffic control glitches or
bunching, when airlines schedule too many flights at once.
</P>
<P>
   A $340 million renovation, which is nearing completion, has made
the terminal more comfortable and modern, adding food courts and
enlarging the lower baggage area. Taxi space has also been improved
but there is no room to add what is most needed _ more runways _ so
congestion has become more common.
</P>
<P>
   Layne has seen tarmac traffic jams so many times that they no
longer faze him much. One recent Friday, the culprit was what Layne
calls popcorn storm cells, small clusters of turbulent weather,
which were north of the city, causing only light rain at the
airport, but forcing air traffic controllers to space out takeoffs
slightly. Layne pointed toward the radio in his van, which was
tuned to the channel used by the officials who direct traffic to
the runways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why you hear those long periods of silence on
there,'' he said, `is because nobody's moving out here. They don't
have anything to tell anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the United Airlines concourse that Friday, Stephanie
Black, a church secretary from Ossining, N.Y., had put her
9-year-old son, Daniel, on a flight by himself back to Denver to be
with his father. The jet pushed away at 11:29 a.m., a minute early.
As she waited, it did not take off. Thirty minutes passed. Then
forty-five. Black needed to go back to work. At 12:20, the jet
thundered down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's in there tearing his hair out,'' said Black, 29,
``probably asking the pilot if he can fly it himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that La Guardia makes an interesting laboratory
for viewing flight delays is that it is one of the few airports in
the country whose traffic is still limited by the Federal Aviation
Administration's high-density rule, which was created in 1969 to
prevent overtaxing the air traffic control system. The rule, which
now has many exemptions, basically means that no more than 1,224
flights are supposed to take off and land during La Guardia's peak
hours, from 6 a.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the exemptions and a steady increase in the
number of flights being scheduled by major airlines, the flight
limit has not prevented the growth of traffic at La Guardia,
especially in the last few years. A chart of all La Guardia
aircraft movements _ those of big jets, commuter jets, private jets
and propeller planes _ shows that last year, for example, there
were 371,000 takeoffs and landings, up from 358,157 in 1998 and
345,647 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, President Clinton signed a law intended to expand
service between New York and smaller cities by creating more slots
for small regional jets, those that hold up to 71 passengers, to
come into and leave La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the law, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
officials in Queens, have sued to try to stop the addition of
slots. They contend that the measure could add as many as 500
flights a day to the airport, swamping it, causing more delays,
clogging traffic and creating more noise.
</P>
<P>
   David Z. Plavin, the president of the Airports Council
International, a trade association representing major airport
operators, said that La Guardia was among 22 national airports
classified by the federal government as severely congested, meaning
that they have 20,000 hours or more of delays a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing outcry from passengers about those delays,
the chances for La Guardia, or many of the other airports, to ever
get off that list remain dim. In large part, this is because demand
for air travel is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines respond to that demand, Plavin said, not only with many
more flights, but also with smaller planes, which are more
economical for the airlines, yet mean more takeoffs and landings
for the same number of people. ``What I think we're seeing is a
tension in the system of people wanting to have more frequency to
places they want to fly and airlines obliging, but the system not
being able to handle that as efficiently as we need it to,'' Plavin
said. ``It used to be that you had two flights a day between some
major cities, and now there are maybe 10 or 20 or 30 by the same
airlines. It's not just a matter of insufficient hardware and
facilities.''

NEIL WILSON, 44, TENOR WHO SANG A MEMORABLE `WERTHER' AT THE MET 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Neil Wilson, a tenor who sang at the Metropolitan
Opera from 1988 to 1993 and was particularly admired for his
portrayal of the title role in Massenet's ``Werther,'' died on
Monday. He was 44 and had homes in New York and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was kidney cancer, said his manager, Neil Funkhauser.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was born in Lubbock, Texas, and received degrees at
Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, and at Oklahoma City
University. He began his operatic career in 1980 in a performance
of Verdi's ``Falstaff'' at Wolf Trap.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in the early 1980s in performances with the
Opera Orchestra of New York at Carnegie Hall and at the
Wuerttembergische Staatsoper in Stuttgart, Germany. In 1988, he
made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Macduff in Verdi's
``Macbeth.'' Other roles he sang with the company were Rodolfo in
Puccini's ``Boheme'' and Werther, both of which included broadcast
performances, and Alfred in Verdi's ``Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was selected as a leading tenor at the Komische Oper
in Berlin, and over the last decade he gave more than 150
performances in leading roles, both in the house and on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies with which he sang in recent seasons include the
Vienna Staatsoper, the Salzburg Festival, the New Israeli Opera,
the Canadian Opera Co., the Washington Opera, the Los Angeles
Opera, and Glyndebourne.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson won several vocal competitions and prizes, including the
Baltimore International Operatic Competition, the Rosa Ponselle
International Competition, and a contest sponsored by the Gerda
Lissner Foundation. In May, he was awarded the Wagner Prize by the
Liederkranz Foundation, and performed in a concert that the
foundation presented at Alice Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Linda Mungia; his mother, Shirley W.
Nease, of Abilene, Texas; two sisters, Nancy Fisher and Nora Del
Bosque, both of Austin, Texas; and two brothers, Noel Nease, of
Littleton, Colo., and Nathan Nease, of Abilene, Texas.

SPORTS COLUMN: LASORDA HAS HIGHER CALLING
</HEADLINE>
  By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  When he was managing for the O'Malley family, Tom Lasorda used to
preach that his blood was Dodgers blue. It was a great shtick that
earned him considerable television time in his early years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now Lasorda is talking red, white and blue, and his
perennial bluster is muted as he talks proudly about patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to sit at the head of the table and tell us,
`You ought to thank God you were born in the U.S.,''' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   He invokes the memory of his father, Sabatino, born in a little
town in the Abruzzi, the hardscrabble region to the east of Rome,
over toward the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father fought for Italy in World War I, and came over when
he was 21,'' Lasorda said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Not needing to footnote that Italy wound up on the other side in
World War II, Lasorda recalled how ``the Germans put all these guns
up in the hills in Tollo, where my father came from, 12 miles from
Pescara. The Americans came in and leveled the place.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lasorda family, then living in the Philadelphia area,
there were no ambiguities. They were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell us in his broken English, `You may be called on
to serve your country. You may be called on to fight. You may be
called on to give up your life,''' Lasorda recalled. ``He said it
would be an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda calls himself fortunate that he never had to bleed for
his country. It is no sacrifice at all for him to manage the U.S.
baseball team in the Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bigger than the World Series! Bigger than Major League
Baseball! Bigger than the Dodgers!'' shouts Lasorda, whose speech
demands to be defined by exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda will have no Garvey, no Fernando, no Dusty, but he
expects nothing less than a gold medal from these prospects and
journeymen. He will surely reprieve the old gall and bluster he
used on his Dodgers in the 1980s, acting as if they were
participating in Grade B war movies.
</P>
<P>
   When Lasorda tried to replace Cpl. Jay Johnstone on defense
during a September game, Johnstone growled, ``Nuts to you, Tommy, I
ain't coming out,'' and bolted back to the outfield as Lasorda
chortled.
</P>
<P>
   When Pvt. Mickey Hatcher led cheers like a UCLA pompom girl,
Capt. Lasorda swelled with blue Dodger pride.
</P>
<P>
   And when the bureaucrats suspended one of his best men, Lasorda
rallied the troops. The other day, he recalled a pivotal moment,
when the future of the world _ or at least Chavez Ravine _ hung in
the balance.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how his best relief pitcher, Jay Howell, was
detected using pine tar, a substance that gives the ball an extra
(and illegitimate) spin, during the 1988 championship series
against the Mets. Howell was tossed out of the game and ultimately
busted for two more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my guys, `We're not gonna let the loss of one guy
determine this series,''' Lasorda recalled. ``I said, `We're all
gonna have to dig in.' That was when Hershiser closed for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Late the next night, Spc. Orel Hershiser, deceptively
bespectacled and mild-mannered, volunteered to come out of the
bullpen in the 12th inning, saving the Dodgers' stunning Game 4
victory, and sending them toward a world championship. Lasorda had
already nicknamed him Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   He will surely have nicknames for his mix-and-match assortment
that will not have it easy in Sydney. He will try to drag
flashbacks from retreads like Pat Borders and a few others who have
had a taste of the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, who won the first two gold medals, in Barcelona and
Atlanta, will be back. Japan may bring as many as eight players
from their two major leagues, including the hot young pitcher
Daisuke Matsuzaka of the Seibu Lions. And South Korea is closing
down its pro league the way the NH L did for the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you right now, we're not gonna go 6,000 miles to
lose,'' Lasorda said over the telephone, so emphatically that one
could envision his index finger jabbing the air.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an immigrant from the Abruzzi can appreciate the
links between nations.
</P>
<P>
   Like Looie Carnesecca, the ambassador of basketball from St.
John's University, Lasorda has gone back to his ancestral homeland
to teach his sport. The Italians have learned well, and are one of
the eight qualifying nations for these Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play Italy on Sept. 22,'' Lasorda said. ``Olympic Stadium!
What an honor! It's my birthday!''

MAVERICKS, PISTONS SET FOR LAETTNER TRADE
</HEADLINE>

By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Mavericks hope to complete a trade for
Christian Laettner by Monday, owner Mark Cuban said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would send Cedric Ceballos, John Wallace and Eric
Murdock from the Mavericks to Detroit for Laettner, a former
All-American at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the earliest the trade can be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks acquired Wallace and Murdock on June 28, the day
of the NBA Draft, from New York and the Los Angeles Clippers,
respectively. NBA rules state that after a player is traded, a team
must wait 60 days to trade him again, and the waiting period for
the Mavs ends Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up Laettner, who is going into the last year of his
contract, gives the Mavs needed depth at center and power forward.
The eight-year veteran has played for three teams _ Minnesota,
Atlanta and Detroit _ and has averaged 15.7 points and 7.6 rebounds
over his career. He scored 12.2 points with 6.7 rebounds in 82
starts for Detroit last season.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted third overall by Minnesota in 1992, Laettner scored a
career-high 18.2 points per game, grabbed 8.7 rebounds and made the
all-rookie team that season. With Atlanta in '97, he averaged 18.1
points and a career-best 8.8 rebounds. Laettner starred on two
national championship teams at Duke, was selected collegiate player
of the year in '92 and played on the original Dream Team at the '92
Olympics, earning a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The trade would drop the Mavericks' roster to 15 players with
more changes possible. Cuban has told guard Dana Barros, acquired
last week in a four-team deal that netted point guard Howard
Eisley, that the team is trying to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, a 6-foot-7, 10-year veteran, averaged 16.6 points and
6.7 rebounds last season in mainly a reserve role. Despite starting
only 25 times, Ceballos was third on the team in scoring. But with
the team in the market for a backup to center Shawn Bradley,
Ceballos is the Mavericks player most often mentioned in trade
rumors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock, who missed 42 games last season because of tendinitis
in a knee, is not completely healthy and would have been hard
pressed to make the Mavs' final roster. Wallace, a 6-9 forward,
played sparingly with the Knicks last season. nn

ANALYSTS SAY MITSUBISHI'S PROBLEMS SHOULDN'T LINGER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Mitsubishi Motors has had perhaps its worst week in its
history. On Tuesday, the company acknowledged that it had concealed
customer complaints for more than two decades, and in a scene that
was televised nationally, its president profusely apologized to the
transportation minister. Its stock has dropped more than 6 percent
this week.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the admission, the company recalled 88,000 cars and
trucks, adding to a recall of 532,000 vehicles announced last
month. But despite the public humiliation, Mitsubishi, Japan's
fourth-largest car manufacturer, is not likely to suffer a
significant loss in sales or damage to its brand image in Japan,
analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direct impact from the recall is negligible,'' said Koji
Endo, an automobile analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   For one, analysts said, Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of
Subarus, and Daihatu Motors were forced to recall cars in the late
1990s, with little effect on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese consumers' attention tends to go to new car models,''
said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the admitted deception, ``in Mitsubishi's case,
there were injuries involving one vehicle out of 600,000 to 700,000
recalled,'' Sugiura said, further limiting potential public
reaction to the recall.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the matter of Mitsubishi's powerful name. The
Mitsubishi cluster of companies, or keirestsu _ which includes
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries _ has a work force that numbers in the
hundreds of thousands, and many of those workers can be expected to
be loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Mitsubishi, which makes models like the Montero
sport utility vehicle, the Galant sedan and the Mirage compact, has
already been suffering from weak sales in Japan and abroad.
Mitsubishi Motors' domestic car sales fell by more than 3 percent
for the six months ended in June, while Honda Motor's sales rose
9.7 percent, and Toyota Motor's gained 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi Motors is also plagued by huge debt. To survive, the
company has sought an alliance with DaimlerChrysler, which has
agreed to take a 34 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi has estimated that the cost of the recall, which
involves replacement parts and repair work, will be about 7.5
billion yen _ or about $70.2 million, based on current exchange
rates _ an amount that is not expected to significantly add to the
company's projected net loss of 70 billion yen, or $655 million,
for the fiscal year ending March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The loss is largely a result of insufficient funds for
liabilities stemming from pension and retirement payments.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cost of the recall could ultimately swell to nearly
10 billion yen, ``that could be offset by selling plants, stocks or
land,'' Endo of First Boston said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi also faces a possible criminal prosecution for
failing to report defects to the government. The Tokyo police said
Thursday that they were considering an investigation. But the
maximum penalty under Japanese law is a fine of 4 million yen, or
$37,500. The true punishment is ``the social sanction for getting
penalized,'' said Yukikazu Komiyama, an official with the Ministry
of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But pride in the Mitsubishi name may offset any such sanction.
``People who work for Mitsubishi group companies will shore up
sales of Mitsubishi cars,'' Endo said. ``There might even be a
campaign to buy a Mitsubishi.''

OATES IS LOSING PATIENCE AS PERISHO LOSES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One-third of the Texas Rangers' experiment with young
pitching is coming to a conclusion. Matt Perisho is just about out
of chances to win a spot in the Rangers' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   That has become increasingly apparent with each start, and
manager Johnny Oates all but confirmed it Thursday. Perisho,
despite being given a 4-1 lead, gave up eight runs in three-plus
innings and lost to the New York Yankees, 8-7, at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho is 2-7 with a 7.34 earned-run average. It's no
coincidence that Ryan Glynn began his medical rehabilitation
assignment by starting Thursday night for Triple-A Oklahoma. Glynn,
a youngster inserted in the rotation along with Perisho and Doug
Davis, could be ready to pitch Tuesday, when Perisho's spot comes
up again. Oates said he hasn't made up his mind who will start
Tuesday but said there's a reason why Glynn started Thursday night.
Oates said much depends on what kind of report he gets after Glynn
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But Oates added, ``Ryan Glynn is going to pitch in the starting
rotation. Whose spot, I don't know. But he's earned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his assessment of Perisho's performance, Oates said:
``Consistent. Consistent with what I've seen most of the year. Not
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he's done evaluating Perisho, Oates said, ``I don't
know if it's accurate, but I've got an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho has given up 18 runs in his past two starts and is
winless in his past 11 starts. Even he seems to believe that he's
running out of chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' said Perisho, a 15-game
winner in Triple A last year who has yet to build on that success.
``I'm not concerned about that. I'm more worried about getting
people out at this level. No matter where I'm at for the next 45
days, all I'm trying to do is figure out how to get people out. No
matter if it's the rotation or the bullpen, I've got to get people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho did not lose to the defending world champions. This was
not the same team that finished off the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of
the World Series last year. Shortstop Derek Jeter, third baseman
Scott Brosius and catcher Jorge Posada, who got a rare start at
first base, were the only ones in the lineup Thursday who started
Game 4 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Missing were Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez, Paul O'Neill,
Darryl Strawberry (yes, he's technically still a Yankee) and Chuck
Knoblauch. All are either injured or, in Strawberry's case,
suspended. Their starting left fielder from Game 4, Ricky Ledee,
started for the Rangers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers met a team banged up as much as they were and still
lost. The Yankees did have 15-game winner Andy Pettitte on the
mound, but the Rangers got five runs off him in the first four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see the best team in baseball,'' first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro said. ``They have a lot of guys sitting out, and
their pitchers were not at the top of their game. Come playoff
time, you'll see a different team playing at a different level. We
should have taken advantage of it, but they were able to piece it
together to win three out of four.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were the sloppy team early, and the Rangers took
advantage of a couple of errors to forge a 4-1 lead. But Perisho
couldn't hold it. The Yankees put together five hits, a walk and a
couple of Rangers defensive mistakes to score five in the third.
The Rangers got one back in the fourth, but Glenallen Hill finished
Perisho with a two-run home run in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a good pitch, they hit a single,'' Perisho said. ``If I
make a bad pitch, they hit a home run. All I need to do is to keep
going out there and learn. Whether it's this year or next year or
in two years, I'm going to get balls that are hit at people and
make pitches that are popped up instead of hit for home runs.'' nn

UNUSUAL LINEUP MAKES FOR BAD BASEBALL BUT A GOOD VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ball was launched hard off the bat and appeared
headed for center field. Chad Curtis thought he had led off the
Texas Rangers' ninth inning with an exclamation, until pitcher
Mariano Rivera raised his glove and denied Curtis a leadoff single.
The ball knocked Rivera backward, leaving him with an expression
somewhere between a smile and a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to get any uglier than that, so it might help
him out a little,'' the New York Yankees' Jorge Posada joked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the game. Fielding a lineup that
turned a few heads, the Yankees ended a messy homestand with a
sloppy 8-7 victory over the Texas Rangers Thursday at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The last week has lacked aesthetics. The Yankee bullpen blew its
third lead of the homestand on Wednesday night before the team
rallied in the ninth for a victory. In all, the Yankees won five of
eight games at the Stadium and now will travel to the West Coast to
play Oakland Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had their share of highlights Thursday, from
Glenallen Hill's love-in with the fans in the bleachers to Andy
Pettitte's persistence to Jose Canseco's footwork to Jason
Grimsley's two hitless innings of relief. But the Yankees and the
Rangers also combined for three errors and numerous mental blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game to win, because we definitely didn't play a
good ballgame,'' said Pettitte (16-6), who won his seventh straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup was less than a thing of beauty. With Bernie Williams
(sore rib cage) and Paul O'Neill (hip pointer) resting injuries,
manager Joe Torre started an outfield of Hill, Clay Bellinger and
David Justice, who returned after missing three games with a sore
neck. Posada played first with Chris Turner catching. Jose Vizcaino
started at second base.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees had Pettitte and his knack for run support on
their side. The team is averaging 7.48 runs in Pettitte's 25
starts, including 11.17 in his previous six starts. Torre joked
that other pitchers were jealous and said before the game, ``If it
happens today with the little bit of a skeleton lineup we have,
then you know Andy Pettitte has an angel on his shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   That angel could have sprouted horns when Pettitte fell behind
by 4-1 in the third inning as his teammates appeared out of sync.
Posada closed his glove too soon on a throw to first in the first
inning for an error, and then he started an unusual sequence in the
third. Ricky Ledee's grounder bounced off Posada's glove and to
Vizcaino, who threw the ball past Pettitte at first base, allowing
one run to score. Curtis, who had stopped running at third, jogged
home unimpeded when Turner chased the ball to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Pettitte was confident that his team would score off the
Texas starter Matt Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees batted around for five runs in the third on the legs
of Canseco. With Posada on first and Canseco, who has a sore left
heel, on second, and three runs already in during the inning,
Turner laid down a sacrifice bunt. Canseco raced to third and beat
Perisho's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Bellinger hit a grounder to third with the bases
loaded and one out, Canseco looked like a tight end as he rambled
home. He saw Texas catcher Robert Waszgis casually standing behind
the plate. Third baseman Scott Sheldon threw home. That startled
Canseco, who saw that the catcher was out of position, and
apparently Waszgis, who was straddling the plate and failed to get
the forceout. The Yankees led, 6-4, but Texas scored once in the
fourth inning. Then, in the bottom of the inning, Hill punctuated
the afternoon with a mammoth two-run home run. The ball caromed off
the front of the center-field bleachers as Hill just missed
reaching the black seats for the second time in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is batting .429 since his trade from the Cubs on July 20,
with 12 homers in 70 at-bats. He batted .455 with six homers on the
homestand and extended his career-high hitting streak to 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the ballpark every day and the ball flies off the
bat, but usually that happens in batting practice,'' Hill said.
``It feels good to have it happen in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre says the team now expects every ball Hill hits in the air
to carry for a home run. ``That's crazy,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making this ballpark look like Enron Field or Coors
Field,'' Pettitte said.

ARTHUR NEWMAN, 92, A BARITONE HEARD IN 50 ROLES AT CITY OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur Newman, a baritone who sang with the New York
City Opera in the 1940s and '50s, died on Aug. 6 in Scottsdale,
Ariz. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who was born in St. Louis, began his stage career in the
1930s as a member of the Missouri Theater Company. Although his
roles were primarily nonmusical, by the mid-1930s he began studying
voice and operatic roles, and in 1939 he joined the St. Louis Grand
Opera Association. In four seasons with the company, he sang
secondary roles in ``Otello,'' ``Rigoletto,'' ``Traviata,''
Tosca,'' ``Manon'' ``Martha'' and ``Mignon.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman also became a featured singer at a St. Louis radio
station, KMOX, where for several years he and his wife, Helen
Wright, presented a weekly program of vocal duets. In the early
1940s, he also sang with the International Opera of Havana and with
the St. Louis Chamber Opera. His first performances in New York
were in a production of Offenbach's ``Vie Parisienne'' presented by
the New Opera Co.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the New York City Opera in the 1944-45 season and made
his debut as Schaunard in ``La Boheme'' in April 1945. He remained
on the company's roster until 1959 and is credited with more than
1,300 performances in more than 50 roles. Many were smaller, comic
roles like the Sacristan in ``Tosca'' and Antonio in ``Nozze di
Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sang Masetto in ``Don Giovanni,'' a handful of roles in
``Der Rosenkavalier'' and Escamillo in ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sang small roles on several recordings for RCA,
including Arturo Toscanini's recordings of ``Otello'' and ``La
Traviata.'' When he left the City Opera, he took a professorship at
Wichita State University in Kansas, where he taught until his
retirement in 1973. Among his students were the bass Samuel Ramey.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Frances Sandoval, of Fountain
Hills, Ariz.; two sons, Frank, of Oak Hill, Va., and Greg, of
Silver City, N.M.; and a sister, Bertha Siteman, of St. Louis.

   A BOOST FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   New polls show Vice President Al Gore has enjoyed a significant
post-convention boost in four crucial big states, overtaking Gov.
George W. Bush in Minnesota and perhaps in Michigan and increasing
his lead in New Jersey and California. Ralph Nader, the Green Party
nominee, slipped in all four states.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, an EPIC-MRA poll showed Gore ahead of Bush by two
points. That lead was within the poll's margin of sampling error of
plus or minus four percentage points. In a pre-convention poll, he
trailed Bush by eight points.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, a Mason-Dixon poll gave Gore an eight-point lead
over Bush. A July Mason-Dixon Poll had Bush ahead of Gore by three
points.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, gave
Gore a 12-point lead. A New Jersey poll taken just before the
Republican convention had Gore ahead by only four points.
</P>

   A BIG FUND-RAISING NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore pulled in more than $1.25 million
Wednesday night in a pair of fund-raising dinners in Washington for
the Democratic National Committee. The first dinner drew 30 people,
most of them Indian-Americans, who paid $5,000 each. With other
contributions, the dinner yielded $250,000. The host of the dinner
was Ramesh Kapur, owner of a medical technology firm in Winchester,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The second dinner drew about 20 people, most of them friends of
Gore's running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, who also attended. They
each paid or raised $50,000, for a total of $1 million. Both
dinners were served at the Mayflower Hotel, but the second was a
Glatt Kosher meal, the pure form of Kosher food, blessed by a rabbi
and provided by a restaurant, Dahan of Washington. Its host was
Marvin Lender, who once ran his family business, Lender's Bagels,
and is now an executive with M&AMP;M Industries, based in Woodbridge,
Conn.

DODGERS READY FOR RETURN TO WRIGLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Call it the 16th parallel, the line separating players
from fans along the right field bullpen at Wrigley Field. It's
impacted the Dodgers season perhaps more than anything else, and
today they return to the scene of the alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   More than three months ago many of Dodgers players spilled into
the Wrigley Field stands to fight with fans, and from the incident
16 players were originally suspended and fined. Because of that May
16 fiasco, the Chicago Cubs modified their security approach to
ensure such incidents don't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The revamped security measures, which include plain-clothed,
off-duty police officers sitting in the stands, could get its most
stringent test today. The Dodgers and Cubs play a doubleheader,
giving fans plenty of time to kick back and enjoy a beer, or four.
Many of those involved in the original melee said alcohol
consumption played a major role.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rathje, director of stadium operations for the Cubs, said
additional security has been added to the bullpen area. In
addition, a crowd-control person has been added, security now
checks every ticket in the area, other security guards had their
positions changed to better view the area and security personnel
are stationed adjacent to the bullpen bench and waist-high wall
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Also, beer sales are cut off at 9:20 p.m. or after the seventh
inning for night games. Beer sales stop after the eighth inning of
day games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We changed a few things after that incident and pretty much
for the rest of the season we've been going with the plan,'' Rathje
said. ``Obviously, we're going to emphasize that area.''
</P>
<P>
   The altercation began in the bottom of the ninth when catcher
Chad Kreuter was allegedly struck in the back of the head and had
his cap stolen. Kreuter said he went into the stands to apprehend
the perpetrator because there was insufficient security.
</P>
<P>
   On his way back out of the stands, Kreuter said he was hit
several times. Teammates went to Kreuter's aid, with several
climbing into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   From it, 16 players, three coaches and an on-field assistant
were suspended for a total of 89 games and fined $77,000. After
appeals were filed, only five players, two coaches and bullpen
catcher Travis Barbary were suspended a total of 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see the crowd's reaction,'' said
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley, whose three-game suspension was
overturned. ``But from our standpoint, it's business as usual. For
me, it's passed, but we'll have to wait and see. I'm sure the fans
still remember and will exploit it. Obviously, we can't let that
happen again. And the Cubs better not let it happen. Security had
better do things better.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Dodgers say they have moved on, the issue isn't dead.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, left fielder Gary Sheffield will miss the first
three games of the series after dropping his appeal of a five-game
suspension Wednesday. Off the field, lawsuits could take time to
run their courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that (security) would be better,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``Common sense would tell you
that it would be.'' &QL;

HARRY BRONSTEIN, 83, OFFICIAL WHO WIDENED HIRING BY CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harry Bronstein, a veteran New York City official who
was instrumental in changes that made it easier for women and
members of minority groups to become police officers and sanitation
workers, died on Aug. 3 in Los Angeles. He was 83 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein was the city's director of personnel and chairman of
its Civil Service Commission from 1970 to 1974. He was assistant
director of the budget when he was appointed to the personnel and
Civil Service Commission posts by Mayor John Lindsay. He was
reappointed in 1974 by Lindsay's successor, Abraham Beame.
</P>
<P>
   As Civil Service Commission chairman, Bronstein was one of the
two key officials, the other being Police Commissioner Donald
Cawley, who were involved in two changes in a Police Department
qualifying examination that were announced late in 1973. The height
requirement was dropped from the physical test and written test
questions that were seen by some as culturally biased were screened
out.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein was also instrumental in creating a training program
to prepare candidates, especially from minority groups, for the
city's sanitation worker examinations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Bronstein moved to a personnel post at the city's
Health and Hospitals Corp. In 1976, he moved to Los Angeles, where
he was personnel director of Warner Communications for a time.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in East Harlem, grew up there, and later attended
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, not long after graduating from high school, he entered
city service as a $15-a-week clerk. He rose through the ranks to
become chief budget examiner.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, as an infantry sergeant, he took part in the
Normandy invasion and received the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Sylvia; a daughter, Lynne Bronstein, of
Santa Monica, Calif.; a son, Elliot, of Los Angeles; and two
sisters, Claire Raizner, of Houston, and Anne Fenton, of Deerfield
Beach, Fla.

GREEN RETURNING TO FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was asked what it
would mean to get back Shawn Green, who finally is hitting again
after a two-month slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh, how about everything,'' Johnson said. ``He was so great
in the first half and the pitchers made adjustments. Now, he is
adjusting to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Green entered the homestand batting just .219 in the second
half, hardly the numbers the Dodgers expected when they signed him
to a six-year, $84 million contract last winter.
</P>
<P>
   But they never questioned his work ethic. Johnson said that
Green's overzealous approach to hitting might have resulted in
undue pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Including a home run in the fourth inning of Thursday's 7-0
Dodgers victory over Montreal, Green was 10 for 28 against the
Expos and Mets, whom the Dodgers faced in their previous series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel like I'm hitting as well as I have this
season,'' Green said. ``It still isn't good enough, but things are
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said that more important than the home run was the fact
that he hit it to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good sign when I am using the whole field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of good signs in the first half when Green
reached safely in 53 consecutive games. His steadying influence was
a huge departure from the volatile Raul Mondesi, who went to
Toronto in exchange for Green. Johnson just hopes Green's
contribution can get the Dodgers back in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back at the first half, maybe I played him too
much,'' he said. ``But we really didn't have anybody to take his
place even for a day. The guy we saw in the first half is the real
Shawn Green. I think that guy is back. He looks relaxed again.''
</P>
<P>
   OLSON EFFECTIVE: After four months on the disabled list with a
sore right forearm, right-handed reliever Gregg Olson, 33, is
beginning to show why the Dodgers signed him last winter. In his
last three outings, he has pitched four scoreless innings,
including two on Thursday with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only do rehab so long,'' bullpen coach Rick Dempsey
said. ``You have to find out what you have right here, and he
finally has found it. His curveball has been just freezing guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who struck out the side in the ninth inning, has had a
history of arm trouble. Before spending the past two years in
Arizona, Olson played for eight clubs in the previous four years
trying to come back from a serious elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of embarrassed that they signed me and I've spent
all this time injured,'' he said. ``When I came back I got roughed
up a little because I was trying to throw a 90-91 mph fastball that
just wasn't there, yet. Now I am getting ahead of hitters. It's
when you don't that there is trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   WILLIS' WAY: The Dodgers have been criticized for their
one-dimensional, power-only offense, but Maury Wills wasn't going
to join the debate. The former stolen base champion, who now serves
as a part-time instructor with the Expos, did say, however, there
was a reason he played on three World Series championships with the
club (1959, 1963, 1965).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put on a show with (home runs), but you can't win with
that,'' said Wills, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes. ``The
Cardinals (with Mark McGwire) and the Cubs (with Sosa) proved that
last year. Winning games is a collective thing. You need those guys
at the top of the order to get on. The stolen base and the hit and
run softens up a pitcher. When everyone contributes you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills, the 1962 NL MVP and a former manager in Seattle, is in
his first season with the Expos. He spent the past two years as an
instructor with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS: Eric Karros' fourth-inning single extended his
hitting streak to nine games. He went 1 for 3 on Thursday, which
actually dropped his average to .405 (15 for 37) during that span.
Karros' longest hitting streak this season is 11 games, from May
5-17. ... Since his costly throwing error in Sunday's game, third
baseman Adrian Beltre has been on a tear at the plate. Beltre went
3 for 4 on Thursday and is 8 for 18 (.444) in his last five games.
Since the All-Star break, Beltre is batting .342 (50 for 146). &QL;

MUSLIM CHARITY HAS TIES TO TERRORISTS, U.S. CONTENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo.)   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State Department has asked the Agency for International
Development to withdraw its registration from one of the largest
Muslim charities in the United States, saying it has ties to the
terrorist group Hamas, government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Madison, a spokesman for the agency, said it had not
officially heard from the department, but when it did, ``the
agency's officials will take appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency has started to review how it registers charities
and relief groups that work overseas, a procedure that allows the
groups to get U.S. government grants and contracts. The agency has
also stopped listing registered groups on its Web site until the
review is complete, the agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the State Department's request was part of an
effort to clamp down on charities and relief organizations
suspected of being used to support Islamic terrorist organizations
acting against American citizens. The effort was prompted by recent
terrorist attacks and plots against Americans and American
property.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said AID had asked the State Department to produce
evidence supporting its concerns about the Muslim charity, Holy
Land Foundation for Relief and Development, an Islamic relief group
based in Richardson, Texas. Government officials they suspect that
the group is tied to Hamas because it provides support to families
of suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, contending that the foundation is a front for Hamas,
closed it and four other charities in May 1997. Earlier this year,
the family of an American killed in a terrorist attack in Israel
filed a civil suit against Holy Land, seeking monetary damages for
what the suit contends is its support of Hamas-inspired terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the foundation, Dalal Mohammed, said she was
surprised to learn of the State Department's request. ``We're in
close cooperation with AID,'' Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
   The charity, which says it raises about $6 million a year for
the poor, mostly Palestinians, has repeatedly denied an affiliation
with Hamas or any other terrorist group. It says it is the object
of an Israeli vendetta to deny charity to needy Palestinians in
Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   While Holy Land has not applied for federal grants, withdrawing
its registration would prevent it from asserting, as it has in
recent publications, that it has been ``accepted and certified'' by
AID.
</P>
<P>
   The request for the revocation came last week from the State
Department's counterterrorism office, which told AID that the
charity's work was ``contrary to the national defense and foreign
policy interests of the United States'' and that the charity
provided indirect support to Hamas, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said an interagency committee was
drafting new guidelines for vetting relief groups more meticulously
to ensure that ``bad groups do not get recognition or money from
the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of its review, AID might decide to stop registering
private charities altogether, one AID official said.
</P>
<P>
   The current registration procedures are quite loose, the
official said. None of the agency's eight requirements for
registration specifically prohibits groups from supporting
terrorism or engaging in activities that could damage American
foreign policy interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation seems to have taken advantage of some very
sloppy registration procedures,'' the official said. ``That's why
the requirements at the very least must be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   AID approved the Holy Land Foundation's request for registration
on June 29, despite the fact that the charity was included in a
list of 30 Islamic relief groups that are the focus of government
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department request is yet another political
embarrassment for the independent agency, which reports directly to
the secretary of state and which prominent members of Congress
tried to abolish several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the agency, also at the State Department's request,
revoked two grants worth $4.2 million to the Islamic African Relief
Agency, a Islamic charity based in Columbia, Mo. Government
officials asserted that the charity had ties to Sudan, which the
State Department has identified as a sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Mubarak, the organization's president, said at the time
that the charity had ``nothing to do with Sudan'' and denied that
it supported terrorism. Since then, the charity has challenged its
suspension as unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   AID's handling of its registration procedures shows how
difficult it is for the government to restrict groups it suspects
of having terrorist ties without jeopardizing their civil
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said their investigations could reveal
evidence of terrorist ties that falls short of a ``smoking gun''
that could be used to prosecute such charities on charges of
violating a 1996 law banning fund raising by and contributions to
groups that sponsor or support international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   According to government documents and interviews with officials,
the government has been investigating the Holy Land Foundation
since 1996. But no charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we can't deny a group registration or funding to a
group simply because it is being investigated,'' a State Department
official said. ``But in this case, we concluded that Holy Land's
support for the widows and orphans of suicide bombers was inimical
to the American-led peace process in the Middle East, and hence, to
American national security and foreign policy objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a State Department official said, the
administration did not want to jeopardize the work of more than
6,000 legitimate Islamic groups operating worldwide, which provide
crucial emergency relief in dangerous and desperate places, often
with the support of friendly states. Nor, he added, does it want to
be publicly criticized as being anti-Muslim.

ANGELS RETURN WITHOUT SCARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels got a much-deserved day off
Thursday after completing their nine-game trip to Toronto, New York
and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Angels finished the trip at a mediocre 4-5, they
returned home in one piece. That is, still in playoff contention.
When they landed at LAX early Thursday morning, they were 3{ games
behind the Indians in the wild-card race and 5{ behind the Mariners
in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won the last game I wouldn't look at it as a winning
trip just like I don't look at it as a losing trip,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``This team has learned to focus its energies into
that day's game and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect this team to do anything but be in it down to
the wire, like any championship-caliber ballclub. That's where our
goals are, this is where we expected to be. It's the opportunity
you hope for when you're in spring training, and we certainly have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild-card race likely will require one team to put together
a significant winning streak. Even though the Angels were only 3{
games out at the start of Thursday, they were in the fifth spot in
the wild-card standings, trailing Cleveland, Boston, Oakland and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still right there,'' first baseman Mo Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   FINLEY NIGHT: The Angels will honor pitcher Chuck Finley tonight
for being voted onto the organization's all-time team. It will be
Finley's first time back at Edison Field since he signed a
three-year, $27 million contract with the Indians last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, the Angels' all-time winningest pitcher, faced the
Angels twice in Cleveland earlier this season, going 1-0 (one
no-decision) with a 2.13 ERA. The Indians won both games he
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back there will be weird,'' Finley said earlier this
month. ``Facing them (in Cleveland) was different, but pitching in
that ballpark will be strange, especially going in from the
first-base (visitors') dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley will start Sunday's game against Angels' starter Kent
Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   ERSTAD RETURNS: Left fielder Darin Erstad is expected to return
to the starting lineup tonight for the first time since Saturday in
New York, when he left after three innings because of a muscle
strain on the left side of his rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad took live batting practice for the first time Wednesday
and came out of it fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels better,'' Erstad said. ``Does it feel normal? No. It
hurts to do the little things, but when I do things all out, I
don't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   STREAK ENDS: Reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa's scoreless-innings
streak ended at 232/3 innings on Monday in Boston, the second
longest scoreless-innings streak by a reliever in the majors this
season. But Hasegawa, who leads the team with eight wins, has not
fallen out of his groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about (the streak) but when you're on the mound you
never think about it,'' said Hasegawa, who has filled in as the
closer while Troy Percival has been out with an elbow injury.
``From the beginning of the season I felt so good. In spring
training I felt good, so I knew it was going to be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival is expected to be activated from the disabled list
today or Saturday. &QL;

WITH VERIZON STRIKE SETTLED, BACKLOG OF PHONE ORDERS AWAITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Del., Va., W.Va., Penn., Md.)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Verizon Communications and the remainder of its
striking workers settled a walkout late Wednesday after an 18-day
strike. It will take the company almost twice that long to work
through its backlog of repairs and orders.
</P>
<P>
   Although about two-thirds of the strikers reached an agreement
with the company and returned to work in New York and New England
earlier in the week, 35,000 members of the Communications Workers
of America in several mid-Atlantic states remained on strike and
returned to work only Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
West Virginia, Virginia and Washington was reached after Verizon,
which was created by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, agreed to
lower mandatory overtime to a maximum of 7.5 hours a week for
customer service representatives, down from 15 hours previously.
Other union members agreed to a maximum of eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the settlements for the unions that went on strike,
the Communications Workers and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, are basically the same in the two regions. They
include wage and benefit increases, stock options, greater job
security and more flexibility to organize in Verizon's fast-growing
wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of the settlements include coverage for obesity
treatment, discounted laser eye surgery, coverage for reproductive
and fertility treatment, adoption reimbursement, increased
reimbursement for dental care and a bilingual pay differential of
3.5 percent for workers in jobs that require more than one
language.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is subject to ratification by union members
through the mail, in a process expected to take two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon is now turning to the demands of its customers. It will
take about a month for the company to work through roughly 50,000
delayed repairs and more than 200,000 orders for new service as a
result of the strike. But many customers are already frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never give Verizon another cent in my life,'' said
Chiwoniso Kaitano, 25, a Columbia University graduate student from
Zimbabwe. ``During the strike they told me it would take 48 hours
to get a phone in my new apartment, and now they're telling me it
will be another month. This reminds me of the telecom services of
an underdeveloped country.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers who need new phone service have few alternatives aside
from acquiring a wireless phone, as Kaitano said she planned to do
_ from a carrier other than Verizon. Even if customers try to get
local dial tone service from one of Verizon's competitors, like
AT&AMP;T or MCI Worldcom, there could be delays because those companies
use parts of Verizon's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing people can do is be patient,'' said Eric Rabe,
Verizon's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon customers in the 12 Eastern states and Washington, where
the strike took place, can call customer service numbers printed on
their bills. Or they can use the Verizon Web site, www.verizon.com,
to order new service or request repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon also sought to reassure investors and press forward with
its corporate strategies. The company said the settlement would not
affect its earnings in coming quarters, and investors on Thursday
bid up the company's shares $1.13, to $41.63.
</P>
<P>
   The company's wireless division, which operates as a venture
with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, filed Thursday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell as much as $5 billion in
shares in what would be one of the largest initial public offerings
ever. The share sale, which is being managed by Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., is expected before the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the settlement, Verizon and the Communications Workers
of America showed some evidence of lingering bad feelings.
According to Verizon, negotiators for the union in the mid-Atlantic
states submitted several demands after their colleagues in New York
and New England returned to work on Monday.

CHENEY STRONGLY DEFENDS HIS WORK AT HALLIBURTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL POINT, Ore. _ Dick Cheney vehemently defended his work
in the oil services business Thursday, bristling at any suggestion
that he was less than successful as the chief executive of
Halliburton and insisting once more that as vice president he would
take steps to ensure that his retirement package did not pose a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from being a second-tier, second-rank energy services
company to being the biggest in the world,'' he told reporters. He
complained that a front-page article in The New York Times on
Thursday that characterized his record at Halliburton as mixed was
``a distortion,'' ``bad journalism'' and ``seriously flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By any measure you want to use, Halliburton has been a great
success story over the last few years, contrary to what your
colleagues at The New York Times reported,'' he said after
addressing members of the Future Farmers of America here at Crater
High School in southern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's five years at the helm of Halliburton have drawn a
great deal of attention _ and criticism _ since he was tapped by
George W. Bush last month to be his running mate. Democrats
ridiculed the Republicans as the big-oil ticket, since Cheney and
Bush both worked in the oil industry in Texas. In addition,
Halliburton offered Cheney a retirement package that, as currently
structured, would leave him with stock options that are not
scheduled to vest until 2001 or 2002 _ meaning that as vice
president he would have a great personal interest in the price of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Cheney's work at Halliburton that was
published in The Times on Thursday questioned the success of the
company's merger with Dresser Industries, the biggest deal he made;
found that while the company's stock rose, it still underperformed
most stocks in the industry; and described serious problems with a
subsidiary that builds roads.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who had earlier declined to be interviewed for the
article, criticized the prominence the article gave to the
company's problems with road construction, saying that the work
represented only a small part of Halliburton's business.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to point out projects that he said the company
completed successfully, like Enron Stadium in Houston, an oil
platform that the company built for Exxon in a part of the Gulf of
Mexico that is nearly a mile deep, and a natural gas complex in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney acknowledged that there had been problems with the
highway projects undertaken by Brown &AMP; Root, a unit of Halliburton,
and said many of them were exacerbated after the company got out of
the road- building business. ``We basically made a decision on my
watch to get out of the road-building business, and what you see
there is the residue,'' he said, adding that once the decision was
made many experts in road construction left the company.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would find a way to handle his retirement package
so that it would not pose a conflict of interest if he was elected
vice president. ``There is no conflict until I'm sworn in, and by
the time I'm sworn in I'll have done whatever's necessary to make
sure there isn't,'' he said. ``I don't know what more I can say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's business dealings have become a campaign issue. He
found himself questioned by reporters about rising oil prices at
several stops during a campaign swing through California and Oregon
this week. And when he was met by an enthusiastic crowd at the
opening of the new headquarters of the Kern County Republican Party
in Bakersfield, Calif., a Republican stronghold in the state, a
dozen protesters gathered across the street holding aloft signs
that said ``Cheney Oil'' and ``Halliburton: $39 million,'' a
reference to one estimate of the value of his retirement package.

VIDEO GAME GIANTS TO FIGHT BATTLE ROYAL IN UNITED STATES
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The home video game industry is about to embark
on what is certain to become a bitter and bloody year of new
technology and cost-cutting, which many people in the business say
will claim one or more victims.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo offered the opening move Thursday at the Spaceworld
video-game trade show in Tokyo, announcing both a new home console
based on an IBM PowerPC microprocessor and a new version of its
hand-held Game Boy portable system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither system is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. market before
next year. For this Christmas, the Sony Corp. will clearly dominate
the U.S. market with its highly promoted Playstation 2, scheduled
to go on sale in the United States on Oct. 22. It is a machine
based on a custom chip developed with a $1.3 billion investment
Sony made jointly with Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   In the wings, the Microsoft Corp. is stalking the game industry
with its own Intel-based video-game system that the company says it
hopes will arrive for the Christmas 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the frenetic competition to dominate the game
console market has forced Sega to retool its strategy. On Sept. 7,
the company will bring out its Sega online game network. It will
also reportedly reduce the price of its Dreamcast video-game
system, which has trailed Sony's Playstation in the American
market.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation video game market is being attacked by giant
consumer electronics and software companies that have different
views of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like three giant planets colliding,'' said Greg Galanos,
a longtime software tool developer for the video game industry, who
is now managing director for Softbank Venture Capital in Mountain
View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the three giants, Sony is intent on creating a
round-the-clock home entertainment portal, Nintendo has focused on
a game-appliance strategy and Microsoft is bringing its PC-centric
strategy to a consumer electronics world, Galanos said.
</P>
<P>
   Sega is not as strong, he said. ``Sega is likely to end up as a
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega, which industry reports say will soon cut the price of its
Dreamcast machine to $149, from $199, and bundle the price of the
machine into its new online game business, has been saying that the
Sony Playstation 2 does not have as large a technical advantage as
the Japanese consumer giant has claimed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sega executives are warning that a performance
war between the giants may ultimately damage the video game
industry. ``If Sony and Microsoft continue to outspec themselves,
they will kill each other and take the industry with them,'' said
Charles Bellfield, communications director for Sega of America
Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has made far-reaching performance claims for the
Playstation 2 and, as a result, is enduring some criticism from
game experts who have suggested that the first games available for
the new system have not matched the talk.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Microsoft is trying to market its machine as
more powerful than the Playstation 2, while saying that the company
is being careful not to ``overpromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that all of the video game makers, which generally
do about 80 percent of their business during the Christmas selling
season, could face stiff competition this year from other, new
intelligent consumer appliances that will be vying for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Christmas, we're going to see big pushes from both Replay
and TiVo,'' said Nick Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a San
Francisco-based consumer electronics market research firm. TiVo and
ReplayTV are the leading brands of digital video recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, he said, will be presented with a wide variety of
different choices this year. In addition to the new digital video
recorders, there will be hand-held gadgets like cell phones and
personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the game companies will be challenged to explain their
next generation products to consumers. All of the machines will add
features like network connections and the ability to play DVDs and
CDs, making them appear closer to interactive set-top television
boxes than dedicated gaming appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're selling both floor wax and dessert topping,''
Donatiello said. ``How are they going to get the message across?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nintendo seemed intent on proving that its Gamecube could
compete head-to-head with Sony and Microsoft. The system will
include a proprietary 1.5-gigabyte optical disk storage system and
will have wireless game controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The system will go on sale in Japan in July 2001 and come to the
United States three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will introduce its system, which will be manufactured
in Mexico by Flextronics, about the same time. The system will
include a 10 gigabyte or larger hard disk and an Ethernet
connection and will come without an operating system. The operating
system will be carried on each game disk and loaded when the disk
is inserted to play a game.

MANY WAYS TO CALCULATE PROPOSED TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How big is George W. Bush's proposed tax cut? There is no single
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first nine years that the program could be in effect
starting in the 2002 fiscal year, the first to begin after Bush
would take office, the tax cut is estimated by Congress'
nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee to reduce federal revenue by about
$1.3 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But tax cuts are sometimes described in terms of their effect
not just on revenue, but on how much of the projected budget
surplus they would consume. The projections concerning the surplus
assume that all excess federal revenue would go toward reducing the
national debt. If any of the surplus is spent or used for tax cuts,
the debt would be reduced by a lesser amount. As a result, the
government would have to pay more interest on the debt than it
would if all the surplus had gone to debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a $1.3 trillion tax cut, the government's
interest bill would be roughly $300 billion higher over nine years
than if there were no tax cut. So it would also be fair to say that
Bush's tax cut would use $1.6 trillion of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a wrinkle. Major tax and spending programs are
usually described in terms of their costs over 10 years, not nine.
In the 10 years starting in fiscal year 2002, Bush's tax plan would
reduce revenue by about $1.6 trillion. If the interest effect were
added, the 10-year reduction in the budget surplus would be about
$1.9 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the same standards could be applied to Vice President
Al Gore's proposals. The Gore campaign describes his plan as a $500
billion tax cut over 10 years starting in fiscal year 2001. (For
the sake of argument, Gore assumes that his tax cut would start
next year, so the cost of the cut can be matched against the
current 10-year surplus projection.)
</P>
<P>
   If the interest component were included, it would be a $620
billion tax cut. But Gore has also proposed spending just over $1
trillion of the surplus. His campaign calculates that the overall
tax and spending plan would have an interest cost of $247 billion
over 10 years, meaning that Gore would use nearly $1.8 trillion of
the surplus.

 &HT;    CLINTON, FOX PREDICT STRONGER U.S., MEXICO TIES
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton welcomed Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox to the White House on Thursday, hailing his upset
victory in July elections as a ``historic'' landmark in the
development of democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ties that bind the United States and Mexico
will only grow stronger in the years to come, but he made it clear
that easing border restrictions, as Fox has espoused, is not in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have borders and we have laws that apply to them
and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the United States,'' he told reporters at the
White House, ``I believe we have the most generous immigration
policy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox emerged from an hour-long Oval Office meeting with Clinton
to say that narrowing the income chasm between the two neighbors is
the key to stemming the tide of illegal immigration by job-hungry
Mexicans seeking greener pastures north of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   It marked a shift in emphasis for Fox, who has outlined in
Mexico in recent weeks a future of open borders between the two
countries, something along the lines of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we work on development, on job creating, on
education programs; as long as we can have in each rural community
in Mexico a school of high level, university or technological
school,'' Fox said, ``then we will not have migration as we are
having now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving a bit further in that direction in remarks later in the
day, Fox said, ``Really, what we are proposing is an economic
convergence, a holistic view of the problems and the
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 7.1 million Mexican-born people living in the
United States _ far more than any other group of foreigners _ and
about 3 million are classified as illegal aliens. Controlling the
border, and dealing with illegal immigrants, has been a perennial
sore spot in U.S.-Mexico relations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who travels Friday to Dallas to meet with Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, was elected president
last month in a stunning win over the PRI, or Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has controlled Mexico's government for
seven decades. He takes office Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and Fox touched on a broad range of issues _
including the illegal narcotics trade and ideas for building on,
and perhaps eventually expanding the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA, which wedded the economies of the United
States, Mexico and Canada _ the incoming Mexican leader made clear
that he was here as part of his transition preparations, not as a
Mexican official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a working meeting, it's not a negotiating meeting or
anything like that,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Fox received the sort of welcome here generally
reserved for heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Much as he has hailed democratic leaders like Vaclev Havel of
the Czech Republic or Boris Yeltsin of Russia, Clinton praised Fox
for a victory expected to shift Mexico's political and bureaucratic
culture dramatically over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked forward to this very much, for the chance to
congratulate him on his election, and all the people of Mexico on a
truly historic affirmation of genuine democracy in their country,''
Clinton said. ``I think it's an example to people who are friends
of freedom everywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That endorsement was part of an auspicious Washington debut for
Fox, a former executive with the Coca-Cola Co. While his visit was
an informal one _ PRI leader Ernesto Zedillo remains Mexico's
president for the next three months _ Fox was received pretty much
as Zedillo was when he visited Clinton earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met with Vice President and Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore Thursday morning, and was hosted for a formal
State Department luncheon by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Standing about two inches taller than Clinton, the charismatic
Fox, with his chiseled features and dark moustache, projected
confidence and an energetic vision for Mexico's future.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed the Washington and Mexican press corps three times,
alternating fluidly between his native Spanish and fluent English,
speaking extemporaneously and in complete paragraphs, seldom
glancing at notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between English and Spanish, I'll end up dizzy here,'' Fox
joked at one point during a 45-minute news conference at the
National Press Club, a traditional event for visiting heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
   In each appearance, Fox sounded the themes of reform and
decentralization near the heart of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said state and local governments should assume a growing role
in areas where federal authority has been inefficient. He said job
growth must come from building a vibrant base of small and
medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurial in nature rather than the
hidebound behemoths that have long characterized industrial Mexico.
In addition, Fox said grassroots activism and so-called
non-governmental organizations _ both home-grown and foreign _ have
an important role to play in promoting human rights and sound
environmental practices, and combating poverty in Mexico.

BUCHANAN AND REFORM RIVAL PLAY THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, N.C., Mont., Mich., Calif., Kan.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Iowa on Thursday, a government aide put a slip of paper
inside each of two black canisters. On one was written
``Buchanan-Foster;'' on the other, ``Hagelin-Goldhaber.'' After the
canisters were placed into a glass bowl on a stand outside his
office in the Capitol rotunda, Secretary of State Chester J. Culver
walked up, stirred the canisters around and lifted one out.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how Pat Buchanan and his running mate, Ezola Foster,
became the Reform Party presidential ticket in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   An odd way, perhaps, to pick a president, but it is the current
state of affairs in the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Iowa and several other states this week is a
direct consequence of a fractious convention two weeks ago that
left the party split, with two candidates and their organizations
contending to be the rightful heir to state ballot designations in
November as the Reform Party ticket and $12.6 million in federal
campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the bickering at the convention was only a prologue to what
is going on now. Not only are the Buchanan and Hagelin factions
fighting over the money with the Federal Election Commission, they
are threatening lawsuits in various states over decisions that
leave one of them off the ballot as the Reform ticket, a
potentially fatal blow for the losing side. Only by winning 5
percent of the popular vote in November can the candidate and his
party qualify for federal money in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   John Duffy, a lawyer in Washington who represents Buchanan, said
flatly: ``We will go into court wherever necessary not to allow
anybody to identify themselves as the Reform Party candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Iowa was one of at least four states in which the
matter was addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney followed his Iowa
counterpart by picking a name out of a ballot box that contained 10
canisters with ``Buchanan'' written on an index card and 10 with
``Hagelin.'' After Cooney plucked out a Hagelin, a lawyer for
Buchanan in Helena began drawing up papers seeking a temporary
restraining order from a state court to prevent Cooney from
certifying a ballot with Hagelin's name.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lippert, the lawyer, said the court would schedule a hearing
within 10 days to decide whether Cooney's selection should stand,
after which Lippert said, he expected that the losing party would
appeal the court decision to the Montana Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Department of State's Bureau of Elections sent a
letter to the two campaigns, asking each to make a case for its
ticket, after which the bureau would decide. ``But if it's not
crystal clear who it should be, I could see us denying both
requests,'' said Brad Wittman, a spokesman for the bureau. ``Then
courts would have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the Board of Elections heard testimony from
the two sides for more than four hours Thursday, and then voted 3-1
to put the Buchanan ticket on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, two other states took other actions, and
perhaps nowhere else will the fight be more grueling than in
California, where the state Reform Party is operating as one
splintered organization. Late Wednesday, Secretary of State Bill
Jones withdrew Buchanan and Foster as the Reform ticket after the
state party chairman, Raymond O. Mills, a Buchanan ally,
acknowledged that the state party board of directors, which favors
Hagelin, had voted last week not to support a Buchanan ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Mills had told Jones last week that the state party recognized
Buchanan as the Reform nominee. But John H. Place, the party vice
chairman, told Jones in a letter that any communication with Mills
should be considered ``null and void'' without evidence of the
board's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state party has until next Thursday to affirm its
notify Jones of its choice.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has taken another approach. On Tuesday, the state
rejected each side's claim to the ballot, advising the two to take
their complaints to the State Objections Board, which would sort
things out and pick one, leaving the loser to take matters into
court.

 &HT;    CLINTON, FOX PREDICT STRONGER U.S., MEXICO TIES
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton welcomed Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox to the White House on Thursday, hailing his upset
victory in July elections as a ``historic'' landmark in the
development of democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ties that bind the United States and Mexico
will only grow stronger in the years to come, but he made it clear
that easing border restrictions, as Fox has espoused, is not in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have borders and we have laws that apply to them
and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the United States,'' he told reporters at the
White House, ``I believe we have the most generous immigration
policy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox emerged from an hour-long Oval Office meeting with Clinton
to say that narrowing the income chasm between the two neighbors is
the key to stemming the tide of illegal immigration by job-hungry
Mexicans seeking greener pastures north of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   It marked a shift in emphasis for Fox, who has outlined in
Mexico in recent weeks a future of open borders between the two
countries, something along the lines of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we work on development, on job creating, on
education programs; as long as we can have in each rural community
in Mexico a school of high level, university or technological
school,'' Fox said, ``then we will not have migration as we are
having now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving a bit further in that direction in remarks later in the
day, Fox said, ``Really, what we are proposing is an economic
convergence, a holistic view of the problems and the
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 7.1 million Mexican-born people living in the
United States _ far more than any other group of foreigners _ and
about 3 million are classified as illegal aliens. Controlling the
border, and dealing with illegal immigrants, has been a perennial
sore spot in U.S.-Mexico relations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who travels Friday to Dallas to meet with Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, was elected president
last month in a stunning win over the PRI, or Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has controlled Mexico's government for
seven decades. He takes office Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and Fox touched on a broad range of issues _
including the illegal narcotics trade and ideas for building on,
and perhaps eventually expanding the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA, which wedded the economies of the United
States, Mexico and Canada _ the incoming Mexican leader made clear
that he was here as part of his transition preparations, not as a
Mexican official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a working meeting, it's not a negotiating meeting or
anything like that,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Fox received the sort of welcome here generally
reserved for heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Much as he has hailed democratic leaders like Vaclev Havel of
the Czech Republic or Boris Yeltsin of Russia, Clinton praised Fox
for a victory expected to shift Mexico's political and bureaucratic
culture dramatically over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked forward to this very much, for the chance to
congratulate him on his election, and all the people of Mexico on a
truly historic affirmation of genuine democracy in their country,''
Clinton said. ``I think it's an example to people who are friends
of freedom everywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That endorsement was part of an auspicious Washington debut for
Fox, a former executive with the Coca-Cola Co. While his visit was
an informal one _ PRI leader Ernesto Zedillo remains Mexico's
president for the next three months _ Fox was received pretty much
as Zedillo was when he visited Clinton earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met with Vice President and Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore Thursday morning, and was hosted for a formal
State Department luncheon by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Standing about two inches taller than Clinton, the charismatic
Fox, with his chiseled features and dark moustache, projected
confidence and an energetic vision for Mexico's future.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed the Washington and Mexican press corps three times,
alternating fluidly between his native Spanish and fluent English,
speaking extemporaneously and in complete paragraphs, seldom
glancing at notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between English and Spanish, I'll end up dizzy here,'' Fox
joked at one point during a 45-minute news conference at the
National Press Club, a traditional event for visiting heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
   In each appearance, Fox sounded the themes of reform and
decentralization near the heart of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said state and local governments should assume a growing role
in areas where federal authority has been inefficient. He said job
growth must come from building a vibrant base of small and
medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurial in nature rather than the
hidebound behemoths that have long characterized industrial Mexico.
In addition, Fox said grassroots activism and so-called
non-governmental organizations _ both home-grown and foreign _ have
an important role to play in promoting human rights and sound
environmental practices, and combating poverty in Mexico.

 &HT;    Peggy Post confirms etiquette's back in style
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The good news, says manners maven Peggy Post, is
the definite resurgence of interest in etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   And although specific guidelines may change through the years,
she says the underlying principles of etiquette always remain the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a code of behavior based on being considerate and
practical,'' says Emily Post's great-granddaughter-in-law, who has
carried on the family mission. ``It helps us get along and gives
people a way of knowing what to do in certain situations. It gives
order to our world.''
</P>
<P>
   She says many rules of etiquette are simple and just a matter of
being considerate. ``If someone's right behind you when you're
walking into a building, don't slam the door in their face!'' she
says. ``And say `thank you' and `please.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dressing and fashion are topics that have always been addressed
in etiquette books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a decision about what's appropriate is a confusing
issue for people,'' explains Post, who adds that is especially true
today, when we have so many choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone asks me what `festive attire' means on an
invitation, I say, `Whatever your host or hostess has in mind,' ''
she says. ``I recommend you either ask other people who are going
what they're wearing or call and ask the hostess. It's all a matter
of feeling comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that we all need to look alike, Post says, but neither
should we ``pull out the shock too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to offend other people. For example, when a
teen-ager is rebellious and wants to wear the wildest outfit to
grandparents' house for Thanksgiving dinner, at least tone it down
a bit. Wear a clean shirt so grandmom and dad don't feel upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Post says she's seen lots of interest in etiquette from parents,
children and teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that they understand just what it is we're
talking about,'' she says. ``Etiquette is for everybody, it's not
just stuffy, highbrow and formal.''

 &HT;    Etiquette's in fashion
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Whatever happened to good manners?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that's been asked often in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   About the time we all fell in love with blue jeans and sweats,
it seems we stopped minding our P's and Q's and began tossing our
etiquette books out the window.
</P>
<P>
   If you're one of those who mourns the loss, take heart. If this
year's fall fashions are any indication, significant changes are in
store.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't grungy or outlandishly dressed models who sauntered
down the New York runways in February showing off the newest fall
looks. Instead we saw elegant ladies and gentlemen looking polished
and sophisticated in luxurious cashmeres and tweeds.
</P>
<P>
   The word of the day is ``ladylike.'' And let's be honest, you
won't appear classy and refined if your decorum doesn't match your
outfit. So while we're not recommending a return to outdated and
rigid rules, the return to common courtesy sounds pretty
refreshing, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   So you won't be caught with your gloves off, we've assembled the
season's must-haves as well as ``must-do's.'' You'll get a chuckle
out of some of the historic etiquette we've uncovered (``The woman
always bows first when meeting men acquaintances on the street'')
and you may learn a few things about what's considered good manners
these days as well (``Do not tip the owner of a B&AMP;B, even if he
brings you breakfast'').
</P>
<P>
   We've taken our models to some of the most elegant locations to
illustrate just how much fun dressing up _ and behaving nicely _
can be.

 &HT;    Gentlemen look the part
 &HT;    By Luma Muhtadie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Men's fashions will complement their ladylike
counterparts. Designers have dipped into fashion's pool of
timeless, traditional pieces and updated them with crisp tailoring
and high-tech fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The classic, polished look that emerges bridges the gap between
formal business dress and casual sportswear: Men will look smart
and sophisticated around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of natural fabrics _ cashmere, refined wools,
tweed _ together with straight and narrow lines, creates a dressier
look than we've seen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that American men search for comfort and
practicality even amid the dressiest clothing, and fabrics cannot
be too heavy, tightly binding, or vulnerable to wrinkling and
staining,'' says Jack Herschlag, executive director of the National
Association of Men's Sportswear Buyers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The ``straight and narrow'' look in men's suits doesn't imply a
tight and constrictive fit. Many designers are adding a bit of
polyurethane (aka spandex) to fabric blends, which allows greater
freedom of movement. The 40-inch topcoat takes its proper place at
the top of the men's list of must-haves this fall. The ``topper'' _
long enough to be worn over a sport coat yet short enough to avoid
the trench-coat look _ is perhaps the season's biggest winner. It's
elegant and versatile.
</P>
<P>
   And the most enduring of classics _ leather _ comes on strong
again this fall. Leather has a strange versatility: It's one of the
most primitive fabrics, but with today's lustrous finishes it gives
it the impression of something high-tech.

 &HT;    Classic lines meet modern attitudes

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   ``While the philosophy of etiquette must be everlasting, the
practice of manners is ever changing. Times have changed
dramatically and with them, the kinds of things we need to know to
practice impeccable manners have changed, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Peggy Post
</P>
<P>
   For some, fashion's nod to the past is nostalgic. It reminds us
of favorite outfits we _ or our mothers and grandmothers _ wore
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   For younger folks attracted to old Hollywood films and vintage
shops, it's a chance to get into the act. This passion for
``dressing up'' is fun _ with an emphasis on elegance, shine and
glamour.
</P>
<P>
   There are influences from many decades _ beat looks from the
'50s, hippie psychedelic prints and bellbottoms from the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But no era is more important this season than the 1940s _ with
its tweed and herringbone fitted suits, soft, feminine blouses and
glamorous furs. The newest shoes have a vintage feel _ open toes,
wedge heels, ankle-strap or T-strap shapes.
</P>
<P>
   What better place than Carillon Historical Park to combine
beautiful objects from the 1940s with contemporary fashion takes on
those special years?

 &HT;    Size up the season's essentials
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Not many of us can afford to purchase a new
wardrobe every season.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it's not necessary. A few key items will have you
looking fashionable for fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women who have missed wearing blouses will be delighted to
know they're back. Perfect this season is a silk blouse with a
matching or attached self-tie scarf. You'll see ultra feminine
versions with ruffles at the neck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leather is hotter than ever. Consider a classic black leather
skirt or blazer. The newest take is embossed leathers, especially
in python, crocodile or cobra patterns. There are patchwork
patterns in leather, suede, fur and denim.
</P>
<P>
   _ A great matched suit is a staple. Pair a waist- or hip-length
fitted jacket with matching pant (most have a flat front) or
simple-line skirt. A fashion-forward length is either just below
the knee or well below the knee, but not ankle length. Fabrics
include tweeds and wool boucles. Consider a fitted suit with fur
collar that recalls the 1940s; pair it with a coordinated blouse.
Look for accents of leather, cashmere and for seam details. Jackets
are often belted, and pants are fitted and slender but some have a
fuller leg.
</P>
<P>
   _ Luxurious fabrics abound: cashmere, silks and satins, feathers
and fur. Pashmina is still with us; this year's version adds
embellishment. A key item is a textured, chunky, colorful sweater
in a cashmere or cashmere blend.
</P>
<P>
   _ A great coat can not only protect you from the elements but
ensure a feminine and sophisticated look as well. Fabrics range
from luxurious to high-tech, and many repel water. Check out a
fitted, back-belted coat, a leather trench or a black-and-white
herringbone tweed. The newest coat length is to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lauren is just one of the designers highlighting tartan plaids
this season. Look for pleated skirts or kilts, matching scarves,
plaid coats, tartan plaid bags for girls. It's also the season for
an Argyle sweater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fur can be faux or real; you'll see it everywhere _ as collar
or cuff trim on suits or jackets and coats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fashion continues its love affair with color. Although fall
neutrals (black, gray, tan) are always a staple, this season you'll
also see strong colors with names such as raspberry, loden, paprika
and grenadine. Combine an intensely bright jacket with black or
dark brown pants or try color blocking _ combining bright hues.
Don't be afraid of turquoise, chartreuse, shocking pink or purple.
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that we've been introduced to the new stretch fabric
blends, we'll never give them up. Consider a pair of cropped
stretch pants, stretch angoras and wools, denim-and-stretch jeans,
a stretch charmeuse bow blouse.
</P>
<P>
   A great accessory can give an outfit an entirely new look. Keep
an eye out for these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gold jewelry. It's no surprise that the return to ladylike
fashion means trading silver for gold. It needn't be the real
thing, of course, but a gold watch, lariat necklace, cuff or bangle
bracelet will add class to any outfit. One essential: the hoop
earring. Mesh metals also abound. And it's the perfect time to get
out your mother's pearls.
</P>
<P>
   _ A knee-high boot with a pointed toe and sculpted heel. You'll
find it in stretch leather for a great silhouette. Retro pumps are
feminine and tailored, definitely designed for comfort. Look for
T-straps, slingbacks, ankle straps and open toes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Animal prints are back again, for blouses and jackets,
handbags and shoes. New looks include python and ostrich, but
leopard, pony and zebra still are popular.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bags, especially fabric bags, continue to be important. Look
for clutch, baguette, chain strap and doctor's bag or bowling bag
shapes. The Coach collection, for example, ranges from Woolrich
blanket totes and Bleecker wools to dark denims and pony hair in
black, deep red, orange and vicuna. Look for little faux fur
handbags, totes in every size, soft leathers and suede hobos.
You'll also spot bags in patent-leather colors, plaids, tweeds and
metallics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opaques are back, not that those of us who battle Midwestern
winters ever considered giving them away. Mix this season's bold
colors with black tights. You'll also find tights in colors,
textures and patterns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skinny belts can be worn with pants, over suit jackets and
knit dresses; there are chain belts, animal skins and rhinestone
looks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check out the aviator look in sunglasses. Rimless glasses are
popular as well; watch for geometrics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scarves come in every size and pattern; they're the perfect
match for a polished look.

 &HT;    Social graces: It's time to be a lady again
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You're invited to someone's home for dinner or a
party and have no idea what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Think about ``dressing like a lady'' and you'll be on the right
fashion track.
</P>
<P>
   Women won't go wrong this season if they pair a pretty sweater
in a yummy color with a suede or leather skirt or pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are excited to see a ladylike, feminine edge move back
into fashion this fall,'' says Paula Daedelow, regional
special-events coordinator for Lazarus. ``I think women are ready
for this fashion movement because they love to dress up.''
</P>
<P>
   If you love red, this is your year. From crimson to cherry,
you'll see it on clothing as well as accessories, with the darker
hues being the most important for fall. If head-to-toe red is too
bright for your taste, try using it as an accent. Pair a red
sweater with dark pants or slip a red blouse under a traditional
suit.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a dressier evening, consider the always-acceptable
little black dress or a feminine blouse and dressy skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories can add flair to any outfit: a pashmina wrap, a slim
python belt or slinky open-toed shoe, some gold bangles.
</P>
<P>
   Men might layer a good-looking polo or V-neck sweater in
cashmere or silk and cotton knit with a T-shirt, then pair it with
a khaki or dress slacks.

 &HT;    Prim, proper &AMP; polished
 &HT;    By Emily Rahimi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Who says prim and proper can't be fun, or that
etiquette doesn't apply to teen-agers?
</P>
<P>
   Now that baggy jeans and chunky shoes are out of style,
polished, more sophisticated looks have taken center stage.
</P>
<P>
   For teens and collegians, that means this season's filled with
blouses, skirts and slacks. Though shapes are classic, they're
anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   Bright colors (used in moderation) and animal prints (ditto) are
hot right now and can make a traditional look a lot of fun. Try
pairing a pewter sweater with a leopard print mini-skirt, or wear a
shiny, blue blouse with cropped wool slacks for a style that's
classy but still young.
</P>
<P>
   Leather is also a cool way to stay warm this autumn. The Gap
carries great pants, skirts and jackets in hues ranging from plum
to black. But don't think you need to break the bank to get this
look. Many stores also offer pleather pieces, which give you the
look of buttery leather at the price of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   If you just can't part with your
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts and jeans, check out items with more refined shapes and
colors. Try a rayon T-shirt with slim-fit, dark denim jeans and
matching jacket. You'll look clean, put together and
oh-so-well-bred. With so many options, why not go out and play with
convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to understand why so many otherwise attractive
people totally destroy their appearance by chewing gum like a cow
chewing a cud. Chewing gum, in itself, if it is done quietly and
unobtrusively, is not unattractive. But when one does it with
grimaces, open mouth, smacks, crackers and pops and worth of all
with bubbles, it is with the worst of taste.''

   It is the impulse of all young persons to try to be as exactly
like each other as biscuits in a pan. During the war, groups of
teen-age girls across the country have taken to the sloppiest of
over-sized boys clothes worn in the sloppiest way.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long will it be before a new craze _ perhaps for extreme
loveliness _ takes its place, no one can say. It can only be hoped
that the behavior that goes with pants and shirttail out will not
have been found ineradicable.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ As his tenure as graduate assistant wound down at
Maryland in 1972, Ralph Friedgen looked for a job as a football
coach. He sent out more than 100 letters to colleges and another 40
to high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first letter I got back was from (Alabama coach) Bear
Bryant,'' said Friedgen, Georgia Tech's offensive coordinator. ``He
turned me down. He said he already had too many coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar replies followed. In fact, he was rejected across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the Maryland assistants, a guy named Bobby Ross, was
interviewing for the top job at The Citadel. ``Bobby told me he
thought he had a good chance at The Citadel job and said if he got
it he wanted me to come as the offensive coordinator. I told him,
`Let's wait and see if you get it, and then we'll talk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen was making $150 a month when Ross called him in, along
with fellow graduate assistant coach Frank Beamer, and offered both
jobs as full-time coaches at The Citadel.
</P>
<P>
   Beamer eventually became head coach at Virginia Tech, the Yellow
Jackets' opponent Sunday. Meanwhile, Friedgen has held assistant
jobs with William &AMP; Mary, Murray State, Maryland, Georgia Tech, the
San Diego Chargers and Georgia Tech again.
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen is considered one of the top offensive football minds
in the country. Last year, he won the Broyles Award as the nation's
top assistant. He won it for directing the NCAA's most prolific
offense, as Tech led the nation with 509 yards per game and scored
40.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   No other college assistant can match his salary of more than
$200,000. He has achieved the rare double of directing offenses for
a college national champion, Tech in 1990, and a Super Bowl
participant, San Diego in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So, why hasn't Friedgen been hired as a head coach, particularly
in this high-pressure, win-at-all-costs age of college football?f+t
</P>
<P>
   f-t ``Ralph is caught in a time when people are going with
flashy, movie-star images who are good with the media,'' Tech
running backs coach Bill O'Brien said. ``They don't look at
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen is a man of substance, both intellectually and
physically. In this day of sound bites and slick, Armani-suited
coaches with $200 coiffures, Friedgen doesn't fit the mold.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Friedgen might get his dream job and go back to
his alma mater, Maryland, in 1997 after the Terps fired Mark
Duffner. In fact, Friedgen was set up for a telephone interview
with athletics director Debbie Yow and the Maryland search
committee when the announcement came that Ron Vanderlinden, a
Northwestern assistant for Gary Barnett, had been hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bitter at the time,'' Friedgen says now. ``I'm not
bitter anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary is amazed that Friedgen isn't
a head coach. ``I hope he has the opportunity,'' he said. ``Ralph
and I are so much alike. It's scary how much we think alike.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary and Friedgen have been friends since Friedgen was Ross'
assistant at Maryland and O'Leary was an assistant at Syracuse.
They first met on the road recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a bigger per diem out on the road, so I used to buy him
lunch,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen is more than just an offensive coordinator, O'Leary
said. The two confer on virtually all aspects of the game. ``He's
detailed beyond belief,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been studying his offensive system and playing in it for
three years,'' said Jon Muyres, Tech's starting flanker. ``You
could take any class at Tech for three years and you could master
it, but not Coach Friedgen's offense.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said: ``He took something from all the offenses he's
ever run _ the wishbone, split-backs, the `I' formation, two-backs,
one-back, no-backs_ and incorporated them. He's the most
knowledgable coach I've ever been around. . . . He's a professor of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen and his wife Gloria recently bought some property on
Lake Oconee, close to O'Leary and Beamer, and started building
their dream house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pulling out all the stops,'' Friedgen said. ``Isn't the
way it usually goes, as soon as you build a house, you get another
job?''
</P>
<P>
   You got the feeling he wasn't kidding.

 &HT;    u B7D1AD97Little Debby valuable as `teaching tool'
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Think of the late, unlamented Hurricane Debby
as a test.
</P>
<P>
   Not a fierce enough threat to galvanize emergency operations
into full alert, activate evacuations or force the temporary
shutdown of South Florida civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But keen enough to persuade procrastinators to buy batteries,
bottled water and plywood and to prompt emergency managers to begin
planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd keep everything that's not perishable,'' said Palm Beach
County Emergency Management Director Bill O'Brien. ``We're still
moving into the height of the hurricane season.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of hunkering down with cans of cold soup behind
aluminum shutters while 100 mph winds test roof construction, South
Florida residents will endure just another late summer weekend of
temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s, sweat-inducing
humidity and a good chance of afternoon thunderstorms Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Those storms won't be Debby's doing. ``There's no longer
anything such as Debby and any remnants will be south of Cuba and
far from us,'' said meteorologist Tom Warner of the National
Weather Service in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There's little chance that the storm, now a mere tropical wave,
can revive itself because of the same high level southwest winds
that sheared it apart as it tried to cross the Windward Passage
from Hispaniola to Cuba Wednesday night and Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If Debby had been stronger then, it may have moved northwest
along the north coast of Cuba and become a threat to South Florida.
But the high terrain of Hispaniola had already begun shredding the
thunderstorms from the low level center, said hurricane specialist
Robert Pasch of the National Hurricane Center. Low easterly winds
pushed it south of Cuba instead.
</P>
<P>
   The north coast track was the official forecast but several
computer models predicted the move south of the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't totally pleased with our track models,'' Pasch
said. ``As I look at the errors in our (computer) predictions, they
are about average. But average is still not good when the storm
comes so close to millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm caused some flash flooding in mountainous Haiti but
eastern Cuba welcomed the rain. One man died in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Keys officials cancelled an evacuation of non-residents
early Thursday, but school will remain closed today because many
teachers evacuated. State and national parks re-opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dry run like this is a good teaching tool'' for emergency
officials, O'Brien said. ``It enhances the level of professionalism
because most of the people involved are not full-time emergency
management people. They get a better understanding of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby's threat raises public awareness, Pasch said. ``We really
hope it made people think about their vulnerability and what they
need to do when a storm approaches.''

 &HT;    Wal-Mart to test waters as GE appliance retailer
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The shake-up among appliance retailers continues, with
Wal-Mart now joining the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest retailer said Thursday it plans to test
sales of General Electric appliances in about a dozen stores this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The rollout will begin in four stores in Texas, Arizona and
Oklahoma. By year-end, Wal-Mart hopes to have the test running in
about 12 stores. It's unclear if any test stores will be in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This initial test phase will last 90 days,'' said Rob
Phillips, a Wal-Mart spokesman in Bentonville, Ark. ``In 2001,
plans are to increase the number of (test) stores.''
</P>
<P>
   GE will handle delivery and installation.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart will compete with large chains: Sears, Lowe's, Best Buy
and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, two other appliance retailers have washed out.
Richmond-based Circuit City decided last month to abandon its No. 2
position to concentrate on sales of electronics, for which the
company is known. Roberds, a regional player, fell into bankruptcy
and is in the process of liquidating all its locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be new product introductions next year with
stimulating designs that will create demand,'' said Wayne Hood, an
analyst with Prudential Securities in Atlanta. ``GE wants to
increase their share in branding appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's entry could be chilling news to Sears. The Hoffman
Estates, Ill.-based company has captured 35 percent to 37 percent
of appliance sales _ the most of any retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond insists that the venerable
chain's selection ``can't be matched.'' Sears sells six brands,
including its own Kenmore line, while Wal-Mart will carry just GE
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working aggressively and intend to remain the No. 1
appliance retailer,'' Drummond said.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge for Wal-Mart will be to fit 40 GE appliance
models, the number the company intends to carry, into its already
fully stocked stores.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the company will make room in some of its
Supercenters by using space in the front of the stores, where other
retailers have operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, that's to be determined,'' said Phillips.

   COXNET FOCUS 0826: MADAM PRESIDENT -- What's next, ``Vice
President Ken''? The joking perhaps was inevitable when the
nonprofit group the White House Project teamed up recently with
Mattel and Girls' Inc. to launch a President Barbie doll. With a
politically correct helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand
nuclear war and an unintentionally funny advisory on the back of
her box _ ``Podium not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this
Leader of the Free (Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous
light. But many people aren't laughing these days when the subject
turns to a woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican and
Democratic conventions, and both George W. Bush and Al Gore
reportedly included a woman on their ``short list'' of potential
running mates (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes

   MEXICO-CENTAM _ TAPACHULA, MEXICO _ Baby-faced Sonia Marlene
Lopez, 15, said she was willing to do anything if she could just

care of babies,'' the Salvadoran teenager said earnestly, her eyes
as wide as saucers. But Lopez never made to Houston or El Paso, her
dream cities. Instead she, her sister and a cousin _ all teen-age
girls _ ended up in a jail cell here for undocumented migrants
crossing into Mexico's southernmost Chiapas state. While U.S.
officials conduct their own battle to stem illegal crossings,
Mexican officials here say they've seen a 30 percent increase over

 &HT;    Parole issue could backfire on Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In 1994, when he was a baseball executive
running for governor, George W. Bush led off his television
campaign with an ad that hit hard on crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three years 7,700 criminals have been released
early from prison,'' Bush said then. ``I will end early release of
criminals and end parole altogether for rapists and child
molesters.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later _ as a governor running for president _ that
approach could come back to haunt Bush as state prisons near
capacity and his parole officials are issuing more and more
get-out-of-jail-early cards.
</P>
<P>
   With parole rates inching higher during Bush's presidential
campaign, the stakes could be huge. One high-profile crime by one
parolee can change the outcome of an election.
</P>
<P>
   f+b f-bAt Al Gore headquarters in Nashville, there was a swift
effort to make political hay out of the parole rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises questions in the minds of voters as to why
Governor Bush has been mostly silent about what he would do to
ensure the safety of American families,'' said Gore spokesman Jano
Cabrera. ``Governor Bush has tried to deflect attention from his
gun lobby-like record and has been mostly silent on what, if
anything, he would do on crime as president.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bush campaign worked to separate parole and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state function and the proper role of the Board of
Pardons and Paroles to address parole, with the public's safety
being a paramount concern,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Ray
Sullivan. ``The governor's appointees to the parole board have a
history of careful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has talked about crime on the campaign trail, but his web
site _ which includes his positions on 19 issues _ includes nothing
about crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, criminal justice experts say, politics and
parole would be as mixable as oil and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area that should be taken out of the political
realm,'' said D'Ann Johnson, executive director of the Texas
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. ``The executive branch ought
to be able to make a case-by-case determination based on the facts
presented to them about whether a person is ready for release.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world _ especially in a real-hot political year
_ politics and parole are as linked as Michael Dukakis and Willie
Horton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back to the political situation,'' said criminal
justice professor Raymond Teske at Sam Houston State University.
``It looks good to say, `We are not paroling people and I'm the guy
that's keeping them in there.'''
</P>
<P>
   For years, that's been the approach for Bush, a politician whose
family is well-acquainted with crime as campaign issue. In 1988, a
group supporting the elder Bush for president scored heavily with a
TV ad detailing the 1986 weekend furlough of convicted
Massachusetts murderer Willie Horton, who fled to Maryland where he
abducted a couple and raped a woman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _ the elder Bush's
1988 presidential opponent _ vetoed a bill that would have ended
the weekend furloughs.
</P>
<P>
   For current presidential candidate Bush, the worst-case scenario
would be anything resembling a repeat of the Horton case. Odds
against it seem good. Almost all the inmates now being paroled are
non-violent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Hubbarth, a vice president of Justice for All, a crime
victims' group, said Thursday he is not concerned about the
increasing parole rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Parole Board Chairman) Gerald Garrett has done an
incredibly good job of allaying people's fears about the streets
being prowled by released predators,'' said Hubbarth, a former
assistant general counsel for the parole division.
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show a national electorate concerned about crime,
but not as much as it is concerned about other issues. A Portrait
of America poll conducted last week showed crime tied for sixth,
with Social Security and taxes, among the issues of concern to
voters. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents said crime is a
``very important'' issue, making it one of 12 issues deemed very
important by 60 percent or more of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by Rasmussen Research, included responses
from 4,208 likely voters. The margin of error is four percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   For many voters, concern about crime translates into calls for
longer prison sentences for offenders. Criminal justice Professor
Teske said the increased parole rate in Texas is the inevitable
result of that mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They overreacted to the situation,'' he said of politicians
like Bush who responded to the tough-on-crime call. ``Now they are
in a bind again. And now they've got to let them out. They don't
want to, but they have to because they don't have room for them.
It's going to have to happen. They have to be selective about it
and people shouldn't blame (Bush) or anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was a candidate for governor, Bush was not shy
about assigning blame for increasing parole rates. One of his
can't-miss quips along the campaign trail involved a story, perhaps
apocryphal, about a young girl's curiousity about wanted posters in
a police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you keep them when you took their pictures?'' Bush
said the girl asked.

 &HT;    Farmer buries cotton picking machine to claim insurance money
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A 58-year-old South Georgia farmer has been charged
with burying his cotton picker _ a 20-foot-high, multi-ton piece of
machinery _ to collect insurance on it.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Donald Keene of Abbeville reported his cotton picker
missing in February, according to the GBI. Cotton States Insurance
executive Tom Bengtson said the company paid $95,000 on Keene's
claim.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, unnamed informants spotted patches of John Deere
green peeking through a hillside on Keene's son's farm, said Gary
Rothwell, agent in charge of the GBI's Perry office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reported it to Wilcox County Sheriff Stacy Bloodworth,
and he asked us to investigate,'' Rothwell said. The sheriff is
related to Keene.
</P>
<P>
   Rothwell said agents are investigating Kenne's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer, charged with filing a fraudulent insurance claim and
making false statements, was free on bond Thursday. The GBI and
Cotton States had the machine exhumed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rothwell said agents believe heavy equipment was used to bury
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on a slope,'' Rothwell said. ``He dug out a cavern,
drove the thing in and covered it up. The keys were still in the
ignition.''
</P>
<P>
   New cotton pickers cost $200,000 to $250,000, according to an
agent for John Deere farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bengtson said Keene's cotton picker was ``several years old,''
and he did not know how much the company could salvage from it. It
was severely damaged by its long interment.
</P>
<P>
   The burial of a massive piece of farm equipment, Rothwell said,
is new in his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually in cases of insurance fraud,'' he said, ``they burn
the stuff.''

 &HT;    Brimming Texas prisons prompts consideration of early release
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A steadily growing population of convicted
criminals is pushing Texas' prison system close to where an
emergency-crowding law not used for a decade could trigger steps to
lower the number of felons behind bars, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But they insisted such a move is unlikely, as long as Texas'
parole rate remains above 25 percent and other programs
successfully divert enough convicts from prison to avoid a crowding
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Official reports listed Texas' 114 prisons as 97.3 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   When they reach 99 percent, a state law requires the parole
board to consider for early release almost any convict serving time
for a non-violent crime who is nearing the end of a sentence _ even
if inmate already has been turned down. And while that might not
produce a much different result than the board approving more
convicts for parole in the first place, officials privately concede
the political backlash could be ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you invoke anything, like martial law or the prison
act, it's creates the perception of a crisis _ and perception is as
much of it as anything,'' said A.M. ``Mac'' Stringfellow, chairman
of the prison system's 18-member governing board. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``For every two points the parole rate drops, we pick up 1,500
additional beds . . . If the (parole approval) rate stays at 25 or
26 percent, I think we'll be okay.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, admissions to state prisons have continued to
grow steadily by an average of about 400 per month, officials said.
By Thursday, 151,095 convicts were behind bars _ a tally that
officials predict could increase by 5,000 during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the state's capacity is about 155,500.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the prison board recommended that the state
build three new prisons, adding 8,550 beds at a cost of nearly $550
million. And they are seeking another $17 million for additional
beds for parole violators, for expansion of electronic monitoring
programs for parolees and 500 beds in local lockups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, parole officials have changed their policies
to review cases faster and not send as many parolees back to prison
for rules infractions _ most involving low-risk, non-violent
convicts who were headed for freedom soon anyway. They also are
reportedly studying whether more elderly and seriously ill convicts
can be paroled to nursing homes to free up additional prison bunks.
</P>
<P>
   New statistics made public Wednesday showed that Texas' parole
rate climbed in July to its highest single point in a single month
since Gov. George W. Bush took office five years ago, with nearly
29 percent of eligible convicts approved for early release from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Parole officials attributed that to new programs that have
allowed closer supervision of convicts who are released, among
other factors. They have insisted that a steadily increasing parole
rate in the past year is not a reaction to prisons growing fuller.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the growing influx of prisoners cools, officials have
warned for two months, Texas prisons could be full within a year.
And that has heightened some concerns that the so-called Prison
Management Act, a law first approved in 1983 to relieve prison
crowding and first used in the late 1980s, could come into play
once again.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, when Texas prisons were so full that more
than 30,000 convicts were backed up in county jails and courts were
levying millions of dollars in fines each month, then-Gov. Bill
Clements invoked the law 13 times to release tens of thousands of
convicts early. Many quickly went out and committed new crimes,
triggering a public outcry that caused Texas to more than double
the size of its prison system in five years _ the biggest such
construction project in U.S. history _ and brought about tougher
anti-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Reynolds, general counsel for the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, said while the prison capacity is high again _
the highest since all the new prisons were completed in 1995 _ he
thinks it unlikely the Prison Management Act will come into play
again.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cushion: The state is leasing bunks from counties _
more than 5,000 in recent months _ with another 1,500 recently
authorized by the prison board. ``The community beds act as our
safety valve,'' Reynolds sai.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabelo, head of the Criminal Justice Policy Council, the
state agency that charts prison population trends, predicts there
will be enough beds for state convicts during the next year _ even
if the parole rate stayed at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any crisis,'' Fabelo said. ``Ninety-seven
percent is not overcrowded. And we have the planning in place to
keep it from reaching 99 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Stringfellow and other officials remain optimistic the
system will not hit 99 percent before new prisons are built.
Privately, officials said they need to keep the capacity below 98
percent to allow for proper operational flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of life is that we have only X number of beds _ and
we don't have any control over what the parole board does or what
the judges sentencing people to prison do,'' Stringfellow said.

 &HT;    He's the `King' behind the curtain
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to catch Chet Brewster's name in the credits of the
hit movie ``The Original Kings of Comedy,'' try not to blink.
</P>
<P>
   And although the 36-year-old Lithonia resident briefly appears
on-screen with comedian Steve Harvey, his cameo probably won't make
him a household name.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't faze Brewster, who served as technical supervisor
on ``Kings'' and for the past three years was director of the
wildly successful traveling stand-up comedy stage show on which the
movie is based.
</P>
<P>
   While the comics kept the audience in stitches, Brewster was in
charge of keeping the freewheeling show from coming apart at the
seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the man behind the curtain,'' he explains. ``When
something goes wrong, I was the first person everybody looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with four R-rated comedians, Brewster's job required him
to act as the unseen straight man: cueing the music when pleasingly
plump Cedric ``The Entertainer'' dances onstage, or getting a
close-up of a bug-eyed Bernie Mac poking fun at an outrageously
dressed audience member.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike typical comedy shows consisting of a guy with a
microphone telling jokes, Brewster's stage production used multiple
cameras and huge screens, turning it into a high-tech event. It
felt intimate even when it played sold-out venues as large as
Atlanta's Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I did the show, no matter where you were in the arena,
everybody had a good seat,'' Brewster says. ``Basically, I took a
comedy show and turned it into a rock concert.''
</P>
<P>
   So when MTV Films, Paramount and show creator Walter Latham
agreed to take ``Kings'' to movie theaters, Brewster figured he'd
be a shoo-in as director. Instead he got spiked, as in Spike Lee,
the Oscar-nominated director who eventually got the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt Chet is very good at what he does,'' says
Latham, who produced the film. ``But we needed someone with a lot
more prestige and a lot more experience.'' (``Kings'' was shot in
February during concert performances in Charlotte.)
</P>
<P>
   Brewster, who worked closely with Lee on the set, says he wasn't
soured by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a strange feeling after working on the show for so
long, but I understand why they wanted Spike's name attached to it.
I wish they had given me the opportunity, but Spike was really
cool. Working with him was a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the success of the recent ``Kings'' concert tour and
movie (in metro Atlanta last weekend, ``Kings'' earned twice as
much at the box office as the nation's No. 1 film, ``The Cell''),
producer Latham says he's planning a sequel called ``The Kings and
Queens of Comedy.'' It's a traveling stage show that's expected to
come to Atlanta this fall. When it does, Brewster says he plans to
be there, working quietly in the background, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind being a small fish in a big pond,'' he says.
``And it's a great job. Even though I've heard some of the jokes
thousands of times, working with these comedians still cracks me
up.''

 &HT;    u B5CCB505Wise guys deliver consistent comedy in `The Crew'
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Move over, ``Space Cowboys,'' there's a new
quartet of senior wise guys in town.
</P>
<P>
   Literally ``wise guys'' in this case, for the foursome of
Michael Dinner's ``The Crew'' are aged lower echelon New Jersey
mobsters. Now reduced to sitting out their sunset days on the porch
of their South Beach old age home, they reminisce as they watch the
suddenly trendy area get yuppified around them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they will find themselves drawn into one last caper, but
otherwise this spry, smart-mouthed comedy is fresh, funny and
surprisingly savvy about the eccentricities of South Florida. In
fact, former ``Golden Girls'' staff writer Barry Fanaro's script
brings to mind the regional nuttiness of an Elmore Leonard or a
Carl Hiaasen novel, in which all roads lead to the local, inept
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   When Joey ``Bats'' Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Mike ``The Brick''
Donatelli (Dan Hedaya), Tony ``Mouth'' Donato (Seymour Cassel) and
Bobby ``No Nickname'' Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss) fake a murder
in the lobby of their retirement hotel, it is just their bad luck
that the corpse they steal from the morgue was the father of a
vindictive Hispanic drug lord. From there, the problems escalate.
</P>
<P>
   They are then forced by a buxom hooker named Ferris (Jennifer
Tilly) to fake another killing. The would-be victim, Ferris's
stepmother, turns out to be Pepper Lowenstein (Lainie Kazan) of Sol
and Pepper, proprietors of Miami Beach's Rascal House deli. (As
Pepper used to say in commercials, with her best trophy wife
delivery, ``Slice the lox, Sol, I want to go shopping.'')
Complicating matters further is homicide detective Olivia Neal
(Carrie-Anne Moss), who Bobby suspects is the daughter he abandoned
30 years ago for mob life.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall with a wince, Reynolds also was in
``Striptease,'' the only Hiaasen yarn to be filmed so far. His
appearance here subliminally links the two movies and underscores
how much ``The Crew'' gets it right, from the depressingly dingy
condo bingo night to the young vultures and real estate yentas
circling to grab any dead geezer's South Beach digs to the early
bird lineup at the Rascal House. In one of Dinner's better
directorial flourishes, he takes us through the deli's kitchen and
halls, a witty spoof of ``Goodfellas'' sweep into the Copacabana.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner, whose work has mainly been in television, underscores
the early character introductions with cheap freeze-frame punch
lines, but he soon eases into the movie's wry, winning tone. Most
impressively, he juggles his sizeable ensemble cast, getting vivid,
quirky performances without letting any one actor dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds plays a hot-tempered bully, embarrassed to be working
at Burger King and stubbornly unwilling to let customers have it
their way. Since his best schemes come to him when he is
unconscious, he periodically has to be knocked out for inspiration
to strike. Baby Boomer Dreyfuss is disconcertingly convincing as a
senior citizen, Hedaya scores with his trademark gruff, dumb
delivery and Cassel (who hails from the early days of independent
filmmaking with John Cassavetes) lends a twinkle to the obligatory
over-the-hill Romeo _ the equivalent of ``Space Cowboys'' Donald
Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   Moss is underutilized, but projects a soft, sympathetic quality
that contrasts nicely with her hard-edged, break-out showcase in
``The Matrix.'' Jewelry-clad Kazan and Wonderbra-ed Tilly are both
cast strictly to type, but they add the right grace and graceless
notes in support.
</P>
<P>
   The most puzzling part of ``The Crew'' is its generic title,
which gives no sense of the offbeat comedy or the sun-baked South
Florida flavor. It has nothing to do with a rowing team or a
close-cropped haircut, but everything to do with an hour-and-a-half
of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   THE CREW
</P>
<P>
   3 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13: Language, drug smuggling, gunplay
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 38 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Cuddly, quirky South Florida comedy of
senior-division ``Sopranos'' pulling off one more job and swiping
plenty of laughs.

 &HT;    Baby bear goes to town
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Small lots, narrow streets, scraggly
trees, children playing in the streets, swing-shift-working dads
and stay-at-home moms, Wal-Mart in walking distance _ sure enough,
it's bear country.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it was was on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A yearling black bear sow claimed the territory for her own that
day, only to be rudely chased about by a passel of police officers
and a brace of wildlife officers. To say nothing of a pack of
onlookers, may of them who knew the Grand Valley had been invaded
by many bears this summer, at least 18 in all so far.
</P>
<P>
   The bear was first spotted just east of Wal-Mart about 10 a.m. A
police dispatcher cracked that there must have been a special on
honey.
</P>
<P>
   Police technician Paula Bockman was one of the first to get a
good look at the bear as it loped west across the Wal-Mart lot and
into a stand of scrubby elm barely 20 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was adorable,'' Bockman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bear lingered only a short time, though, in the patchy
shade.
</P>
<P>
   Word crackled out from dispatch that the bear was on the move,
this time heading west.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove its claim to legitimate residency, the bear
ducked into the open door of Crown Liquors, said Grand Junction
Police Lt. Mike Nordine. Apparently finding nothing to its taste,
it crossed the street and made back to the east, passing by an auto
parts store and a Chinese restaurant. The bear found itself a
comfortable watching place in the shade of a line of slender elm
trees stretching 150 yards or so and settled in.
</P>
<P>
   With trees behind and an open field in front, the bear had a
commanding view of its territory _ tiny, but indisputably its own.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, company arrived. Police officers, onlookers and
experts watched the bear with a mixture of awe, sympathy and
healthy respect. The bear watched back.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Sidener, district wildlife manager for the Colorado
Division of Wildlife, parked about 75 yards away and studied the
bear.
</P>
<P>
   She was, Sidener estimated, a yearling that would go about 100
pounds. That was an estimate, he cautioned, saying, not for the
only time, ``It's not a perfect science.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bear seemed to be in good shape, especially in
comparison to the 18 bears so far this summer that have been
tranquilized between and replaced in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The bear's mother recently booted it out to fend for itself,
Sidener said, and that probably was the first of several cuffings
the yearling received as it crossed other bears' territories in
search of a place it could call its own.
</P>
<P>
   A late freeze and a dry spring and summer left precious little
food in the high country, forcing bears to cover larger territories
and leaving less room for newcomers, such as this one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad year to be a bear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much as he might wish to leave it alone, this bear had already
crossed the street on at least three occasions, which suggested a
traffic hazard at the least, Sidener said.
</P>
<P>
   A hazard in town, and at a severe disadvantage in its normal
territory, the bear was out of place most everywhere, Sidener said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidener sent for a tranquilizer kit and gun _ which looks like a
super-hyped paintball weapon _ and settled in to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a stump sticking out of the grasses _ albeit one
with rounded ears _ the bear seemingly glowed in the sun. Part of
the glow, Sidener said, was the light tips on the bear's fur. ``It
almost looks like he got a bad dye job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When his tranquilizer gun arrived, Sidener prepared for what he
least wanted _ a shot at a bear on the ground. The drug could take
anywhere from five to 20 minutes to take effect and a bear on the
ground could cover a lot of territory in that time. He eyeballed
the bear to determine how much sleeping agent to inject and noted,
``It's not a perfect science.''
</P>
<P>
   With no trees capable of holding a yearling bear, Sidener had to
risk a shot at the bear on the ground. He took one shot from about
30 yards, to apparent effect, but the bear never drifted into
unconsciousness. The shot, it turned out, missed.
</P>
<P>
   As Sidener approached for a second shot, the bear suddenly
bounded up and ran east, into a thicket of elm and weeds. Police
and the wildlife officers followed behind, trying to turn it back
with shouts and handclaps.
</P>
<P>
   The bear made for the backlot of Grand Junction Nursery, filled
with trees and plants.
</P>
<P>
   From within the greenery, officers could only rely on shouted
instructions and glimpses of their quarry, as well as other humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a bear in there with you,'' called one to a nursery
employee. ``You might want to head in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've got to get this done,'' came the response.
</P>
<P>
   The bear turned to the north and bounded ahead, climbing an
8-foot fence in almost simian fashion and crossing another empty
lot before disappearing into the urban wilds.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, elementary school children were called in from the
playground as the bear rambled around his realm.
</P>
<P>
   Sidener and the officers retired back to their vehicles for a
road hunt _ one that lasted only minutes before the bear was
spotted again.
</P>
<P>
   Nordine was the first to arrive where the bear was treed in the
back yard of James and Susan Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Otis, a 2-year-old chocolate Labrador, did what dozens of
two-legged pursuers couldn't _ forced the bear into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Otis ``nearly treed me,'' Nordine said.
</P>
<P>
   Perched above roofline in the weeping willow, the bear attracted
a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, how cute,'' said Shawna Mangum, who saw the bear
dash through her back yard and followed it to the neighbors'.
</P>
<P>
   The urban safari moved towards its end when Sidener pumped a
dart into the bear's backside 32 feet above the ground. Once shot,
the bear lurched to the top of the tree, where it clung.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officers, neighbors and passersby were recruited to
catch the bear in a tarp before it struck the wooden deck.
</P>
<P>
   A play-by-play rang out as the bear lost consciousness. ``He's
holding on by two paws. Now just the one. Now!''
</P>
<P>
   The bear tumbled down from the crown of the tree, crashed
against a limb and then hit with a heavy thud in the tarp, where
she was quickly gathered up and carried off.
</P>
<P>
   The bear was tagged and was to be relocated to the mountains
near Silt or on the Uncompahgre Plateau, Sidener said.
</P>
<P>
   In reasonably good health, Sidener said, the female wasn't as
heavy as he had anticipated, maybe 75-80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he said, ``It's not a perfect science.''

 &HT;    Bush's tough on crime stance conflicts with record
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In 1994, when he was a baseball executive
running for governor, George W. Bush led off his television
campaign with an ad that hit hard on crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three years 7,700 criminals have been released
early from prison,'' Bush said then. ``I will end early release of
criminals and end parole altogether for rapists and child
molesters.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later _ as a governor running for president _ that
approach could come back to haunt Bush as state prisons near
capacity and his parole officials are issuing more and more
get-out-of-jail-early cards.
</P>
<P>
   With parole rates inching higher during Bush's presidential
campaign, the stakes could be huge. One high-profile crime by one
parolee can change the outcome of an election.
</P>
<P>
   f+b f-bAt Al Gore headquarters in Nashville, there was a swift
effort to make political hay out of the parole rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises questions in the minds of voters as to why
Governor Bush has been mostly silent about what he would do to
ensure the safety of American families,'' said Gore spokesman Jano
Cabrera. ``Governor Bush has tried to deflect attention from his
gun lobby-like record and has been mostly silent on what, if
anything, he would do on crime as president.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Bush campaign worked to separate parole and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state function and the proper role of the Board of
Pardons and Paroles to address parole, with the public's safety
being a paramount concern,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Ray
Sullivan. ``The governor's appointees to the parole board have a
history of careful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has talked about crime on the campaign trail, but his web
site _ which includes his positions on 19 issues _ includes nothing
about crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, criminal justice experts say, politics and
parole would be as mixable as oil and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area that should be taken out of the political
realm,'' said D'Ann Johnson, executive director of the Texas
Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. ``The executive branch ought
to be able to make a case-by-case determination based on the facts
presented to them about whether a person is ready for release.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the real world _ especially in a real-hot political year
_ politics and parole are as linked as Michael Dukakis and Willie
Horton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back to the political situation,'' said criminal
justice professor Raymond Teske at Sam Houston State University.
``It looks good to say, `We are not paroling people and I'm the guy
that's keeping them in there.'''
</P>
<P>
   For years, that's been the approach for Bush, a politician whose
family is well-acquainted with crime as campaign issue. In 1988, a
group supporting the elder Bush for president scored heavily with a
TV ad detailing the 1986 weekend furlough of convicted
Massachusetts murderer Willie Horton, who fled to Maryland where he
abducted a couple and raped a woman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _ the elder Bush's
1988 presidential opponent _ vetoed a bill that would have ended
the weekend furloughs.
</P>
<P>
   For current presidential candidate Bush, the worst-case scenario
would be anything resembling a repeat of the Horton case. Odds
against it seem good. Almost all the inmates now being paroled are
non-violent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Hubbarth, a vice president of Justice for All, a crime
victims' group, said Thursday he is not concerned about the
increasing parole rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Parole Board Chairman) Gerald Garrett has done an
incredibly good job of allaying people's fears about the streets
being prowled by released predators,'' said Hubbarth, a former
assistant general counsel for the parole division.
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show a national electorate concerned about crime,
but not as much as it is concerned about other issues. A Portrait
of America poll conducted last week showed crime tied for sixth,
with Social Security and taxes, among the issues of concern to
voters. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents said crime is a
``very important'' issue, making it one of 12 issues deemed very
important by 60 percent or more of the respondents.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by Rasmussen Research, included responses
from 4,208 likely voters. The margin of error is four percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   For many voters, concern about crime translates into calls for
longer prison sentences for offenders. Criminal justice Professor
Teske said the increased parole rate in Texas is the inevitable
result of that mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They overreacted to the situation,'' he said of politicians
like Bush who responded to the tough-on-crime call. ``Now they are
in a bind again. And now they've got to let them out. They don't
want to, but they have to because they don't have room for them.
It's going to have to happen. They have to be selective about it
and people shouldn't blame (Bush) or anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was a candidate for governor, Bush was not shy
about assigning blame for increasing parole rates. One of his
can't-miss quips along the campaign trail involved a story, perhaps
apocryphal, about a young girl's curiousity about wanted posters in
a police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you keep them when you took their pictures?'' Bush
said the girl asked.

 &HT;    f+bCLINTON, FOX PREDICT STRONGER U.S., MEXICO TIES
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   f-b WASHINGTON _ President Clinton welcomed Mexican
President-elect Vicente Fox to the White House on Thursday, hailing
his upset victory in July elections as a ``historic'' landmark in
the development of democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the ties that bind the United States and Mexico
will only grow stronger in the years to come, but he made it clear
that easing border restrictions, as Fox has espoused, is not in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have borders and we have laws that apply to them
and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the United States,'' he told reporters at the
White House, ``I believe we have the most generous immigration
policy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox emerged from an hour-long Oval Office meeting with Clinton
to say that narrowing the income chasm between the two neighbors is
the key to stemming the tide of illegal immigration by job-hungry
Mexicans seeking greener pastures north of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   It marked a shift in emphasis for Fox, who has outlined in
Mexico in recent weeks a future of open borders between the two
countries, something along the lines of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we work on development, on job creating, on
education programs; as long as we can have in each rural community
in Mexico a school of high level, university or technological
school,'' Fox said, ``then we will not have migration as we are
having now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving a bit further in that direction in remarks later in the
day, Fox said, ``Really, what we are proposing is an economic
convergence, a holistic view of the problems and the
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 7.1 million Mexican-born people living in the
United States _ far more than any other group of foreigners _ and
about 3 million are classified as illegal aliens. Controlling the
border, and dealing with illegal immigrants, has been a perennial
sore spot in U.S.-Mexico relations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who travels Friday to Dallas to meet with Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, was elected president
last summer in a stunning win over the PRI, or Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has controlled Mexico's government for
seven decades. He takes office Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and Fox touched on a broad range of issues _
including the illegal narcotics trade and ideas for building on,
and perhaps eventually expanding the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or NAFTA, which wedded the economies of the United
States, Mexico and Canada _ the incoming Mexican leader made clear
that he was here as part of his transition preparations, not as a
Mexican official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a working meeting, it's not a negotiating meeting or
anything like that,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Fox received the sort of welcome here generally
reserved for heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Much as he has hailed democratic leaders like Vaclev Havel of
the Czech Republic or Boris Yeltsin of Russia, Clinton praised Fox
for a victory expected to shift Mexico's political and bureaucratic
culture dramatically over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked forward to this very much, for the chance to
congratulate him on his election, and all the people of Mexico on a
truly historic affirmation of genuine democracy in their country,''
Clinton said. ``I think it's an example to people who are friends
of freedom everywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That endorsement was part of an auspicious Washington debut for
Fox, a former executive with the Coca-Cola Co. While his visit was
an informal one _ PRI leader Ernesto Zedillo remains Mexico's
president for the next three months _ Fox was received pretty much
as Zedillo was when he visited Clinton earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met with Vice President and Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore Thursday morning, and was hosted for a formal
State Department luncheon by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Standing about two inches taller than Clinton, the charismatic
Fox, with his chiseled features and dark moustache, projected
confidence and an energetic vision for Mexico's future.
</P>
<P>
   He addressed the Washington and Mexican press corps three times,
alternating fluidly between his native Spanish and fluent English,
speaking extemporaneously and in complete paragraphs, seldom
glancing at notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between English and Spanish, I'll end up dizzy here,'' Fox
joked at one point during a 45-minute news conference at the
National Press Club, a traditional event for visiting heads of
state.
</P>
<P>
   In each appearance, Fox sounded the themes of reform and
decentralization near the heart of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said state and local governments should assume a growing role
in areas where federal authority has been inefficient. He said job
growth must come from building a vibrant base of small and
medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurial in nature rather than the
hidebound behemoths that have long characterized industrial Mexico.
In addition, Fox said grassroots activism and so-called
non-governmental organizations _ both home-grown and foreign _ have
an important role to play in promoting human rights and sound
environmental practices, and combating poverty in Mexico.

 &HT;    New Sprint wireless tool to link e-mail, Net, company networks
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sprint on Thursday trotted out a new service aimed
mainly at wooing companies that want their mobile employees to have
access to e-mail, the Internet and corporate networks back in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   While sure to be challenged by rivals, Sprint means to help
shape the future of wireless tools, leaping ahead of the pack by
packaging functions now found on a personal digital assistant, a
pager and a phone, said Jay Highley, Sprint vice president. ``We
think we are 12 or 18 months ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Other wireless Net phones aren't capable of slipping a user
through a company's ``firewall'' to plug into the internal
corporate network from anywhere, he said. ``The world has been
looking for the wireless data killer app (application), and the
killer app is e-mail _ or anything behind the corporate firewall.''
</P>
<P>
   To make that connection, a user can plug the phone into a
laptop. Or the user can slide a small metallic card into the
computer. That card, which costs $400, is a wireless modem.
</P>
<P>
   Once phone and modem are purchased, a user can for about $65 a
month have both phone and card _ and two phone numbers _ permitting
a phone conversation while linking to company networks or the
Internet. But the phone itself can also link to the Net, sending
e-mail and updating addresses and appointments _ on a much smaller
screen with a touch-sensitive keypad.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is widely believed to be behind Japan and
Europe in wireless data. But in both places _ especially with NTT
DoCoMo in Japan _ the service is pitched to consumers with a
heavier accent on games and e-mail than on corporate uses.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint service, available in September, is an aggressive
push toward business customers, employers of an estimated 47
million people who often work outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   To lasso that market, Sprint hopes to take advantage of the
desire to centralize purchasing and simplify billing. For instance,
time used on all a company's phones can be pooled and counted
toward whatever total the company is paying for. Sprint also
expects companies to consolidate buying decisions about wireless,
something often left now to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals can be counted on to point out some vulnerabilities in
the service. For one thing, a user's use of wireless data will be
billed per minute, like a phone conversation. Also, the service may
seem sluggish to anyone accustomed to a truly high-speed connection
from a desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's new service is technically only a little faster than
its current 9.6 kilobits-per-second connection. But software on
both network and phone strips away some graphics to make the link
seem like 56 kbps, as fast as the quickest dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is far slower than the high-speed connections of
many desktops. It's about half as fast as Metricom's Ricochet, the
wireless modem that provides a continuous connection to the Net for
laptops. That service was recently launched in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel and Southern LINC each have phones with e-mail capacity _
as well as an ``instant conferencing'' feature that connects
designated users immediately. And, of course, there are pagers that
send e-mail as well as various wireless phones from BellSouth,
Powertel and AT&AMP;T, which also has a national network. Some of these
services are cheaper than Sprint's.
</P>
<P>
   As for PDAs, like the Palm Pilot, they come with hundreds of
customized applications that Sprint cannot match. The newest Palms
also do e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But Highley said Sprint has a better combination of features, as
well as a national plan that counts a minute in Atlanta the same as
in Spokane. A Palm cannot access corporate networks, he said. ``And
besides, you can't talk over it.''

   Tonight
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``Big Brother'' f-b(8 on CBS, 1361, and 8 p.m. Saturday,
7317) _ Day Two of ``Survivor'' withdrawal dawns, and it seems an
appropriate time to turn the whirring, wall-mounted camera back to
CBS' other reality series, ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   And oh, brother. After the finale fireworks of ``Survivor''
Wednesday, going back into that sad little house feels more like
Chinese water torture than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' is still watchable, in a ghastly,
peek-through-your-fingers sort of way, and still better than summer
reruns.
</P>
<P>
   But a little past the halfway point in CBS' 100-day experiment
in sensory deprivation, it's hard to tell who's more lethargic _
the seven remaining house-hostages or the viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly the audience's fault, for voting out the only three
people who really stirred things up _ black activist Will ``Mega''
Collins, stripper-provocateur Jean Jordan and Froot Loopy Hoosier
homemaker Karen Fowler. Most of the remaining guinea pigs are too
nice to make waves; this is what happens when Rodney King's wish _
``Can't we all just get along?''_ comes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The producers have been trying to spice things up, giving them a
puppy (even though they already have Brittany Petros) and sneaking
Will back into and out of the house earlier this week (although by
sneaking him, they missed the chance for a major moment).
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if CBS starts amping up ``Big Brother'' to
try to build a buzz. Hint: You can't go wrong with forcing people
to eat live beetle larvae.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``Miss Teen USA Pageant'' f-b(9 p.m. on CBS, 4684) _ Just

</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``Daria: Is It Fall Yet?''f-b (7 p.m. on MTV, 487911) _ Dry
as an Atlanta back yard, Daria is MTV's coolest cartoon character.
Sunday night, she gets her first movie, in which she is forced to
volunteer at a summer camp for the oversensitive called the OK to
Cry Corral.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``The Simpsons'' f-b(8 p.m. on Fox, 3337) _ If PBS pledge
breaks make you break out in boils, take a gander at what happens
when they get Simpson-ized in this classic rerun.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``Witchblade'' f-b(8 p.m. on TNT, 908089) _ Yancyf+tCQf-t
Butler (that's right, Yancy, not Nancy) stars in this new sci-fi
flick based on a comic book. She plays a New York City cop who
discovers a magical bracelet that gives her supernatural powers and
won't even turn her wrist green.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``The E! True Hollywood Story: All in the Family.'' f-b(9
p.m. on E!, 175824) _ As much a part of TV's pantheon as ``All in
the Family'' deserves to be, it would be almost impossible to get
it on a major network today. Not that it was easy in 1971. Carroll
O'Connor, Rob Reiner and Jean Stapleton reminisce about when those
were the days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  f+b``The Chieftains Over Ireland'' f-b(10 p.m. on A&AMP;E, 828398)

   GORE-THEME _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore began sounding
a subtle new theme on the stump this week, aimed at countering the
political estrangement among young and middle-aged voters alike.
Campaigning in the Midwest, Gore asked voters to ``open your
hearts'' and ``allow yourself to believe'' and to ``break through
your disillusionment.'' In an interview, Gore said these were not
references only to the reaction against President Clinton's
behavior, but also to the disenchantment with politics in general.

   BUSH _ Aside from the statewide implications, Gov. George W.
Bush faces some tough political choices that could have
implications on his national campaign: does he start releasing
inmates in droves or wait until state law does it for him. Is this
a sign of his prison management failure? Will there be some fiscal
implications? What are Democrats going to do? We explore all the
political ramifications. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-PAROLE _ At the heart of the state's recent spike in
paroles that are being granted is something called the Prison
Management Act. Under this law, if the state's prisons reach 95
percent of capacity, some draconian policies kick in, including the
automatic awarding of good time credits to inmates. The net effect:
more inmates on the street. Gov. George W. Bush, running with a
tough-on-crime record, is said to want to avoid at all costs this
act kicking in for fear of political repurcussions. (Ward, Austin

did when they were that young. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

   MONITOR _ ATLANTA _ Off the coast of Cape Hatteras, in the
graveyard of the Atlantic, time and tide are erasing the remains of
a naval legend. The USS Monitor, the icon of Civil War ironclads,
is surrendering to the natural forces and maritime mishaps that
have dogged it since it sank in a storm on New Year's Eve, 1862.
Like the H.L. Hunley, the Confederate submarine raised from
Charleston Harbor this month, the Monitor _ the first ship built
entirely of iron _changed the face of naval warfare and sounded the
death knell for wooden warships. Like the Hunley, the Monitor was
lost at sea for more than a century. And like the Hunley, it is the
object of a multi-million dollar effort to save as much of it as
possible for posterity. (Toner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ His daddy taught school before
going to Congress, Democrat Al Gore told the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles last week. His mom worked her way through
law school waitressing. ``When I visit a school and see a
hard-working teacher trying to change the world one child at a
time, I see the face of my father,'' Gore said. ``When I see a
waitress working hard and thanking someone for a tip, I see the
face of my mother. ``And I know: for that waitress carrying trays
or a construction worker in the winter cold, I will never agree to
raise the retirement age to 70 or threaten the promise of Social
Security. It's not fair to them, and I won't do it.'' He'll stand

BUCHANAN AND REFORM RIVAL PLAY THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, N.C., Mont., Mich., Calif., Kan.)   (Eds.: SUBS 4th graf to add first names for Hagelin and
Goldhaber.)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Iowa on Thursday, a government aide put a slip of paper
inside each of two black canisters. On one was written
``Buchanan-Foster;'' on the other, ``Hagelin-Goldhaber.'' After the
canisters were placed into a glass bowl on a stand outside his
office in the Capitol rotunda, Secretary of State Chester J. Culver
walked up, stirred the canisters around and lifted one out.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how Pat Buchanan and his running mate, Ezola Foster,
became the Reform Party presidential ticket in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   An odd way, perhaps, to pick a president, but it is the current
state of affairs in the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Iowa and several other states this week is a
direct consequence of a fractious convention two weeks ago that
left the party split, with two candidates and their organizations
contending to be the rightful heir to state ballot designations in
November as the Reform Party ticket and $12.6 million in federal
campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The bickering at the convention was only a prologue to what is
going on now. Not only is Buchanan's faction fighting over the
money with that of John Hagelin and Nat Goldhaber before the
Federal Election Commission, the two sides are threatening lawsuits
in various states over decisions that leave one or the other
candidate off the ballot as the Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
   John Duffy, a lawyer in Washington who represents Buchanan, said
flatly: ``We will go into court wherever necessary not to allow
anybody to identify themselves as the Reform Party candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Iowa was one of at least four states in which the
matter was addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney followed his Iowa
counterpart by picking a name out of a ballot box that contained 10
canisters with ``Buchanan'' written on an index card and 10 with
``Hagelin.'' After Cooney plucked out a Hagelin, a lawyer for
Buchanan in Helena began drawing up papers seeking a temporary
restraining order from a state court to prevent Cooney from
certifying a ballot with Hagelin's name.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lippert, the lawyer, said the court would schedule a hearing
within 10 days to decide whether Cooney's selection should stand,
after which Lippert said, he expected that the losing party would
appeal the court decision to the Montana Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Department of State's Bureau of Elections sent a
letter to the two campaigns, asking each to make a case for its
ticket, after which the bureau would decide. ``But if it's not
crystal clear who it should be, I could see us denying both
requests,'' said Brad Wittman, a spokesman for the bureau. ``Then
courts would have to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the Board of Elections heard testimony from
the two sides for more than four hours Thursday, and then voted 3-1
to put the Buchanan ticket on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, two other states took other actions, and
perhaps nowhere else will the fight be more grueling than in
California, where the state Reform Party is operating as one
splintered organization. Late Wednesday, Secretary of State Bill
Jones withdrew Buchanan and Foster as the Reform ticket after the
state party chairman, Raymond O. Mills, a Buchanan ally,
acknowledged that the state party board of directors, which favors
Hagelin, had voted last week not to support a Buchanan ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Mills had told Jones last week that the state party recognized
Buchanan as the Reform nominee. But John H. Place, the party vice
chairman, told Jones in a letter that any communication with Mills
should be considered ``null and void'' without evidence of the
board's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state party has until next Thursday to affirm its
notify Jones of its choice.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has taken another approach. On Tuesday, the state
rejected each side's claim to the ballot, advising the two to take
their complaints to the State Objections Board, which would sort
things out and pick one, leaving the loser to take matters into
court.

GASOLINE EDICTS SHARE BLAME FOR HIGH PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The next time some politico wants to grab
some headlines by initiating an investigation into gasoline price
spikes, we'd all be better served if the probe's focus was on
government rather than the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Details of how federal and state meddling contributed
substantially to this summer's soaring gas prices have been
revealed in dribs and drabs, but it fell to a journal well outside
the media mainstream to do the most comprehensive reporting job yet
on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   An article in this month's edition of ``The Intellectual
Activist'' by Jack Wakeland is by far the best media effort to put
the gas price conspiracy in proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state controls, he explains, worked in tandem to
turn back the economic clock to the days before gasoline
standardization. The Illinois situation became a textbook example
of how badly consumers are served by ill-advised government policy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Environmental Protection Agency's reformulated-gas
mandate took effect, Illinois was divided into four pollution
control zones. Each required three different grades of
ethanol-blended gas. To further complicate matters, Illinois
mandated use of ethanol fuel additives, which are derived from
corn, instead of the cheaper ethanol-based oxygenate used in most
reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeland calls these ``boutique fuels'' and says if local
inventories run low they cannot be rebuilt by borrowing reserves
from other regions. Thus, when a pipeline supplying refineries
producing reformulated gasoline ruptured, it set in place the
events that caused the soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
   While Kansas City wasn't affected directly, the
market-distorting ripple effect from all the combined developments
no doubt contributed to the price shocks that occurred in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the resulting consumer woe, the article revealed, was
the cavalier way government officials ignored how their regulatory
mandates would cause prices to surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a conspiracy ... the real conspirators would be
the EPA and the state of Illinois,'' Wakeland surmised. ``They
ordered the oil industry to produce 12 different gasoline blends,
specified the precise chemical composition of each, and dictated
exactly in which territories it may be sold _ and then blamed the
refiners for the astronomical costs of complying with these
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the alleged conspiracy by Big Oil is a figment of its
detractors' imagination, Wakeland notes that ``there is real
evidence for (the) anti-oil industry conspiracy. A memo from an
energy secretary aide warned that the reformulated gas rule was the
main culprit in the gas price spike, but EPA officials refused to
grant waivers for Chicago and Milwaukee areas, which were hit worst
by soaring prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as surging gas prices became big news, it's worth
remembering that many pols and bureaucrats began making noises in
the media implying that the oil industry greed was to blame for the
price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Wakeland says, Big Oil's critics offered no facts or
analysis to substantiate such claims. Instead they sold the idea
using the same methods others use to claim the world is really run
by a cabal of bankers.

GAME OF WEEK GOING RETRO, AND THEN SOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Do not adjust your television set Saturday
morning. Fox has control of it. Sit back, learn and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   During the Dodgers-Cubs national telecast at 10 a.m. PDT from
Wrigley Field, Fox has what's called a ``Turn Back The Clock''
special presentation that may look more like Major League Baseball
meets ``The Twilight Zone.'' What it amounts to is an ingenious way
to illustrate how far technical advances have come in TV coverage
of the game over the last 60-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it'll also wake someone up into realizing that more isn't
always better.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, 1939, no more than 500 homes in New York had access
to the first televised baseball game between the Cincinnati Reds
and Brooklyn Dodgers from Ebbets Field. Behind the mike, Red Barber
flew solo _ Vin Scully was more than a decade away from starting
his career with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a black-and-white production, with two
stationary cameras _ one on ground level behind home plate for a
majority of the pitcher-batter shots and another in the upper deck.
And they didn't even know if it was technically possible to switch
back and forth between the two live shots.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Fox telecast will open Saturday, 61 years to the
date of that game _ one announcer (Joe Buck, from a small wooden
table behind home plate), two wide-angle cameras and no replays.
</P>
<P>
   With each half-inning, they'll add more equipment to represent
what changes were made in that decade. Tim McCarver won't join the
broadcast as the second voice until the top of the second (the
color man first was introduced in 1957), and an attempt at a color
picture will go in the bottom of the second (which came in '61).
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth inning, the game will be at full 21st Century tilt,
a 15-camera complement with microphones in the bases, catcher
camera and all the noisy graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda makes you already yearn for the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gimmick quality, but with a Game of the Week
telecast we can do something fun like this and honor some of the
people who've done the work over the years and show some of the
things we take for granted,'' said Keith Olbermann, Fox's baseball
studio host. Olbermann will introduce each half-inning time-frame
dressed in period clothes and, with Steve Lyons, discuss the news
headlines from that era.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann added that, for his segment, he steps into an
egg-shaped time capsule _ the company rented the one used in the
movie ``Austin Powers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just too bad that they couldn't find a way to incorporate
Scully into this time warp.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION OF THE WEEK: If it's called the Kickoff Classic,
signifying the kickoff to the college football season, why does it
come a day after the Pigskin Classic?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who promote the Pigskin found out that the Kickoff
worked (coming first),'' said ABC's Keith Jackson. ``It's money.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, both games are sponsored by the National
Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics and benefit the
College Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   For our benefit, Jackson will call the USC-Penn State Kickoff
contest only because he happens to be in New York for network
meetings and Brent Musburger is busy this weekend doing the Little
League World Series. Otherwise, Jackson, starting his 48th season,
will remain a West Coast entity for the network this season as per
his agreement to drop plans for retirement two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find as the years pile up I grow more lazy,'' said the
almost 72-year-old who spent part of his summer vacation hauling in
175 pounds of halibut and 102 pounds of salmon from British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind saying that come Sunday night, I'll probably be
bone dog tired since I haven't done a game since last fall. When
you're my age, it's hard to concentrate for eight or nine hours on
a broadcast like this.''
</P>
<P>
   NO STATIC CLING: There will be no discernable changes in the
weekday lineup for all-sports KXTA-AM (1150), even though the
station has access to the entire new Fox Sports Radio Network that
launches Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Premiere Radio Networks boss Kraig Kitchin, whose
Sherman Oaks, Calif.-based company works with Fox on this endeavor,
1150 needs to find a new program director and get through some red
tape from a pending company merger before any decisions are made on
what content the station will use.
</P>
<P>
   He did confirm that by the middle of next month, the new flashy
studios will be ready near the corner of Sepulveda and Ventura,
where anyone walking by can watch the ensuing show hijinx, kind of
like NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bruno, who did some fill-in afternoon hosting on 1150 prior
to the Fox launch, will host the first show for the network from 5
to 9 a.m. PDT. For obvious reasons, 1150 should pick up his show
and immediately drop the ``Bob and Tom'' syndicated fiasco out of
Indianapolis, which former 1150 program director Mike Thompson
not-so-privately despised.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting twists to this new network is that Bill
Pugh, who runs the affiliate XTRA-AM (690) in San Diego, has been
an important sounding board for Premiere and Fox. Pugh's brother,
Dan Patrick (not his real name), is the cornerstone to the rival
ESPN Radio network. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
-- The same time ESPN's Chris Berman and Dan Patrick make the cover
story of the newest issue of Dads magazine, NBC's Bob Costas had
his image consultants allow him to be interviewed in the October
issue of Playboy. Berman and Patrick talk about what it's like to
be a high-profile sports dad. Costas rips on John Tesh for his
network performance on doing gymnastics at the 1996 Summer
Olympics. ``I think most reasonable people would say that, at
times, the gymnastics coverage was beyond parody,'' says Costas.
``He's a talented guy, but, oh man, those gymnastics.'' &QL; 
-- For ABC's coverage Saturday of the Little League World Series
title game, Orel Hershiser has been added as an analyst. Wouldn't
hurt if he tried to boost his confidence a bit by pitching some
batting practice to the tykes. But then again ... &QL; 
-- Documentary don't misses: ESPN's two-parter on a Pennsylvania
high school football team's pursuit of the 1999 state title
(produced by New York Times Television company), airs Monday (5 to
6:30 p.m. PDT) and Tuesday (5 to 6 p.m. PDT), and The History
Channel's two-hour production called ``Gridiron Generals: A
Hard-Hitting History of College Football,'' airing Monday at 9 p.m.
PDT. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
-- Did ya see the promo running on the FX Channel for new episodes
of the Howard Stern-produced ``Son Of The Beach'' sit-com? There's
one of a surfing competition with a shot of huge waves crashing
that gets the announcer to exclaim: ``Look at that set'' _ just as
a well-endowed bikini-clad babe walks in front of him. Get it? Oh,
the announcer in question is only Fox's clean-cut, do-it-all Bill
Macdonald. Oh, (ital)now(endital) we get it. &QL;

RAVIANT NETWORKS ATTRACTS $55 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL

<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ An Overland Park company that works with
telephone companies and Internet service providers to update their
telecommunications networks has received $55 million in venture
capital from two East Coast firms.
</P>
<P>
   The cash infusion will allow Raviant Networks to hire up to 75
engineers, project developers and other employees this year; move
into new offices in Leawood; and build a state-of-the-art
telecommunications laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital investment is one of the largest ever in a
Kansas City, Mo., area company. It brings total capital investment
in area companies to more than $223 million in the first eight
months of 2000 _ eclipsing last year's record of $143 million.
</P>
<P>
   Raviant Networks, which changed its name from Integrated Network
Solutions Inc., until recently was based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The
company has moved its focus from equipment provider to specialist
in telecommunications network design and consulting, concentrating
on the integration of voice and data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our real momentum was coming from telecommunications
services,'' said Matt Cullen, chief executive of Raviant. ``Our new
identity reflects transformation, not only within our company but
throughout the telecommunications industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Raviant now has 74 employees, most in Kansas City, with small
offices in North Carolina, Texas and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Raviant works with telephone companies, Internet service
providers and large corporations to help them integrate new
broadband technologies into existing networks. The company's
clients include Sprint Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Birch Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   The company specializes in packet switched networks, which
transmit voices and data along the same path in high-speed bursts,
using network capacity more efficiently than traditional circuit
switching. Circuit switching opens up a dedicated circuit between
callers for the duration of a call.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to packet switching gives companies an opportunity to
offer new services _ and generate more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows them to deploy a whole set of next-generation
services, some of which haven't even been thought of yet,'' Cullen
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the hottest segment in the telecommunications market, and
finding financing to move the company forward wasn't difficult,
Cullen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money flow in this area is still solid,'' Cullen said.
``We had firms virtually begging us to take money from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Raviant has grown from $2 million in revenue in 1997 to more
than $30 million in 1999. Cullen projected growth of 10 percent to
20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the launch of its new corporate name, Raviant is
leasing a 22,000-square-foot headquarters in Leawood, Kan. The new
office will include the Raviant Encubator, a telecommunications
technology laboratory where customers can design, build and test
complex network equipment before it's used in a company's own
network.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen said the facility also will be used to work with start-up
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for opportunities to work with early-stage
companies,'' he said. ``The difference between huge success and
rampant failure is time to market, and we can help with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The venture capital came from Apollo Management and Crest
Communications Holdings, both venture firms based in New York. Each
invested $27.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Mockenhaupt, a managing director for Crest, said the
investment was one of the venture firm's largest to date.
</P>
<P>
   Crest was attracted to Raviant because of the company's
diversity, Mockenhaupt said. Raviant has staff members who have
both ``science-type expertise and a quality-of-service attitude
that the telco world has,'' he said.

AVAX COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF FRENCH BIOTECHNOLOGY FIRM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Avax Technologies Inc., a Kansas City
biotechnology company, said Thursday that it had completed its
acquisition of Genopoietic SA, a privately held French
biotechnology firm.
</P>
<P>
   Avax said it also had acquired from Pierre et Marie Curie
University the rights to university patents covering Genopoietic's
technologies and retained Genopoietic's exclusive agreement with
the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very excited to close this important transaction with a
company that we believe is at the forefront of cell and gene
research and development,'' said Jeffrey M. Jonas, president and
chief executive officer of Avax.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this transaction, we are now a company with
operations on three continents, with one commercialized product,
and a pipeline rich with cell and gene therapies in various stages
of clinical development.''
</P>
<P>
   Avax is working on cancer treatments that use a patient's own
cancer cells. It reached a milestone recently when its M-Vax
vaccine for melanoma was made available for use in Australia, the
first country to which it has been brought to market.
</P>
<P>
   Avax is publicly traded and is listed under the ticker symbol
AVXT.
</P>
<P>
   Genopoietic specializes in the research and development of cell
and gene therapy aimed at cancer, autoimmune diseases and
orthopedics.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

ZING HOPES ADS WILL RING AMONG TEENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No stranger to youth itself, Internet direct
marketer Zing announced a partnership that will let it reach the
highly coveted teen-age market.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old company started by a pair of 30-year-old California
State University, Northridge, graduates will team up with San
Francisco-based Cybermoola to offer teen-agers a payoff in exchange
for receiving advertisements on their cell phones. Teens who
register at Zing's Web site can accumulate points exchangeable for
Cybermoola dollars, which work like prepaid telephone cards good
for purchasing merchandise on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Zing gets valuable consumer information volunteered
by registrants; data it can sell to advertisers through a targeting
practice known as permission marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The deal allows Zing to sidestep a law that prohibits the
offering of points or other incentives over the Internet.
Cybermoola cards can be purchased in stores and parents must give
approval when their children sign up for Cybermoola.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now give points to under-18 consumers without any
liability,'' said Zing Chief Operating Officer Lance Suder.
``They're just a huge consumer market.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and industry observers said the market has, no pun
intended, not quite matured yet. Cellular phones with text
messaging capability needed to use Zing are not as widespread as
they are in Europe. There, said ad network executive Bruce Mello,
``you can go up to a vending machine and buy a Coke with your cell
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that direct marketing is a tremendous business on
Internet and has great potential in wireless,'' said Mello, senior
vice president of wireless, broadband and emerging media at 24/7
Media, a marketing solutions company.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bills, editor covering entertainment and information for
Hoovers Online, said Zing is not the first company marketing
through the Internet, but perhaps among the first to bypass
advertising on it directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially there are all kinds of companies doing that thing
on the Web,'' Bills said. ``Those companies started on the Web and
are expanding into wireless devices. It sounds like (Zing) is
trying to catch next big thing by skipping Internet altogether.''

NETSALES LAYS OFF NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF ITS EMPLOYEES, SELLS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ In a major corporate restructuring,
Overland Park-based NetSales Inc. on Thursday laid off almost a
third of its employees and sold off its software e-commerce
business.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come as the 5-year-old Internet company shifts its
focus to the business-to-business Internet market, where it builds
and maintains marketplace Web sites for midsize manufacturers and
distributors, said Robert Fraser, the company's founder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fraser is stepping down as chief executive of
NetSales to focus on planning and public relations. Jeff Reene,
NetSales' president, who left Cerner Corp. in 1999 to join the
company, will take on the added role of chief executive, Fraser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to be specific about the number of
people laid off but said it involved more than 60 employees.
Employees were told Thursday afternoon, and some employees said
more than 70 persons were laid off.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales previously had about 240 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet company signed a deal Thursday to sell its
software//technology sales division to Eden Prairie, Minn.-based
Digital River Inc. The two companies had been competitors in the
e-commerce market, where both built Web sites for e-commerce and
software companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which included NetSales' portfolio of more than 500
software publishing clients, was an all-stock transaction valued at
about $6 million, based on the closing price Thursday of Digital
River stock.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales' comparatively new business-to-business division is
growing rapidly, and the company was losing focus, Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to have two businesses that are very different
and very distinct. B2B is the market we've chosen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating almost a third of the company he spent five years
building was a difficult decision, Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of friends I'm saying goodbye to today.
These are all very good and, for the most part, highly skilled
people,'' he said. ``But with the sale of the business, there was
nothing else we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those laid off were in sales, customer service,
operations and support, Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said the decision to step down as chief executive was
``recognition of what has already happened. I haven't been focused
on day-to-day operations for six to nine months. It makes sense to
have a single person at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser started NetSales in 1995, working with three employees.
The business plan then was to sell advertising to software
companies from a company-owned software review Web site.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales refocused in 1997, building and operating e-commerce
Web sites for small and midsize companies. At one time, the company
operated more than 1,600 storefronts on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser had hoped that working with publishers to allow consumers
to buy and download software on the Internet would allow the
company to expand even more rapidly. The market, which Digital
River dominates, hasn't developed as rapidly as expected.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales moved into the business-to-business market earlier this
year after receiving $32 million in venture capital from a
coalition that included Time Warner and two of the nation's largest
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said NetSales is expecting a ``flood'' of new corporate
customers as a result of partnerships with Cisco Systems, Chase
Manhattan Corp. and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about one word: focus,'' Fraser said. ``NetSales
has succeeded because of that one thing, focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's focus now will be on what Fraser calls
e-marketplaces _ Web sites where corporations in the $100 million
to $1 billion range can sell to their customers online. NetSales
builds and maintains the site, charging $20,000 to $200,000 per
site, plus a transaction fee.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales last week unveiled a product that allows corporate
marketplaces to interact with large online marketplaces that can
include thousands of corporate buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The business-to-business market, where companies do business
with their suppliers and customers online, is expected to grow to
more than $1 trillion in less than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing tremendous demand for B2B e-business solutions,
particularly among the midmarket supplier companies that NetSales
targets,'' said David Grossman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel
Partners. ``These companies want to participate in the e-commerce
boom and are looking for strategic partners like NetSales to take
them online in a way that makes business and financial sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For Digital River, the opportunity to purchase the NetSales
division was another sign of the consolidation taking place in the
Internet marketplace. The company has 7,500 clients in its
portfolio, and picking up a competitor will help the company grow,
said Al Galgano, vice president of investor relations for Digital
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice addition to the portfolio,'' Galgano said of the
purchase. ``We're very happy with the quality of the clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Digital River, publicly traded on Nasdaq, hit $43 a
share in December before falling to less than $6 a share this
month. The stock, traded under the symbol DRIV, closed unchanged at
$6 a share Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital River has been a fierce competitor of ours,'' Fraser
said. ``But we found we cannot afford to have even a great side
business.''

BOEING SEES RESURGENCE AMONG INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _
</P>
<P>
   PAUL NYHAN
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. is enjoying a resurgence among investors, its
shares surging to a 28-month high Thursday and gaining more than 8
percent in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering through a succession of production problems and
a 40-day engineering strike, the company's stock is making a
significant recovery. And there are plenty of reasons, from a
healthy aircraft market, and a successful satellite launch, to an
improving defense sector and a generally healthy U.S. stock market,
financial analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are increasingly comfortable with the notion that
Boeing is working as a turnaround story,'' said Heidi Wood, who
tracks Boeing for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``It is sort of a
compounding of several events.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those events is a stronger-than-expected demand for new
airplanes. Together, Boeing and rival Airbus have landed almost 600
orders in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few years, Boeing is expected to produce roughly
500 airplanes a year, according to a report from Peter Jacobs at
Ragen MacKenzie Group Inc. While, the rate is down from last year's
record of 620 aircraft, it still represents a healthy pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is generally a more optimistic outlook for the
company as a whole as long as the company can continue to post the
improvement in earnings as most investors are expecting,'' Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only two days ago, Boeing burnished its image by putting a Delta
3 rocket into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The company had
failed in two previous attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing isn't the only aerospace or defense concern posting
strong gains on Wall Street. Bellevue-based Esterline Technologies
Corp. shares rose 56 cents, or 3.5 percent, in trading Thursday to
close at $16.50. Aircraft supplier B.F. Goodrich Co. shares rose
$1.94 to close at $41.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares rose $3.06, or 6.06 percent, in trading Thursday,
closing at $53.62 in one of the stock's best days in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some defense firms are also performing well in the financial
markets, which is good news for Boeing since it's the nation's
second-largest defense contractor, according to some financial
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp.
rose slightly, 6 cents, in trading Thursday to close at $28.44.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Standard &AMP; Poor's Aerospace and Defense Index rose
25.17 points Thursday to close at 1,210.85.
</P>
<P>
   Only five months ago, Boeing was saddled with a stock price in
the 30s and a slowdown in airplane deliveries as executives
struggled to settle a 40-day strike by engineers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also made great strides in improving its
once-troubled commercial airplanes division. In 1997, Boeing
attempted to boost production to record levels and created major
problems within its commercial operations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also managed to rebound from a more recent loss.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Boeing shares fell $2.25, or 4.55 percent, to
close at $47.25 after Boeing announced it would acquire aviation
data company Jeppesen Sanderson Inc. for $1.5 billion in cash. Some
observers worried about the price.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of review, investors appear more comfortable with
the purchase and with Boeing, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in Boeing's stock price came too late for some Boeing
employees this year. The vast majority of Boeing workers would have
received stock payouts if the company's average stock price had
traded at roughly $49 on June 30, under a special trust program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, employees will have another opportunity on
June 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial analysts say Boeing's stock performance could
continue, while adding the usual caveats about the unpredictability
of the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ragen MacKenzie's Jacobs has pegged Boeing shares with a
18-month to two-year price target between $68 and $82.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is also in the market with a continuing stock buyback
program, according to on financial analyst.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing offered its investors strong returns this week, the
company also broke through a symbolic barrier, according to Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting through the $50 dollar barrier was kind of a big
psychological hurdle for some investors,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>

LIBERTY FOLLOWS SCRIPT THAT'S TOO FAMILIAR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With 4 minutes 4 seconds to play in the opening game of the WNBA
finals Thursday night, the momentum and the whole history of the
league began to turn on its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after four years of fighting the legend that is the
Houston Comets, the only champions the league has ever had, the New
York Liberty seemed poised to bring Houston down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had climbed back within four points of the Comets in
the opener of the best-of-three series, the only game that will be
played in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the sellout crowd of 19,563 hoping for an upset,
Teresa Weatherspoon made two foul shots with 52.3 seconds remaining
to pull the Liberty to within 52-50. But history and talent were
just too much of a burden to overcome at the end, and the Comets
hung on for a 59-52 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The series resumes Saturday afternoon in Houston. If it does not
end then, a third and deciding game will be played there Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston's three-year reign, the WNBA championships have had
only one most valuable player: Cynthia Cooper. She played that way
again Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   With 26.4 seconds left in the game, Cooper drove through the
lane and banked in a layup, drawing a foul. She then made the free
throw to give Houston a 55-50 lead, and sealed the victory by
sinking two foul shots with 14.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips could not do it alone Thursday night for the
Liberty. She had 24 points and sparked the second-half comeback,
but no one else on the Liberty scored in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had 20 points, and Tina Thompson added 15. Sheryl Swoopes
also scored 12 for the Comets.  &QL;

INVENTOR'S CAR PROTECTOR ON IN A FLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Male car lovers may be willing to unfurl, tug
and adjust a traditional car cover over their whole car. But Jeremy
Hoenack, inspired by his wife, has taken a decidedly unmacho tack
with a lightweight and easily manageable car cover.
</P>
<P>
   The Smartcover is a top cover that uses soft, energy-absorbing
weights to allow the cover to ``fly'' across the car when thrown
and settle gracefully into place in seconds. It can keep a car
parked in full sun up to 80 degrees cooler inside, it keeps the
windshield and windows clean, it locks onto the car when the car
door is closed, and it doesn't take up a lot of space in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works really well,'' says Maria Hoenack, the woman Jeremy
Hoenack had in mind when he invented the Smartcover.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hoenack is a petite woman with a hereditary condition that
makes her arms shorter and smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hoenack particularly values the cover when she has her
7-month-old son with her. When they get back to the car after doing
an errand, it's much more comfortable inside for him, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Kaye, a Studio City business consultant, is among the
product's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in love with it. I liked it from the get-go, and it grows
on you,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I park outside under some trees. That gets my car filthy, and
it heats up in the summertime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Hoenack said the steering wheel of a car parked in the
sun can get as hot as 195 degrees. It's hard for a person to hold
his or her hand on a 155-degree surface for more than two or three
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you leave your car in the sun all day, it may get to 120
degrees even with the cover, but it won't get that searing heat,''
Hoenack said.
</P>
<P>
   The cover caught Kaye's eye because it doesn't cover the whole
car. She saw it at a carwash on the cashier's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe how simple it is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes less than a minute to put on and take off and Kaye put
the cooling factor to the test on a recent run of errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on every time I stopped, and what a difference it
makes,'' Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Hoenack may have found his niche. He's veering away from
the venues that would target mechanics and male car enthusiasts. He
thinks half-covers haven't sold because they were targeted at men.
</P>
<P>
   Smartcover is decidedly marketed to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to fool with the full cover,'' Hoenack said.
Putting on a full cover can be a workout that will leave you
sweating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenack came up with the Smartcover idea about three years ago.
It's one of a number of inspirations he says he has gotten about 3
a.m.

   ``Inventing has just sort of been my thing from the time I was a
kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenack owns Sound Trax Studios in Burbank and invented a
digital audiovisual editing system that allows film editors to edit
on a computer screen and add sound effects with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   He was working on a patent for another sound-related invention,
but decided to patent the car cover first as a practice run.
</P>
<P>
   After he filed the Smartcover patent, it was time to figure out
how to manufacture and market it. A car cover manufacturer wasn't
interested because a half-car cover it marketed had bombed. Hoenack
tried a company that makes folding windshield sun reflectors, but
they weren't positioned to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Hoenack remembered Jackson Ko, a man he met at a car
show who manufactured reflective materials in China. After being
sold on the idea, Ko started producing the Smartcover.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoenacks decided to market the cover themselves. They
contacted Hammacher-Schlemmer and the company put it a catalog
released June 19. The covers starting selling almost immediately,
Hoenack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have exceeded our expectations in every way,'' Hoenack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenack produced a demonstration video in his studio and put the
demo tape and the car covers at the Classic Car Wash in Northridge
and the Toluca Lake Car Wash in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Villareal, cashier at Toluca Lake Car Wash, says their
location has sold about 25 of them, with no returns. People see the
video while they wait for their carwash and buy the $39.95 cover.
Smartcovers are popular with people who park their cars at the
Metro Rail terminal, where they're in the sun all day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenack decided to get more exposure for the cover with a media
buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the conclusion that it would be a sin not to make a
TV spot, since we have all the resources right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-second commercials targeting women began airing this week
on The Food Channel, Game Show Network, Odyssey and Oxygen cable
networks.

LAZIO DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM BUSH TAX CUT PLAN

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio moved to distance himself from
Gov. George W. Bush's tax cut plan Thursday, offering his own
package of business and personal tax reductions that by his
campaign's calculation is nearly 40 percent smaller than the one
Bush has made a cornerstone of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's proposal for the use of a projected $4.4 trillion,
10-year surplus, which he outlined in a speech at the Chamber of
Commerce here, includes a call to allow taxpayers to deduct the
payroll tax from their federal income taxes, much the way state and
property taxes are now treated. His plan would affect the payroll
tax that finances the Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said that proposal, combined with a menu of tax cuts long
advocated by congressional Republicans _ like eliminating the
inheritance tax and the so-called marriage penalty _ would save the
average New York family about $3,000 a year in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed permitting parents to put aside up to $500,
free of tax, to pay for primary and secondary education in private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the surplus ultimately belongs to the American
people is not conservative or liberal, it's not even Republican or
Democrat _ it's just common sense,'' said Lazio, the Republican
candidate for Senate. ``And if I'm senator, New Yorkers will get to
keep more of what they earn. My opponent believes there's no room
in a $4.4 trillion surplus for meaningful tax relief for New York
families. I believe simple fairness demands that we give taxpayers
a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's speech came in a week in which Bush has found himself
defending the fiscal prudence of his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax
cut, in the face of attacks by Democrats and polling data
suggesting that the idea has not stirred much interest from voters.
And in New York, his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has
repeatedly sought to link Lazio to Republican tax cut proposals
that she has said are too broad and has described as a threat to
the nation's future prosperity. Lazio's response suggested some
concern in his campaign about that line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-minute speech by Lazio, of Suffolk County, signaled, as
well, a coming-to-life of a campaign that has been somewhat dormant
for much of the summer. One of Lazio's advisers said that he had
intentionally kept a low profile while campaigning in order to
raise money, give himself time to become acquainted with issues and
in the belief that he benefited from keeping attention off himself
and on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With Labor Day, the traditional start of the general election
campaign, less than 10 days away, Lazio is now moving into a new,
higher-profile phase of his campaign; Thursday's speech was the
first in what aides said would be a series of addresses intended to
flesh out his political portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to invoking an issue that Republicans have seized on
in election after election over the past two decades _ tax cuts _
Lazio Thursday seemed to be making a definite effort to move away
from Bush's tax cut plan, if not the Republican presidential
candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign press release put the cost of Lazio's tax cut at $776
billion over the next 10 years. ``By comparison,'' Lazio's campaign
said, ``George W. Bush's tax plan would cost $1.3 trillion over 10
years, and Al Gore's tax plan would cost around $500 billion over
10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lazio, in a news conference, was notably cool to Bush's tax
plan, which his opponent Clinton has repeatedly criticized as
excessive. ``I am comfortable with the plan that I have laid out
right now, in terms of raw size, the macro number,'' Lazio said.
``I'm going to keep my options open on what Gov. Bush's proposal is
until we see what kind of revenues come in next year. I just prefer
to make sure that we have a restrained approach that will allow a
pay-down of the debt, will allow us to invest in the prescription
benefit and will give us the ability to have some enhanced
investment in education at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers moved to tether Lazio to Bush's economic
policies. They asserted that his estimate of the cost of his tax
cut was grossly understated _ they put it at $1.24 trillion over 10
years _ and said it would hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Lazio offers New Yorkers yet another reckless
trillion-dollar tax plan that simply doesn't hold up,'' said Howard
Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign. ``The Republican tax
program would return us to the days of irresponsible budgets,
ballooning deficits, and high interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a far more modest plan of tax reductions
that would total $496 billion, her aides said Thursday. They would
include a reduction, rather than elimination, of the marriage
penalty and inheritance tax, and tax credits for such things as
college tuition. She said that the nation's surplus first should be
used to pay down the country's debt and to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The centerpiece, and most unusual aspect, of Lazio's plan was to
allow taxpayers to deduct the payroll tax from their federal income
taxes. Such proposals have been raised in Congress before, but
usually discarded, both because they would be hugely expensive and
would offer more of a benefit to wealthier taxpayers in
higher-income tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   The payroll tax affected, the one that finances the Social
Security fund, is 6.2 percent this year for people on the first
$76,200 of income; employers put in another 6.2 percent. Lazio said
his proposal would cost the government $300 billion; Clinton's
aides put the figure at closer to $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Lazio's tax-reduction program is made up of a number
of more familiar Republican initiatives. Lazio called for cutting
the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 15 percent, increasing
allowable IRA contributions to $5,000 from $2,000, and eliminating
part of the tax on Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio used his speech Thursday to offer his own response to what
has been a political complication for Republicans running for
office this year: the state of the economy. Calling the country's
financial health ``a wave of economic prosperity unrivaled in human
history,'' the congressman disputed the Democrats' claims of credit
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lazio attributed the nation's economic well-being to,
among other things, tax cuts initiated by President Ronald Reagan
and actions by the Federal Reserve. And he reiterated his
opposition to the economic program pushed through by President
Clinton early in his presidency, which raised taxes to reduce the
nation's deficit. The president has repeatedly invoked that
legislation as a turning point.

FORMER CHIEFS PLAYER CHARGED WITH WRITING BAD CHECKS TOTALING
$158,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE AND GLENN E. RICE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jackson County prosecutors on Thursday
charged former Kansas City Chiefs player Andre Rison with four
felonies for writing $158,000 worth of bad checks to a Georgia
jeweler.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Rison wrote the four checks between
June and December 1998 to pay for such things as a Rolex watch,
diamond jewelry and a $40,000 gold necklace with the word ``Dre'' _
Rison's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Each count is punishable by up to five years and a $5,000 fine.
He was charged in Jackson County because the checks were drawn on a
Jackson County bank and some of the merchandise was delivered to
this area.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Rison are the latest in a series of recent
legal troubles he has faced. A week before the Chiefs unexpectedly
released him last week, police in River Falls, Wis., where the
Chiefs hold their training camp, cited Rison for allegedly giving
false information after a bar fight.
</P>
<P>
   Rison also faces legal problems in Johnson County, Kan., where
he has criminal and civil trials scheduled in September involving
allegations of felony theft and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   After his release by the Chiefs, Rison, 33, signed a contract
with the Oakland Raiders, a team that played Thursday night against
the Seattle Seahawks in Oakland. Rison could not be reached for
comment. Raiders officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Tucker, a friend of Rison who is his contract adviser,
suggested that the charges were largely the result of a
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of players do is write checks, and they don't know
whether the account is closed or not. Andre probably didn't,''
Tucker said. ``He does silly stuff sometimes, because he doesn't
pay attention to things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any intent there,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said Rison probably did not
know of the bad-check charges. Warrants were issued only for
Missouri and Kansas to avoid costly extradition from California,
Beaird said. He said he expected Rison to surrender in Jackson
County and post $10,000 bond within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does not surrender in a reasonable time,'' he said, ``we
will expand the warrant'' to include California.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four checks Rison allegedly wrote to Elif Fine
Jewelry of Decatur, Ga., were on Jackson County accounts that had
been closed, according to court records. Before joining the Chiefs,
Rison had played for the NFL's Falcons in nearby Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Aydin, the Georgia jeweler who told police he took the
checks from Rison, could not be reached for comment. After failing
to collect on the debt, officials said, Aydin notified authorities
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said a representative from Elif had indicated that Rison
had agreed to make payments over a period of time. Tucker said he
didn't know the specifics of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to be some agreement with the jewelry people,''
Tucker said. ``Nobody can walk in there and write a check like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson County, a judge has entered a $200,000 civil judgment
against Rison in a case brought by one of his Leawood neighbors.
The neighbor said Rison had failed to repay money she lent him.
</P>
<P>
   An additional claim of fraud in the woman's lawsuit is to go to
trial Sept. 18 in Johnson County District Court, according to the
woman's attorney, Tom McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal charge of felony theft is also pending against Rison
in Johnson County, involving recording equipment he rented from an
Overland Park, Kan., business and allegedly never returned.
</P>
<P>
   That case is set for trial Sept. 25, although Rison's attorney
has filed a request to withdraw from that case. A hearing on that
request is set for Aug. 31.

SPORTS COLUMN: LASORDA HAS HIGHER CALLING
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS word to ``reprise'' in 11th graf)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  When he was managing for the O'Malley family, Tom Lasorda used to
preach that his blood was Dodgers blue. It was a great shtick that
earned him considerable television time in his early years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now Lasorda is talking red, white and blue, and his
perennial bluster is muted as he talks proudly about patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to sit at the head of the table and tell us,
`You ought to thank God you were born in the U.S.,''' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   He invokes the memory of his father, Sabatino, born in a little
town in the Abruzzi, the hardscrabble region to the east of Rome,
over toward the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father fought for Italy in World War I, and came over when
he was 21,'' Lasorda said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Not needing to footnote that Italy wound up on the other side in
World War II, Lasorda recalled how ``the Germans put all these guns
up in the hills in Tollo, where my father came from, 12 miles from
Pescara. The Americans came in and leveled the place.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lasorda family, then living in the Philadelphia area,
there were no ambiguities. They were Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell us in his broken English, `You may be called on
to serve your country. You may be called on to fight. You may be
called on to give up your life,''' Lasorda recalled. ``He said it
would be an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda calls himself fortunate that he never had to bleed for
his country. It is no sacrifice at all for him to manage the U.S.
baseball team in the Summer Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bigger than the World Series! Bigger than Major League
Baseball! Bigger than the Dodgers!'' shouts Lasorda, whose speech
demands to be defined by exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda will have no Garvey, no Fernando, no Dusty, but he
expects nothing less than a gold medal from these prospects and
journeymen. He will surely reprise the old gall and bluster he used
on his Dodgers in the 1980s, acting as if they were participating
in Grade B war movies.
</P>
<P>
   When Lasorda tried to replace Cpl. Jay Johnstone on defense
during a September game, Johnstone growled, ``Nuts to you, Tommy, I
ain't coming out,'' and bolted back to the outfield as Lasorda
chortled.
</P>
<P>
   When Pvt. Mickey Hatcher led cheers like a UCLA pompom girl,
Capt. Lasorda swelled with blue Dodger pride.
</P>
<P>
   And when the bureaucrats suspended one of his best men, Lasorda
rallied the troops. The other day, he recalled a pivotal moment,
when the future of the world _ or at least Chavez Ravine _ hung in
the balance.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how his best relief pitcher, Jay Howell, was
detected using pine tar, a substance that gives the ball an extra
(and illegitimate) spin, during the 1988 championship series
against the Mets. Howell was tossed out of the game and ultimately
busted for two more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my guys, `We're not gonna let the loss of one guy
determine this series,''' Lasorda recalled. ``I said, `We're all
gonna have to dig in.' That was when Hershiser closed for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Late the next night, Spc. Orel Hershiser, deceptively
bespectacled and mild-mannered, volunteered to come out of the
bullpen in the 12th inning, saving the Dodgers' stunning Game 4
victory, and sending them toward a world championship. Lasorda had
already nicknamed him Bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   He will surely have nicknames for his mix-and-match assortment
that will not have it easy in Sydney. He will try to drag
flashbacks from retreads like Pat Borders and a few others who have
had a taste of the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans, who won the first two gold medals, in Barcelona and
Atlanta, will be back. Japan may bring as many as eight players
from their two major leagues, including the hot young pitcher
Daisuke Matsuzaka of the Seibu Lions. And South Korea is closing
down its pro league the way the NH L did for the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you right now, we're not gonna go 6,000 miles to
lose,'' Lasorda said over the telephone, so emphatically that one
could envision his index finger jabbing the air.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an immigrant from the Abruzzi can appreciate the
links between nations.
</P>
<P>
   Like Looie Carnesecca, the ambassador of basketball from St.
John's University, Lasorda has gone back to his ancestral homeland
to teach his sport. The Italians have learned well, and are one of
the eight qualifying nations for these Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play Italy on Sept. 22,'' Lasorda said. ``Olympic Stadium!
What an honor! It's my birthday!''

OREGON FIRM NETS MOBY DISC MUSIC STORES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moby Disc, a store that sells used and new music,
has been swallowed by an Oregon online music retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Moby Disc's six Los Angeles-area locations will
bring Portland-based Djangos.com's family of stores to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Djangos' vision is to combine the best used-music retailers in
major metropolitan markets into one family and overlay that with
online technology, said Steve Wood, chairman and CEO of Djangos.
</P>
<P>
   Moby Disc's name will not change, nor will much else. Djangos
acquires unique stores with a good reputation and loyal customers.
Since it's not broken, Djangos won't try to fix it, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Djangos is about is taking the best used products and the
most unique stores available to you as a music enthusiast,'' Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
   The added benefit for customers will be Djangos' ability to make
more titles available. The acquisition of Moby Disc adds 70,000
units to the Djangos 1million-unit inventory.
</P>
<P>
   If a desired title is not available in the local Moby Disc
store, customers will soon be able to use Internet-connected
in-store kiosks to find that particular piece of music or format in
other Djangos stores. The music can be shipped to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   Music can also be ordered from home through the Djangos Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to manage a global inventory,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Djangos owns stores in Chicago, Portland and Seattle. The Moby
Disc acquisition is the company's entrance into the Los Angeles
market and is its largest acquisition to date. Djangos plans
another acquisition by year-end, Wood said, but he declined to name
the stores or locations.
</P>
<P>
   Moby Disc was founded in 1972 by Mark Ferjulian and Bob Say. The
company has stores in Canoga Park, Sherman Oaks, Pasadena, Santa
Monica, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with the acquisition, Djangos has named Ferjulian
vice president and Say general manager of Southern California
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right opportunity at the right time to move our
stores into the new century,'' Say said. ``It's an opportunity to
get hooked up with the Internet and still do what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Djangos is also working with MP3.com to provide streaming
digital versions of music purchases available through an ``instant
listening'' account on the Internet. The instant listening project
is set to get under way this fall, when MP3 finalizes its
agreements with the last of the Big Five record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Customers would then be able to take their favorite music with
them anywhere in the world, without having to carry it, Wood said.
