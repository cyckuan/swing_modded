<HEADLINE> Group Names Dangers To Press  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A rebel leader from Sierra Leone, the supreme
leader of Iran and the president of Yugoslavia head the list of
''10 Enemies of the Press'' from the Committee to Protect
Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Slobodan Milosevic,
and the others on the list ''use methods that range from outright
torture and murder to more subtle techniques aimed at keeping
uncomfortable truths from being told,'' said Ann Cooper, the
committee's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The annual list released Wednesday from the New York-based press
freedom group also includes the leaders of Cuba, China, and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh of Sierra Leone led the list. He is the leader of the
Revolutionary United Front, a rebel movement that the committee
accused of killing at least eight journalists during the country's
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He was new to the list, as was Khamenei, who was next on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said Khamenei has created a repressive atmosphere
for reformist newspapers, and that after a speech of his last
month, 16 newspapers were forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was on the list for the second consecutive year.
According to the committee, authorities in Yugoslavia have
''intensified their crackdown on the independent Serb media with an
almost daily barrage of attacks on press freedoms in the first few
months of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The other names on the list were:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jiang Zemin, president of China, who the committee alleges had
18 Chinese journalists in jail at the beginning of this year. Six
were convicted last year due to their use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   -- Zine al-Abdine Ben Ali, president of Tunisia, who according to
committee has ''brought Tunisia's press to its knees with
newspapers closures, the prosecution of reporters, economic
pressures against publications, and intimidation by security
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakstan. The committee
said Nazarbayev promised freedom of the press when the country
gained independence in 1991, but that the current ''stranglehold''
on information is much like that under Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fidel Castro, president of Cuba, accused of keeping four
independent journalists in jail for crimes such as
''dangerousness,'' for reporting stories critical of the Cuban
system.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jose Eduardo dos Santos, president of Angola, who has
''effectively made public mention'' of the rebel organization,
UNITA, or the ongoing war, a crime.
</P>
<P>
   -- Alberto K. Fujimori, president of Peru, described by the
committee as pooling all his resources to ''trashing'' a ''thriving
and vigorous'' press that existed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of Malaysia. He is accused by
committee of controlling most major media in the country for nearly
20 years. In 1999, he ''tightened the screws on his country's small
opposition press, following an election in which the opposition
made significant gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemin, Castro, Ben Ali, Fujimori, and Mohamad have appeared on
the list before.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Young Men Stress Family Time  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Younger men are placing a strong emphasis on
having a job schedule that allows for family time, according to a
survey by the Radcliffe Public Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found 82 percent of men ages 21 to 39 ranked having a
family-friendly work schedule as ''very important'' to them as a
component of their job, said study director Leslie Cintron.
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone survey of 1,008 men and women age 21 and up
was conducted Jan. 18 to Feb. 2 nationwide by Harris Interactive.
The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points, with
greater margins for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   The survey only looked at the attitudes of men and women at one
point in time, but researchers said they believed it had captured a
snapshot of attitudes that are in flux -- a younger generation of
men that is becoming more family-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that there has been a sea change in attitudes of
young men who report that they want to take a much greater role in
raising their children,'' Cintron said.
</P>
<P>
   Cintron said that focus groups conducted with Harvard students
unearthed similar results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young men were beginning to tell us a story that differed
remarkably from the one that is expected of men, young men as well
as old men. They were not willing to give up having family time for
a job, for a career.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say I think this is a very significant finding and one
that definitely requires further exploration. It was somewhat
surprising for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those surveyed were asked to rate how important seven
characteristics of a job were to them. They could pick more than
one characteristic as ''very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The responses were then broken down by age and sex groups.
</P>
<P>
   For younger men, in the 21-39 group, a family-friendly schedule
was picked most often as ''very important'' -- by 82 percent of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   For men, ages 40-64, a family-friendly schedule was only picked
by about two-thirds as ''very important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the older age groups, doing challenging work and having a
good relationship with co-workers were picked more often as ''very
important'' job characteristics.

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Democratic state Attorney General Mike Easley and
former Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot, a Republican, won their party
nominations for governor Tuesday in a race to succeed popular Gov. Jim Hunt.
Thirteen candidates in all jumped into the race when Hunt, a Democrat who served
four terms over the past 25 years, was barred by law from seeking another term.
In Indiana, conservative Rep. David McIntosh won the GOP nomination to challenge

Arkansas' first execution of a woman in more than 150 years. Christina Marie
Riggs, 28, was the fifth woman executed in the United States since the Supreme
Court lifted a ban on capital punishment in 1976. She had maintained throughout
that she wanted to die and her last words reflected her grief. ''There is no way
no words can express how sorry I am for taking the lives of my babies,'' she
said. ''Now I can be with my babies, as I always intended.''

Nuclear Pledge Called Inadequate

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A coalition of countries said Tuesday that a new

arsenals falls short of demands that they actually get rid of them. ''We stress
that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is an obligation and a priority
and not an ultimate goal,'' said a statement by Mexico, Ireland, South Africa,
Egypt, Sweden, New Zealand and Brazil. The statement was a response to a joint
position paper issued Monday in which the United States, Russia, China, France
and Britain pledged their ''unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of
complete elimination of nuclear disarmament.''

have done little to dissuade new-home buyers. Analysts said the figures pointed

<HEADLINE> Royals 8, Athletics 7, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Carlos Febles' RBI single capped a
three-run 10th inning and boosted Kansas City past the Oakland
Athletics 8-7 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen, who was 14-for-14 in career save chances,
was two outs away from tying the major league record for
consecutive saves starting a career. The record is 15 shared by
Robb Nen and Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   But Isringhausen (1-1) gave up a game-tying, two-run homer to
Mark Quinn. Then with two outs, Rey Sanchez singled and stole
second. After Johnny Damon was walked intentionally, Febles lined a
clean single into left-center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh walk-off win in 11 home victories for the
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada and Jeremy Giambi homered off Ricky Bottalico to
open the 10th inning and give the A's a 7-5 lead. Tejada went
3-for-4 with a single, double and three RBIS.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Rakers (1-0) got two outs for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Dye's league-leading 12th homer leading off the fourth
ignited a four-run rally for the Royals in the fourth that tied it
5-all.
</P>
<P>
   After Dye's 427-foot shot, Carlos Beltran doubled off Ron Mahay,
and Joe Randa got a single on a high popup that shortstop Tejada
lost in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Quinn and Rey Sanchez followed with RBI singles and Johnny
Damon, who homered leading off the Royals' first, hit a sacrifice
fly off reliever Luis Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   Olmedo Saenz homered off Miguel Batista leading off a five-run
second inning for the A's. After Matt Stairs walked, Ben Grieve
lined a single into center which Carlos Beltran let get past him
for an error. Stairs scored and Grieve wound up on third and scored
on Eric Chavez's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez reached on a single and Frank Menechino walked
and both scored on Tejada's double to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Batista, in his first start since joining Kansas City from
Montreal, gave up five runs and four hits in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mahay, in his first start since April 8, allowed five runs and
seven hits in 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Damon has led off a game with a home run nine times. ...
Commissioner Bud Selig will participate in pregame ceremonies
Sunday honoring David Glass, the new owner of the Royals. ...
Grieve's hit in the second was originally ruled a triple. But
official scorer Sid Bordman changed his mind two innings later and
made it a single and a two-base error, without an RBI. ... The A's
had an embarrassing lapse in the third when third baseman Chavez
and catcher Hernandez miscommunicated and let Mike Sweeney's high
pop foul drop to the ground beneath them. Hernandez was given an
error. But a moment later, second baseman Menechino made an
outstanding running catch of Sweeney's pop foul behind first.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 12, Expos 6  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeffrey Hammonds hit his second career grand slam
and Scott Karl made a respectable bid to stay in Colorado's
starting rotation as the Rockies beat the Montreal Expos 12-6
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansing, Brent Mayne and Tom Goodwin also homered for the
Rockies, who have hit 15 in their last four games. They had 17 in
their first 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   With right-hander Rolando Arrojo set to come off the disabled
list later this week, Karl (1-2) is fighting with Brian Bohanon to
remain in the Colorado rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 7-0 lead after three innings, Karl gave up four runs
and nine hits in six innings. The Rockies pounded Jeremy Powell
(0-2) for eight runs and nine hits in 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 0-3 with a 15.63 ERA in three career starts against
Colorado, created his own problems when he issued consecutive walks
to Larry Walker, Jeff Cirillo and Todd Helton with two outs in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds fell behind in the count 0-2, then hit a fastball an
estimated 428 feet to left-center field. His only other grand slam
came May 23, 1998, at Oakland while playing for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing hit a two-run homer in the second, and Goodwin added a
solo shot that just cleared the left-field wall in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal chipped away on RBI singles by Jose Vidro and Rondell
White in the fourth and fifth. Lee Stevens added an RBI double in
the sixth and scored on Wilton Guerrero's pinch-hit single to make
it 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado added four runs in the eighth highlighted by Mayne's
two-run homer, his first with the Rockies. Montreal's Trace
Coquillette hit his first career homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cirillo extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ...
Goodwin has three homers in 88 at-bats. He had three in 405 at-bats
all of last season. ... Montreal C Chris Widger, who hit two solo
homers Monday night, did not play Tuesday because of soreness
between his right thumb and index finger. ... Powell was called up
from Triple-A Ottawa on Tuesday. ... The Expos are 0-8 when
trailing after seven.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America Head Sounds Warning  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Myriad state laws to ensure privacy in the
financial services industry would lead to ''untenable''
infrastructures for banks and higher costs for consumers, Bank of
America chief Hugh McColl Jr. said Tuesday at a gathering of
business journalists.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans increasingly worry about how much of their personal
information is collected, stored and shared across the Internet,
McColl said legislators' search for security ought to be prudent
and restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ''The temptation to exploit consumers' privacy concerns for
political gain is great,'' said McColl, chairman and chief
executive of the country's biggest bank, which serves more than 30
million households and 2 million businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in the end, the public will not be served by rash,
ill-considered action.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl spoke at the 37th annual Society of American Business
Editors and Writers convention.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote speech later that evening, Time Warner vice
chairman and CNN founder Ted Turner used the meeting as a
soundboard for a rambling diatribe against nuclear weapons, saying
that a nuclear disaster would be ''very bad for business.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who started the Cable News Network 20 years ago next
month, spoke for 20 minutes about the dangers of nuclear weapons,
greenhouse gas emissions, and failure of the world's governments to
clean up nuclear wastes and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''How does this affect business editors?'' he summed up. ''Well,
let me tell you, brothers and sisters, if there is a nuclear
accident or war it will be very bad for business.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl, who used his lunch speech on banking technology to
outline his company's concerns about online privacy regulation,
said consumers have somewhat divergent desires from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make a new global community out of the Internet and
World Wide Web, but we worry about who will come to know us in this
new community -- and what they will do with their knowledge,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also worries about states passing individual
privacy laws that differ from federal requirements, McColl said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administrative structures we would have to erect to serve
customers across the country with different privacy rules in every
state would be untenbable,'' he said. ''And, of course, at the end
of the day, customers would bear the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of customer data has become a hotly debated topic in
Congress and among state legislatures. In January, Chase Manhattan
agreed to stop sharing customer information after consumer
complaints prompted New York officials to file a lawsuit over the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress approved legislation allowing banks,
insurance companies and brokerages to get involved in each other's
business.
</P>
<P>
   The law also gave consumers the right to block financial
companies from providing their personal data to outside firms, such
as telemarketers. But companies can share customers' data with
affiliated financial companies under the same corporate roof.
</P>
<P>
   That ability is critical to the industry's success, he said,
advocating an ''opt-out'' system in which consumers must declare
they don't want their data shared among a company's affiliates over
an ''opt-in'' system where people consent to such sharing.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, 99.8 percent of Bank of America's
customers have decided to allow free access to their information
across the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, 64, sidestepped a question about when he plans to retire
and declined to express his preference between Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Vice President Al Gore about which ought to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one piece of privacy we got left, isn't it?'' McColl
quipped.

<HEADLINE> 'Father of Microcredit' Worried  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN ALT POWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For nearly a quarter of a century, Muhammad
Yunus of Bangladesh has been the champion of ''microcredit,'' tiny
loans that have helped thousands of impoverished families start
small businesses and improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's increasingly worried that the world's poor -- some
1.5 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day -- could be
set back even further if they are left out of the computer
revolution that is changing how the world works.
</P>
<P>
   ''Computers and the Internet are creating the New Economy,'' he
said in an interview Tuesday during a pause in a U.S. speaking
tour. ''This same information technology can bring unprecedented
opportunities to the poorest person in the world. E-education.
E-commerce. E-health care. E-jobs. Or it can leave that person
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to make sure that the poor are included, Yunus is urging
governments, academics and aid groups to unite to create an
international center that would try to figure out how to get
computers -- and the resources they can carry -- to the developing
countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Yunus sees it as an uphill battle, but he is not one to shrink
from challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Yunus, who earned a Ph.D. in economists from Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn., first got into the business of
fighting poverty during a 1974 famine in his homeland Bangladesh,
one of the poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''There I was, teaching elegant theories of economics at the
university, and I'd come out of the classroom and see people dying
of hunger,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly discovered that just a tiny loan could make a huge
difference in a poor person's ability to survive. His first loan,
he recalled, was $27 from his own pocket to a woman who made bamboo
furniture, which she sold to support herself and her family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he founded the Grameen Bank to make loans to poor
Bangladeshis that mainstream institutions considered too risky for
credit. Since then the Grameen has loaned more than $3 billion to
some 2.4 million borrowers, with most loans averaging between $75
and $200. And there are almost no defaults on the repayments.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of his ''customers'' are women, and they
typically start with a loan of just $75. If they prove they can
handle credit by paying the money back on time, they can borrow
more.
</P>
<P>
   He says that a third of Grameen borrowers ''have passed over the
poverty line'' in Bangladesh, where per capita income among the
nation's 130 million people is just $300 a year. They've used the
funds not only to create cottage industries and expand their
farming output but also to repair their houses and send their
children to universities.
</P>
<P>
   Yunus, known to many as ''the father of microcredit,'' has
worked hard to spread the idea. There are now microcredit banks in
at least 40 developing countries, from the Philippines to Vietnam,
Uganda, China and Mexico. There are even Grameen-style lending
programs in New York City and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Yunus, who is 59, has been using his bank's
credit to underwrite the introduction of modern technology to
Bangladesh's rural villages.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks fondly of his ''telephone ladies,'' the 1,400 village
women who have borrowed about $500 each from the bank to lease
Grameen-provided mobile phones. Other villagers then pay the
telephone ladies to make calls.
</P>
<P>
   Yunus said that some of his telephone ladies earn as much in a
month as the average Bangladeshi does in a year.
</P>
<P>
   He's also setting up cyber kiosks -- ''the Bangladesh equivalent
of the cyber cafe'' -- where villagers can, for a small fee, log on
and surf the Internet or send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But Yunus believes that more has to be done to bring the
Internet and its services to the poor of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be especially helpful,'' he said, ''if there was a
computer-like device available for a really low price, like $20 or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he's working with the Hewlett-Packard Co. to develop
an electronic health care system; he's working with the Nippon
Electric Co. to create and online educational system that would
provide ''knowledge on demand'' for whole families; he's working
with media experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
seek voice-operated systems that would be accessible to the world's
illiterate people.
</P>
<P>
   He's excited about the possibilities: ''Think of a poor village
woman. She's down, she's depressed. But maybe she can talk to the
computer and it will talk back. It will be a friend, a philosopher,
a business consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Yunus believes that information technology will
help create a level playing field so the poor can join in the
fruits of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is an empowering thing,'' he said. ''It's now
coming to businesses. Next, we hope, it will come to the people.''

<HEADLINE> Bestfoods Nixes Unilever Bid  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. buying spree by international consumer
products conglomerate Unilever has hit a snag, with Bestfoods'
rejection of an $18.4 billion takeover offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, the maker of such household food products as Skippy
peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said Tuesday its board had
unanimously rejected the $66 a share bid.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, whose brands include Lipton teas, Vaseline and
Pepsodent toothpaste, agreed last month to purchase Vermont gourmet
ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's for around $326 million and diet
foods company Slim Fast Foods for $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's offer for Bestfoods represented a 31 percent premium over
the Englewood Cliffs, N.J.-based company's closing price of $50.56\
in trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bestfoods said its board had determined the offer
was ''financially inadequate and not in the best interests'' of the
company and its shareholders ''given Bestfoods' successful business
strategies and growth prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement late Tuesday, Unilever said it ''is
disappointed with Bestfoods' response and their unwillingness to
discuss with Unilever any aspect of its proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unilever believes that Bestfoods should reconsider its
proposal and remains available for constructive dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever officials did not immediately return messages left at
their London headquarters Tuesday. The company also has
headquarters in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods initially learned of Unilever's interest in acquiring
the company April 20, according to the Bestfoods' statement. At the
time, Unilever offered between $61 and $64 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods' officials agreed to study the proposal and said its
board would vote at a special meeting Tuesday. Unilever increased
the offer at the last minute but was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from Bestfoods' chairman and chief executive C.R.
Shoemate to Unilever's chairmen Niall FitzGerald and Antony
Burgmans, Shoemate stated; ''We view your interest in acquiring
Bestfoods as validation of Bestfoods' global strategy in the
consumer food industry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Shoemate wrote that Bestfoods would no longer consider
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever had 1999 sales of $43.7 billion. Under a reorganization
plan announced in February, Unilever said it plans to slash 25,000
jobs over five years as it tries to reverse a slump in profits and
its share price.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods reported 1999 sales of $8.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Binghamton University expels one, suspends one in attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- One student was expelled and another was
suspended from Binghamton University following an assault that
later ignited protests of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas W. Richetti, 19, of Waverly was expelled and Chad
Scott, 18, of Walton suspended for two years. Scott will not be
eligible for reinstatement until fall 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A third student, Christopher M. Taylor, 20, of Seaford was
cleared. All three were members of the BU wrestling team.
</P>
<P>
   Richetti and Scott also were ordered to pay for medical claims
not covered by victim John E. Lee's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   School officials also have called for a separate investigation
into the university's wrestling program and the FBI has begun its
own investigation into whether the fight may have violated federal
civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 27 assault outside a dorm left Lee with a fractured
skull and roused ethnic tensions on campus. The three suspects, all
of whom are white, were arrested March 3 and ordered off the campus
March 6 pending the administrative review.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American students said the attack was racially motivated
and called for apologies from school officials and more recognition
on campus. As many as 200 students from as far away as Washington,
D.C., protested on campus last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Ronnie Han, a Korean-American from Queens who has
followed the case closely, said Monday night he accepted the
university's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's maybe not quick, but at least they came up with
something. I understand that they cannot move too quickly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The university's three-member disciplinary board of school
administrators ruled Richetti violated the university's rules of
student conduct, specifically two counts each of causing injury to
another person; striking, shoving, or kicking another person; and
harassing conduct that limits or denies equal treatment of another
person ''because of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion,
age, disability, veteran status, marital status, national origin or
ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
   The board found Scott guilty of one count each of the same
offenses. The two can appeal to a university hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   They still face a separate criminal prosecution by the Broome
County District Attorney's Office, which has charged them with
second-degree gang assault, a felony.

<HEADLINE> SMU Reinstates Two Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Two Southern Methodist players were reinstated to
the team Tuesday as the school concluded its investigation into
their actions at a hotel party during the Western Athletic
Conference tournament in March.
</P>
<P>
   The two players -- Jeryl Sasser and Renaldo Bratton -- were
accused of inappropriately touching an SMU cheerleader March 10 at
a hotel in Fresno Calif. The two players were questioned by Fresno
police, but no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser and Bratton, both junior guards, had been suspended from
the team since March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser has scheduled a news conference for Wednesday, when he is
expected to declare for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   The players and a group of cheerleaders were in the players'
hotel room drinking after SMU lost to Hawaii, according to a police
report.
</P>
<P>
   The police report also said Sasser and Bratton denied touching
the cheerleader inappropriately. Several players and cheerleaders
said they had been drinking, but denied the woman had been
assaulted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine students were disciplined by the school for their
involvement in the incident with punishment ranging from judicial
reprimand, disciplinary probation and/or mandatory referral to
SMU's Center for Alcohol Education, according to a statement from
the school.

<HEADLINE> Genesee Brewing Buyout Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- The owner of Genesee Brewing Co., which
has made beer in Rochester since 1878, has canceled an agreement to
sell the nation's fifth-largest brewery to a New York investment
company.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee Corp. had struck a deal in December with Platinum
Holdings, owner of City Brewing Co. in La Crosse, Wis. But ''we
believe that the interests of our shareholders will be better
served by terminating the agreement,'' chief executive Tom Hubbard
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee, which also operates food processing, real estate and
equipment leasing businesses, said it ended the purchase deal
because unspecified terms weren't met. It is exploring alternatives
for its brewery subsidiary, including a management-led buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee produces 1.6 million barrels of beer and ale a year and
had revenues of $103.3 million in the 1998-99 fiscal year. Its
brands include a line of regional beers -- Genesee Beer, Genny Light
and Genny Cream Ale -- as well as high-end specialty beers such as
J.W. Dundee Honey Brown Lager and Michael Shea's Irish Amber.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-sized breweries have been battling for survival in a
cutthroat market dominated by Anheuser-Busch Cos., Miller Brewing
Co. and Adolph Coors Co., which account for more than 80 percent of
domestic beer sales. In recent years, small craft and specialty
brewers, plus imported brands from Canada, also have plundered
Genesee's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Platinum Holdings bought the former G. Heileman Brewing Co. in
La Crosse, Wis., from Stroh Brewery Co. for $10.5 million last
summer, then started City Brewing Co., a privately owned company
whose brands include La Crosse Lager and City Lager.
</P>
<P>
   The Genesee buyout was to have been completed by mid-March.
Under the deal, Genesee Brewing would continue operating here under
a new name, possibly City Brewing-Genesee, and with most of its 470
workers retaining their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee said it has saved about $8 million after a turnaround
program it started last summer. In December, it reintroduced its 12
Horse Ale brand and is aiming to reinvigorate its Genesee line with
promotional campaigns during the peak summer seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Wehle family owned a controlling interest in the voting
stock of Genesee Corp., a publicly traded company, for nearly 70
years. John Wehle Jr., who had succeeded his father and grandfather
as chief executive, died of lung cancer March 10 at age 53. He was
replaced by Hubbard, who had been appointed the company's president
last June.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to complete state swing  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton was kicking off
a two-day foray across northern New York today that at its end will
mean she has visited all 62 of New York's counties in her 10 months
on the Senate campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope noted Tuesday that
was not accomplished by Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer until late
last year, a full year after he defeated Republican incumbent
Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton is in the process of redefining New York state
politics, throwing traditional formulas out the window with her
relentless attention to counties that heretofore have been
ignored,'' Hope said. ''Clearly, upstate New York will be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hope said the first lady's visit to all 62 counties was
not aimed at helping her overcome charges that she is a
carpetbagger, aides to Senate rival Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pressed
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton can travel to as many counties, as many times as
she wants,'' Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said
Tuesday. ''It will not change the fact that she's never lived in
New York, never worked in New York and she has absolutely no
connection to New York. There's only one real New Yorker in this
race, Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton moved to the suburbs north of New York City in January.
She planned stops today in Washington, Hamilton and Franklin
counties.
</P>
<P>
   While the first lady was preparing Tuesday for her trip,
Teitelbaum tapped a veteran Republican operative to bolster the
mayor's upstate campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor, who learned last week that he has
prostate cancer, has been criticized by some fellow Republicans for
not spending enough time in traditionally more conservative upstate
New York while the first lady has been crisscrossing what is
expected to be a major electoral battleground this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows this state like the back of his hand,'' Teitelbaum
said as he announced that state GOP executive director Brendan
Quinn will become director of statewide field operations for the
Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. George Pataki continued to brush off questions
about whether he would take up the GOP Senate banner if the mayor
drops out of the race. ''I believe he will continue to run,''
Pataki said. Beyond that, the governor said, ''I'm not going to
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Pataki is the top choice among
Republican voters to take on Clinton if Giuliani drops out of the
race. The mayor said he will make his decision before the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the campaign trail, aides to Giuliani were working
on setting up a meeting for later this week between the mayor and
state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long. The two have been
at odds over the mayor's refusal to come out for a ban on what
critics call ''late-term abortion'' and his strong ties to the
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, with Long's encouragement, former U.S. Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi announced he would seek the nominations of the
Conservative, Right to Life and Independence parties. A DioGuardi
candidacy could drain conservative votes away from the mayor, a
liability in a close race. Polls show the race is close.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Long said that ''at this stage of the game'' he did
not see Giuliani being the Conservative Party's candidate and
believed the nomination would go to DioGuardi. But Long cautioned
that could change before the party's June 3 state convention.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani said he would court the Conservative Party,
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady would
ask the Liberal Party for its support although party boss Raymond
Harding is one of Giuliani's top political advisers. Both Giuliani
and Clinton are scheduled to meet with the Liberal Party's policy
committee Saturday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count the votes they receive on third-party ballot lines, a factor
in close races. In New York, no Republican has won statewide office
since 1974 without the Conservative Party line. Conversely, no
Democrat has been elected U.S. senator or governor without the
Liberal Party line since the party's founding in 1944.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, legislative leaders make deal on debt reform  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki and state legislative
leaders say their agreement on New York's borrowing practices means
the Legislature can adopt a $77.5 billion state budget that has
been delayed for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal reached by Pataki, Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, $3 billion would be set
aside in ''rainy day'' reserves, including tripling the debt
reserve fund from $250 million to $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers would also pass a bill limiting how much debt the
state can take on. The borrowing cap of new debt would be set at 4
percent of the state's personal income. A cap on how much the state
could pay for debt service would be established at 5 percent of all
funds.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which currently does not have such caps, now borrows
at 6 percent of its personal income and pays 5 percent of all funds
for debt service. The 4 percent cap would be phased in over the
next 10 years, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would be retroactive to April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an excellent budget,'' said Pataki, who had been
pushing for debt reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also agreed on a $3.8 billion transportation bond
act, which Pataki said would be subject to the new borrowing
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bruno and Silver, the starting date for the state's
prescription drug program for senior citizens, would be pushed back
to Jan. 1, 2001. Legislators had initially settled on an Oct. 1
starting date for the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage
(EPIC) program.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had originally called for adoption of a state
constitutional amendment that would limit how much the state could
borrow. Silver and Bruno said they agreed to that two weeks ago,
but thanks to what Bruno called an honest misunderstanding, Pataki
said he also thought the legislative leaders pledged at the same
time to pass a law establishing the same caps while a
constitutional amendment was moving toward passage.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest a constitutional amendment could be in place would
be November 2001 while Pataki argued that the state should improve
its borrowing practices sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Tuesday that in the two weeks since -- which included
a vacation by lawmakers for the Passover-Easter holiday --
legislative staffers and those for Pataki's Budget Division
approached Wall Street bond rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''They indicated something that was more immediate would be more
significant to raising the rating of bonds in New York state,''
Silver said. ''After that information was made available to the
leaders by the staff, we said, 'Let's do something that's more
immediate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he hopes the borrowing changes will ''warrant a
significant upgrade in the bond rating of New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has about $37 billion in accumulated debt and its bond
rating is the lowest in the country or near to it. A bond upgrade
would save the state millions of dollars in lower interest costs
when it borrows money.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Bruno said a constitutional amendment instituting the
debt reform steps is still possible. Silver sounded less hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders said they hoped final
budget adoption could come late this week. This is the 16th
straight year the budget will be adopted after the April 1 start to
the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Silver said it has not been a bad budget-adoption
process. Last year's budget wasn't put into place until Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it,'' Silver said. ''We did it quicker than we usually
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although bills are still being printed and there is still room
open for discussion, Bruno said this budget agreement won't fall
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now a clear understanding as to what we've agreed on
and I don't believe there is any question,'' he said. ''There isn't
any issue, really, that's a deal breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal for homeowners to receive their tax rebate
checks directly from the state instead of having reductions
credited to their school taxes by districts under the ''STAR''
property was defeated in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Critics say Park Place's casino deal could take years  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Critics of a proposal by the world's largest
gambling company to build a casino for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe
at a Catskill resort say it could take years before the casino
becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting tribe members and local officials said Tuesday that
Park Place Entertainment's deal with Kutsher's Resort Hotel and
Country Club would have to go through lengthy federal review
proceedings before any actual work could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''They still have to get approval from the community, and the
federal application will start from Day One,'' said former Chief
Phil Tarbell. ''I don't see any possible way they're going to
shortcut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal reached Monday, Park Place acquired the option to
purchase the 1,400-acre Kutsher property and entered a definitive
agreement to buy 50 acres of land that would be transferred in
trust to the Tribal Council.
</P>
<P>
   On that 50-acre slice, Park Place would be expected to build a
casino for the Mohawks and operate it for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawks had been linked for about five years with Catskill
Development Corp., a firm that acquired a 30-acre parcel near
Monticello Raceway and in April received federal approval to put
the land in a trust. That step is necessary for the Mohawks to use
non-reservation land for a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have accused Park Place of trying to derail plans for
any casino in the Catskills to avoid competition for the casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J. A Sullivan County casino would be about 75
miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Tarbell and 28 other dissenting Mohawks filed a $12 billion
class-action lawsuit last week against Park Place, its chief
executive Arthur Goldberg and chief counsel Clive Cummis. The suit
accused Park Place of interfering with the tribe's earlier deal
with the Catskill Development.
</P>
<P>
   Tarbell, who serves on the board of the tribe's Gaming
Authority, said as far as board members were concerned, the tribe's
original agreement with Catskill Development is ''still in the
works, still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Tribal Council said the agreement with
Park Place signed April 14 included a $3 million payment to the
tribe and exclusive rights to develop and manage future Mohawk
casinos in the state. But the deal did not include the Kutsher
property.
</P>
<P>
   Rowena General said a concrete location was not specified in
that agreement and that the council is ''still under discussions''
with both Catskills Development and Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too preliminary to release any information at this
point,'' General said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for Catskills Development, declined to
comment on the status of Catskill Development's deal with the
Mohawks in light of the Tribal Council's new agreement with Park
Place. But he added that the company is ''exploring all our
options'' for developing a casino on the raceway site.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place officials did not return a telephone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Since federal approval was granted only for the raceway
property, any new agreement on land outside that land would have to
go through a separate federal review, said Stephanie Hanna, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Interior.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said there is ''no way to know'' how long the department
would take to review a new application.
</P>
<P>
   Such a process would take anywhere between three to five years,
said Raymond Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature.
In that period, the ''legislative climate in Albany and Washington
could be dramatically changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no guarantee that we could do this again,'' Pomeroy
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added the Monticello Raceway has the overwhelming support of
the local hotel industry. Shifting the casino construction to the
Kutsher land would generate less support because the hotel on that
property would have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy said he has cautioned the Mohawks that the county would
be ''reviewing with other tribes'' if the final casino location is
not on the raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The site proposed Monday, in the Town of Thompson, has been in
the Kutsher family for nearly 100 years and was a focal point of
the Catskills' heyday as an entertainment destination.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place, owner of 28 casinos including Caesar's Palace and
Bally's, plans a 160,000-square-foot casino with up to 2,000 guest
rooms. It would also include several gourmet and themed
restaurants, 50,000 square feet of retail space, up to 100,000
square feet of convention and meeting space, a 1,500-seat theater
and a championship golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson Supervisor Anthony Cellini said the new deal is
unfair for residents who have waited for nearly five years to get
approval for the Monticello Raceway project.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair to the residents, to put them on the roller
coaster ride they've already been through,'' Cellini said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who favors a casino in the region, said
things are ''very confusing'' in light of the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need clarifications before we can take any further steps at
this point,'' Pataki said. ''The entire federal process will have
to be done over again. That's what appears to be the case.''

brewers, plus imported brands from Canada, also have plundered
Genesee's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Platinum Holdings bought the former G. Heileman Brewing Co. in
La Crosse, Wis., from Stroh Brewery Co. for $10.5 million last
summer, then started City Brewing Co., a privately owned company
whose brands include La Crosse Lager and City Lager.
</P>
<P>
   The Genesee buyout was to have been completed by mid-March.
Under the deal, Genesee Brewing would continue operating here under
a new name, possibly City Brewing-Genesee, and with most of its 470
workers retaining their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee said it has saved about $8 million after a turnaround
program it started last summer. In December, it reintroduced its 12
Horse Ale brand and is aiming to reinvigorate its Genesee line with
promotional campaigns during the peak summer seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Wehle family owned a controlling interest in the voting
stock of Genesee Corp., a publicly traded company, for nearly 70
years. John Wehle Jr., who had succeeded his father and grandfather
as chief executive, died of lung cancer March 10 at age 53. He was
replaced by Hubbard, who had been appointed the company's president
last June.

<HEADLINE> NYSEG files complaint over wholesale market  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILDERLAND, N.Y. (AP) -- A power utility has asked federal
regulators to help stabilize prices on New York's new wholesale
electricity market.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Electric &AMP; Gas Corp. has filed a federal petition
critical of the New York Independent System Operator, which was
launched in November to monitor the state's electricity system. The
utility claims software and design problems have led to dramatic
price fluctuations on wholesale electricity sold through the ISO.
</P>
<P>
   Those higher wholesale costs cannot be passed along to consumers
buying power through regulated utilities.
</P>
<P>
   NYSEG president and chief operating officer Michael German said
the ISO's problems ''could strangle the nascent competitive retail
electricity market in New York state.'' The utility recently asked
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to correct these
''start-up'' problems before electricity demand peaks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ISO last year replaced the utility-operated New York Power
Pool in watching over the state's power grid. The ISO took on the
power pool's role, along with additional duties of administering
the wholesale market adopted as part of electricity deregulation in
New York state
</P>
<P>
   The ISO is run from the pool's old headquarters in the Albany
suburb of Guilderland.
</P>
<P>
   The utility hopes the FERC can put a temporary cap on wholesale
prices. German said the utility is seeking the same sort of action
from the FERC that the agency has taken to protect evolving
competitive power markets in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ISO spokesman Ken Clapp said he could not address the Binghamton
utility's complaint while a response for federal regulators is
being drafted. Clapp said there were some ''growing pains'' at the
ISO as the complicated venture started out. But he said the ISO was
well prepared for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   NYSEG is not the only utility with concerns about ISO pricing.
Niagara Mohawk spokesman Gerald Rockower said some ISO charges seem
to be out of sync with the market. He said Niagara Mohawk could
possibly seek refunds if the ISO does not address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are right now looking at this as a start-up problem that
will be overcome,'' Rockower said.

<HEADLINE> Convicted cop-killer freed five months ago on parole is arrested  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- After serving 25 years in prison, a
convicted cop-killer who was freed in December, has been taken into
custody for violating parole.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Victory, 59, who was convicted in 1970 along with another
man of murdering New York City Police Officer John Varecha, was
apprehended April 7 in a Syracuse establishment where alcohol is
served and sent to the Onondaga County Justice Center, Division of
Parole spokesman Thomas Grant said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Victory had a preliminary hearing April 26 at the jail, and
probable cause was found, Grant said. A final hearing was being
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who called
Victory's release a ''disgrace'' when it was announced, was not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ''Albert Victory is an individual who should never have been
paroled,'' Safir, who wants New York to abolish parole, said. ''The
fact that he's violated his parole underscores that he should never
have been let back out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory, who had been serving a sentence of 25 years to life,
left Attica state prison in Wyoming County a free man in December
and went to live in Utica. Conditions of his release were strict.
He could not consume alcohol, could not travel outside Otsego and
Oneida counties, had to follow a 9 p.m.-7 a.m. curfew, and had to
be under electronic monitoring by parole officers.
</P>
<P>
   A tangled web of bureaucratic and legal rulings had preceded
Victory's release.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, a state Parole Board said Victory had earned
it. But two months later the board reversed itself and rescinded
his parole, saying that ''new information'' had come to light in
the case. The board said it had been unaware when granting him
freedom that Victory had escaped in 1978 and spent three years on
the lam before being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Victory's lawyers countered that the board was well aware of
Victory's escape and that it rescinded his parole on flimsy grounds
after Gov. George Pataki's office complained.
</P>
<P>
   Victory and another prisoner bribed guards to let him meet his
girlfriend in a hotel room while the guards drank in the hotel bar,
and when the guards returned to take him back into custody, Victory
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Acting state Supreme Court Justice Mark Dadd ruled Dec. 15 that
the board had erred by taking back its decision to free Victory,
and he ordered Victory's release.
</P>
<P>
   Dadd found that the parole files in Victory's case included
''many references'' to the 1978 escape and ruled parole officials
could not reopen the matter based on ''new information.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's appeal of Dadd's ruling is still before the
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse students will track bombing trial for victims' families  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Syracuse University is forever linked to
the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. Now, the university is providing a
link for the victims' families so they can follow the murder trial
of the accused bombers on a special web site.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Syracuse University law students will provide daily
summaries and explanations to the victims' families and relatives
as part of a project funded by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea was the families needed better access to the
information that was going to be coming out at the trial than they
would get just through the general media,'' Andrew Greenberg, the
project's associate director, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, most of them are not going to be there. There was
no other resource for the families to get the detailed information
they want,'' said Greenberg, adding that project is unprecedented
but could open the way for future coverage of transnational trials.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, Libyan nationals Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah go on trial in a Scottish court
holding session in The Hague. The two are accused of murder,
conspiracy to commit murder and violations of international safety
laws in the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The 270 people killed in the bombing represented 21 nations.
Among the dead were 35 students studying overseas under a Syracuse
University program.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Syracuse has maintained a close association with
the victims' families. The university started a scholarship program
in honor of the Lockerbie victims and built a memorial wall on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the close relationship with the families that prompted
the U.S. Justice Department to ask Syracuse to set up the web site,
said Donna Arzt, director of the university's Center for Global Law
and Practice and the project director. The justice department
provided a $100,000 grant to help create the site, called the
Lockerbie Trial Families Project.
</P>
<P>
   Though a university-created web site with information on the air
tragedy is available to the public, the comprehensive trial
coverage will be exclusively for the families, who were issued
special passwords by the justice department to gain access to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an intranet site rather than an Internet site,'' said
Arzt, who is attending the first two weeks of the trial. A total of
about 700 victims' relatives worldwide will have access to the
family site, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The justice department arranged with the Scottish court for
daily transcripts, which will be unofficial and uncorrected. A
dozen law school students, with the assistance of a handful of
professors, will process the transcripts and post them on the web
site, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse will receive the transcripts around 11 a.m. every day,
when the court is ending at 5 p.m. in the Netherlands. Greenberg
said the goal is to get a summary written and posted within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse group also will provide explanations of legal
procedures and legal language.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to be able to understand why certain information is
coming out, and why it's coming out in certain forms, and why
certain information is not coming forth,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   An interactive component will allow families to ask questions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public site has been up since November and usage has been
growing steadily. In March, there were 10,000 hits by 445
individuals, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Families of U.S. victims also can view the trial on closed
circuit television at four special sites around the country. The
video will be shown on a tape-delay basis.

<HEADLINE> Commission: Hungary trips did not violate ethics laws  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The funding of Gov. George Pataki's trips to
Hungary in 1995 and 1996 did not violate state ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   But the trips have prompted a change in how the state Ethics
Commission will regard such corporate-sponsored forays in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The state Ethics Commission said Tuesday that funding for the
trip by such corporate entities as Philip Morris, Pfizer and
PepsiCo raises ''ethical concerns'' for the group that paid for
Pataki's trip. Those companies either do business with the state or
are regulated by New York.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said it will alter the way it regards the
propriety of future trips by statewide elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission also said it found no wrongdoing by Pataki or
those close to him in arranging and executing the two trips to the
governor's ancestral homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we have said all along, what we did was right and proper,''
Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Tuesday. ''The commission has
now clarified that.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said Pataki's office sought and received clearance for
both trips with the Ethics Commission and otherwise ''played by the
rules.'' Those guidelines were established when travel costs for a
trip to Japan in 1991 by former Gov. Mario Cuomo were paid for by
the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Pataki's case, the travel costs and other expenses were paid
by the Hungarian American Chamber of Commerce (HACC).
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission's determination, close Pataki
adviser Charles Gargano approached the HACC asking whether it
wanted to sponsor Pataki's trip in 1995. In 1996, Pataki himself
asked the group whether it wanted to sponsor a return trip of the
governor to participate in ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary
of the 1956 Hungarian uprising against the Soviet Union, according
to the Ethics Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Following both requests, the HACC solicited contributions from
corporations to pay for the trips. In 1995, sponsors included
Philip Morris ($10,000), ATT Hungary ($10,000), Pfizer ($5,000) and
PepsiCo ($5,000). The next year, Philip Morris contributed $20,000,
Bristol-Myers Squibb $10,000 and price Waterhouse $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics Commission executive director Donald Berens Jr. noted
that the commission approved the trips after determining that the
Hungarian American Chamber of Commerce did not have official
business before Pataki or his administration. But Berens said the
commission should have requested the list of companies who were
solicited by the chamber of commerce to underwrite the trip to
determine if they were ''disqualified'' by their business before
the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Berens said the commission will demand to know
whether the group organizing trips will be soliciting money from
others and for the names of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The ''ethical concerns'' raised by the Pataki trips was in the
Hungarian American Chamber of Commerce's solicitation of companies
to help pay for them, Berens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A corporation may respond to the solicitation in the hope of
currying favor with the state and thereby advancing its own private
interests,'' Berens said. ''Whatever the corporation's motives, its
sponsorship of a trip in such circumstances may create an
appearance of impropriety and adversely affect public confidence in
the integrity of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Berens said there is no evidence that the companies paying for
the Hungary trips got special access to Pataki or that the governor
or his inner circle knew the Hungarian American Chamber of Commerce
was soliciting money from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's determination came in response to a challenge
to the funding of the Hungary trips by the New York Public Interest
Research Group, Common Cause New York and the League of Women
Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group said
that accepting corporate money via the Hungarian American Chamber
of Commerce showed how ''ethically tone deaf'' the administration
was in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like the Ford Foundation called up the administration
and said, 'We're holding this conference in Budapest. Please
come,''' Horner said. 'This is something the administration thought
up and it solicited the Hungarian-American Foundation to pay for
part of the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Horner said the investigation also shows how ''weak and
ineffective'' the state's ethics laws are and he renewed his
group's call for a complete ban on gifts to legislators and
government officials.

<HEADLINE> Giants 7, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bobby Estalella hit the first grand slam at
San Francisco's new bayside ballpark and the Giants defeated the
New York Mets 7-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Livan Hernandez (1-4) pitched an eight-hitter to win his first
game of the season. The right-hander, who lost all five decisions
to the Mets last season, has both of San Francisco's complete games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   After losing their first six games at Pac Bell Park, the Giants
have won three of their last four.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch (1-2) allowed seven runs and 11 hits in six
innings. He struck out two and didn't walk a batter as the Mets
lost their fifth in the last seven.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella's second career grand slam highlighted a six-run rally
in the fourth inning. Russ Davis and Rich Aurilia also drove in
runs in the inning as the Giants batted around.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds, who hit the first home run into McCovey Cove on
Monday night, failed to homer for the first time in four games, but
did hit a triple and double and scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored in the first when Robin Ventura had a two-out
RBI double. Hernandez did not allow a baserunner past second base
the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent doubled to score Bonds in the bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out five and walked three.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mets CF Darryl Hamilton will undergo surgery early next
week on the large toe in his left foot. He is expected to miss 4-6
weeks. ... The Giants announced the April 16 rainout with Arizona
will be made up as part of a day-night doubleheader on Saturday,
Sept. 23. The makeup game will start at 7:05 p.m. and will require
separate admission. ... Mets C Mike Piazza was not in the starting
lineup for the fourth consecutive day after sustaining a bruised
right wrist on Friday. He underwent treatment on Monday, and did
some light throwing and soft toss hitting before Tuesday's game.
... The Mets' eight bullpen wins coming into Tuesday's contest are
the most in the NL. ... Bonds is off to his quickest home run pace
of his career with 11 in his first 23 games. He hit 11 in his first
26 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Padres 8, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Damian Jackson had a two-run homer among his
three hits, scored three runs and made an acrobatic play at
shortstop as the San Diego Padres beat the Florida Marlins 8-3 on
Tuesday night to stop a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Clement allowed three runs and five hits in eight innings
to win his eighth straight decision since last Sept. 5. It figured
that the Padres would support Clement (4-0). They've scored 52 runs
in winning all six of his starts. He struck out seven and walked
three.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Padres found out that starting pitcher
Woody Williams has an aneurysm near his right armpit and that
doctors have recommended surgery. The Padres say it's similar to
when New York Yankees pitcher David Cone had an aneurysm in his
right shoulder in 1996 and missed four months.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin homered for the first time in 50 at-bats and Al
Martin also connected.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson hit a two-run homer to left off Vladimir Nunez with two
outs in the fourth, his third of the year. Jackson also doubled and
singled, falling a triple short of hitting for the cycle, which no
Padres player has ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who beat out Chris Gomez to win the starting shortstop
job in spring training, made a spectacular play in the second
inning. He went to his left to field Alex Gonzalez's grounder,
leaped, spun around and threw him out at first to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin hit a two-run homer to highlight the third-run third, his
seventh. He hadn't homered since April 16 against Houston. Ryan
Klesko had an RBI double and Bret Boone an RBI single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Martin homered with two out in the sixth, his fifth.
</P>
<P>
   All three of Florida's runs came on homers. Mark Kotsay homered
to center on Clement's first pitch of the game, his second leadoff
homer of the year and his fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Nunez, who came in with a 10.07 ERA, hit bitter than he
pitched, connecting for a two-run homer in the fifth, the first in
his big league career. Paul Bako was aboard on a one-out walk.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez (0-3) allowed eight runs and 10 hits in six innings,
struck out six and walked one.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams' aneurysm was discovered a day after he pitched 8
1-3 innings in a 5-2 loss to Florida. ... Klesko tied his
career-high with his sixth stolen base in the first inning. ... San
Diego's Eric Owens singled in the third to extend his hitting
streak to 11. He had a 13-game hitting streak earlier in the year.
If CF Ruben Rivera is activated on Friday as expected, Owens will
move to RF to take the spot of Tony Gwynn, who's on the DL with a
sore left knee. Owens has started 22 straight games in center.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP) -- Tornadoes touched down in south
Texas on Tuesday, ripping the roof off at least one house and
overturning about 25 mobile homes on South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   No major injuries were reported, Cameron County Fire Marshal
Desi Najera said, but power was out to about 5,000 residents.
Fearing the mix of fallen power lines and wet roads, officials
closed state Highway 100.
</P>
<P>
   The roof was ripped off a home east of Rio Hondo around 8 p.m.
An hour later, witnesses said a tornado touched down on Padre
Island and parts of Laguna Madre.
</P>
<P>
   While the tornadoes touched down, the winds weren't anything
like the tornado that struck Fort Worth, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These aren't the kind of tornadoes you get up in Tornado
Alley,'' said Ken Newman, senior forecaster for the Brownsville
office of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, repair crews worked into the night to restore power
to homes affected by heavy rain and wind that pounded the Houston
area early Tuesday and shut down at least one area school.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, about 238,000 homes were without power. That
number had been reduced to 28,000 by late Tuesday, Houston Lighting
and Power spokeswoman Leticia Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are shooting for getting everyone back up tonight,'' Lowe
said. ''It could be late, but that's our goal.''

   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Rebels said two foreign hostages died during a
pre-dawn clash Wednesday between military troops and Muslim guerrillas holding
21 people on Jolo island in the southern Philippines. But military officials
expressed skepticism about the claim, saying they had no knowledge of any
fatalities among the hostages captured last week from a Malaysian resort.
Meanwhile, the same rebel group holding a group of 27 Filipino hostages in
nearby Basilan province offered Wednesday to release all their captives if the
military halts its pursuit.

and not an ultimate goal,'' said a statement by Mexico, Ireland, South Africa,

clear the range but promised they wouldn't fight back. With three U.S. warships
offshore, the occupiers readied for what they called ''the invasion,'' a
possible effort to remove them.

Economic Indicators Reverse Decline

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. economy is set to grow well into the second half of
the year, according to two private reports released Tuesday, while the
government provided fresh evidence in a third report that rising interest rates
have done little to dissuade new-home buyers. Analysts said the figures pointed
to further interest rate increases by inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is designed to predict economic
activity three to six months ahead, rose 0.1 percent in March.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jason Kidd came back, Tim Duncan didn't and the Phoenix Suns
knocked the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs out of the NBA playoffs.
Penny Hardaway and Rodney Rogers, winner of the NBA's Sixth Man Award, scored 23
points apiece as the Suns won the best-of-five series 3-1 with an 89-78 victory
Tuesday night. Rogers, who also had 10 rebounds, scored eight points and
Hardaway seven in the fourth quarter as Phoenix fought off one last San Antonio
challenge to advance past the first round for the first time in five years. The
Suns play the winner of the Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento series in the Western
Conference semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 2, Stars 1  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks got to Ed Belfour
just enough to get back in their playoff series with the Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a 171-minute, 28-second scoring drought that included
consecutive shutouts by the Dallas goalie in the first two games of
the series, the Sharks broke through for goals by Owen Nolan and
Mike Ricci and beat the Stars 2-1 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks trail the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal
series 2-1 with Game 4 set for Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose goalie Steve Shields made his team's sudden offense
stand up by stopping 30 shots, including several clutch saves in
the final period. Dallas pulled Belfour in the final minute for an
extra attacker but Shields smothered Kirk Muller's wraparound
attempt with 30 seconds left and Dallas failed to register another
shot.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose finally got its first goal of the series at 5:42 of the
second period and it took a 5-on-3 power play to do it. With Blake
Sloan and Aaron Gavey in the penalty box, Gary Suter got off a shot
from the top of the slot and Ricci, positioned in front of the net,
used the shaft of his stick to redirect it past Belfour before the
Dallas goalie could adjust.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first goal scored on Belfour since early in the third
period of Game 5 in Dallas' first-round victory over Edmonton, a
span of 164:35.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci's first goal of the series marked San Jose's first playoff
score since Jeff Friesen's goal at 14:14 of the second period in
the Sharks' game 7 victory at St. Louis on April 23, when they
completed their first-round upset of the top-seeded Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, San Jose's leading scorer who sat out game 2 at Dallas
because of foot and shoulder injuries, came back to score his
seventh postseason goal at 14:56 of the second, putting the Sharks
in front.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Marchment started the rush in the San Jose zone, got the
puck out on the wing to Vincent Damphousse, who shot a lead pass
out to the streaking Nolan. He just managed to take a poke at the
puck as it slid across the slot and directed it into the corner of
the net past the startled Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   A San Jose turnover near the red line gave the Stars a
short-handed breakaway in the final seconds of the second period
but Mike Modano's shot from up close was stopped by Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas opened the scoring on the power play as Modano scored his
fifth goal of the playoffs and third of the series. Shields
deflected a shot by Brett Hull but the puck came out to Modano at
the bottom of the faceoff circle and he wristed a shot past Shields
3:35 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose had some early chances, outshooting the Stars 12-8 in
the first, but was frustrated by Belfour. At one point, Friesen
shook loose on a breakaway but Belfour came out to the top of the
crease and smothered the shot just as Friesen's stick met the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had another great stop with about eight minutes left in
the period. The Sharks got the puck to Todd Harvey alone in the
slot but Belfour dropped to his knees in anticipation of the
forehand shot and blocked it.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Set To Open  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- For more than 11 years,
investigators pursued a trail of evidence across Europe and the
Mediterranean to the two Libyan intelligence agents accused of
blowing Pan Am Flight 103 out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial in the world's worst airliner bombing opens today
at a Scottish court in the Netherlands, prosecutors dismissed
reports of weaknesses in the case and insisted they are ready with
sufficient proof to convict the men.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings, expected to last about a year, follow the
largest international murder probe on record, with investigators
interviewing 15,000 witnesses in more than 20 countries and sifting
through 180,000 pieces of evidence since the 1988 blast.
</P>
<P>
   All 259 passengers and crew members -- including 189 Americans
heading home -- were killed along with 11 residents of Lockerbie
some 38 minutes after the New York-bound jumbo jet took off from
London's Heathrow airport at 6:25 p.m. on that Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah is being held at Camp Zeist, an old U.S. air base declared
Scottish sovereign territory for the duration of the trial. The
venue was chosen in a U.N.-brokered compromise following years of
sanctions aimed at forcing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to hand
over the suspects, who were indicted in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 American victims' relatives were getting front-row
seats in the public gallery, separated from the court by
bulletproof glass. Many other family members could watch via
closed-circuit television linkups to sites in Washington, New York,
London and Dumfries, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   For the relatives, the long-awaited start of the trial elicited
mixed emotions. It marked a milestone in their crusade for justice
for the deaths of their loved ones. But it also raised doubts
whether those truly responsible for the crime will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a sense of relief and a sense of accomplishment that we
pursued it long enough and hard enough,'' said Maddy Shapiro, of
Stamford, Conn., whose daughter Amy was on Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she expressed concern that even if the men are
found guilty, ''whatever higher-ups gave the orders ... won't be
pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are really responsible are who we are after,''
said Kathleen Flynn of Montville, N.J., whose son, John Patrick
Flynn, was among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives believe the bombing plot involved senior figures in
the Libyan government as well as other terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They have also voiced worry over reports that the prosecution
case suffered setbacks as a result of contradictory witness
statements and inconsistencies in the evidence against the Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that the defendants planted the suitcase
rigged with a plastic explosive onto a flight from the
Mediterranean island of Malta to Frankfurt, where it was
transferred as unaccompanied luggage onto a feeder flight
connecting with Pan Am 103 at Heathrow.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scottish legal experts, the prosecution has no
eyewitness who can establish incontrovertibly that the defendants
planted a suitcase bomb aboard the doomed airliner. The rigorous
standards of proof in Scottish law require that every incriminating
fact be backed up by more than one source.
</P>
<P>
   The experts note, however, that prosecutors have kept their
cards close to their chest and may well have enough sources to link
the Libyans to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's awfully easy to debunk evidence before a trial,'' said
John Grant of Glasgow University Law School. ''Let's just hear what
the prosecution's case is. There may be some surprises for the
skeptics and the cynics.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have indicated they will call up to 1,000 witnesses
-- including investigators, eyewitnesses, and CIA and other covert
agents -- to testify. In the opening weeks, the witnesses will
include aviation experts who will discuss the explosion of the
jetliner as well as police and eyewitnesses on the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of murder, al-Megrahi and Fhimah face a mandatory
life sentence in a Scottish prison.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Glasgow University legal expert, Jim Murdoch,
noted that under Scottish law, ''Life doesn't have to mean life.
It's entirely possible that if these men are convicted, within 10
or 15 years they will be released.''

<HEADLINE> Swedish clothier sparks frenzy on Fifth Avenue  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shopping on ritzy Fifth Avenue never used to
mean standing in line. On the priciest stretch of this famous
street, a bulging wallet has always been more important than a
patient heart.
</P>
<P>
   Until a Swedish invader turned things upside down, drawing
throngs of shoppers with low prices in a neighborhood better known
for high-end names like Tiffany and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Hennes &AMP; Mauritz, or H&AMP;M, began its American expansion in
midtown Manhattan a month ago, and has quickly become the hottest
Swedish import since the 1970s supergroup Abba.
</P>
<P>
   Frugal, fashionable shoppers mob the three-floor store daily for
$11 stretchy shorts, $35 shimmery purple pants and $17 bikini
swimsuits. Security guards often ask bargain-seekers to wait
outside until the crowd ebbs, and lines frequently twist down the
block and around a corner.
</P>
<P>
   What's all the fuss about?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cute, trendy clothes for low prices,'' said shopper
Malaika Elcock, 27, of Brooklyn. ''It's more fashion-forward than a
lot of other stores. For basics, I would go to the Gap, but for
trendy stuff I would come here first.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm-based H&AMP;M ventured across the Atlantic in March and
now has three U.S. stores -- on Fifth Avenue, in West Nyack, N.Y.,
and Paramus, N.J. -- with at least one more planned for Manhattan
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fashion-conscious, word is traveling fast.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Hoppins, of Los Gatos, Calif., said she heard about the
store from friends at home and decided to visit during a recent
trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just saying, 'You've got to go see it,' so that's
why I'm here,'' she said as she stood on a short line waiting to be
admitted. ''I just came out of the cab and said, 'Oh, my God, you
have to wait on line to get in?' Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the megastore, hundreds of shoppers, mostly teens and
twenty-somethings, had to squeeze past each other on a recent
afternoon to browse through clothes, outerwear and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Long cash register lines snaked through the showrooms as
customers snatched up the stylishly retro merchandise, including
1970s-esque items like flared brown-and-orange pants and crocheted
purple ponchos.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a phenomenon because the prices are very attractive, and
because the fashions are so different from what has been shown here
before,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting firm
Loeb Associates.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;M -- which now has stores in 14 countries -- says it's thrilled
with the response it's gotten in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over what we expected,'' said Christian Bagnoud, a
company spokesman. ''What we tried to do is exactly what we have
done in Europe. We haven't changed anything in the variety, the
garments.''
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;M announced a profit drop just before the Fifth Avenue store
opened, but it was believed to be mainly a result of the expensive
U.S. expansion, not serious financial problems. Stock prices
plunged when CEO Fabian Maansson resigned around the same time, but
they have since regained most of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish newcomer's biggest draw is its low prices, but the
chain also keeps its stock varied, selling most styles only briefly
and replacing them quickly with new ones to keep customers
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you find something that you like, you have to buy today,
because tomorrow it might be that you can't find it anymore,''
Bagnoud said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers seem to like the high-turnover approach, which
eliminates the worry -- common among shoppers at some clothing
chains -- of ending up dressed just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a much larger variety,'' said shopper Brenda
Singleton, 37, of Raleigh, N.C. ''The Gap is really basic, they
hone in on a few things. Here they have a little bit of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton, loaded down with an armful of tops and pants, called
them ''play clothes'' and said she knew they might go out of
fashion quickly, but didn't mind because she wasn't paying much.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't come here for work clothes. But it's good prices
for stuff I know I might wear only for (one) summer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of lower quality,'' said a woman who came to make a
return and gave her name as Tammy. ''Disposable things. ... It's
cute stuff but it doesn't look like it's made that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb, the retail analyst, said the excitement around the Fifth
Avenue store is likely to quiet down. But if H&AMP;M expands
aggressively in the United States, he said, it could pose a real
challenge to chains like the Gap, Old Navy and Kohl's.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't expect to have lines around every store, but I see
the (H&AMP;M) stores crowded around every part of Europe, so why
shouldn't it'' be the same here, he said. ''I think it will be
strong competition.''

<HEADLINE> Co Says It Has Whipped Soybean Cyst  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Researchers may have finally whipped the
dreaded cyst nematode, a resilient pest that eats the roots of
soybean plants and ruins more than $1 billion worth of crops across
the country every year.
</P>
<P>
   Midland Genetics Group, an alliance of six companies in
Illinois, Iowa and Kansas, is the first to capitalize on a soybean
plant first bred by Purdue University researchers that has proven
resistant to more than 150 types of cyst nematode.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are working to incorporate the new technology,
called CystX, into their brands, but Midland is first to test the
technology and get it to market. The cooperative's partners say
they will start selling seed later this year for farmers to plant
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''They saw the material in the field very early and made a quick
decision,'' said Rick Vierling, a geneticist at Purdue. ''They were
convinced this was something customers would want and they jumped
on board. For a small company, it's a big deal, but then sometimes
smaller companies can move faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Private and university researchers have worked for years to find
some way to stop the cyst nematode, which chews up soybean roots
and lowers yields. A typical farmer in cyst nematode regions can
lose 5 percent of their soybeans, while a really bad infestation
can wipe out almost an entire crop.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our area there are a lot of other stresses involved,
especially weather stresses, on growing soybeans,'' said Clyde
Sylvester, an owner of one of the Midland companies in Ottawa, Kan.
''We felt like if we could keep the nematodes off the soybeans, it
really makes them tougher against the other stresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Before now, scientists made progress with soybeans that fought
off a few types of nematodes, but not all. Much of the latest
research has centered on the Hartwig soybean variety, which
successfully resisted all versions of the nematodes but didn't
produce high enough yields to win over farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Purdue researchers finally bred the resistant
capabilities of Hartwig into a higher-yield soybean variety. They
spent two years testing it against every type of nematodes they
could. Midland, followed by other companies Purdue is not allowed
to identify, bought licensing rights to CystX.
</P>
<P>
   CystX was developed using a high-tech, but still natural
breeding process, geneticist Rick Vierling said. So while
technologically advanced, it's not a genetically modified organism,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Midland's owners put the bulk of their resources behind CystX,
working at a harried pace to breed Purdue's variety with its own
soybean types. Midland project coordinator Dennis Brown said the
resistance has proven itself time and again in Midland research
stations in the United States and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were the first to really believe in it,'' said Brown, a
farmer and seed dealer in Neoga, Ill. ''In southern Illinois, we've
been dealing with this problem for 15 to 20 years, but we haven't
been dealing with it quite well enough.''

<HEADLINE> White House Staffers Assist Gore  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top White House talent employed by the
taxpayers is helping Democrat Al Gore write his campaign speeches,
work up attacks against rival George W. Bush's budget and develop
everything from crime-fighting proposals to health and education
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, head of President Clinton's National Economic
Council, and Bruce Reed, chief White House domestic policy adviser,
and scores of lower-level aides are lending their expertise --
legally, Gore's presidential campaign notes -- on their own free
time.
</P>
<P>
   Good-government watchdogs wince at the overlap.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are dropping any pretense of a separation between
campaign and government. The problem here is of perception and the
average American does not expect his or her taxpayer money to go
toward Al Gore's campaign,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director
of the Center for Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   -- As Gore flew to Atlanta Tuesday for an address on crime,
campaign aides referred reporters' questions on the meat of that
speech -- a $500 million rehabilitation program for prisoners and
parolees -- to Reed and helpfully distributed his telephone number
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sperling and his White House staff crunched numbers for a
15-page indictment of Gore's Republican opponent's tax-cut and
spending plans that concluded, on page 6, that Texas Gov. ''Bush
would need to make (spending) cuts of nearly 40 percent to balance
the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Sperling, along with former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, reviewed
drafts and gave Gore input on the major economic address he gave
last week in New York, where he assailed Bush's agenda as reckless.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sarah Bianchi, who transferred to the Nashville, Tenn.-based
campaign last month, worked during the past year on Gore's health
and Medicare proposals from her desk at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   -- On a campaign trip in February, reporters were handed ''Gore
2000'' press releases bearing the stamp of the official fax machine
in Gore's White House communications office. Campaign spokesman
Chris Lehane later called it ''an inadvertent mistake by a junior
staffer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of this that goes on in politics. But these
folks take it to a whole new level -- the Lincoln bedroom comes to
mind -- in using public property for campaign ends,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway underscored that official
aides may legally free-lance as long as they clock 40 hours of work
on official business each week and do not use government resources,
such as computers and phones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who helps out works strictly according to the rules and
we're grateful for them,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, campaign spokesman for Bush, who has his
gubernatorial staff at his disposal, declined to make an issue of
the muddied line between Gore's official and campaign resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue raised is not who writes the vice president's
material but what the vice president is saying ... negative attacks
that are part and parcel of old-style politics,'' said Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sometimes calls on state officials to do his political
bidding. Last week, his campaign dispatched Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander to a Gore appearance in Dallas, where she defended
the governor's education record to reporters traveling with the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has recently begun to move a number of his White House
aides, like Bianchi and communications director Laura Quinn, to
campaign or Democratic National Committee payrolls, freeing them up
to work full-time on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Among other legal perks of incumbency, Gore uses the White House
travel office to handle the massive logistics of hotel, plane and
rental car arrangements for his campaign trips.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warships Wait Off Vieques  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican protesters waited for
U.S. federal authorities to expel them from the U.S. Navy's prized
training ground -- even as several U.S. lawmakers and a religious
leader promised to come show their support.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 protesters on several campsites in the bomb-littered
range and dozens more in front of its main gate say authorities
will have to arrest them to clear the range, which has been idle
since stray bombs killed a civilian guard in April 1999. A few have
threatened to scatter into the bomb-strewn bush, endangering
themselves and any pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials say a raid would be carried out in an FBI-led
operation, and tensions have mounted since three U.S. warships
arrived off Vieques on Monday, reportedly carrying 1,000 Marines to
help secure the base perimeter once the area is cleared.
Helicopters have been flying over the area, but authorities have
given no hint of when an operation will begin.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing Tuesday, the Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig
Quigley, refused to answer questions about a planned operation but
vigorously defended the Navy's position that the inhabited island
alone offers the Atlantic Fleet ''the opportunity to combine both
the amphibious training, the naval gunfire training and the
air-to-ground ordnance training.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today there's only one Vieques,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   That argument has failed to win over the Vieques activists, who
enjoy broad support in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 4 million
Spanish speakers where local feelings run strong.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Council of Churches, the Geneva-based World
Council of Churches and the Pastors for Peace human rights group in
Chicago -- which sent several bishops and pastors to the bombing
range this weekend -- appealed Tuesday to President Clinton to
reconsider any planned arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spectacle of police action backed up by the presence of
warships and which is likely to involve arrests of church leaders
will contribute little to the pursuit of a lasting solution to this
problem,'' the WCC said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, amid speculation that the sweep was imminent, the
Vieques protesters and their supporters began their nightly vigil
at the gates to the range.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Susan Ravitz, 58, a social worker from Easton,
Pa., who owns a house in Vieques and came to join the
demonstration. ''It's historic because a small island, using no
violence whatsoever but just the power of their cause, has been
able to stop the hugest military force humanity has ever seen for
379 days,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered when it was announced that Roman Catholic
Bishop Alvaro Corrada del Rio was coming to Vieques from the main
island today to meet with Adm. Kevin Green, commander of the
training ground, on the disputed bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Also promising to arrive in Vieques soon are two mainland
Democrats of Puerto Rican descent, Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois
and Rep. Nydia Velazquez from New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, many reiterated their willingness to be arrested.
''I'm ready,'' said Luisa Guadalupe, 82. ''We are American
citizens, and we have rights. This is our land, and we going to
defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy bought two-thirds of the island on the eve of World War
II, forcing much of the population to relocate to the
English-speaking U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a war emergency. We had to help fight Germany, so many
people said 'O.K. we'll make the sacrifice for the moment,''' said
Nazario Cruz Viera, 89, who once worked on a farm on what is now
Navy area. ''But now we're tired of it. They've stayed too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 9,400 civilians live sandwiched between a Navy munitions
depot on the western third of the 21-mile-long island and the
bombing range in the west.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, the Clinton Administration and the
Puerto Rican government agreed in January that training could
resume for three years -- with dummy instead of live bombs -- and
Vieques residents would vote, probably next year, on whether the
Navy should leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy announced Tuesday that as part of that deal it will
begin removing 1,600 tons of munitions Thursday in order to
transfer nearly 8,000 acres of federal land to Puerto Rico later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not all here are against the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. military defends the democracy in the world, and of
course they're going to need a place to practice,'' said
schoolteacher Matilde Rosa.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Say 2 Hostages Die in Clash  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Rebels said two foreign hostages died
during a pre-dawn clash Wednesday between military troops and
Muslim guerrillas holding 21 people on Jolo island in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   But military officials expressed skepticism about the claim,
saying they had no knowledge of any fatalities among the hostages
captured last week from a Malaysian resort.
</P>
<P>
   Nur Misuari, the government's hostage negotiator, later said he
had conflicting reports about whether the two hostages were dead or
only injured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the same rebel group holding a group of 27 Filipino
hostages in nearby Basilan province offered Wednesday to release
all their captives if the military halts its pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   The military admitted Tuesday it was unable to find the 27 after
overrunning the main Abu Sayyaf stronghold. They were among about
50 seized by the rebels from two schools on March 20 for use as
human shields. The rebels later released some of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Ten soldiers were killed and 56 injured in the assault on the
camp, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers seeking the release of the 21 hostages and Abu Sayyaf
rebels clashed several times Tuesday and early Wednesday after
about 100 heavily armed guerrillas attempted to escape through
military lines. At least one soldier was killed and six injured,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Robot, an Abu Sayyaf leader, claimed in a telephone
interview with the local ABS-CBN radio network that one hostage had
been shot in the encounter and another died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized to their families and said it was not the rebels'
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Another rebel leader, Abu Escobar, later repeated the claim in a
call to another radio station and said the rebels would proceed
with a previous threat to behead two foreign hostages if the
military does not pull back from the rebels' hide-out.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ernesto de Guzman, chief of staff of the military's
Southern Command, said the troops would stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not move in and we will not move out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the overnight fighting was very far from where the
hostages are believed held.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 hostages were kidnapped April 23 from a Malaysian diving
resort and brought to a bamboo hut in Talipao on Jolo, about one
hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have pleaded with the government to halt military
operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a very serious situation. I would like to make that
clear,'' said German hostage Werner Wallert. ''We are risking our
lives here and if the Philippine government should try to march in
and find a military solution, there will be bloodshed, nothing
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Misuari said the rebels have refused to begin formal talks
unless the troops are moved from the area. He also urged a halt to
the military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want only peaceful means because I believe this is more
effective in getting them released safely than military means,''
said Misuari, a former Muslim rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign countries have offered to help negotiate, but
the government said Wednesday it can take care of the situation
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've asked them to please give us the opportunity to handle
the problem,'' presidential spokesman Ricardo Puno said. If needed,
he said, ''we will get their advice and we will get whatever
assistance they can give us. But the ball is in our court at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two groups fighting for a
separate Islamic state in the Philippines' impoverished Mindanao
region, home of the country's Muslim minority. The other group of
Abu Sayyaf rebels who are holding the 27 claimed two weeks ago to
have beheaded two of their captives, triggering a military assault
on their stronghold which so far has failed to find the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Jolo hostages include tourists from Germany, France, South
Africa, Finland and Lebanon as well as resort workers from the
Philippines and Malaysia. Several wrote letters Monday to their
embassies asking them to pressure the Philippine government to
speed up negotiations and remove the troops to prevent further
clashes and let the kidnappers obtain food.
</P>
<P>
   Several journalists who accompanied a doctor to the simple
bamboo hut Monday were able to interview the hostages, who
complained of food shortages, fevers and infections. The doctor
later reported that most of the hostages appeared exhausted and
dehydrated. She said she told the rebels that two captives need to
be hospitalized, but the rebels did not immediately agree.
</P>
<P>
   About 50-70 heavily armed Abu Sayyaf rebels, their faces covered
with hoods, guarded the area, about 45 minutes up a rugged path
from the nearest road in Talipao.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, troops battled rebels from the larger group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, in central Mindanao. Fierce clashes
that began Friday in Maguindanao province spread to nearby North
Cotabato province, de Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels and the military have accused each other of starting
the fighting, which prompted the MILF to suspend peace talks on
Sunday. A major clash between the MILF and the government would
seriously threaten stability in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Divided Over Missile Plan  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Pressure from the United States to support its
proposed missile defense plan has Canadian officials arguing over
whether to go along for the sake of North American unity or resist
to protect Canada's role as a champion of non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have visited Canada and held special briefings
with journalists to make sure their message gets across: Opposing
the National Missile Defense program could leave Canada vulnerable
to a rogue missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Herbert Browne, deputy commander of the U.S. Space
Command, said Tuesday in Alabama that if Canada refuses to
participate, the United States might be forced to let an incoming
missile hit Ottawa rather than compromise the security of U.S.
targets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the strongest indication so far of how Canada could
jeopardize its traditional joint defense arrangement with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, however, are divided about whether the country should
join the U.S. system.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy says the plan could
spark a new arms race, either by provoking Russia to drop
non-proliferation agreements or inspiring smaller states to try
harder to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law of physics is that every action has a reaction,'' he
told a parliament committee recently. ''And if you put a unilateral
system in place, I can assure you, other countries will not simply
stand still and say 'That's it.' They will undertake alternate and
optional actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Judson Corey, a spokesman for Veterans Against Nuclear Arms,
also said that joining the system would undermine Canada's history
of promoting non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would lose our credibility among other nations as a
negotiator for disarmament and for liberation from the nuclear
threat,'' Corey said.
</P>
<P>
   Art Hangar, the opposition defense spokesman in Parliament,
urged the government to sign on to the plan to preserve traditional
U.S.-Canada defense ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our membership in this alliance will be severely compromised
if we don't support the U.S. national missile defense system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Defense Minister Art Eggleton said the plan should be
studied and debated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply a matter of prudence that our joint institution
is capable of responding to new security challenges,'' he said last
month. While stopping short of a direct endorsement, he made it
clear that the U.S. view mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans believe there is a threat there,'' he said. ''We
certainly need to look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling was the position offered earlier this year by
Daniel Bon, acting assistant deputy minister for policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Canada has not been opposed in principle to a national missile
defense system,'' he said, ''provided it was deployed in a
cooperative international political environment, complementary to
arms-control and non-proliferation regimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureaucratic language touched on a key issue -- Canada's role
in setting up and implementing the $20 billion plan intended to
defend all 50 U.S. states against attack from a small number of
intercontinental ballistic missiles. Missile interceptors would be
based in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   If Canada backs the plan, it would be run by the North American
Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian operation in
Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., where the two countries have defended
North American airspace for five decades, Browne said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a Canadian role, the system would be commanded
by the U.S. Space Command, he said. That means deployment decisions
would be based solely on U.S. concerns, rather than joint
consideration for Canada, Browne warned.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to decide by fall whether to
proceed with the system, which could begin operating as soon as
2005.

<HEADLINE> Black Women's Diabetes Risk Studied  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Lifestyle factors such as obesity, poor diet and
lack of exercise strongly contribute to the high incidence of
diabetes in black women, suggests a study published today.
</P>
<P>
   In a nine-year study of more than 12,000 middle-age Americans,
''potentially modifiable'' lifestyle factors explained nearly half
of the excess risk in black women but accounted for little of the
excess risk faced by black men.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the higher risk in black men and women could be due
to ''other environmental risk factors that are unknown to us, or
there might be genetic differences,'' said co-author W.H. Linda
Kao, a Johns Hopkins University researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appear in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association. They aren't surprising since overweight people get
more diabetes, said Dr. Richey Sharrett, a scientific adviser at
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which helped fund the
study.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharrett said the study could have significant implications
because it shows that factors that people can do something about
play such a big role.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kao said the findings underscore the importance of
leading a healthy lifestyle as a way to prevent diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   About 14 million Americans have adult-onset, or type 2 diabetes,
in which the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, a
hormone that processes blood sugar. Diabetes can lead to kidney
failure, blindness and nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2.3 million blacks with diabetes have the
adult-onset form.
</P>
<P>
   Good diet, exercise and weight loss can help improve the body's
use of insulin and is usually recommended in adult-onset diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers analyzed data on 12,107 adults ages 45 to 64
participating in a nationwide study on hardening of the arteries
and compared the number of blacks and whites who developed diabetes
during a nine-year follow-up. In all, 459 blacks and 966 whites
developed the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Black women were nearly 2{ times more likely to get it than
whites and black men were about 1{ times more likely -- figures in
line with previous research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Modifiable'' factors, especially obesity, accounted for 47.8
percent of the excess risk in black women, said the authors, led by
Dr. Frederick L. Brancati. In black men, lifestyle factors were
found to be play only a ''minimal'' role.

<HEADLINE> Kings 101, Lakers 88  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers were beaten by
a bunch of reserves named Jon, Tony and Predrag, and the NBA's best
team this season suddenly was one loss from first-round playoff
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber had 23 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and seven
blocks, and the Sacramento reserves provided the decisive spark for
the second straight game as the Kings defeated the Lakers 101-88
Tuesday night to even their series at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth and deciding game will be Friday night in Los Angeles,
where the Lakers won the first two games of the series by
comfortable margins. The Lakers, who went an NBA-best 67-15 this
season, did not lose three straight games all year.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the series will face the Phoenix Suns in the
Western Conference semifinals. Phoenix dethroned the San Antonio
Spurs, wrapping up their series 3-1 with an 89-78 victory Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had 32 points for the Lakers, who never led in the
game and got no closer than six points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal added 25, but struggled with his shooting touch
for the second straight game. He went 10-of-22 from the field and
missed seven of 12 foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Barry had 17 points, Tony Delk had 12 and Predrag Stojakovic
11 as the Sacramento backups outscored the Lakers' reserves 42-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings went 9-for-21 from 3-point range, compared to 3-for-17
by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento is trying to become the 13th team to rally and win a
series after trailing 2-0. No team has accomplished that feat since
the Houston Rockets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings led 56-45 at halftime. They extended their lead to
68-56 with 3:18 left in the third period, seconds after Bryant and
Divac were assessed technicals for a skirmish under the Los Angeles
basket.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal committed his third foul on a charge, knocking Divac to
the floor, and Divac hit a short jumper at the other end to make it
72-59 with 1:30 left in the quarter. The Lakers finished the period
with a 7-1 run, though, and trailed just 73-66 going into the
fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento extended its margin to 12 points when Delk's bucket
with 8:19 left made it 82-70. Bryant had three baskets as the
Lakers used an 8-2 run to close to 84-78, but Barry hit a 3-pointer
with 5:19 remaining and Webber followed with a steal and dunk to
give the Kings an 89-78 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles never got closer than eight points after that, and
Barry ran along the sideline giving fans high-fives in the closing
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers missed eight of their first nine shots and fell
behind 9-2 in jet-engine loud Arco Arena. Los Angeles made just
three of its first 16 shots, falling behind by as many as 11 points
and trailing 27-18 after one period.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles closed to 46-43 with 2{ minutes remaining before
halftime, but Nick Anderson and Barry hit consecutive 3-pointers as
the Kings closed the half with a 10-2 run capped by Webber's hook
with eight-tenths of a second left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kings assistant coach Pete Carril was released from Sutter
Memorial Hospital, three days after having a minor heart attack,
and planned to watch Game 4 at home on TV. ... O'Neal and Bryant
each scored 90 points in the first three games of the series. ...
Kings reserve forward Tyrone Corbin missed the game with a sprained
left ankle. ... Rick Fox was with the Lakers a day after the birth
of his daughter and played five minutes in the fourth quarter. ...
Jason Williams struggled for the second straight game for the
Kings, going 1-for-8 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Minority Parents Value College  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hispanic and black parents are far more likely than white
parents to consider a college education the most important
ingredient for a youngster's success, according to a survey
released today.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of the general public and parents of high school-age
youths found that 65 percent of Hispanic parents and 47 percent of
black parents considered college the most important element for
success.
</P>
<P>
   Only 35 percent of the general public and 33 percent of white
parents agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the general public and non-minority parents picked
various other attributes -- such as knowing how to get along with
people, having a good work ethic, gaining skills on the job -- as
most crucial for success.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by the New York-based Public Agenda, a
nonprofit research group.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of high school-age youngsters also endorsed more
education as the best sequel to high school graduation. More than
three-quarters, or 77 percent, identified four- or two-year college
as most beneficial, and 16 percent cited trade school. Only 4
percent advocated a job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 67 percent of the public and 63 percent of parents with high
school kids said they believe success is possible without college.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's findings on minority aspirations contrasts sharply
with minority attendance in schools of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the latest federal figures available, among 18- to
24-year-olds, 37 percent of whites were enrolled in higher
education, but only 30 percent of blacks and 20 percent of
Hispanics were.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many non-Hispanic whites, it is a given that they will go
to college,'' said Antonio Flores, president of the Hispanic
Association of Colleges and Universities.
</P>
<P>
   But not so for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to go, but they can't afford it,'' Flores said. They
may be held back by poverty, language barriers or lack of family
experience in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The survey polled 1,015 adults by telephone in December. An
additional 451 Hispanics, blacks and whites were included in the
sample of parents of high school-age children. The margin of
sampling error was 3 percentage points overall, and 7 percentage
points for the extra survey of parents.
</P>
<P>
   The study was commissioned by the National Center for Public
Policy and Higher Education in San Jose, Calif., which promotes
education and training after high school.

<HEADLINE> Gene May Affect Response to Chemo  </HEADLINE>
By JACQUI PODZIUS COOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A genetic mutation that makes women more likely
to develop ovarian cancer may also make the body more responsive to
chemotherapy, according to a study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that women who carry the gene mutation live
about two years longer after receiving chemotherapy in the advanced
stages of the disease than women who do not have the flaw.
</P>
<P>
   The study analyzed tissue samples from 189 Jewish patients
treated during a 12-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York. All of the women had ovarian cancer in it most
advanced stages.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers focused on Jewish women because they more often
carry the defective BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are linked to
higher rates of ovarian and breast cancer. About 10 percent of all
ovarian cancer cases are hereditary.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 189 studied, 88 had the inherited BRCA mutations and 101
did not.
</P>
<P>
   The median time from the first chemotherapy treatment until
death for the hereditary cancer group was about five years,
compared with about three years for women without the mutated gene.
</P>
<P>
   The median time for recurrence of the disease -- the time between
the start of the first round of chemotherapy and beginning of the
second -- was 14 months for the hereditary group and seven months
for the other group.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers took into account such variables as the patients'
age and lifestyle, and still found a connection between the mutated
genes and longer survival, said Jeff Boyd, director of
Sloan-Kettering's Gynecology and Breast Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The survival is significantly longer,'' he said. ''If you
control for everything else, then BRCA status alone predicts better
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason may be that the gene defect that makes women more
susceptible to ovarian cancer also weakens cells so much that they
are more receptive to chemotherapy, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the findings could put researchers on the path to
understanding the type of cell damage caused by the BRCA mutation
and possibly replicating it in cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly there's something very different about these tumors,''
he said. ''They are clearly responding more favorably to the same
types of treatment, and the women are surviving longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynn Hartman, a Mayo Clinic oncologist who was not involved
in the study, said it is difficult to draw conclusions about
chemotherapy sensitivity from findings based on the three specific
mutations found in Jewish women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can extrapolate from findings in that group
for all BRCA cancer,'' she said. ''There are hundreds of different
mutations. We don't know that they all behave the same.''

<HEADLINE> Ky. Launching Anti-Smoking Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES WOLFE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- The nation's No. 1 state in smoking and
No. 2 in tobacco growing is launching its first statewide
anti-smoking campaign, with a modest early goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can make it to No. 2, we can probably make it to No. 5
or No. 8,'' Dr. Rice Leach, public health commissioner, said
Tuesday. ''If we can do that, we're on our way to getting somewhere
in the middle of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly last month enacted Gov. Paul Patton's plan
to spend $5.5 million over two years on smoking prevention
programs. The money, which Leach's agency will parcel out to local
health departments after Jan. 1, is from Kentucky's share of a
national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature also appropriated $5 million to establish a
substance-abuse agency that will focus on tobacco, drug and alcohol
use.
</P>
<P>
   The total is a fraction of what some other states are spending
to fight smoking. It is also $25 million less than the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention estimated Kentucky should be
spending, considering the size of its smoking habit.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the first time Kentucky has attempted a statewide
anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took us 200 years of Kentucky economy to become as
dependent on tobacco as we have become,'' Leach said. ''Most people
in Kentucky know smoking's bad for you. Most people who smoke wish
they didn't. They just need some help and understanding while all
the population moves in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than three in 10 Kentucky adults smoke, a rate
that has been declining but still tops that of all other states.
The national rate is 23.2 percent, according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky also has the highest rate of youth smokers and of
smoking-related deaths, and runs up $800 million a year in medical
bills for smoking-associated illnesses, according to the CDC. The
state tax on cigarettes, 3 cents per pack, is the nation's
second-lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky produced 400 million pounds of tobacco in 1999, second
only to North Carolina's 429 million.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has spent little so far on smoking prevention,
but Gov. Jim Hunt said he would support allocating a significant
portion of the state's tobacco settlement money for programs to
reduce teen smoking. Virginia has concentrated on enforcing laws
against selling tobacco products to minors.

<HEADLINE> ABC, NBC Head-to-Head in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Wallace and the ''60 Minutes'' crew may
have met their match in Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   In the first head-to-head match of the venerable CBS
newsmagazine and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the ABC game
show had the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ''Millionaire'' audience of 19.2 million was well below
its season average of 28 million. But ''60 Minutes'' had only 11.7
million viewers, a sharp drop from its season average of more than
17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ABC and NBC finished in a dead heat for last week's
prime-time Nielsen Media Research ratings crown, for a period that
encompassed the first four days of the important May ratings
sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of ABC's ''Arabian Nights'' miniseries had about
a million more viewers Sunday than CBS's competing movie on John
Denver. NBC's airing of ''The '70s'' proved far less popular than
last year's miniseries based on the 1960s, finishing behind the ABC
and CBS movies.
</P>
<P>
   NBC challenged ABC's dominance based on its strong Thursday
night lineup, particularly the top-rated ''ER'' and ''Friends,''
where actor Bruce Willis began a brief guest stint.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC and NBC had identical 8.9 ratings and 15
audience shares. NBC had a slightly higher number of households
tuned in, but ABC's average prime-time viewership of 13.2 million
beat NBC's 12.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had an average of 11 million viewers (7.7 rating, 13 share),
Fox had 8 million viewers (5.4 rating, 9 share), UPN had 4 million
viewers (2.7, 5), the WB had 3.4 million (2.6, 4) and Pax TV had
1.2 million (0.9, 1).
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''World News Tonight'' drew 9.5 million viewers last week
(7.2 rating, 16 share). NBC's ''Nightly News'' had 9.3 million
viewers (7.2, 16) and the ''CBS Evening News'' had 7.7 million
viewers (6.0, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of April 24-30, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings were ''ER,'' NBC, 19.6; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 17.0; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 16.0; ''Friends,'' NBC, 14.7;
''Frasier,'' NBC, 14.4; ''Frasier'' special, NBC, 13.0; ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 13.0; ''Just Shoot Me''
special, NBC, 12.9; ''Law and Order,'' NBC, 12.8; ''Touched By an
Angel,'' CBS, 11.8.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebels Seize UN Workers  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Rebels seized 50 U.N. workers as
the West African intervention force that defended the government
during eight years of bloody civil war completed its pullout of
Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary United Front rebels captured 16 U.N. military
observers and peacekeepers in the central city of Makeni, U.N.
force commander Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 27 people were seized in the eastern city of Kailahun
and seven others were captured in Magburaka, Jetley said. All were
taken in the past two days, he said, adding that rebels promised to
free the peacekeepers early today.
</P>
<P>
   The government condemned what it called the ''recent incidents
of indiscriminate violence perpetrated by some misguided
ex-combatants against the international peacekeepers'' in a
statement issued Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations force ''has been exercising considerable
restraint,'' the statement said. But that does not mean ''it does
not have the mandate, the means and capability to discharge its
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council held emergency
consultations to discuss the incident and issued a statement
calling the rebels' actions criminal and ''tantamount to
violations'' of a cease-fire agreement signed last July.
</P>
<P>
   The council demanded that rebel Revolutionary United Front
leader Foday Sankoh immediately give instructions to his followers
to end attacks against the United Nations, withdraw his forces
immediately and abide by the cease-fire agreement signed in Lome,
Togo.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who was brought into the government as part of a
power-sharing agreement last year, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the ''outrageous and
criminal'' seizures and demanded the rebels cooperate with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if Foday Sankoh is trying to derail the peace
process,'' Jetley said.
</P>
<P>
   Jetley insisted, though, that the U.N. mission called UNAMSIL
was capable of enforcing Sierra Leone's shaky cease-fire agreement,
signed by both sides in July. The United Nations was expected to
boost its force from the current 8,500 soldiers to 11,500 by July.
</P>
<P>
   But many Sierra Leoneans have expressed skepticism that U.N.
troops can enforce the fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   While authorized to use force, the peacekeepers -- mainly
Indians, Kenyans and Nigerians -- have avoided confronting the
rebels, who during the war killed tens of thousands of civilians
and intentionally maimed many more.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of rebels also have refused to give up their
guns, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping Monday occurred after about 100 armed
Revolutionary United Front rebels surrounded a Makeni disarmament
and demobilization center, demanding the return of 10 fighters who
had turned in weapons. When U.N. troops refused, the rebels fired
into the air and seized a U.N. military observer. Another three
observers and three peacekeepers were captured when they went to
negotiate their colleague's release.
</P>
<P>
   The two pilots and three passengers captured Tuesday were taken
at a rebel roadblock in Kailahun, where they had gone to drop off
U.N. supplies, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said they were attempting to negotiate the
release of the hostages with other RUF leaders. ''We have the
military option as we are a trained force,'' Jetley said. ''But
that is the last resort.''

<HEADLINE> The FBI and Its Code Names  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Before the search warrants are issued
and the suspects brought into the courtroom, federal investigators
have to have a name for their case.
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, Wash., there was Operation Doughboy, a case of
middle-aged businessmen selling cocaine. In New York, Operation
Marionette targeted mobsters accused of controlling a union ''like
a puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, Operation Plunder Dome is shorthand for the
corruption investigation of Providence City Hall. The case, so far,
has yielded five guilty pleas and a conviction in a scheme in which
bribes were given for property tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Where do the clever code names come from?
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of them we'd come up with were like something out of a
spy novel we'd read in junior high,'' said Donn Kidd, a former FBI
supervisor in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Take Plunder Dome, for instance. Though agents won't give
specifics, common wisdom is that the name is a play on the 19th
century City Hall dome and the Mel Gibson movie ''Mad Max: Beyond
Thunderdome.''
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Dennis Aiken, who heads the investigation, would
only say the derivation of the name was ''pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sort of fits, doesn't it?'' Aiken asked.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI produces thousands of operation names each year. Agents
are responsible for coming up with the case tags and supervisors
decide whether the name is appropriate, said Special Agent Anita
Dickens, an FBI spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can pretty much name it whatever they want, it just has
to be approved by headquarters,'' said Dickens, declining to
provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents say that choosing a snappy sobriquet is one of the
fun parts of a pressure-filled job.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Castelli, a former New York state trooper who teaches at
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of
New York, said there was no science to choosing a name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way you survive a career in law enforcement, especially
when you're talking about long investigations that tend to fray
your nerves and keep you away from the family, you sometimes have
to have a perverse sense of humor,'' Castelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Abscam, for example, was chosen for the FBI investigation two
decades ago in which agents posed as wealthy Arab businessman
offering bribes to members of Congress for help on immigration
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Desert Glow was exactly what it sounded like: a 1992
investigation of hazardous waste from a Colorado company that made
plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Louisiana case was called Operation Rap Crack because the
members of a crack cocaine ring being investigated were also
members of a rap group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only limited by your own creativity,'' said Jay Grant,
spokesman for the FBI's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   The names have a practical use, too.
</P>
<P>
   They make longer cases easier to track. And in an era when field
offices have more freedom to deal with reporters, the code names
allow agents to talk more openly about a case, said former FBI
Special Agent Harvey Burstein.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in, in the Hoover era, nothing -- and I mean nothing
-- got to the media except through headquarters,'' said Burstein,
now a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the Plunder Dome case, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., known for
his wit, used the name to poke fun at investigators and prosecutors
last year on a national morning radio show.
</P>
<P>
   He called the case ''Wonder Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where they got the name,'' said Cianci, who
denies any knowledge of corruption in City Hall. ''It sounds like
something from World War II.''

<HEADLINE> Biotech Food Regulations Expected  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The food industry is applauding a plan by the
Clinton administration to provide more oversight of gene-altered
crops and to set standards for labeling foods that claim to be free
of biotech ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan being announced today falls far short of what
consumer advocates have wanted, which is mandatory labeling for all
products containing genetically engineered products. Administration
officials say that is unnecessary, and the food industry has argued
that it would unfairly stigmatize biotech food.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would require biotech companies to notify the Food and
Drug Administration in advance of releasing new genetically
engineered crops and provide the agency with their research data,
according to industry officials who were notified of the plan
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA also intends to set standards for labeling biotech-free
food, an idea the food industry proposed last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plan calls for the Agriculture Department to
begin validating new scientific tests designed to detect the
presence of biotech ingredients in food, The Washington Post
reported in today's editions. The tests would ensure that food
labeled biotech-free meets uniform standards.
</P>
<P>
   James Maryanski, FDA's biotechnology coordinator, declined to
comment on the agency's plan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is a good step to make sure that this process is
open and transparent,'' said Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the
Grocery Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Willard of the National Food Processors Association said the
plan ''reflects recommendations that we have made repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Crops have been engineered to stay fresher longer or else to
resist pests and herbicides. The National Academy of Sciences
concluded recently that the biotech food now on the market is safe,
but critics say there isn't enough proof, and some U.S. food
processing companies and fast-food companies have been turning away
from the crops.
</P>
<P>
   FDA bowed to public concern and held a series of hearings on
crop biotechnology last year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 13 governors are joining the biotechnology industry
in an effort to persuade the public of the benefits of genetically
engineered crops and the safety of the food that is made from them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes sense to say that this isn't just the big, bad
chemical companies trying to engineer something to jam down your
throats,'' North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The governors hope to coordinate their message with the
biotechnology companies, who last month launched a $50 million
advertising campaign to counter criticism of the industry, said
Schafer, a Republican who is co-chairing the Governors
Biotechnology Partnership with Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they (the governors) are doing their farmers or
their consumers any benefit by promoting a technology that hasn't
proven to be safe,'' said Charles Margulis, a spokesman for
Greenpeace, an environmental group that has led the opposition to
biotech food. ''I don't think it's going to make much difference to
our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Other governors in the group include Democrats Mel Carnahan of
Missouri and Tom Carper of Delaware, whose states are home to two
leading biotech companies, Monsanto and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   The other governors in the coalition are Republicans Dirk
Kempthorne of Idaho, John Engler of Michigan, Mike Johanns of
Nebraska, Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and
George Ryan of Illinois, and Democrats Frank O'Bannon of Indiana,
Jim Hunt of North Carolina and Gary Locke of Washington.

<HEADLINE> North Koreans Shed Abrasive Image  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In 1994, amid a nuclear crisis, a
North Korean negotiator threatened to turn Seoul into a ''sea of
fire.'' In Beijing last year, the same envoy and his aides snubbed
South Korean diplomats, refusing to shake their hands.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the North Koreans are full of smiles and
compliments for their counterparts as the two Koreas prepare for a
first-ever summit between their leaders on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of how desperately the North Koreans want the
summit to happen that they're shedding their old image as tardy,
abrasive and even threatening in dealings with the outside world.
The South Koreans believe their poor, communist neighbors were
driven to the table less out of a yearning for reconciliation than
the desire to extract economic aid from the wealthy South.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motive, the tone of the talks is a welcome change
for South Korea's top negotiator, Yang Young-shik, who has said an
agreement is close on summit details such as security and
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides made significant progress Wednesday in preparatory
talks, a South Korean official said. After ending the third round
of talks, negotiators said they will meet again Monday on the
northern sector of the border village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although agreement was reached in many areas, both sides did
not reach the point of signing a formal accord,'' said Lee Kwan-se,
chief spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yang told North Korean envoy Kim Ryong Song, a suave
veteran in his 50s who is adept at pre-meeting chuckles and small
talk, that he had ''a mild tone of voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark was significant because many South Koreans view
totalitarian North Korea as an austere land run by harsh officials.
The Pyongyang government's rhetoric is often confrontational toward
its traditional foes: Japan, South Korea and the United States.
North Korea's penchant for invective dates to armistice talks
during the 1950-53 Korean War, when U.S. military negotiators sat
through frequent communist diatribes in Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim turned on the charm last week, telling South Korean
negotiators that a morning drizzle had stopped when they crossed
into the northern side of Panmunjom for talks. A good omen, implied
Kim, who helped draft a 1992 agreement with the South that called
for peaceful reunification, but failed to stem tension for long.
</P>
<P>
   Yang has had less amiable exchanges with North Korean officials
in the past. In July, he was Seoul's lead envoy in failed talks in
Beijing on arranging reunions of separated Korean families. A naval
clash between the Koreas in the Yellow Sea in June soured those
talks, and North Korean negotiator Pak Yong Su and his aides walked
out of two sessions with Yang.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pak said in Panmunjom that the North would turn Seoul
into a ''sea of fire'' in a defiant reaction to international
pressure to allow inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities.
The South Korean capital is within range of North Korean artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Pak is not involved in the summit negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In the summit talks at the border village, negotiators have
focused on procedural matters. The next step is shaping an agenda
for South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il at their Pyongyang meeting.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean negotiators are considering a North Korean proposal
that the agenda be based only on a mutual desire for reconciliation
and reunification. Seoul had said it wanted a detailed agenda, wary
that North Korea might use the summit as a platform to pontificate
on the U.S. military presence in South Korea and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the border talks, North Korean journalists wearing pins with
the image of Kim Il Sung -- the father of the current leader and
nearly a godlike figure in the North -- have been eager to chat with
the South's press corps.
</P>
<P>
   One North Korean reporter urged a South Korean to write an
adulatory story about Kim Jong Il, recounting how he once ordered
1,000 army veterans and 1,000 female volunteers to cultivate
potatoes on a mountain plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great stuff. Don't you think so?'' the North Korean said.
The South Korean journalist politely nodded.

<HEADLINE> Seattle's 'Toe Truck' Has Suitors  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN VAN BRONKHORST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A history museum wants it. An online auction
house beckons. A candymaker even dreams of its image in white
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of loving homes that want to adopt the pink,
foot-shaped ''Toe Truck'' that sits above Lincoln Towing at a busy
freeway interchange.
</P>
<P>
   The city will soon sell the land to developers -- and the Toe
must go.
</P>
<P>
   But where?
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 years old, the Toe -- a Volkswagen microbus topped with
giant Styrofoam-and-fiberglass toes -- hardly qualifies as a
historic landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Seattle's Museum of History and Industry wants to
be first in line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd love to be home to the Toe,'' declares deputy director
Feliks Banel.
</P>
<P>
   Toe co-owner Ed Lincoln isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   He's had offers -- yes, thank you -- or at least inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody said you should put it on eBay, and let everybody
from a podiatrist to Nike bid on it,'' he said Monday, one day
after his official retirement from managing the mom-and-pop
operation he sold more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast: Co-owner Connie Lincoln is intrigued by the
white-chocolate sample candies -- toe-shaped and foot-shaped --
received from local candymaker Kathy Moeller.
</P>
<P>
   If her candy company can have the Toe Truck, Moeller writes, she
will market pink candies and donate proceeds to a charity.
</P>
<P>
   The Toe originated when a stranger wandered into the Lincoln
Towing office and sketched an imaginary tow truck on a napkin. Ed
decided to build it.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Toe has played a part in many local TV and radio
promotions and commercials. It once sported a garter to transport a
bride and groom to their reception.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are two ''Toe Trucks.'' A ''right foot'' version
built from a Chevrolet truck in 1996 graces a parking lot in north
Seattle. Neither truck actually tows vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Now the city, which has leased Lincoln Towing its land, is
selling the property. The Lincolns want to donate the truck to a
place in Seattle where people could appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have their own plans: Mark Reed wants to place the Toe atop
an old brewery alongside the busy Interstate 5 freeway. Traffic
reporters could then say: ''The toe is jammed.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another option.
</P>
<P>
   Towing buffs are waiting to welcome the Toe to a place of honor
at the International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum in
Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''You bet, we'd polish it up,'' said Jerry Bullock, the museum's
president.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lincolns want to stay local. The Museum of History and
Industry sounds good, they said, although discussions are only
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to be able to display it for people to see something
that they remember and bring their kids to show them something from
the past, something that's uniquely Seattle,'' said Banel of the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a shoo-in.

<HEADLINE> Cervical Cancer, Oral Cancer Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have discovered the virus that
causes most of the world's cervical cancer seems to cause another
cancer, too -- oral cancer, mostly tumors found in the tonsils.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long wondered if human papillomavirus, or HPV,
caused any other malignancy, but the study reported Tuesday in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute provides the first proof.
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news: HPV-linked tumors may be less deadly
than oral cancer caused by smoking or alcohol, the usual culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were surprised,'' said Dr. Maura Gillison, a Johns Hopkins
University oncologist who began the study expecting to disprove the
viral link. Instead, she said, ''We think we found a cause for
these cancers in people who don't smoke or drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Her findings are so strong that Hopkins researchers developing
an experimental vaccine-like treatment to fight cervical cancer now
are preparing to test the therapy on some oral cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is ''very exciting,'' said Harvard Medical School
biochemist Karl Munger, an expert on human papillomavirus, or HPV.
''If you know what causes a cancer, you can much better define what
strategy to use to combat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 38,000 Americans and 350,000 people worldwide are diagnosed
with oral cancer each year, said Dr. David Wong, oral pathology
chief at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. It's disfiguring,
hard to treat, and half of all patients die within five years, a
toll that hasn't changed much in two decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking and heavy alcohol use are the chief causes. But about 15
percent of patients don't have those risk factors, puzzling
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that infects some 40 million
Americans. There are over 80 strains, most thought harmless,
causing no more than the common wart.
</P>
<P>
   But about 1 percent of infected people have the HPV 16 strain
that causes most cervical cancer -- and now the Hopkins research
shows HPV 16 can cause a unique type of oral cancer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gillison tested head-and-neck tumors taken from 253 patients and
detected HPV in 25 percent of them. The virus was only in tumors in
the tonsils and base of the tongue, and HPV-positive tumors tended
to occur in nonsmokers who drank little alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   More important, patients with HPV-positive tumors had a 59
percent lower chance of dying during the study.
</P>
<P>
   But Gillison still was skeptical -- just because the virus was in
a tumor didn't mean it caused the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So she gave the tissue samples to pathology specialists, who
discovered that under a microscope, HPV-positive oral cancer has
unique cellular characteristics almost identical to HPV-caused
cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The next step: Alcohol and tobacco both cause specific mutations
in a gene called p53, disabling it so it cannot properly fight
cancer. HPV, in contrast, can cause cervical cancer without
stopping to mutate p53. Sure enough, a gene check showed the
HPV-positive tonsil cancer had far fewer p53 defects than
HPV-negative tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all of this, we were convinced,'' Gillison concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The study didn't address how HPV is infecting people's throats,
but Gillison said oral sex or something as simple as unwashed hands
could explain it.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is why a virus-caused tumor doesn't appear
as deadly as one caused by tobacco or alcohol. Perhaps HPV-caused
tumors don't invade deep tissues and spread as quickly, meaning
surgery or radiation could work better for these patients, Gillison
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, a virus gives oncologists a long-awaited
new target in attacking oral cancer, says Harvard's Wong.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to efforts at fighting cervical cancer, some
experimental strategies already are under development. The National
Cancer Institute has funded Hopkins scientists who are developing
vaccine-like treatments that prime the immune system to recognize
and attack HPV 16 in cervical tumors. Now those scientists are
expanding a planned clinical trial of the anti-cancer vaccine to
include oral cancer patients, too. The trial should begin within a
year, Gillison said.

<HEADLINE> Lott Struggles With Competing Forces  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had just
wrapped up a difficult session with Janet Reno and knew that many
of his colleagues were steaming about the attorney general's
decision to order a military-style seizure of young Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   So three days after the April 22 raid, Lott rushed to announce
that the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings on the
incident -- and hinted that the panel's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
might want to consider calling the 6-year-old refugee's Cuban
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Lott called him ''an interesting witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing -- originally set to begin today -- has since been
postponed, with Hatch, R-Utah, blaming the Justice Department for
dragging its feet on a request for documents.
</P>
<P>
   It was an announcement that has come to haunt Lott -- the latest
in a series of difficulties he's encountered and another example of
how difficult it is to lead the Senate during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''An enormous wave of emotion swept over conservatives. This
evoked for them everything bad about Bill Clinton and Janet Reno,''
said Norman Ornstein, an analyst with the American Enterprise
Institute. ''Lott not only felt that, but saw it from his base --
and immediately reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of majority leader is always difficult, but it may be
especially so for Lott ''because we have rampant individualism
dominating the Senate now,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also tentatively agreed recently to leave on the back
burner a bill to boost U.S. military ties with Taiwan, according to
some Senate Republicans close to the legislation, to keep it from
getting tangled with legislation to give China permanent trade
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He omitted the Taiwan bill from a list of measures he hoped to
see passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that upset some Senate conservatives, including Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who wants the
Taiwan bill to come up as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was quick to spread the word that he hadn't really decided
one way or the other on timing for the Taiwan measure.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a proposed compromise Lott helped broker to
increase trade benefits for Africa and Central America appeared to
be falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done about all I'm going to do on this issue, let me just
put it real blunt, point blank. You know, there are other people
that need to quit being obstinate and bring this to a conclusion,''
he groused on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Elian Gonzalez hearings, Lott on Tuesday sought to
clarify his position.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was never intended to be a long, drawn out, protracted
hearing,'' Lott said. ''It was always thought to be something that
could be handled in a day or two at the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that most Americans supported the predawn raid
on the Miami home of Elian's great-uncle and the return of the boy
to his father -- and don't want to see congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans in both the House and the Senate don't want to
be drawn into what they see as a political minefield
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a Foreign Relations subcommittee
chairman, has been among the most outspoken Republicans in urging
the Senate not to hold the hearings -- saying Congress should leave
the matter alone.
</P>
<P>
   But some others want to press ahead full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is suggesting the Justice Department's refusal to provide
his committee with documents is why hearings have been postponed.
But Democrats see that as a cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are very few people in this city who believe
that their postponing of the hearing has anything to do with
documents arriving on the Hill,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The panel still hopes to hold a limited hearing into the raid,
Hatch indicated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has always been challenged in attempting to run the Senate
while keeping his credentials intact with the chamber's more
conservative members. He also knows that others have designs on his
job if he should stumble -- including Majority Whip Don Nickles,
R-Okla., and Rules Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The usual snail's pace of Senate proceedings and the pressure of
election-year politics has made it increasingly difficult for Lott
to move legislation, even bills that he deems as essential.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said on Tuesday that he's still ''very enthused'' about
holding hearings into the Elian Gonzalez matter. ''But you know,
there are other people, including the Judiciary Committee, that has
to make the final call on that.''

<HEADLINE> House Inspector Urges Fire Safety  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Architect of the Capitol has much work to
do before the Capitol complex is safe from fire hazards, but
additional emergency equipment has been installed in buildings
cited for code violations, the House inspector general reports.
</P>
<P>
   Most defective sprinklers have yet to be replaced 16 months
after the inspector general first reported on the fire safety
problems, and a comprehensive fire safety plan is still in the
works, Inspector General Steven A. McNamara concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The major progress has been in installation of new smoke
detectors, and a system of alarms, strobe lights and speakers that
would warn of a fire emergency, McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the AOC made improvements to House fire protection
systems, they continue to take a haphazard approach to planning,
implementing installing and completing fire protection systems
throughout the House complex,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara found:
</P>
<P>
   --Not all firefighting components within a building are connected
to a central station, which would monitor the systems and provided
up-to-date information to emergency responders.
</P>
<P>
   --The architect is moving slowly in replacing defective Omega
sprinklers that the Consumer Product Safety Commission identified
as defective. Of 5,270 replacement sprinkler heads that were
provided for the House side of the complex, only 1,300 have been
installed.
</P>
<P>
   --Despite the need for new emergency doors, unobstructed exit
routes, better exit signs and evacuation planning, much of that
work has not been done. Proper doors have not been installed, most
emergency exits are not connected to alarm systems that would allow
automatic opening, many exit signs are not visible and evacuation
studies have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The architect's spokesman, Bruce Milhans, said his office agreed
with the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have indeed taken steps to improve and have significant
steps ahead,'' he said. ''We're already working on a comprehensive
fire protection plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Milhans said architect officials are conducting overall
assessments of fire risks and then will complete a
building-by-building plan along with a schedule of priority
projects. ''Some projects have been funded and if they haven't,
we've asked for funding. We're well on the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress' health and safety agency issued formal
citations ordering the architect to fix fire safety hazards that
jeopardize the lives of lawmakers, their staffs and thousands of
daily visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report was unrelated to the citations,
but rather was a follow-up to the office's December 1998 report
that first warned of fire hazards in congressional buildings. Only
the House has an inspector general, who has authority to issue
investigative reports for the House half of the Capitol and the
House's office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our judgment that continuing with fire protection
projects without a viable comprehensive plan greatly increases the
risk of improper scheduling, wasted resources and the omission of
critical system components,'' the report found. An example was the
installation of exit signs in the Cannon House Office building
before studies were completed, ''resulting in misplaced exit
signs.''

<HEADLINE> Time of Columbine Deaths Reported  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- All the people killed by gunmen inside Columbine
High School were dead by the time the first SWAT team reached the
school's library even though authorities knew hours earlier from a
teacher's 911 call that the gunmen were firing outside the library.
</P>
<P>
   The call from teacher Patti Nielson is part of a timeline of
events that ABC's ''World News Tonight'' reported Tuesday. The
network said its story was based on a draft report on the April 20,
1999, shootings being developed by the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The document has not been released to the public. Victims'
families have complained about how long it has taken the sheriff to
complete the report and have sued to force its release.
</P>
<P>
   A judge has given the department until May 15 to release the
final report on the shootings that left 13 people and the student
gunmen dead and 26 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Nine lawsuits representing the families of those slain and
wounded in the country's deadliest school shooting have been filed
against the sheriff's office. The timeline could serve as evidence
for the families if it backs their claims that some of the victims
might have been saved if they had gotten medical help sooner.
</P>
<P>
   According to ABC, which did not say how it obtained the
information, the timeline begins with the gunmen, Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold, appearing outside the school at 11:19 a.m. One of
them yelled ''Go! Go!'' and five students were shot immediately.
Two of those students died.
</P>
<P>
   Then the gunmen roamed around the school shooting through doors
and windows and throwing homemade bombs on the roof, the network
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's deputy assigned to the school, who was just
finishing his lunch, exchanged shots with Harris, according to the
timeline. Harris fired at him 10 times with a rifle before it
jammed.
</P>
<P>
   While the deputy distracted the gunmen, teacher Dave Sanders
herded hundreds of students out of the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Another sheriff's deputy arrived and traded shots with Harris,
according to the report. The gunmen went back into the school where
they shot Sanders outside the library.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Nielson called 911 from a phone in the library and told
the operator there were students inside the library and the gunmen
were right outside. The operator told her and the students to
remain in there and that police, paramedics and firefighters were
on the way.
</P>
<P>
   But the gunmen entered the library four minutes after the call
and began ordering the students to get up, according to the report.
Over the next seven minutes, the draft report says, 22 students
were wounded or shot.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen then killed themselves. The first SWAT team to arrive
at the library got there more than three hours later after working
their way through the large school building. By then, 10 students
and Sanders were dead.

<HEADLINE> Recovery Continues After Tornadoes  </HEADLINE>
By RENEE RUBLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- One year ago, Sara Ruiz was huddling with
her two grandchildren under a mattress when the sky attacked,
peeling away the roof, sucking up the walls and chewing it all to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said she plans to look into the sky today and thank God for
what remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''My tragedy has been made into a miracle,'' said Ruiz, who is
returning to a new home near Tuttle that was paid for by donations
and built by volunteers after the tornado of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, Oklahomans are celebrating their survival and
remembering the victims of May, 3, 1999, when a tornado up to a
mile wide went on a 60-mile destruction path, leaving 44 people
dead, almost 800 injured and more than 8,000 homes damaged or
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The F5 twister, the strongest on the Fujita Tornado Scale, tore
through a quarter of the state, starting near Chickasha. It cut
through rural Bridge Creek, hit Moore, crossed southwestern
Oklahoma City and roared into the suburbs of Midwest City and Del
City.
</P>
<P>
   It was the costliest tornado in U.S. history, causing about a
billion dollars in damage. Mail boxes still stand in front of
vacant lots and scrunched cars sit in driveways.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the anniversary is a time to celebrate a community that
rebuilt together, said Kay Norman, principal of the elementary
school in Bridge Creek, where 12 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The school, one of the only things in town that withstood the
318 mph winds, planned a carnival today with games and inflatable
jumping toys -- and counselors, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have fun,'' Norman said. ''We don't want to
forget what happened, but we do want to recognize the community
spirit around here. We're building. We're back. We're stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mental recovery has just begun for many, said Gwen
Allen, director of Project Heartland, a mental health program
created after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's after the rebuilding and getting back into a new home
that people may realize the impact of the tornado,'' Allen said.
The agency has provided services to 82,740 people in 19 Oklahoma
counties.
</P>
<P>
   While the removal of debris is officially done and 75 percent of
rebuilding finished, the human scars linger.
</P>
<P>
   Memorials and moments of silence were planned in Bridge Creek
and at Rose State College, while the congregation of Beth Haven
Independent Baptist Church in Moore planned to meet in the parking
lot to worship. A new, almost-finished sanctuary stands near the
old church the tornado destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really haven't lost anything when you look at it, the Lord
has returned it all,'' Pastor Ivan Casteel said Monday. ''We're
still moving strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Rogers is one example.
</P>
<P>
   Toppled trees, plywood, tin, shingles and other rubbish blown
from more than 20 miles away has kept a small group of men cleaning
his yard near Perry busy.
</P>
<P>
   But the most challenging part has been living in a mobile home
until his homestead is rebuilt. Rogers boasted of recently cooking
enough chicken, potatoes and pecan pie to feed the 25 worker who
helped one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just do what you have to do,'' he said. ''God is still
smiling down on us and that's about all you can ask for.''

<HEADLINE> Commerce Dept Lists Winners, Losers  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that have anything to do with
computers or telephones will enjoy a very good year, while aircraft
manufacturers and makers of leather goods won't fare as well, the
government is forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department on Tuesday released its annual list of
winners and losers among more than 200 manufacturing industries and
service companies.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the government said the U.S. economy, which in February
set a record for the longest period of uninterrupted growth, should
turn in a 10th year of expansion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is an economic powerhouse,'' Commerce
Secretary William Daley said in the report. ''Fueled by a
revolution in information technology, we are experiencing the
lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, with more than 20 million new
jobs created.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's list of industry winners, which was contained
in ''U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook 2000,'' was dominated by
computer and telecommunication companies, which occupied five of
the top six spots in terms of projected growth in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses making semiconductors and related devices for
computers led all others with a projected jump in shipments this
year of 23 percent, which would follow a strong 22.2 percent gain
in 1999. Other big winners were manufacturers of telephone
equipment, radio and television communications equipment, printed
circuit boards and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of computers and telecommunications, the top winners
were manufacturers of oil and gas field machinery, who were
enjoying a rebound fueled by rising energy prices, drug companies,
poultry processing plants and auto parts makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department report, which has been issued since
1960, predicted that 75 percent of manufacturing industries and all
the major service sectors will enjoy positive growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report forecast rough sailing for some U.S.
industries. The biggest loser was projected to be aircraft
manufacturing, which the department forecast would suffer a 20.4
percent drop in shipments following an 8 percent increase in 1999,
reflecting a decline in orders following the Asian currency crisis.
Aircraft engine and parts manufacturers were also expected to see
shipment declines this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other big losers in terms of projected percentage drops were
manufacturers of women's handbags, personal leather goods such as
purses and luggage, all industries which face heavy import
competition from low-wage countries such as China.
</P>
<P>
   The report offered these highlights:
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Computers, telecommunications and
semiconductors continue to lead the economy with double-digit
growth forecast, reflecting strong investment by businesses and
high demand by consumers. Continued demand for faster, smaller,
more functional electronic products will fuel demand for printed
circuit boards, the nervous system of electronic devices, with
shipments expected to rise by 9.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOMOTIVE: Shipments of motor vehicles were projected to
decline by 1.7 percent this year, reflecting a slight slowdown
following dramatic gains in recent years. Auto parts sales were
forecast to increase by 5.1 percent, fueled by rising demand from
motorists keeping cars on the road longer.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH: Outlays for health care are expected to rise to $1.3
trillion this year, an increase of 7.1 percent over the $1.2
trillion spent in 1999. The share of total spending that goes to
hospitals is expected to decline from 34.6 percent in 1996 to 32
percent by 2001 while payments to doctors will increase as more
Medicare beneficiaries enroll in managed care plans.

Philippine Military Disputes Report
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Rebels said two foreign hostages died during a
pre-dawn clash Wednesday between military troops and Muslim guerrillas holding
21 people on Jolo island in the southern Philippines. But military officials
expressed skepticism about the claim, saying they had no knowledge of any
fatalities among the hostages captured last week from a Malaysian resort. Nur
Misuari, the government's hostage negotiator, later said he had conflicting
reports about whether the two hostages were dead or only injured.

Puerto Ricans Wait To Be Expelled
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican protesters waited for U.S. federal
authorities to expel them from the U.S. Navy's prized training ground -- even as
several U.S. lawmakers and a religious leader promised to come show their
support. Some 50 protesters on several campsites in the bomb-littered range and
dozens more in front of its main gate say authorities will have to arrest them
to clear the range, which has been idle since stray bombs killed a civilian
guard in April 1999. A few have threatened to scatter into the bomb-strewn bush,
endangering themselves and any pursuers.

ABC Back on Time Warner for Now

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
scolded Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co. for taking ABC off the air for 3.5
million customers, saying viewers shouldn't be held hostage to their dispute.
''This should never happen again,'' William Kennard said Tuesday, shortly after
ABC's signal was restored following a 27-hour blackout. Kennard's warning came
after the corporate warriors put off, but didn't settle, their quarrel over what
Disney would be paid to provide its cable channels to Time Warner customers.

Arkansas Woman Executed

   VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- A former nurse who asked for the death penalty for
drugging and suffocating her two children was executed by injection Tuesday in
Arkansas' first execution of a woman in more than 150 years. Christina Marie
Riggs, 28, was the fifth woman executed in the United States since the Supreme
Court lifted a ban on capital punishment in 1976. She had maintained throughout
that she wanted to die and her last words reflected her grief. ''There is no way
no words can express how sorry I am for taking the lives of my babies,'' she
said. ''Now I can be with my babies, as I always intended.''

Nuclear Pledge Called Inadequate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A coalition of countries said Tuesday that a new
pledge by the key five nuclear powers to work to eliminate their nuclear
arsenals falls short of demands that they actually get rid of them. ''We stress
that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is an obligation and a priority
and not an ultimate goal,'' said a statement by Mexico, Ireland, South Africa,
Egypt, Sweden, New Zealand and Brazil. The statement was a response to a joint
position paper issued Monday in which the United States, Russia, China, France
and Britain pledged their ''unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of
complete elimination of nuclear disarmament.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell broadly Tuesday after AT&AMP;T delivered a cautious
profit outlook and investors took profits from a three-day rally in technology
shares. Worries about rising interest rates hung over the market, keeping volume
low and buyers scarce. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.66 to close at

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jason Kidd came back, Tim Duncan didn't and the Phoenix Suns
knocked the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs out of the NBA playoffs.
Penny Hardaway and Rodney Rogers, winner of the NBA's Sixth Man Award, scored 23
points apiece as the Suns won the best-of-five series 3-1 with an 89-78 victory
Tuesday night. Rogers, who also had 10 rebounds, scored eight points and
Hardaway seven in the fourth quarter as Phoenix fought off one last San Antonio
challenge to advance past the first round for the first time in five years. The
Suns play the winner of the Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento series in the Western

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves became the first National
League team in 49 years to win 15 straight games, beating the Los
Angeles Dodgers 5-3 Tuesday night behind Andruw Jones' go-ahead,
two-run single in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who have set a franchise record for consecutive
wins, are the first NL team with a 15-game winning streak since the
New York Giants took 16 straight from Aug. 12-27, 1951, as they
overcame the Brooklyn Dodgers to win the NL pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was the last major league team to win 15 straight,
accomplishing the feat from June 1-16, 1991, en route to a World
Series title.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker pitched the ninth for his seventh save in seven
chances. Unlike Monday night, when a fan ran on the field and
mooned him, there were no incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fans booed when he entered the game, and nearly two dozen
security men went on the field and the Braves' dugout. With two
outs and two on, Rocker retired Gary Sheffield on a flyout, then
walked off the field as security again went on the field and the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back doubles by Adrian Beltre and Todd Hundley with one
out in the sixth had given the Dodgers a 3-2 lead, and it appeared
they would extend their advantage in the seventh, loading the bases
with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruce Chen (4-0) got Sheffield to ground into a double
play and struck out Dave Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner and Bobby Bonilla walked opening the Atlanta eighth
against Terry Adams (2-2). Pinch-runners Brian Jordan and Walt
Weiss moved up on a wild pitch before Jones lined a 2-2 pitch to
center, putting the Braves ahead 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   After Javy Lopez singled, Mike Fetters relieved Adams and
retired the next two batters before first baseman Dave Hansen
misplayed a pickoff attempt for an error that allowed Lopez to
score from third.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead off Terry Mulholland in the second
on Kevin Elster's infield out. The Braves tied it off Chan Ho Park
in the fourth on a two-out, RBI double by Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Park appeared to hit his first big-league homer leading off the
fifth, but first-base umpire Larry Young ruled a fan leaned over
the box seat railing in the right-field corner and caught the ball,
making it a ground-rule double. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
argued to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The call became moot when Shawn Green hit a one-out single to
drive in Park, giving the Dodgers a 2-1 lead, but Joyner's homer in
the sixth tied the game again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers reached Mulholland, who won his three previous
starts, for 10 hits in six innings, but managed only three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed two runs and three hits in 6 2-3 innings while
walking seven, equaling a career high, and striking out six.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Braves have beaten the Dodgers five times in the last
eight days. ... There were two late lineup scratches -- one by each
team. Jordan didn't start because of a sore left rib cage, and
Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros sat out because of stomach flu.
... Braves 2B Quilvio Veras went 0-for-3 with two walks, ending his
career-high 12-game hitting streak. ... It appears Braves OF Reggie
Sanders, who sprained his left ankle in San Diego last Saturday,
won't play before Friday night when the Braves entertain
Philadelphia. ''It's still real swollen, but I'm disappointed, I
want to be in there tomorrow,'' said Sanders, no doubt motivated by
a .139 batting average. ... Joyner, who brought a .440 career
batting average against Park into the game, played first base in
place of Andres Galarraga. Joyner's homer was his first in his 21st
at-bat of the season. ... The Dodgers grounded into four double
plays and Sheffield hit three. He hit into only two in his team's
previous 25 games. ... Braves P Tom Glavine pinch hit in the ninth
and grounded out.

<HEADLINE> N. Carolina Gubernatorial Race Set  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Democratic state Attorney General Mike
Easley and former Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot, a Republican,
won their party nominations Tuesday in a race to succeed popular
Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen candidates in all jumped into the race when Hunt, a
Democrat who served four terms over the past 25 years, was barred
by law from seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of precincts reporting, Vinroot had 126,963
votes, or 47 percent, to defeat state Rep. Leo Daughtry, who had
96,967 votes, or 36 percent. Former state Rep. Chuck Neely had
42,840 votes, or 16 percent. Easley drew 268,632 votes, or 59
percent, to defeat Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker, who had 161,822 votes,
or 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winning candidate in each party had to
get more than 40 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, conservative Rep. David McIntosh won the GOP
nomination to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon.
With 80 percent of precincts reporting, he had 234,455 votes, or 72
percent of the vote. He defeated John Price, a lawyer who toured
the state in a red school bus, and drew 92,493 votes, or 28
percent. O'Bannon had no opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional races in both states drew heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, however, appeared light with the Republican and
Democratic nominees for president all but final. George W. Bush and
Al Gore already have won the necessary number of delegates, and
they won more Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, Gore drew 75 percent of the Democratic vote, while
former rival Bill Bradley won 22 percent. Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
had 3 percent. Bush drew 81 percent and former rival John McCain
drew 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Bush drew 78 percent, while former rivals
McCain drew 11 percent and Alan Keyes drew 8 percent. Gore had 70
percent, while Bradley drew 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., Gore drew 96 percent of the Democratic
vote. Bush had 75 percent, and McCain had 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, North Carolina's governor from 1975 to 1983 and re-elected
to two more terms starting in 1993, is one of the state's
best-known politicians, with approval ratings exceeding 70 percent.
He did not endorse any of the 13 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Wicker and Easley argued over how best to
strengthen education programs with money from a not-yet-approved
state lottery. Easley, a 50-year-old former state prosecutor, ran
unsuccessfully for Senate in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for
governor in 1996, and Daughtry criticized each other's conservative
record on spending and abortion, while debating whether to use
attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were seven Democrats, four Republicans and two
Libertarians running.
</P>
<P>
   A recount appeared likely in the North Carolina district of
Democrat Rep. Mel Watt. With 99 percent of precincts reporting
early Wednesday, Republican history teacher Chad Mitchell led a
tight race with 4,711 votes, or 41 percent, against gourmet coffee
shop owner John Cosgrove's 4,614 votes, or 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lines of Watt's district, which runs from Charlotte to
Greensboro, are being challenged in federal court by critics who
allege it was drawn with an unconstitutional emphasis on race. In
1992, Watt became one of the state's first two black congressional
representatives in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Also in North Carolina, both parties fielded woman candidates
for the lieutenant governor's race for the first time -- state Sen.
Beverly Perdue for the Democrats, and state Sen. Betsy Cochrane for
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, former radio talk show host Mike Pence defeated a
crowded field to win the GOP nomination for the seat for McIntosh's
east-central district. Attorney Robert Rock won the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, faced no primary opposition. In
the fall, he will go up against Democratic attorney David Johnson,
an adviser to O'Bannon.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Veto Stands  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chalk up another one for Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two senators won the latest round Tuesday in the
long, ongoing congressional struggle over whether to ship thousands
of tons of nuclear waste to the Nevada desert for storage.
</P>
<P>
   By a 64-35 vote, the Senate failed to override President
Clinton's veto last month of legislation that called for sending
waste now at power plants in 31 states to a central Nevada facility
as soon as 2007. The vote was three senators short of the
two-thirds needed.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill held out hope for another vote later this
year, but Nevada's lawmakers said they're confident they will again
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 34 votes, we will always have 34 votes,'' vowed Sen.
Harry Reid, D-Nev., referring to the minimum needed to sustain a
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been trying for years to establish a temporary
storage site for used reactor fuel now kept at 72 nuclear power
plants around the country. Scientists continue to study a permanent
underground burial site for the waste at Yucca Mountain, also in
Nevada, about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   This time, both the Senate and House for the first time passed
the legislation, but both votes were shy of being veto proof,
prompting President Clinton on April 25 to block it.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill argue that the government had promised to
assume responsibility for the waste, but so far has failed to do
so, leaving electric utilities in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply cannot allow (the nuclear industry) to strangle on
its own waste without a viable alternative,'' Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska, chief sponsor of the bill, said during four hours of
debate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowksi urged his fellow senators ''to put this issue behind
us for once and for all'' and accused the White House of refusing
to address the issue of nuclear waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Without a central storage facility, said Murkowski, the country
would have ''80 mini-Yucca mountains'' that aren't designed for
long-term storage of waste and will remain highly radioactive for
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   But Reid and Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., maintained that the
waste can be kept in dry casks at reactor sites for as long as 100
years, and by then other approaches to waste disposal could be
developed. Most people in Nevada are vehemently opposed to the
proposed shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation requires the government to begin shipping wastes
from reactor sites beginning in 2007 if the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission issues a license for a permanent waste repository at
Yucca Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Senate try at overriding Clinton's veto was even
closer than the numbers suggested, prompting supporters of the
measure to hold out hope for another try later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who switched to a
''no'' vote in a procedural move that will allow him to revive the
measure, favors the legislation, as does Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,
who was absent. Murkowski noted that with those two votes, a veto
override was but one vote short.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Lincoln
Chafee of Rhode Island continued to be the only Republicans to
oppose the bill. But the Nevadans lost a Democrat -- Sen. John
Edwards of North Carolina had opposed the waste bill in the
original vote, but joined in voting for a veto override on Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Group names Sankoh, Khamenei, Milosevic as press enemies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A rebel leader from Sierra Leone, the supreme
leader of Iran and the president of Yugoslavia head the list of
''10 Enemies of the Press,'' which was scheduled for release today
by the Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Slobodan Milosevic and
the others on the list ''use methods that range from outright
torture and murder to more subtle techniques aimed at keeping
uncomfortable truths from being told,'' said Ann Cooper, the
committee's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The annual list from the New York-based press freedom group also
includes the leaders of Cuba, China and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, of Sierra Leone, led the list. He is the leader of the
Revolutionary United Front, a rebel movement that CPJ accused of
killing at least eight journalists during the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He is new to the list, as is Khamenei, of Iran, who came in
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The CPJ said that Khamenei has created a repressive atmosphere
for reformist newspapers and that 16 newspapers were forced to
close after a speech he made last month.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, of Yugoslavia, was cited on the list for the second
consecutive year. According to the CPJ, authorities in Yugoslavia
have ''intensified their crackdown on the independent Serb media
with an almost daily barrage of attacks on press freedoms in the
first few months of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In Yugoslavia and Iran, threats are so severe that independent
media are in grave danger of becoming extinct in the near future,''
said Cooper, the CPJ official. ''Elsewhere, in China and Cuba,
opposition voices have used new technology to circumvent
restrictions, prompting new reprisals from leaders determined to
control information.''
</P>
<P>
   The others on the list are:
</P>
<P>
   --Jiang Zemin, president of China, who CPJ alleges had 18 Chinese
journalists in jail at the beginning of this year and uses secret
police to monitor the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   --Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, president of Tunisia, who has
''brought Tunisia's press to its knees with newspaper closures, the
prosecution of reporters, economic pressures against publications
and intimidation by security forces,'' CPJ said.
</P>
<P>
   --Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakstan, who promised
freedom of the press when the country gained independence in 1991
but has a Soviet Union-like stranglehold on information, CPJ said.
</P>
<P>
   --Fidel Castro, president of Cuba, accused by CPJ of keeping four
independent journalists in jail because of stories critical of the
Cuban system.
</P>
<P>
   --Jose Eduardo dos Santos, president of Angola, who allegedly has
made public mention of the rebel organization UNITA a crime.
</P>
<P>
   --Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru, described by the CPJ as
pooling his resources to cripple the thriving and vigorous press
that existed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   --Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister of Malaysia, accused by CPJ of
controlling most major media in the country for nearly 20 years and
pressuring his country's small opposition press.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, Castro, Ben Ali, Fujimori and Mahathir have appeared on
the list before.

<HEADLINE> Tower Air shuts down passenger service  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tower Air was known by travelers for its
no-frills approach, discounted airfares and delays. Now the airline
that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year has stopped
its passenger service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still operating charters and military flights but not
passenger flights,'' Pam Buoninconcri, director of corporate
relations for Tower, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger flights were discontinued Monday night, leaving some
ticketholders scrambling to find space on other carriers. The
airline had been flying to Los Angeles; Miami; San Juan, Puerto
Rico; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and Tel Aviv, Israel.
Flights to San Francisco; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Athens, Greece,
and Paris were dropped as problems mounted in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 Tel Aviv-bound passengers first learned the bad news
when they arrived Monday at John F. Kennedy International Airport
for their 11:30 p.m. flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those of us who had tickets already, who bought the tickets,
paid for them,'' said Andre Joseph, interviewed on the cable
television station New York 1. ''And finding out right now, in the
rain, that you're stuck here, that's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoninconcri said she did not know how many other flights had
been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, said Port Authority staffers at Kennedy were
helping the stranded passengers book flights on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mosley, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of
Transportation in Washington, said other carriers are not required
to honor Tower tickets but may do so.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Bishop-Cross, a spokeswoman for TWA, said the airline
would not accept Tower tickets but added: ''If someone has a Tower
Air ticket we will sell them a ticket and we will work with them to
get them the best deal possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoninconcri said passengers with Tower tickets could ask either
their travel agents or their credit card companies for refunds. She
said Tower could not provide refunds at this time ''because of our
bankruptcy position.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower Air Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
February in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, the airline, based at Kennedy Airport, said it
intended to cut 300 jobs, or 19 percent of its work force, and
reduce the size of its fleet by returning planes to their lessor.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Nachtomi, the company's president, chief executive and
chairman of the board, holds 77.2 percent of Tower's voting
securities, according to the bankruptcy filing. Nachtomi is the
managing general partner of the Nachtomi Family LP, which holds the
vast majority of those shares.
</P>
<P>
   Tower was known for low fares -- less than $400 round trip from
New York to Los Angeles, for example -- and spotty service. Delays
were routine, and Tower's fleet of aging Boeing 747s required
frequent maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the wrong airplanes with the wrong routes with the
wrong pricing,'' said Julius Maldutis, an airline industry analyst
with CIBC World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Maldutis said other airlines have successfully emerged from
bankruptcy reorganization but that Tower would need ''a clear-cut
management strategy to turn the company around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, a
Washington D.C.-based organization that represents airline
passengers, said a number of factors contributed to Tower's
apparent woes, including fuel price increases and competition from
other low-priced carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he noted, the leisure travelers whom Tower targeted
can now shop for low fares at Web sites like Priceline.com and
Lowestfare.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of places for people to go in the marketplace
to find low fares,'' Stempler said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Tower would resume passenger service at some
point, Buoninconcri said, ''I can't predict the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said the majority of Tower's employees have been let go,
adding, ''We will retain the services of the staff that will be
required to maintain our reduced operation and comply with
regulatory requirements.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Back on Time Warner for Now  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission scolded Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co. for taking
ABC off the air for 3.5 million customers, saying viewers shouldn't
be held hostage to their dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should never happen again,'' William Kennard said
Tuesday, shortly after ABC's signal was restored following a
39-hour blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard's warning came after the corporate warriors put off, but
didn't settle, their quarrel over what Disney would be paid to
provide its cable channels to Time Warner customers.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers became a part of the long-running dispute at 12:01 a.m.
Monday, when ABC service was cut off for Time Warner customers in
seven cities, including New York, Houston and Los Angeles. The
blackout started a run on rabbit-ear antennas and satellite TV
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The truce came suddenly during a Tuesday news conference called
by Time Warner Cable chairman Joseph Collins. He offered Disney a
six-month extension to continue airing ABC's signal, putting off
their fight over the cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had earlier rejected an eight-month extension. Collins
said ABC programming would not be restored until ABC had agreed to
the extra time.
</P>
<P>
   While he was talking, his remarks televised live by Time
Warner-owned CNN, Disney executives faxed a statement saying they
would agree to put off the dispute to July 15. Collins stepped away
from the microphone to confer with his associates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to accept this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a half hour, WABC-TV in New York was back on the air,
showing ''General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC said it was ''gratified that Time Warner is now making the
viewers their first priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney had asked the FCC to rule on its contention that Time
Warner violated the law by dropping ABC's signal during a ratings
sweeps month. Agency officials said Tuesday's agreement does not
preclude the FCC from acting on the request.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner claims that Disney is insisting upon an additional
$300 million to air its cable channels, including The Disney
Channel, Toon Disney and the Soap Opera Channel. Disney said that's
a fair price, considering Time Warner is getting ABC for free.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse had driven down Disney's stock over the past two
days as investors feared that a prolonged showdown could have an
impact on ABC's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Time Warner wanted resolution of
the dispute delayed as long as possible, until after federal
regulators ruled on the company's merger with America Online.
Disney has opposed the merger of its rival media giant.
</P>
<P>
   The affected customers were in seven markets served by ABC-owned
television stations. About 1.5 million were in the New York City
area, 665,000 in Houston and 440,000 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
Smaller numbers of customers in the Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif., areas were also blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's competitors were only too happy to step into the
breach. EchoStar Communications was offering affected Time Warner
customers a free satellite dish and free installation of its Dish
TV service if they signed up for a year of programming. ABC was
also talking with DirecTV about paying for customers' new dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is certainly a dispute that we're seeking to capitalize
on,'' said Bob Marsocci, spokesman for DirectTV.
</P>
<P>
   The lost viewers didn't put much of a dent in the ''Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' juggernaut Monday, though. The celebrity version
drew the largest audience ever for television's most popular show,
an estimated 35.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media
Research.

London, German Exchanges To Merge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The London Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse have
agreed to merge their share-trading operations, the London exchange announced
Wednesday. The combined exchange would be Europe's largest stock market and
serve as a regional counterweight to Wall Street. The two national exchanges
will each own 50 percent of the new entity, which is to be called iX, for
International Exchanges, and headquartered in London. Under the merger
agreement, shares in blue-chip companies would be traded in London, while shares
in high-tech firms would be traded in Frankfurt, the London Stock Exchange
announced.

   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Rebels said two foreign hostages died during a
pre-dawn clash Wednesday between military troops and Muslim guerrillas holding
21 people on Jolo island in the southern Philippines. But military officials
expressed skepticism about the claim, saying they had no knowledge of any
fatalities among the hostages captured last week from a Malaysian resort. Nur
Misuari, the government's hostage negotiator, later said he had conflicting
reports about whether the two hostages were dead or only injured.

Puerto Ricans Wait To Be Expelled

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican protesters waited for U.S. federal
authorities to expel them from the U.S. Navy's prized training ground -- even as
several U.S. lawmakers and a religious leader promised to come show their
support. Some 50 protesters on several campsites in the bomb-littered range and
dozens more in front of its main gate say authorities will have to arrest them
to clear the range, which has been idle since stray bombs killed a civilian
guard in April 1999. A few have threatened to scatter into the bomb-strewn bush,
endangering themselves and any pursuers.

ABC Back on Time Warner for Now

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
scolded Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co. for taking ABC off the air for 3.5
million customers, saying viewers shouldn't be held hostage to their dispute.
''This should never happen again,'' William Kennard said Tuesday, shortly after
ABC's signal was restored following a 27-hour blackout. Kennard's warning came
after the corporate warriors put off, but didn't settle, their quarrel over what
Disney would be paid to provide its cable channels to Time Warner customers.

Riggs, 28, was the fifth woman executed in the United States since the Supreme

<HEADLINE> London, German Exchanges To Merge  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The London Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche
Boerse have agreed to merge their share-trading operations, the
London exchange announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The combined exchange would be Europe's largest stock market and
serve as a regional counterweight to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The two national exchanges will each own 50 percent of the new
entity, which is to be called iX, for International Exchanges, and
be headquartered in London.
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger agreement, shares in blue-chip companies would
be traded in London, while shares in high-tech firms would be
traded in Frankfurt, the London Stock Exchange announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-German Bourse also has a formal cooperation agreement
with the U.S. Nasdaq market, which is dominated by technology
stocks. The London exchange did not give specifics on this link-up
with Nasdaq but said it did not involve mutual ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announcement ends two years of fitful efforts by the
London and Frankfurt exchanges to combine.
</P>
<P>
   They began trying in 1998 to form the hub of a pan-European
stock market and later enlarged their plan to include six other
national stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious effort foundered when London and Frankfurt
apparently failed to reach agreement over issues of ownership and
the type of trading platform to be used in a regional exchange. It
was not immediately clear how the two exchanges resolved their
differences over the trading platform.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Europe's national stock exchanges to consolidate has
intensified due to the introduction last year of a single European
currency, the euro, together with competition from U.S. markets and
electronic share-trading networks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a three-way regional exchange was formed by stock
markets in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. The trio tried, without
success, to persuade the London exchange to join them. Such a move
would have left the Frankfurt bourse relatively isolated in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-German merger underscores the growing power of
Frankfurt as a financial center rivaling London. While the London
exchange has a larger market capitalization, the Frankfurt market
is more diversified and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Share trading in Europe has soared in popularity as more private
individuals invest for their retirement and institutions find it
easier to buy shares in companies listed elsewhere in the 11
euro-zone countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, which is eager to expand in the region, unveiled a plan
in November to create an Internet-based European network called
Nasdaq-Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to begin operating late this year, the network is
aimed at helping the region's high-growth companies raise money
while also making it easier for Europeans to invest in blue-chip
American and Asian stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how Nasdaq's expected linkup with
the combined Anglo-German exchange would affect Nasdaq-Europe.

<HEADLINE> Favorite's Curse Shadows 'Pegasus'  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Maybe a Hall of Fame trainer can break
the Kentucky Derby favorite's curse.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale was elected to thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame
on Tuesday, and now faces the unenviable task of trying to win
Saturday's Derby with favored Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   If the $4 million colt can do it, the victory would end a
21-year streak of beaten favorites; the last favorite to win the
Derby was Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But on Derby day, anything can happen when 20 of the best
3-year-olds enter the starting gate to race a grueling 1\ miles at
Churchill Downs. Last year, 31-1 shot Charismatic broke through for
the win, and in '95 it was 25-1 shot Thunder Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wildly run race,'' Cot Campbell of Dogwood Stable,
which sends out Trippi and Impeachment in the Derby, said Tuesday.
''There's the jockeys' nerves, the horses' nerves, everybody's
nerves. There's the distance, and there's the knowledge that the
form of these horses has not yet been crystalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put that all together and many times you never even have a
true favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, the witty 52-year-old Englishman, doesn't seem
bothered by the curse, even though his '92 Derby favorite A.P. Indy
was scratched the morning of the race with a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's continuing to strengthen,'' Drysdale said of Fusaichi
Pegasus, winner of four in a row, including a dominating win in the
Wood Memorial. ''I've been watching him work and he looks good
going over the ground. I'm happy to see him in good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith, who gets the call on long shot Globalize, is
familiar with favorite failure in the Derby. He rode three
favorites and finished second on Prairie Bayou in '93, 12th on Holy
Bull in '94 and fifth with Unbridled's Song in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to get a handle on it, but the best horse doesn't
always win,'' Smith said. ''In Fusaichi Pegasus, you know he has
the ability. But whether he has the stamina and mind for it, you
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is still amazed at Holy Bull's effort, especially because
the gray came into the race off dominating wins in the Florida
Derby and Blue Grass Stakes. After the Derby, he went on to become
Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just didn't run a lick in the Derby,'' Smith said. ''He was
dull during the week, dull in the post parade, didn't leave the
gate, and just went through the motions. He probably was the best
horse going in, but there are a lot of things that can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of explanations why favorites aren't winning
the Derby: new surroundings, the distance, strange track surface,
full 20-horse fields, media-frenzy, bad betting.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the public's penchant for betting horses coupled in
the wagering: 1983 winner Sunny's Halo probably would have been
favored over the entry of Marfa, Balboa Native and Total Departure.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert subscribes to the bad-betting theory. He saddled the
last two Derby favorites, the entry of Excellent Meeting and
General Challenge in '99; and Indian Charlie in '98. Baffert's Real
Quiet won in '98 as the fifth choice in the betting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indian Charlie was the favorite, but I knew Real Quiet was
doing better than any of them leading up to the race,'' said
Baffert, who sends out Captain Steve on Saturday. ''I think the
media makes them favorites. It has a lot to do with it. You guys
are bad handicappers.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris McCarron, who will be aboard top contender The Deputy,
says experience counts when it comes to pulling off a clean trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''The favorite has to run the best race of his career because
there's so much traffic, everyone's head is down and we're riding
as hard as we can,'' McCarron, a two-time Derby winner, said.
''Even the best horse still needs a clean trip to get it done, and
if you've done it before you have a better idea of what's going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, is trained by
Jenine Sahadi, looking to become the first woman to train a Derby
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pletcher will saddle four horses in his first Derby, and
says ''a lot of people betting on this race usually don't bet on
races. They go by what they read.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at Fusaichi Pegasus. He's never run at Churchill Downs,
but based on past performance he's the favorite. He did take his
race to New York and ran big, and maybe he can do it here, too.
We'll just have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher trains undefeated Trippi and Impeachment for Campbell,
and also will send out Blue Grass runner-up More Than Ready and
Arkansas Derby winner Graeme Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In was pulled out of Derby consideration after a subpar
workout Tuesday morning. The Arkansas Derby runner-up will be
pointed to the Preakness on May 20. The decision clears the way for
China Visit, owned by Godolphin Racing, to join the field.

<HEADLINE> Hill Panels Begin Writing Bills  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional committees are beginning to
write spending bills for fiscal year 2001, with top Republicans
acknowledging that election-season clashes with President Clinton
over priorities are likely.
</P>
<P>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee planned to debate a roughly
$2.4 billion bill today financing Congress' own operations. The
measure is expected to be approved despite Democratic claims that
it would force layoffs of 1,700 congressional personnel.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a separate appropriations subcommittee used a voice
vote to approve the first spending bill, providing $8.6 billion for
military construction. That legislation, loaded with money for
virtually every state, is traditionally among the most popular of
the 13 annual spending measures that keep agencies functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with White House budget chief Jack Lew threatening
Clinton will veto bills that shortchange his plans for schools,
land conservation and other programs, GOP leaders said this could
be a confrontational year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy working with Jack Lew,'' said House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. ''I'm satisfied there will be
a lot of opportunity for me to enjoy that pleasure'' in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Urban Institute, Lew said unless Republicans
provide more money for administration priorities in the spending
bills, ''the president simply cannot and will not sign them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew said Clinton wants about $20 billion more for education and
other domestic programs than Republicans seem ready to provide,
which is about $293 billion. The overall federal budget is about
$1.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The military construction measure finances facilities like bases
and housing. It would provide nearly $300 million more than this
year's total, and $600 million more than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   However, it includes only $83 million of the $104 million
Clinton requested to build radar facilities in Alaska as part of a
possible anti-missile defense system the administration is
considering deploying. The subcommittee said it might provide the
additional money later.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Chief Federal Judge Faces Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former U.S. attorney will conduct an inquiry
of the chief federal judge in the District of Columbia, who
assigned the prosecutions of alleged campaign fund-raising
improprieties and the Whitewater case to be heard by Clinton
appointees, legal sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry has already caused repercussions, with a defense
attorney in one of the campaign fund-raising prosecutions seeking a
delay until the inquiry is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Joe D. Whitley, who served as a U.S. attorney
in the Reagan and Bush administrations, is a rare step for judicial
disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley will work for a five-judge panel that is overseeing a
misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson to determine why she bypassed the normal random
case assignment system, legal sources at the courthouse said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases, the prosecution of 1996 Clinton-Gore
fund-raiser Maria Hsia, the chief judge asked the Justice
Department to request that the case be sent to U.S. District Judge
Paul Friedman, a Clinton appointee. Hsia was convicted of five
felonies last summer and in post-trial motions is asking Friedman
to throw out the convictions. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., has asked
Johnson to testify about her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The allegations of wrongdoing by Chief Judge Johnson carry
with them implications of favoritism and partiality by this
court,'' Hsia lawyer Nancy Luque said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding in the midst of the judicial inquiry and a
congressional investigation would ''damage the public belief in the
impartiality of the judicial system and risk Ms. Hsia's right to
unquestionably unbiased scrutiny of her prosecution,'' Luque added.
</P>
<P>
   Luque said that ''it might be appropriate'' for Friedman to
disqualify himself from considering post-trial motions if he does
not grant a delay in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The cases that Johnson assigned to Clinton judges included those
of presidential friends Webster Hubbell, a Whitewater figure, and
Charlie Trie, a Clinton fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   After The Associated Press first disclosed special assignments
in the Trie and Hubbell cases last year, Johnson wrote a letter
saying her decision was not politically motivated and simply was
designed to shift complex cases to judges with open schedules. She
has never addressed her actions in the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the findings of Whitley and the five judges, the panel
will make a recommendation to the Judicial Council of federal
appeals and district judges, who must decide whether to discipline
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The council's decision could be appealed to the Judicial
Conference, the policy-making body for the U.S. court system.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Whitley is an unusual move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of any parallel situation in which it became
known that an outside investigator has been hired,'' said New York
University law professor Stephen Gillers. ''Usually it's all done
internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitley declined comment through a secretary at the Atlanta law
firm where he works.
</P>
<P>
   He served as U.S. attorney in Macon, Ga., from 1981-87, then
moved to the Justice Department in Washington, where in 1989, he
became acting associate attorney general, the department's No. 3
post. From 1990-93, Whitley served a second stint as U.S. attorney
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> House Questions US Computer Expert  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials will be asked to explain
to lawmakers why they abandoned plans to retrieve thousands of
missing e-mails that might have been of interest to investigators
examining a variety of allegations against the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee today will question a
White House computer expert, Karl Heissner, who in early 1999
outlined a way to fix the problem of recovering large amounts of
e-mail that had not been placed into a searchable archive.
Heissner's steps weren't acted on at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also will hear from Michael Lyle, director of the
White House Office of Administration, and Robert Raben, assistant
attorney general for legislative affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle's office dealt with the e-mail problem beginning in June
1998 and passed on information about it to the White House
counsel's office, which was responsible for producing documents to
congressional investigators, the Justice Department and Independent
Counsel Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Raben will be questioned about committee chairman Rep. Dan
Burton's request that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special
counsel to investigate the e-mail controversy. Reno has not
responded.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles Ruff will testify Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of today's hearing, the White House dropped a
potential executive privilege claim and turned over to Congress
several handwritten notes from lawyers that were being sought by
investigators in the controversy over missing e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making these seven documents available today to your
committee,'' White House counsel Beth Nolan wrote Burton. ''We are
not waiving the right to assert executive privilege or
attorney-client privilege with respect to future requests.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue were handwritten notes by White House lawyers involving
discussions they had with computer experts about the missing e-mail
since the controversy first erupted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House initially declined to turn over the memos,
saying they included the ''mental impressions'' of presidential
lawyers and may be protected by the president's right to keep
confidential the advice he receives.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not formally invoke the executive privilege,
instead listing the documents and saying they were subject to such
a claim. Burton, R-Ind., criticized the maneuver as ''legal
mumbo-jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee as well as federal prosecutors are
investigating why the White House, after discovering a glitch in
1998 that kept e-mails from being properly archived, did not
immediately retrieve the missing messages to determine if they
should have been turned over to investigators under subpoenas
issued in investigations from Whitewater and impeachment to
political fund-raising.

   The White House did not formally invoke the executive privilege,
instead listing the documents and saying they were subject to such
a claim. Burton, R-Ind., criticized the maneuver as ''legal
mumbo-jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee as well as federal prosecutors are
investigating why the White House, after discovering a glitch in
1998 that kept e-mails from being properly archived, did not
immediately retrieve the missing messages to determine if they
should have been turned over to investigators under subpoenas
issued in investigations from Whitewater and impeachment to
political fund-raising.

<HEADLINE> FDA Rebukes Gene Therapy Researcher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- In a sharply worded warning letter, federal
officials accused a gene therapy researcher of failing to follow
key patient safeguards or properly report the death of a volunteer
patient.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged violations were outlined in the nine-page letter
dated April 28 and sent by the Food and Drug Administration to Dr.
Jeffrey Isner, a Tufts University scientist who headed the trials
at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One patient was included in a trial even though he had cancer, a
fact the FDA said could have been exacerbated by the treatment
which encourages blood vessel growth that in turn can feed tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said the patient's lung tumor doubled in size within
three months of being treated.
</P>
<P>
   The research team, whose trials were halted by the FDA in March,
also allegedly failed to investigate and properly report the death
of another patient.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the therapy caused her death 4{ months
after she received an injection of genetic material directly in her
heart. But the FDA said Isner only told hospital overseers of
complications despite being ''well aware'' of the death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deviations in these studies appear to be the result of a
serious lack of knowledge of your responsibilities as principal
investigator including supervision of personnel,'' the FDA letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said the enrollment of ineligible subjects, such as
the cancer patient, ''can be a serious protocol deviation.'' It
said such patients may have faced ''an unreasonable and significant
risk of illness or injury'' and that their inclusion may have
tainted the results of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Isner has 15 days to respond with a plan to correct the
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy attempts to repair or replace abnormal genes in
seriously ill patients by transferring synthetically manufactured
genes into the body.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy has been under close scrutiny since the death of an
18-year-old volunteer in an experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania in September. The patient died of liver failure after
he received an injection of genes designed to correct a genetic
liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have concluded that the experiment was not in
compliance with federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston trials sponsored by Vascular Genetics of Durham,
N.C., were aimed at growing new blood vessels around blocked heart
and leg arteries in patients who could not undergo traditional
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Isner could not be located for comment by The Associated Press
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   St. Elizabeth's spokeswoman Sonia Hagopian said the hospital is
taking the letter seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''It raises some questions about some aspects of care and
record-keeping and the medical center is in the process of putting
together a thoughtful and thorough response,'' Hagopian said in
today's Boston Herald.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to complete state swing  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign was unveiling its first television ad today, a 30-second
spot that will air statewide beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the ad was ''a
positive, biographical'' ad that doesn't mention the first lady's
Senate rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The ad focuses on the work Clinton has done over the 30 years in
public life.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani has already been advertising on television off
and on for several months, the Clinton spot is the first to be paid
for by her campaign. Late last year, the Democratic state committee
with money from the federal Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee ran an ad boosting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She was kicking off a two-day foray across northern New York
today that at its end will mean she has visited all 62 of New
York's counties in her 10 months on the Senate campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope noted Tuesday that
was not accomplished by Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer until late
last year, a full year after he defeated Republican incumbent
Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton is in the process of redefining New York state
politics, throwing traditional formulas out the window with her
relentless attention to counties that heretofore have been
ignored,'' Hope said. ''Clearly, upstate New York will be
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hope said the first lady's visit to all 62 counties was
not aimed at helping her overcome charges that she is a
carpetbagger, aides to Senate rival Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pressed
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton can travel to as many counties, as many times as
she wants,'' Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said
Tuesday. ''It will not change the fact that she's never lived in
New York, never worked in New York and she has absolutely no
connection to New York. There's only one real New Yorker in this
race, Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton moved to the suburbs north of New York City in January.
She planned stops today in Washington, Hamilton and Franklin
counties.
</P>
<P>
   While the first lady was preparing Tuesday for her trip,
Teitelbaum tapped a veteran Republican operative to bolster the
mayor's upstate campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor, who learned last week that he has
prostate cancer, has been criticized by some fellow Republicans for
not spending enough time in traditionally more conservative upstate
New York while the first lady has been crisscrossing what is
expected to be a major electoral battleground this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows this state like the back of his hand,'' Teitelbaum
said as he announced that state GOP executive director Brendan
Quinn will become director of statewide field operations for the
Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. George Pataki continued to brush off questions
about whether he would take up the GOP Senate banner if the mayor
drops out of the race. ''I believe he will continue to run,''
Pataki said. Beyond that, the governor said, ''I'm not going to
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Pataki is the top choice among
Republican voters to take on Clinton if Giuliani drops out of the
race. The mayor said he will make his decision before the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the campaign trail, aides to Giuliani were working
on setting up a meeting for later this week between the mayor and
state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long. The two have been
at odds over the mayor's refusal to come out for a ban on what
critics call ''late-term abortion'' and his strong ties to the
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, with Long's encouragement, former U.S. Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi announced he would seek the nominations of the
Conservative, Right to Life and Independence parties. A DioGuardi
candidacy could drain conservative votes away from the mayor, a
liability in a close race. Polls show the race is close.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Long said that ''at this stage of the game'' he did
not see Giuliani being the Conservative Party's candidate and
believed the nomination would go to DioGuardi. But Long cautioned
that could change before the party's June 3 state convention.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani said he would court the Conservative Party,
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady would
ask the Liberal Party for its support although party boss Raymond
Harding is one of Giuliani's top political advisers. Both Giuliani
and Clinton are scheduled to meet with the Liberal Party's policy
committee Saturday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count the votes they receive on third-party ballot lines, a factor
in close races. In New York, no Republican has won statewide office
since 1974 without the Conservative Party line. Conversely, no
Democrat has been elected U.S. senator or governor without the
Liberal Party line since the party's founding in 1944.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers pushing $12.3 billion budget through General Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- With a midnight deadline looming, the
House was poised to give final legislative approval today to a
$12.3 billion budget that cuts taxes, boosts spending and plugs
holes in program shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate unanimously passed the spending side of the
budget Tuesday. The Senate then passed a $171 million tax cut
package to the House. The General Assembly must finish its business
by the time the legislative session ends at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts are in addition to $123 million in tax breaks approved
by the Legislature last year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new breaks, drivers would get some relief at the pumps
with a 7-cent gas tax cut, and shoppers would keep some extra cash
in their pockets under increased clothing tax exemptions and a week
of tax-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes $75 million in tax breaks to the
state's hospitals and $54 million in cuts for industry and
broadcasters, of which $15 million goes to Bristol-based ESPN. The
sports broadcasting giant is planning a $500 million expansion of
its world headquarters that could mean up to 1,000 new jobs in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 billion budget is about $150 million more than what
the Legislature agreed to spend last year for the 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   About $40 million of the increase is going to new programs; the
rest is needed to make inflation adjustments and cover agencies and
programs running in the red.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Medicaid program, Department of Correction and
Department of Children and Families needed cash infusions.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also earmarks $3 million for enhancements at the
state's three juvenile detention facilities in Bridgeport, Hartford
and New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   About $4.4 million is slated to ease prison overcrowding by
creating more treatment programs. Since last year, 484 Connecticut
inmates have been transferred to a Virginia prison to thin the
state's prison population.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have nonviolent offenders in treatment center and
free up needed beds,'' said Sen. Donald Williams, D-Killingly.
</P>
<P>
   About $1.5 million is being used to expand eligibility
requirement for the state's ConnPace prescription drug program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted more, but that's palatable enough for now,'' said
Rep. James Amann, D-Milford. ''It will be able to help some
individuals this year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to budget expenditures, lawmakers were poised to
carve up about $250 million of surplus money.
</P>
<P>
   About $20 million of that is earmarked for a bailout of
deficit-plagued University of Connecticut Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another $34 million of the surplus would be doled out to towns
in one-shot grants. Municipalities would be able to decide how best
to use the grant money, which ranges from $22,000 for Union to $3.3
million for New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus also will sink $43 million into school construction
and $10 million into getting classrooms wired for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We care about schools because we have provided money for
school construction,'' said Rep. William Dyson, D-New Haven. ''We
care about the schools because we're making sure the digital divide
doesn't get any wider.''
</P>
<P>
   While the budget intends give students a leg up in the
classroom, it also gives their parents a break in paying for school
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic backed measure pushed the clothing tax exemption
from $50 to $75. In return, the GOP won out on a one week-long
sales tax exemption on clothing priced up to $300.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax cut is expected to save $85 to $140 a year for a
family that drives 30,000 miles. In addition, lowering the tax
would keep Connecticut drivers from crossing state lines to fill
their tanks at cheaper prices, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   Although the budget represents a series of compromises between
Democrats and Republicans, the two sides failed to agree on a
tuition tax credit plan proposed by Republican Gov. John G.
Rowland. The budget will not include the proposal to give families
up to $500 to send their children to private schools. Opponents of
the tax credits say they're too much like vouchers that would drain
money from public education.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also dropped a proposal to whittle adults out of the
state's HUSKY health care plan -- a program they had argued is too
costly and could have saved the state about $32 million. The
program was originally designed to provide health care for
uninsured children, but was expanded to include their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 billion budget stays about $51 million under the
state's mandatory spending cap. But expenditure of the surplus
breaks the spending cap by about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also is expected to approve a package of bonding
projects.

<HEADLINE> Report: grand juror to look into dispute over murder evidence  </HEADLINE>
sfnhrdsrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A grand jury will investigate a dispute
between North Haven and New Haven police involving a murder
investigation, the New Haven Register reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting unnamed sources, the newspaper said a panel of three
judges has approved a request for a grand jury to consider whether
New Haven police supervisors criminally withheld evidence from
North Haven authorities in a 1996 murder case.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also reported that the New Haven State's
Attorney's Office, which launched the investigation earlier this
year, transferred the case to the chief state's attorney in Rocky
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Michael Dearington and Police Chief Melvin H. Wearing
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Dearington began investigating the New Haven
detective bureau's handling of evidence in the 1996 murder of North
Haven resident Phillip Cusick.
</P>
<P>
   Dearington applied for a grand jury when his investigation
stalled, the Register reported. A grand jury's investigative powers
are stronger than the state's attorney's.
</P>
<P>
   Cusick's body was found Nov. 6, 1996, in front of his home in
North Haven, but police suspect he was shot in New Haven and dumped
there. North Haven police have made no arrests in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, two New Haven detectives took a statement from an
informant that allegedly implicated a suspect, but there is some
dispute over whether that evidence was given to North Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives Stephen G. Coppola and Edwin Rodriguez taped the
statement and brought it to their supervisors, who allegedly told
them to drop the investigation.

<HEADLINE> DC Chief Federal Judge Faces Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former U.S. attorney will conduct an inquiry
of the chief federal judge in the District of Columbia, who
assigned the prosecutions of alleged campaign fund-raising
improprieties and the Whitewater case to be heard by Clinton
appointees, legal sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry has already caused repercussions, with a defense
attorney in one of the campaign fund-raising prosecutions seeking a
delay until the inquiry is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Joe D. Whitley, who served as a U.S. attorney
in the Reagan and Bush administrations, is a rare step for judicial
disciplinary proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley will work for a five-judge panel that is overseeing a
misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson to determine why she bypassed the normal random
case assignment system, legal sources said Tuesday. The sources,
some who worked at the federal courthouse in Washington, spoke only
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases, the prosecution of 1996 Clinton-Gore
fund-raiser Maria Hsia, the chief judge asked the Justice
Department to request that the case be sent to U.S. District Judge
Paul Friedman, a Clinton appointee. Hsia was convicted of five
felonies last summer and in post-trial motions is asking Friedman
to throw out the convictions. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., has asked
Johnson to testify about her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The allegations of wrongdoing by Chief Judge Johnson carry
with them implications of favoritism and partiality by this
court,'' Hsia lawyer Nancy Luque said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding in the midst of the judicial inquiry and a
congressional investigation would ''damage the public belief in the
impartiality of the judicial system and risk Ms. Hsia's right to
unquestionably unbiased scrutiny of her prosecution,'' Luque added.
</P>
<P>
   Luque said that ''it might be appropriate'' for Friedman to
disqualify himself from considering post-trial motions if he does
not grant a delay in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The cases that Johnson assigned to Clinton judges included those
of presidential friends Webster Hubbell, a Whitewater figure, and
Charlie Trie, a Clinton fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   After The Associated Press first disclosed special assignments
in the Trie and Hubbell cases last year, Johnson wrote a letter
saying her decision was not politically motivated and simply was
designed to shift complex cases to judges with open schedules. She
has never addressed her actions in the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the findings of Whitley and the five judges, the panel
will make a recommendation to the Judicial Council of federal
appeals and district judges, who must decide whether to discipline
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The council's decision could be appealed to the Judicial
Conference, the policy-making body for the U.S. court system.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Whitley is an unusual move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of any parallel situation in which it became
known that an outside investigator has been hired,'' said New York
University law professor Stephen Gillers. ''Usually it's all done
internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitley declined comment through a secretary at the Atlanta law
firm where he works.
</P>
<P>
   He served as U.S. attorney in Macon, Ga., from 1981-87, then
moved to the Justice Department in Washington, where in 1989, he
became acting associate attorney general, the department's No. 3
post. From 1990-93, Whitley served a second stint as U.S. attorney
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 112; Nasdaq Down 29  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly lower today as
interest-rate worries weighed on traders seeking direction in a
quiet market.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 112.62 to 10,618.50.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 11.57 to 1,434.72, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 29.71 to 3,755.74.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for a second session as interest-rate fears kept
many buyers on the sidelines. The Federal Reserve is widely
expected to raise interest rates on May 16 in its continuing bid to
slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting a quarter-percentage point
increase, but worries that the Fed could boost rates by as much a
half-percentage point are rattling the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next key piece of economic data will hit the market on
Friday, when the Labor Department releases employment data for the
month of April. Until then, analysts say, investors will continue
to move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bestfoods rose 12 1/16 to 62|. Late Tuesday, the maker of
Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise rejected an $18.4
billion takeover offer from multinational consumer products
conglomerate Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The offer valued Bestfoods at 66 per share, a 31 percent premium
to Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday. But Bestfoods said the offer
was not financially adequate and not in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever fell 2| to 22[.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were mostly lower after Goldman Sachs removed
several prominent retailers from its list of recommended stocks.
Kohl's fell 3~ to 47 15/16, Target fell 3[ to 65} and Costco fell
3[ to 51|. All were downgraded from ''recommended'' to ''market
outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 124.96 million
shares, on par with Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 3.21 to 502.14.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 0.8 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Safety Chief for Capitol Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to speed up preventive measures in a
Capitol complex cited for fire code violations, a bipartisan group
of lawmakers proposed today that Congress establish a Director of
Fire Safety and Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which has been planned for some time, nonetheless
came a day after a congressional report concluded there was much
work to do before the Capitol and other congressional buildings met
fire codes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the office under the Architect of
the Capitol would take over preparation of a comprehensive plan to
correct the violations and regularly test Congress' fire protection
and warning equipment. He said that bringing the complex in
compliance with fire codes was ''vital not only for the people who
work here, but also for the millions of tourists who visit each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., founder of the Congressional Fire and
Emergency Services Caucus, called the bill ''an attempt to head off
a potential disaster before it happens. Our lack of preparedness
would be considered a gross violation at any American
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar bipartisan legislation was being planned in the Senate,
Hoyer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House inspector general Steven A. McNamara
reported that the architect's office, which maintains congressional
buildings, has yet to replace most defective sprinklers 16 months
after fire safety problems were first reported -- and a
comprehensive safety plan had not been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The major progress has been in installation of new smoke
detectors, and a system of alarms, strobe lights and speakers that
would warn of a fire emergency, McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the AOC made improvements to House fire protection
systems, they continue to take a haphazard approach to planning,
implementing installing and completing fire protection systems
throughout the House complex,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara found:
</P>
<P>
   --Not all firefighting components within a building are connected
to a central station, which would monitor the systems and provided
up-to-date information to emergency responders.
</P>
<P>
   --The architect is moving slowly in replacing sprinklers that the
Consumer Product Safety Commission identified as defective. Of
5,270 replacement sprinkler heads that were provided for the House
side of the complex, only 1,300 have been installed.
</P>
<P>
   --Despite the need for new emergency doors, unobstructed exit
routes, better exit signs and evacuation planning, much of that
work has not been done. Proper doors have not been installed, most
emergency exits are not connected to alarm systems that would allow
automatic opening, many exit signs are not visible and evacuation
studies have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The architect's spokesman, Bruce Milhans, said his office agreed
with the conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have indeed taken steps to improve and have significant
steps ahead,'' he said. ''We're already working on a comprehensive
fire protection plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Milhans said architect officials are conducting overall
assessments of fire risks and then will complete a
building-by-building plan along with a schedule of priority
projects. ''Some projects have been funded and if they haven't,
we've asked for funding. We're well on the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Congress' health and safety agency issued formal
citations ordering the architect to fix fire safety hazards that
jeopardize the lives of lawmakers, their staffs and thousands of
daily visitors.

   London, German Exchanges To Merge
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges plan to
merge, creating Europe's largest stock market and a powerful
regional counterweight to Wall Street. Under the plan announced
today, the London exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse would each
own 50 percent of the new entity, which is to be called iX, for
International Exchanges. Headquarters will be in London. Shares in
blue-chip companies would be traded in London, while shares in
high-tech firms would be traded in Frankfurt, the London Stock
Exchange said. The Anglo-German union includes a joint venture
agreement with Nasdaq Europe Ltd., the European subsidiary of the
technology-heavy U.S. Nasdaq market, to create a European market
for high-growth stocks.

   Factory Orders Rebound Strongly
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to American factories bounced back
in March, rising a bigger-than-expected 2.2 percent, led by the
largest jump in demand for electronic equipment in more than two
years. The Commerce Department reported today that factory orders
rose to a seasonally adjusted $383.2 billion after showing no
change in February and declining in January. March's 2.2 percent
increase in factory orders was the best showing since a 3.8 percent
gain in December and was stronger than the 1.6 percent rise many
analysts were anticipating. The Federal Reserve has boosted
interest rates five times since June 30 in an effort to slow the
red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. But the hikes
have not done much to cool demand.

   Bestfoods Nixes Unilever Bid
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. buying spree by international consumer
products conglomerate Unilever has hit a snag, with Bestfoods'
rejection of an $18.4 billion takeover offer. Bestfoods, the maker
of such household food products as Skippy peanut butter and
Hellmann's mayonnaise, said yesterday its board had unanimously
rejected the $66 a share bid. Unilever, whose brands include Lipton
teas, Vaseline and Pepsodent toothpaste, agreed last month to
purchase Vermont gourmet ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's for around
$326 million and diet foods company Slim Fast Foods for $2.3
billion. It's offer for Bestfoods represented a 31 percent premium
over the company's closing price of 50 9/16 in trading yesterday on

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co.'s top executives have announced
plans to boost employee morale by improving compensation, closing

Chairman Doug Daft and president Jack Stahl spoke to employees
yesterday in separate meetings, spokesman Ben Deutsch said. The

Germany's Nemax 50 Index could unjustifiably depress the value of

   Oil Cos. Commit $100B to Saudi
</P>
<P>
   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Western oil companies have committed
to invest $100 billion over the next 20 years in Saudi Arabia's oil
and gas sectors, the official who oversees oil policy said today.
Prince Saud al-Faisal, who is foreign minister as well as head of
the Supreme Petroleum Council, did not name any of the companies
but said they were among the industry's ''super-giants.'' Saudi
Arabia is the world's No. 1 oil producer and exporter. He said no
specific agreements had yet been signed and that a negotiating
committee would be formed over the next few weeks to work out the
details. He said he expected negotiations to be finalized by the
end of the year. Saud said that the national oil company Aramco
will participate in the execution of the projects.

internationally. Under the plan, the majority of the banks,
including two public sector banks, would be grouped into financial
institutions with a minimum capital of 30 billion Sudanese pounds

<HEADLINE> Albright Wants Security Improved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
admittedly ''furious'' over recent security lapses at the State
Department, exhorted department employees Wednesday to ensure that
the nation's secrets don't fall into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   A stern-faced Albright summoned the employees to a ''town hall''
meeting to discuss her concerns following the unexplained
disappearance of a laptop computer containing highly sensitive
information last February and an incident last year in which a
seventh floor conference room to found to have been bugged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not wish to underestimate what has happened here,''
Albright said, ''It is huge and terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   A standing room only crowd, including virtually all of the
department's most senior officials, jammed the department's main
auditorium to hear Albright's impassioned pleas for greater
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are not a professional about security, you are a
failure,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Albright transferred two office directors in response
to the lapse that led to the disappearance of the computer. She
also announced a five point plan to guard against such security
breakdowns in the future
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the missing laptop contained large quantities of
documents about arms proliferation issues, including highly
sensitive information about sources and methods of U.S.
intelligence collection.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 126; Nasdaq Off 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a broad retreat today as
interest-rate worries weighed on traders seeking direction in a
quiet market.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 126.19 to 10,604.93.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also falling. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 22.28 to 1,424.01, and the Nasdaq
composite index was down 100.69 to 3,684.76.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for a second session as interest-rate fears kept
many buyers on the sidelines. The Federal Reserve is widely
expected to raise interest rates on May 16 in its continuing bid to
slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting a quarter-percentage point
increase, but worries that the Fed could boost rates by as much a
half-percentage point are rattling the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next key piece of economic data will hit the market on
Friday, when the Labor Department releases employment data for the
month of April. Until then, analysts say, investors will continue
to move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is looking for some comfort in the numbers to come
on Friday,'' said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at
First Union Securities in Chicago. ''Especially for investors in
the Old Economy stocks, interest-rate worries are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bestfoods rose 10 1/16 to 60|. Late Tuesday, the maker of
Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise rejected an $18.4
billion takeover offer from multinational consumer products
conglomerate Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The offer valued Bestfoods at 66 per share, a 31 percent premium
to Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday. But Bestfoods said the offer
was not financially adequate and not in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever fell 2| to 22[.
</P>
<P>
   Several other food companies rose today as investors anticipated
that any or all could come into play. Heinz rose 3 9/16 to 37{ and
Campbell Soup rose 2 3/16 to 28 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were mostly lower after Goldman Sachs removed
several prominent retailers from its list of recommended stocks.
Kohl's fell 5 5/16 to 46{, Target fell 4] to 64{ and Costco fell 3
5/16 to 51 7/16. All were downgraded from ''recommended'' to
''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Wal-Mart fell 3 13/16 to 53 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 304.66 million shares
at late morning, slightly behind Tuesday's pace. On the Nasdaq,
decliners led by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 3.21 to 502.14.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse students will track bombing trial for victims' families  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Syracuse University is forever linked to
the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing. Now, the university is providing a
link for the victims' families so they can follow the murder trial
of the accused bombers on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Syracuse University law students will provide daily
summaries and explanations to the victims' families and relatives
as part of a project funded by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea was the families needed better access to the
information that was going to be coming out at the trial than they
would get just through the general media,'' Andrew Greenberg, the
project's associate director, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, most of them are not going to be there. There was
no other resource for the families to get the detailed information
they want,'' said Greenberg, adding that project is unprecedented
but could open the way for future coverage of transnational trials.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan nationals Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah went on trial today in a Scottish court holding session in
The Hague. The two are accused of murder, conspiracy to commit
murder and violations of international safety laws in the Dec. 21,
1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The 270 people killed in the bombing represented 21 nations.
Among the dead were 35 students studying overseas under a Syracuse
University program.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Syracuse has maintained a close association with
the victims' families. The university started a scholarship program
in honor of the Lockerbie victims and built a memorial wall on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the close relationship with the families that prompted
the U.S. Justice Department to ask Syracuse to set up the Web site,
said Donna Arzt, director of the university's Center for Global Law
and Practice and the project director. The justice department
provided a $100,000 grant to help create the site, called the
Lockerbie Trial Families Project.
</P>
<P>
   Though a university-created Web site with information on the air
tragedy is available to the public, the comprehensive trial
coverage will be exclusively for the families, who were issued
special passwords by the justice department to gain access to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an intranet site rather than an Internet site,'' said
Arzt, who is attending the first two weeks of the trial. A total of
about 700 victims' relatives worldwide will have access to the
family site, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The justice department arranged with the Scottish court for
daily transcripts, which will be unofficial and uncorrected. A
dozen law school students, with the assistance of a handful of
professors, will process the transcripts and post them on the Web
site, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse will receive the transcripts around 11 a.m. every day,
when the court is ending at 5 p.m. in the Netherlands. Greenberg
said the goal is to get a summary written and posted within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everything works magically, perfectly, we'll know by Friday
what kind of response we're getting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Syracuse group also will provide explanations of legal
procedures and legal language.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to be able to understand why certain information is
coming out, and why it's coming out in certain forms, and why
certain information is not coming forth,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   An interactive component will allow families to ask questions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public site has been up since November and usage has been
growing steadily. In March, there were 10,000 hits by 445
individuals, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Families of U.S. victims also can view the trial on closed
circuit television at four special sites around the country. The
video will be shown on a tape-delay basis.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Russia Research May Pose Risks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backed by a new congressional report, the
House Armed Services Committee chairman today said that joint
research with Russian biological scientists poses serious risks for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., released a General Accounting Office
report that said a collaborative program with Russian scientists
formerly involved in weapons programs may ''exacerbate or create
risks'' in the field it is aimed at safeguarding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress must carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of
this program to ensure that it does not have unintended
consequences that could jeopardize the national security,'' Spence
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation, funded in part by the Pentagon's program to
reduce the threat of nuclear weapons from former Soviet states,
provides work for Russian scientists so they will not share their
scientific knowledge and biological weapons expertise with
potentially troublesome states.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report by the GAO, Congress' investigative arm,
said the program could help sustain Russia's existing biological
weapons program by ''maintaining or advancing Russian scientists'
skills to develop offensive biological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. funds could end up supporting this research, the report
said, noting that nothing prevents scientists working with the
United States from also participating in activities at weapons
facilities that remain closed to foreign inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 1999, Congress has provided about $20 million to fund
collaborative research projects intended to shift former biological
weapons scientists in the former Soviet Union to peaceful research
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed spending another $220
million over the next four years to expand those efforts to former
Soviet biological weapons institutes.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's first turn as a comedian
went so well that he decided to treat reporters to an encore
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before boarding Air Force One to fly to Kentucky, the
president turned to his wife Hillary, sitting in a limousine on the
tarmac, and held up a brown paper bag with an unidentified item
inside.
</P>

   The move was an apparent homage to his own performance in a

<HEADLINE> Female Sex Dysfunction Device OK'd  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women with sexual problems can now try the
first government-approved medical device to help them achieve
orgasm by pumping blood into the clitoris.
</P>
<P>
   While Viagra and penile devices have revolutionized impotence
treatment for men, women's sexual problems haven't fared as well.
In fact, women's sexual dysfunction has largely been considered a
psychological problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Food and Drug Administration has approved a medical
device called Eros that treats a physical problem behind ''female
sexual arousal disorder.'' The rationale behind the device is that
blood flow into the clitoris is as important for women's sexual
arousal and satisfaction as blood flow into the penis is for men.
</P>
<P>
   Eros, made by UroMetrics Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., consists of a
soft suction cup to be placed over the clitoris. A tube attaches it
to a handheld, battery-operated vacuum device. Users need only to
switch on the vacuum, turning it up or down as needed, for a few
minutes until the clitoris feels engorged. They then turn it off
and remove the suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved Eros to be sold by prescription only, for women
diagnosed with ''female sexual arousal disorder'' or FSAD, the
female equivalent of impotence. UroMetrics said the device is
available immediately, but did not reveal a price.
</P>
<P>
   Female sexual dysfunction is characterized by the inability to
achieve orgasm, painful intercourse because of vaginal dryness,
lack of clitoral sensation or diminished interest in sex.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many women suffer the problem, although some
estimates suggest half of all women experience sexual dysfunction
at some point in their lives, said Dr. Diane Mitchell, an FDA
gynecologist who reviewed Eros.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, estrogen therapy and vaginal lubricants, to counter
dryness, were women's main options. Viagra, the little blue
anti-impotence pill taken by thousands of men, is being tested in
women with mixed results so far.
</P>
<P>
   Eros becomes the first FDA-approved product to address clitoral
dysfunction. In a study of 15 women diagnosed with FSAD, 80 percent
reported increased sexual satisfaction and some reported orgasms.
The study also included 10 normal women, some of whom reported more
sexual satisfaction as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Eros did not help every women, Mitchell warned. ''This
device is not going to be a panacea,'' she said.

   DENVER (AP) -- A do-not-resuscitate order: What is it, why have
one and under what conditions should it be signed? Gregg Parish, an
estate planning expert at the College for Financial Planning,
discusses the medical order that focuses specifically on emergency
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a retiree in rapidly deteriorating health. I've been
told I should consider getting a 'do-not-resuscitate order.' What
is it?
</P>
<P>
   A. A do-not-resuscitate, or DNR order, is an official medical
order signed by a doctor that tells hospital or other medical staff
that you do not want to have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
performed should you stop breathing or your heart stops. A DNR
order is part of the broader category of advance medical directives
that provides for medical decisions to be made when a person is too
sick or unable to make decisions for himself or herself. A living
will and a durable power of attorney for health care are the other
forms of advance medical directives.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why should I consider a DNR order?
</P>
<P>
   A. People who are in the late stages of cancer, experiencing
kidney failure, severe heart problems, or other serious illness
that is likely to attack the cardiopulmonary system may want to get
a DNR order if they don't wish to prolong their illness. People who
get a DNR order often have already been revived at least once with
CPR.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may not want to be revived again because they have
decided they want to die in peace,'' says Parish. ''You might call
it a 'quality of death' issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial issues are another reason someone might get a DNR
order. They may feel they've worked hard to build an estate and
they don't want to give much of it away at the end of their life to
doctors and hospitals. Even with insurance, you can still end up
owing money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is a DNR order different from a living will or durable
power of attorney for health care?
</P>
<P>
   A. A living will is a broader document designed for someone who
is terminally ill or in a permanent coma. ''It generally addresses
whether you want certain medical treatments, such as the
continuation of nutrition and hydration, that would only prolong
the dying process,'' Parish says. While a living will addresses
more non-emergency situations, a do-not-resuscitate order focuses
specifically on emergency CPR.
</P>
<P>
   A DNR order should never be considered an order not to provide
regular medical treatment to a person. It applies only if cardiac
or respiratory arrest occurs.
</P>
<P>
   A durable power of attorney for health care gives power to a
spouse, relative, or friend to make medical decisions on behalf of
someone who is not able to make competent health care decisions.
One of those powers might be to execute a DNR order for the maker
of the power of attorney, says Parish.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do I obtain a DNR order?
</P>
<P>
   A. Forms can be obtained from a hospital or your doctor's
office. State statutes typically provide a sample. The person fills
in the blanks, and it must be signed and notarized before
witnesses. The person must be 18 or older to execute a DNR order,
though parents can execute one on behalf of a child in
circumstances prescribed by state statute.
</P>
<P>
   Check carefully with your state laws regarding DNR orders. ''All
states have DNR statutes, but they vary from state to state,'' says
Parish. For example, some states allow DNR orders to be carried out
only in a hospital, while other states allow them to be used
outside the hospital, such as in an ambulance or at home.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do medical professionals know you have a DNR order?
</P>
<P>
   A. ''It's up to the individual to let the health care provider
know,'' Parish says. ''People often put these (orders) in a bedside
drawer and consequently health care providers never know they have
one. It's where mistakes are commonly made that can nullify the
intent of a DNR order.''
</P>
<P>
   The document should be filed with a physician or hospital. Some
people wear a bracelet or necklace that tells medical professionals
they have a DNR order and where it can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when people travel, move permanently, or live part time in
another state, they often forget to take their original order with
them. Some people are pushing to have a national registry for DNR
orders, which would reduce this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Parish stresses that people should be sure a DNR order is turned
into a doctor's order. ''Don't leave it with the receptionist at
the front desk,'' Parish says. ''The doctor must issue the order
and put it into your medical chart. Be sure the order is signed.
Many people fail to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the order with your family and doctor. A study
published in 1998 in the medical journal Circulation found that
cardiologists were wrong 24 percent of the time regarding whether
their patients wanted to be resuscitated or not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can I change my DNR order?
</P>
<P>
   A. It can be changed or nullified at any time, as long as you
are competent at the time.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Lily King  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA NOONAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Lily King's gentle debut novel, ''The
Pleasing Hour,'' centers on a young American au pair who becomes
part of the emotional life of a French family.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of-age tale set in Paris has been compared by critics
to the fiction of Henry James and Jane Austen and to the 1997
postmodern comedy, ''Le Divorce,'' by Diane Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The novel has also become something of a first-time author's
success story, generating a bidding war between several publishers
before Atlantic Monthly Press agreed to pay nearly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The novel has a first printing of 45,000 copies, more than twice
the average for a literary debut. Scribner has reportedly paid a
six-figure sum for paperback rights, and ''The Pleasing Hour''
enjoys prominent display in Barnes &AMP; Nobles stores nationwide as
the chain's most recent recipient of the Discover Great New Writers
Award.
</P>
<P>
   It's all been quite a reception for an easygoing 35-year-old
author who still enjoys membership in a book club, filling in as a
substitute high school English teacher and taking care of her
infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But King says she's not fazed. ''I try not to put too much
pressure on myself,'' she says with a laugh, during an interview at
a local bakery cafe.
</P>
<P>
   While King herself spent time as a part-time au pair for a
''wonderful'' French family shortly after college, the story of
Rosie, who skips out on college to go to Paris to work as an au
pair, is decidedly nonautobiographical, King says.
</P>
<P>
   The book's heroine is a thoughtful and sensitive young woman
running from a very real demon: the recent surrender of an infant
son to her infertile older sister.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie escapes to the Tivot family -- parents Marc and Nicole, and
their three children, Odile, 16, Lola, 12, and Guillaume, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Rosie finds herself in a strange competition with
beautiful, judgmental Nicole, and is quickly waved aside by Odile
and Guillaume, too old and too young -- respectively -- to need her.
</P>
<P>
   But Lola and Marc both crave the closeness and acceptance they
can't get from the emotionally unavailable Nicole, and gravitate
toward Rosie's warmth.
</P>
<P>
   King, a graduate of the University of North Carolina, said the
inspiration for ''The Pleasing Hour'' didn't come until the final
semesters of graduate school at Syracuse University, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Outlines of Rosie and the Tivots emerged in two, unsuccessful
short stories she wrote at Syracuse. The stories weren't well
received by her creative writing classmates, but the author was
positive there was something special.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody liked them,'' King recalls with a laugh. ''But I didn't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried about letting the material fade away, King vowed to keep
up with the novel after leaving Syracuse to teach high school
English in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrical, almost poetic writing in ''The Pleasing Hour'' was
a departure from the trends King had witnessed in graduate school,
where short, terse sentences, a la Raymond Carver, were the rage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying to put a lot more care and attention into my
language,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long gestation of ''The Pleasing Hour,'' the
hardest character to flesh out was Nicole, the Tivot's cold,
enigmatic mother, a figure who stayed distant until the final
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wasn't turning into anything but an ice queen,'' recalls
King. ''It was very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the author drew on the memory of female friend of her
host family as a model for developing the character of Nicole. It
worked.
</P>
<P>
   After the manuscript was accepted, and a publication date was
finalized for early 1999, King learned she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing she couldn't manage a 16-city book tour in the latest
stages of pregnancy, the publication date was pushed back until
September. Then, King and her 6-month-old daughter, Calla, went on
the tour together, met by friends and family in almost every city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pleasing Hour'' fans are predominantly women, but middle-aged
men and Francophiles also are drawn to the story. So, King was not
surprised to see a considerable cadre of men showing up at book
signings for a novel about women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is an underappreciated, unexplored population of
men reading and liking (so-called women's) literature that focuses
on language and history,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   King has no plans for a ''Pleasing Hour'' sequel, but has
embarked on a novel about a mother who teaches English at the her
son's high school. Tentatively set in the late 1970s, the book will
deal with themes of alcoholism and loss, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Massachusetts, King cites as her literary influences
Shirley Hazzard's ''Transit of Venus'' and ''Evening of the
Holiday,'' as well as Virginia Woolf's ''To the Lighthouse'' and
Marilyn Robinson's ''Housekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   She now lives in Cambridge, just a few miles from Harvard
University, with her husband Tyler Clements, an Internet
entrepreneur and writer, and their baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   King says she continues to enjoy teaching English from time to
time, and is in the middle of ''War and Peace'' for her book club.
</P>
<P>
   The club, a collection of friends who love writing and reading,
recently chose ''The Pleasing Hour'' as a selection. The group had
nothing but positive comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very supportive,'' King recalls, smiling. ''They
knew I was very vulnerable.''

<HEADLINE> Rare Stroganoff Art Works Shown  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN DuBOIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- It's a Russian story, but the elements are
universal: war, business, politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   And the Portland Art Museum is attempting to tell this 500-year
epic with ''Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian
Noble Family,'' a $3.5 million exhibit running through May 31.
</P>
<P>
   A chance meeting between museum director John Buchanan Jr. and
Baroness Helene de Ludinghausen, the last Stroganoff, brought the
exhibit here. It took four years to organize and has drawn more
than 100,000 visitors since its February opening.
</P>
<P>
   The Stroganoff family of salt barons was so wealthy it once
provided 20 percent of Russia's total tax revenue. It was so
powerful it financed Russian military campaigns for four centuries
and hired mercenaries to conquer Siberia for themselves and Ivan
the Terrible.
</P>
<P>
   They also loved art, collecting and commissioning thousands of
pieces from the 1500s to the 1900s. With its immeasurable impact on
Russian culture, the family even became synonymous with a style of
art called the Stroganoff School.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1917, the Bolsheviks chased the Stroganoffs away,
nationalizing the Stroganoff palace in St. Petersburg and
scattering the art works throughout Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 230 of those pieces have been reunited, shown outside of
Russia for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday afternoon, hundreds of visitors ignored the
predictable Oregon rain to pack the exhibit, putting on headsets as
they shuffled through the various rooms, admiring the marbles, the
bronzes, the Botticellis, the historical documents and the big
malachite coupe, generally the centerpiece of the Malachite Room at
the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   But they also were drawn to the ornate furniture, and most
people gawked at the coupe, a green stone basin cradled by a gilded
stand. It was commissioned by Count Alexander Stroganoff, the
family's most prolific collector.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians did not want the basin to leave their country, but
de Ludinghausen insisted. The baroness, who has set up a foundation
to restore Russia's palaces and museums, had a huge hand in this
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the economy the way it is, the (Russian) government is no
longer able to support museums,'' says Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, the
curator, noting that cash-starved Russian museums have struggled
since the fall of communism. ''They are strapped. They're looking
for western money.''
</P>
<P>
   As she whittled through thousands of pieces to form the exhibit,
Hunter-Stiebel says she didn't want to just throw art in people's
faces; she wanted to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   Tapes for adults and children provide context, as do some
historical documents. And it's easy to identify with religious
paintings and portraits of various Stroganoff family members,
including Mouton, the family Spaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't need a Ph.D. to respond to this stuff -- it wasn't
made for that,'' Hunter-Stiebel says.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibit highlight is a re-creation of the Stroganoff
palace's paintings gallery. This is where Alexander Stroganoff,
propped in a chair, spent his dying hours looking at works by
Botticelli, Poussin, Van Dyck and others.
</P>
<P>
   An old Russian proverb says ''Richer than the Stroganoffs,
you'll never be.'' Perhaps that's why people just don't have
private collections like this anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely the most exciting project I've ever worked
on,'' said Hunter-Stiebel, who's based in New York City. ''It
touches on the underlying issues of the art world. Right now, the
whole notion of private collecting has been questioned, with people
believing they are cultural possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling piece isn't even part of the official
exhibit, it's a giant picture of the Stroganoff palace as it looks
today: elegant chandeliers dangling above chipped walls and
ripped-up floors.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the damaged palace, it's hard not to think of the
revolution, especially when you listen to de Ludinghausen's
contradictory message on the explanatory tape. On it, the baroness,
who lives in France, concludes with this: ''One of the reasons I'm
so happy about this exhibition is that it shows how people of all
the different classes in old Russia contributed to the vitality of
it.''

<HEADLINE> Two Recall Painting With O'Keeffe  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Two men a generation apart have similar
stories to tell about painting with Georgia O'Keeffe.
</P>
<P>
   John Poling, a philosophy professor at St. Olaf College in
Northfield, Minn., and Jacobo ''Jackie'' Suazo, a retired state
employee in Santa Fe, each recall being welcomed by O'Keeffe at her
Abiquiu home, doing chores and, ultimately, being allowed to paint
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Poling has written a bittersweet memoir, ''Painting With
O'Keeffe,'' and Suazo has filed copyright claims for at least three
paintings once attributed to O'Keeffe. Those three paintings are
part of the so-called Canyon Suite of 28 watercolors challenged by
experts associated with the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say they were hired to do chores -- the 9-year-old
Suazo, to water O'Keeffe's trees in the 1940s, and Poling, to paint
the wooden trim on her house in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Poling says he worked with O'Keeffe when she was 88 and her
eyesight was failing. He said he helped her paint three canvases --
two of them views of the Washington Monument and one of a patio
door at her house.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident that O'Keeffe could barely see, he says in a book
that paints a poignant portrait of the artist as an elderly woman
dependent on her assistant, Juan Hamilton. It shows her wanting to
create but unable to execute the works she could see so clearly in
her mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Poling says he followed her explicit instructions in laying out
those paintings for her, with O'Keeffe standing beside him while he
painted. O'Keeffe herself added some touches, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The patio door painting was shown as her work at a dinner party
with several of her friends, Poling said, and one of the Washington
Monument paintings was presented in an ARTnews magazine article as
new work by O'Keeffe without noting Poling's assistance, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Poling said the article made him feel as though he were part of
a deception, and he asked O'Keeffe to set the record straight. The
confrontation ended their relationship on a bitter, painful note.
</P>
<P>
   His book quotes O'Keeffe as accusing him: ''You're just after
something for yourself, aren't you?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the dispute landed with a splash in a Santa Fe weekly
newspaper, The Reporter. It carried two articles including comment
by O'Keeffe, Hamilton and Poling. Hamilton suggested Poling write a
letter noting his concerns to the Beinecke Library at Yale
University, where the O'Keeffe papers are kept for scholars.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe was quoted as saying in the newspaper: ''He was nothing
but a tool. ... He had no thought, no part in the painting, except
that he could do what I told him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Minnesota, Poling recalled:
''O'Keeffe said I was the equivalent of a palette knife.''
</P>
<P>
   He said she misunderstood his intentions and, had he been able
to explain his feelings better, she would have understood.
</P>
<P>
   Poling's assistance on the Washington Monument paintings is
acknowledged in the just-released ''Catalogue Raisonne'' of
O'Keeffe's work jointly issued by the National Gallery of Art and
the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Poling says he was told the painting of the patio door was
destroyed because of technical problems that arose with the work,
and there is no mention of it in the ''Catalogue Raisonne.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe continues to be an inspiration for Poling, who teaches
a course called ''Georgia O'Keeffe: Philosophy and Art.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It uses O'Keeffe's life and her art, what it is to be an
artist, what it is to be successful as a human being and how
O'Keeffe in many ways brought those things together in a striking
way,'' he says of the course. ''She said so many on-target things
about art.''
</P>
<P>
   Poling met O'Keeffe partly through the connection of his father
-- the Rev. David Poling, a Presbyterian minister -- with the
neighboring Presbyterian Church-owned Ghost Ranch. He knew little
about the artist back in 1976 but has done much study about her
since.
</P>
<P>
   He believes ultimately in her integrity, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he sometimes imagines what it would have been like if things
had ended differently for the friendship between him and O'Keeffe.
He would have liked to have helped her paint additional canvases,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked to see the other things that would have
happened with that collaboration,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo, on the other hand, claims he lived with O'Keeffe -- almost
as a foster child -- with the approval of his mother, who lived
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''These arrangements my mother didn't like very much, but later
she realized the association between me and Miss O'Keeffe was very
good for me,'' Suazo says. ''Miss O'Keeffe started helping me all
the time on how to do art work.''
</P>
<P>
   He did oil, acrylic and watercolor paintings as well as drawings
with charcoal, pencils and pastels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we had 100 paintings that I did,'' he says, and they
were kept in a large storage room, or ''salita,'' at O'Keeffe's
adobe home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, when Suazo joined the Marine Corps, he left the
paintings with O'Keeffe. He never saw any of them again -- until, he
contends, he saw one of them printed last fall along with a
newspaper article about the Canyon Suite.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of O'Keeffe's life, he said, he tried to get
the paintings back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried going over there, but they would never let me in. I
didn't know whether my paintings were even still there or they had
thrown them away,'' says Suazo, a retired investigator with the
state Human Rights Division.
</P>
<P>
   When she died, he received $30,000 from the estate but no
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   After the Canyon Suite story broke, Suazo went to Kemper Museum
officials in Kansas City and claimed some of the watercolors were
his.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Washington lawyer Ernie Sanchez filed a copyright
claim on behalf of Suazo. It asserts copyright claims to 13 of the
28 Canyon Suite watercolors Suazo says he collaborated on with
O'Keeffe and an additional three of them he claims he did all by
himself, according to Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo is looking for reproduction rights, in the event anyone
wanted to make prints or posters.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo's claims came after the National Gallery excluded the
works from the ''Catalogue Raisonne.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the paintings surfaced in 1988, two years after
O'Keeffe died, is well known in Canyon, Texas, where O'Keeffe had
been head of the art department from 1916-18 at West Texas Normal
College, now West Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, longtime O'Keeffe friend and confidant Ted
Reid of Canyon gave a packet of watercolors to his granddaughter's
father-in-law. The father-in-law, Emilio Caballero, a prominent
watercolorist and former art chairman at West Texas A&AMP;M, turned the
paintings over to his son and daughter-in-law, who sought to
determine if they were O'Keeffe's.
</P>
<P>
   Once authenticated, Santa Fe dealer Gerald Peters purchased them
for $1 million, then sold them to the Kemper Museum for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then the authentication started to come apart. As work
progressed on the ''Catalogue Rainsonne,'' additional information
surfaced about the paper used in some of the paintings. Such paper
could not have been used by O'Keeffe during her time in Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Peters refunded the money to Kemper, and the paintings were
returned to Peters, who is currently having additional research
done on them.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo said in an interview that he never met Reid and cannot
explain how pictures he painted in the 1940s in Abiquiu could get
mixed in with pictures that supposedly originated 30 years earlier
-- before he was born -- in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was saddened when he saw the paintings but that he
would always love O'Keeffe for all she did for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll love her until I meet her again, I guess,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> 'Re-Animator' Back From the Dead?  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS J. ROWE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Re-Animator'' is just the kind of trippy movie
people high on pot would talk and giggle about -- just as they do in
the latest best-picture Oscar winner, ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're in the cult that remembers the 1985 film about
bringing people back from the dead, you probably didn't catch what
the Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley characters were riffing about when
they're smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Oscar-winning ''American Beauty'' -- which
comes out on video May 9 -- doesn't necessarily translate into
renewed life for ''Re-Animator.'' (And it certainly shouldn't for
its sequel, ''Bride of Re-Animator''.) That's according to Patrick
Mathewes, a researcher at Screenplay, which provides movie trailer
reels for video store use.
</P>
<P>
   ''The average person is less likely to take out a film like
'Re-Animator,''' says Mathewes, whose business is linked to Rain
City Video, a Seattle store specializing in offbeat and
hard-to-find tapes. ''They have sort of a prejudice against it, for
whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than a bias against the genre in this case, he says:
''Some people don't want to see someone walking around without
their head.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, based on an H.P. Lovecraft story, a mad-genius
medical student named Herbert West invents a re-animating serum
that brings the dead back to life. An older doctor wants to take
credit for it, so West lops off his head with a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the young man finds the doctor isn't letting his
decapitation interfere with his sex life, he says: ''I'm very
disappointed in you. You steal the secret of life and death and
here you are trysting with a bubbled-head coed. You're not even a
second-rate scientist ...
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll never get credit for my discovery. They'll never
believe a talking head. Get a job in a sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie anticipated ''Scream'' and ''I Know What You Did Last
Summer'' by having such a sense of humor about itself.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Stuart Gordon, ''Re-Animator'' stars Jeffrey Combs
as West, Bruce Abbott and Barbara Crampton -- all of whom have
recurrently made B horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vrieling, owner of Rain City Video, noted that
''Re-Animator'' was checked out of the store as he spoke and had
gone out more than usual recently -- but there was no way of telling
if that's from the ''American Beauty'' reference or not.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Dennis, owner of the Movie Place in New York, hasn't seen
any spike in rentals of ''Re-Animator.'' And there usually isn't
when a movie just makes a passing reference to another movie, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to ''King Kong'' in ''The Cider House Rules''
didn't result in any uptick of rentals, either.
</P>
<P>
   But in that case, Mathewes said, ''People assume they know all
about that movie even though they haven't seen it in years or may
not have ever seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   The one way that a movie inevitably gets a rush of rentals is
when there's a remake, Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happens all the time,'' he said. ''When 'The Talented Mr.
Ripley' came out, people started renting 'Purple Noon,' which is a
French version of the same story.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that last year's redo of ''The Thomas Crown Affair''
created a call for the original, and he's going to stock another
copy of the original ''Shaft'' in anticipation of this summer's
reprise that'll star Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''American Beauty'' on video could spark renewed interest
in ''Re-Animator,'' Mathewes said.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings to mind some dialogue from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not anymore!''

<HEADLINE> 'Unfortunate Events' Books Praised  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Try pitching this as a series of children's
novels: Three young siblings -- handsome, clever and rich -- lose
their loving parents in a fire that destroys their mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Too gloomy? It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the shell-shocked trio are bounced between a series
of clueless caregivers as a diabolical distant cousin -- an
audacious count who heads a roguish troupe of actors -- relentlessly
pursues the tots, scheming to get his hands on their inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not half bad.
</P>
<P>
   And the pitch seems to have worked as well. Volumes of the bleak
little books, published under the title ''A Series of Unfortunate
Events,'' have sold more than 100,000 copies, with a feature-length
film and television series in the works. ''The Bad Beginning,'' the
first book in the series, is in its sixth printing and plans are
under way to translate the series into four languages.
</P>
<P>
   Written by an enigmatic, pseudonymous author named Lemony
Snicket, the tales are earning high praise and a fierce following
among adults as well as children. The series is illustrated by
Brett Helquist.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Pettid, owner of Reading Reptile, an independent children's
bookstore in Kansas City, Mo., says ''The Bad Beginning'' is her
top-selling book. Pettid read a copy of the manuscript last summer,
just before its September publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''It blew me away,'' she says. ''I loved it. It was so different
from any other fiction I'd read. It was so fresh and so clever --
and dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ''Oliver Twist'' meets ''Matilda,'' with illustrations
by Edward Gorey. The books are ''very gothic'' and more
sophisticated than most marketed for 10-year-olds, the series'
target audience, says Jennifer Brown, children's forecasts editor
for Publishers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The series -- four books so far, with a fifth due in August --
have yet to appear on Publishers Weekly's best-seller list, but
have been well received by the magazine's critics, who gave the
first two books a starred review.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Snelson, editor of children's books at Amazon.com, says
the books are among the best-selling titles for older children at
the online retailer's site. She picked ''The Bad Beginning'' as one
of Amazon.com's top 10 middle-grade books of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely wanted it to get some attention because I thought
it was a lot of fun,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The book this month ranked among the retailer's top 1,500
sellers, Snelson says. ''That's a pretty high rank, especially for
a middle-grade novel.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest volume, ''The Miserable Mill,'' released in April, is
selling nearly as many copies online as ''The Bad Beginning,''
Snelson says. ''They definitely are gaining momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The books' wry humor has made them particularly popular in
Canada, where mainstream humor looks more like Americans'
alternative humor, says series editor Susan Rich.
</P>
<P>
   While no one expects the series -- or any series -- to match the
stratospheric sales of J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter'' books,
Snelson and others say Snicket's books are following the same
word-of-mouth path to popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will just be more kids sharing them with each other,
librarians spreading the word and so on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Pettid and other booksellers are ''hand-selling'' the books,
recommending them highly to customers and promoting the series
through readings and promotional events -- much as booksellers
spread the gospel of Harry Potter. And the books' low price -- $8.95
for the tiny hardcovers -- makes them an appealing commodity.
</P>
<P>
   One Amazon.com customer noted on the company's Web site: ''My
second-grader and I despaired of ever finding a series that we'd
enjoy reading together as much as we enjoyed Harry Potter. We found
it!''
</P>
<P>
   But the series may be most noteworthy for the ways in which it's
not like Harry Potter. There's not a whiff of magic between the
covers -- the wee heroes rely upon their wits, period. Outside,
there are no glowing reviews or airy cover illustrations. Instead,
Snicket's books offer dark, moody portraits and dire warnings to
potential readers. Each book features a blurb that gives readers
the impression they're picking up a bottle of drain cleaner instead
of a children's book.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would
be better off reading some other book,'' the first volume begins.
''In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no
happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   In that unhappy first chapter, Violet, Klaus and Sunny
Baudelaire ride a rickety trolley to Briny Beach one gray day,
unaware that a fire has killed their parents and destroyed their
home and all their lovely belongings. The tiny orphans are taken in
by Mr. Poe, a distracted, consumptive banker and family friend who
packs them off to live with the scabrous Count Olaf. The count, who
forces the children to cook and clean for his friends, a menacing
troupe of actors, wants nothing more than to get his hands on the
children's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   After narrowly escaping the villain in the first book, the
children are sent to live with a series of adults, each of whom
puts the children in harm's way again and again. In each volume,
Count Olaf reappears, thinly disguised, with another plan to grab
the Baudelaires' inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, only the children recognize him each time, and it
often seems as if the only thing standing in the way of their
liberation is an excruciating case of good manners.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Violet, an inventive 14-year-old, her bookish
12-year-old brother Klaus and their baby sister, Sunny (her
strength is in the exceeding sharpness of her four baby teeth) fend
for themselves, enduring knives, falling lamps, lightning storms,
poisonous snakes, man-eating leeches, hook-handed henchmen and a
hypnotic optometrist, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the series' mystique, the books offer virtually no
information about Snicket, a dogged, mournful storyteller forever
on the run, leaving his manuscripts in unlikely places for his
editor to retrieve.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Snicket is ''represented'' by a 30-year-old
novelist named Daniel Handler.
</P>
<P>
   Handler's first book for adults, a dark comic novel titled ''The
Basic Eight,'' was published last year by St. Martin's Press. His
second, ''Watch Your Mouth'' -- which he describes as ''an incest
comedy'' -- will appear this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Handler, a 1992 graduate of Wesleyan University, grew up in San
Francisco. The son of an accountant and a college dean, Handler
started out writing poetry, but soon switched to fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''My poems were getting longer and longer, and more and more
proselike,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Handler wrote short stories and ''most of a novel that I ended
up throwing away.'' Then in 1993, he won an Olin fellowship, which
enabled him to write ''The Basic Eight.'' He later spent two years
writing comedy for ''The House of Blues Radio Hour,'' a syndicated
radio show based in San Francisco. After moving to New York City,
he wrote free-lance movie reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Unfortunate Events'' books took shape after Handler
pitched the proposal -- ''small children placed in despicable
circumstances'' -- to Rich, a children's books editor at
HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   Handler had been toying with the idea of a ''mock gothic novel''
and was tired of chipper stories in which the bully gets his
comeuppance at the end. Why not let the bad guy go? he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Daniel first shared the idea with me, my first fear was
that we might be the only two in the world who thought it was so
brilliant,'' Rich says.
</P>
<P>
   Together they developed the series, striking what Rich calls
''the perfect balance between delight and despair.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark tone grew out of Handler's taste in reading as a child.
He avoided books in which ''everybody goes to camp and has a good
time,'' he says. ''I really preferred books in which a troll came
to town and cut off everybody's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Handler dreamed up the odd pseudonym Lemony Snicket under
duress, during a telephone conversation five years ago. While
researching radical right-wing groups for ''The Basic Eight,'' he
found himself on the phone with a member of one group, who asked
for Handler's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be on their mailing lists,'' he says. The
name Lemony Snicket ''just popped into my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, someone pointed out that the name sounds a lot
like ''Jiminy Cricket,'' which pleases Handler, since Snicket and
Cricket seem similar in important ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always hated that snively, overly moralistic insect,'' he
says. ''It pleases me that my name has been an inadvertent
perversion of him.''
</P>
<P>
   At readings, the 6-foot-tall Handler appears nattily dressed,
apologetically announcing that Snicket, bitten by a bug and
paralyzed from the armpits down, couldn't attend. During the
reading, Handler clumsily slips up. Little by little, children
figure out that he is Snicket.
</P>
<P>
   Handler also has been known to strap on an accordion and deliver
a ballad, Tom Lehrer-style, telling just how evil Count Olaf really
is.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Count Olaf treads a fine line between super-villain
and supreme bumbler. His schemes tend to get more desperate each
time -- in the newest book, he appears in drag, wearing a blonde wig
and pale lipstick, posing as a stubbly-legged receptionist named
Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   ''His profit margin gets slimmer and slimmer with each plan,''
Handler says.
</P>
<P>
   But the relentless count clearly has unsavory thoughts. In fact,
Snicket's scheduled appearances last fall at an elementary school
and bookstore in Decatur, Ga., were canceled after school officials
protested his use of the word ''damn'' in the second book, ''The
Reptile Room,'' and a strange plot twist in ''The Bad Beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In that story, Olaf stages a play in which he forces Violet to
play his bride. The scheme -- to marry the girl for real in order to
steal the family fortune -- collapses when Violet comes up with a
way to wiggle out of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur school officials found the plot a bit distasteful,
Handler says. He waved off criticism of the mock wedding, pointing
out that Violet's cleverness gets her out of the bind.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, not everyone loves the dry satire of the series,
which also includes ''The Wide Window,'' ''The Miserable Mill'' and
''The Austere Academy,'' which will be released in August.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Sutton, editor in chief of The Horn Book Magazine, a
Boston-based children's book review, said he read the first two
books but didn't plan to review them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not to my taste,'' he said. ''I think the humor is
adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Brooks, the children's book buyer for the three-store
Anderson's Bookshop chain in Chicago, said she enjoyed the series,
but added, ''I just wish he'd shake it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most series, the books have worked themselves into a
well-worn groove -- in most of the stories, an adult meets a cruel
end, while the three orphans survive, ready to be packed off to
some other gloomy-sounding spot such as Lake Lachrymose or
Paltryville.
</P>
<P>
   But the series manages to stay strangely uplifting, even through
the march of misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're comforting, in an odd sort of way,'' Pettid says.
''The kids are clever, they're all good at something, they rely on
each other and they're reasonable. Books can be reassuring in a way
that's not sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins has contracted for eight Snicket titles, with
plans to release three per year. Rich says the series' arc will be
complete by the end of the 13th book, with more details emerging
about Snicket's quest to detail the Baudelaire children's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher promoted the first three books with a small book
tour and a ''Magnets for Misfortune'' poetry contest, sending out
sheets of tiny magnetic words and printing the winner's poem in the
dedication to ''The Miserable Mill.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicists also sent out eerie ''chain letters'' threatening
dire consequences if retailers didn't spread the word on the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Handler is on a seven-city book tour this month. Meanwhile,
Nickelodeon is negotiating for the series' film and television
rights, with plans for Handler to write the first screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   As for what readers can expect in the next several volumes, Rich
says, simply: ''More misfortune.''

<HEADLINE> Catatonia a Saucy Import From Wales  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cerys Matthews' reputation precedes her.
</P>
<P>
   It arrives via dozens of British magazine covers, which have
pictured the rock band Catatonia's lead singer decked out in a
white bustier, a skintight rubber suit slit nearly to her belly
button, or posed like a tiger about to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this 29-year-old Welshwoman enjoys life. She was in a
London cab when she heard Catatonia had its first No. 1 single, and
she ordered the driver to stop, hopped into the street with a whoop
and began guzzling champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one in the United States knows her music yet, but
the American magazine Details was smitten enough to put Matthews on
its April cover. It didn't hurt that the black-rooted blonde wears
a midriff-baring tank top, white pants partially unzippered and a
sultry stare.
</P>
<P>
   Details calls her ''the next Courtney Love -- only better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a stretch, but one thing is certain: Cerys (pronounced
CARE-iss) Matthews is no Spice Girl. So it seemed somewhat odd to
find her in a conference room, dressed demurely in a black and gray
pantsuit that made her look like thousands of other Manhattan
office workers.
</P>
<P>
   Is she really the wild woman that the British press have made
her out to be?
</P>
<P>
   ''That gets dangerous, doesn't it?'' Matthews replied.
</P>
<P>
   Catatonia's drummer, Aled Richards, won't let Matthews off so
easily. ''It's something you have to live up to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never live up to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth a try; rock 'n' roll can use more colorful
personalities. Atlantic Records is giving Catatonia a big push in
America, hoping to buck a trend. Despite a rock renaissance in
Great Britain, few of its new bands have made a dent across the
ocean, except for the occasional Oasis single.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews' thick Welsh accent lends a certain drama to
Catatonia's catchy pop-rock nuggets. Their first hit, ''Mulder &AMP;
Scully,'' used the two characters from ''The X-Files'' as a hook
for her urgent lamentation of lost love.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic has released Catatonia's third album, ''Equally Cursed
and Blessed,'' with two earlier British hits added on, ''Mulder &AMP;
Scully'' and ''Road Rage.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, Catatonia played the bars of its native
Cardiff, hardly a musical hotbed. By writing and singing songs
mostly in English, instead of Welsh, they at least showed more
ambition than many of their contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews was busking on the streets in 1992 when she was
approached by guitarist Mark Roberts, who already had a band
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came over and started chatting because he liked my voice,''
she said. ''He said he didn't want to be a singer anymore. He
wanted to get a thick, blond bimbo to stand up for the band and do
the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And you obliged,'' Richards added drolly.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Matthews commenced a four-year relationship that has
since ended, but it didn't end the band. Catatonia's dry years,
spent scuffling for small gigs, gave the quintet the perspective to
deal with its seemingly sudden burst of success.
</P>
<P>
   Being on magazine covers ''is actually quite uncomfortable,''
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go into a shop and you're faced with your own face, so you
walk out again,'' she said. ''I used to read the articles, but I
think it's better not to read them anymore, because they can go
around and do funny things in your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine being somebody like Christina Aguilera, who's really
young, and being all over the world,'' she said. ''I'm at least a
little older and have been around for awhile. It's a very strange
concept, celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Their experience in the United States has been quite the
opposite. Catatonia was briefly placed on the bill for the
H.O.R.D.E. tour a couple of summers ago, playing with bands like
Blues Traveler and Bare Naked Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   In a musical setting that worshipped the 10-minute guitar solo,
Catatonia played three-minute pop songs. Matthews wore stiletto
heels, jewelry and glittery clothes -- and stared out at a sea of
khaki shorts and t-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Catatonia is willing to go through those experiences, and even
laugh in retrospect. Not every British act feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you get to a certain stage, you have to do America,'' she
said. ''And we think that America is no different than anywhere
else -- if you can go somewhere and be accepted for who you are and
people smile at your songs, all the old cliches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bands say that, but they're not prepared to do the work. They
say, 'I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to play to 20 people
in the Midwest. I want to go home and play arenas.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of Catatonia's new songs, ''Londinium,'' pokes fun at
Britain's capital. ''London never sleeps, it just sucks,'' Matthews
sings, pausing wearily for dramatic effect before starting again.
''...The life out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The band still calls Wales home. Richards was taken aback one
day recently when his daughter told him that they were singing one
of Catatonia's songs, ''International Velvet,'' in her school.
</P>
<P>
   The song's one-line chorus -- ''every day when I wake up, I thank
the Lord I'm Welsh'' -- is a counterpoint to verses that outline
some of the country's weaknesses. The irony is lost on most
listeners, since the verses are in Welsh. Richards' daughter and
her classmates are singing it to brush up on their language skills.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews reacts to that news with a mixture of horror and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the death of us,'' she said, ''if we've become school
fodder.''

   Selected new releases:
</P>

<P>
   Handel's ''Alcina'' (Erato, 3 CDs)
</P>
<P>
   This amazing work, completed in 1735, is one of the ''opera
seria'' that the German composer wrote during his long residency in
London. Like most of Handel's operas, it fell into two centuries of
neglect as musical fashions changed. In recent years, ''Alcina''
has been best known as a vehicle for Joan Sutherland, though her
cool technical brilliance was never an ideal match for Handel's
world-weary, tormented heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Now a spectacular new, live recording with a dream cast (taken
from performances at the Paris Opera last year) shows us what we've
been missing.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, soprano Renee Fleming in the title role is every
inch the tragic sorceress the composer had in mind. From her first
aria, ''Di', cor mio,'' there's an achingly sensuous quality to her
phrasing that tells us Alcina is one troubled lady. She may not be
Sutherland's equal in the vocal fireworks department (who is?) but
she is highly impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely less astonishing is the French coloratura Natalie
Dessay, who invests the part of Morgana, Alcina's sister, with a
vulnerable humanity as well as flawless high E's and F's. Listen to
her ''Tornami a vagheggiar'' at the end of Act One (an aria
Sutherland appropriated for Alcina) as a supreme example of the
fiendishly difficult made to seem effortless.
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo Susan Graham has the less showy, but crucial, role of
Ruggiero, a knight who has fallen under Alcina's spell. Other
notable contributors include mezzo Kathleen Kuhlmann and bass
Timothy Robinson. The chorus and orchestra of Les Arts Florissants
are conducted by William Christie with scrupulous attention to
period detail.

<P>
   Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut'' (Deutsche Grammophon, 2 CDs)
</P>
<P>
   This was Puccini's first big hit, and though it's overshadowed
today by ''La Boheme'' and ''Tosca,'' it brims with a youthful
energy and tunefulness the later masterpieces can't quite match.
</P>
<P>
   A live recording conducted by Riccardo Muti in 1998 at La Scala,
the shrine of Italian opera, this is still an international
enterprise, with a Russian soprano and an Argentinian tenor in the
roles of the ill-fated lovers, Manon Lescaut and the Chevalier Des
Grieux. Once there might have been half a dozen Italian sopranos
and tenors who could handle these parts with distinction, but no
longer!
</P>
<P>
   The chief interest here is Jose Cura, the hot young tenor from
Argentina who has been creating a stir in houses around the world
with his potent vocalism and smoldering good looks. As Des Grieux
he leaves a mixed impression. There's a dry, hooded quality to much
of his singing in the lower range; but when he has to exert himself
in climaxes on high notes, he summons a thrilling, virile sound
that puts him in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Maria Guleghina is a thoroughly satisfactory Manon,
skillfully modulating her large voice for the many quieter moments
and singing with delicacy in the Act Two salon scene. Yet she also
has the resources for a powerful statement of her despairing
''Solo, perduta, abbandonato'' as she nears death in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Italian baritone Lucio Gallo does well in the relatively brief
role of Manon's sympathetic brother, Lescaut.

</P>
<P>
   ''Silver &AMP; Gold'' (Reprise) -- Neil Young
</P>
<P>
   This disc sounds like a sweetly nostalgic letter from an old
friend. In the quiet, acoustic country sound that recalls ''Harvest
Moon,'' Neil Young sings of the joy in reconnecting with his wife
after being on the road; kicking up dirt on a walk with his dad;
and wishing he could turn back the clock with his old band, Buffalo
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe now we can show the world what we got,'' he sings on
''Buffalo Springfield Again.'' ''But I'd just like to play for the
fun we had.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the spirit of this album. It won't be remembered as one
of the major statements in Young's illustrious career, but that's
not the point. One only has to hear the labored attempts at
songwriting by his colleagues on the latest Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young album to appreciate the small miracle of Young's
longevity as an artist who moves effortlessly among styles.
</P>
<P>
   And just think, ''Silver &AMP; Gold'' could have been much richer if
he had not donated a couple of its best songs to CSNY to save their
latest collaboration.

<P>
   Pianist and composer D.D. Jackson makes a strong statement for
modern jazz on his second RCA Victor recording, ''Anthem.''
Classically trained but with a fine ear for improvisation and the
soul to let it flow, Jackson shows himself a strong composer as
well. The percussion in his playing and the bold styling of his
compositions bring to mind McCoy Tyner.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson keeps company with improvisational masters such as David
Murray and Hamiet Bluiett as the keyboardist's ''Showcase Blues''
and ''Dewey's Groove (for Dewey Redman)'' attest. But he's equally
at home with more lyrical offerings in compositions such as ''Pat
(for Pat Metheny)'' and ''Her Song.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthem'' boasts a stellar lineup of musicians, including Jack
DeJohnette on drums, James Carter on sax, Richard Bona on bass and
Mino Cinelu on percussion. Of particular interest is the interplay
throughout between Jackson and violinist Christian Howes.

<HEADLINE> Russell Crowe Savors Success  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Years ago, when Russell Crowe was an aspiring young
rock singer, he wrote a song called ''I Wanna Be Like Marlon
Brando.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he's happy to be Russell Crowe. Only five years
after landing his first Hollywood role, he is one of the hottest --
and busiest -- actors around.
</P>
<P>
   So busy, in fact, that when he was offered the lead in Ridley
Scott's new movie ''Gladiator'' he ignored it. He was too absorbed
in the role he was creating for ''The Insider'' at the time, a role
that garnered him an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was ignoring it because I was working,'' Crowe said during a
visit to Rome. ''The two things weren't coming together in my
head.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up taking ''Gladiator,'' a $100 million epic of honor
and glory in ancient Rome that opens Friday (May 5), at the urging
of ''Insider'' director Michael Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Passing up a chance to work with Scott would be crazy, Mann told
Crowe during one of the two-hour-plus makeup sessions that helped
transform the 36-year-old actor into the paunchy, middle-aged Big
Tobacco whistleblower he was playing in ''The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy Crowe's not. He took the part.
</P>
<P>
   The whole project seems improbable at first glance. A gladiator
movie in this day and age? But it works. The filmmakers have
created a gorgeously detailed ancient world, one that is savage and
civilized at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of single-minded focus and hard work that kept Crowe
from leaping at a juicy role like ''Gladiator'' is the key to his
success. Colleagues say he approaches each role with fierce
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know how they say an actor is the custodian of his role?
Russell, well, Russell is the bodyguard of his character,'' said
''Gladiator'' producer Douglas Wick. ''And he's on duty 24 hours a
day!''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's intensity and commitment to his character led to some
clashes with the equally forceful Scott, whose credits include
''Blade Runner, ''Alien'' and ''Thelma and Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He would kill for his character,'' Wick said. ''And Ridley
would kill for the movie. So you have two very willful people who
are sometimes in disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe and Scott both speak well of each other now (''a great
artist, a Dutch master,'' Crowe says of Scott. ''He's worth it,''
the director says of Crowe.) and insist their clashes proved
creative at day's end and made the movie better.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Gladiator,'' Crowe plays the hero of the tale, the Roman
general Maximus who is betrayed and sold into slavery as a
gladiator.
</P>
<P>
   On the brutal battlefield of the Colosseum, recreated for the
film with sets and computer imaging, Maximus transcends disgrace
and becomes a hero once again.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe said the written ''Meditations'' of emperor Marcus
Aurelius, played in the film by Richard Harris, served as ''a
touchstone for who Max was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I discovered the book,'' he said, ''it was like one of
those 'Eureka!' moments.''
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, Crowe doesn't seem like the kind of guy who sits
around with tomes of Stoic philosophy written nearly 2,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Zealand, raised in Australia, Crowe lives on a
560-acre ranch north of Sydney. He rides horses and punches cows to
relax.
</P>
<P>
   But Crowe has the true actor's gift of delving into a character,
of creating such a complete inner reality that he can convey a
lifetime with just a glance or a gesture on film.
</P>
<P>
   He also has the chameleon's gift of transforming himself
physically. For ''The Insider,'' he put on around 50 pounds and --
seemingly -- 20 years. As Maximus, he is absolutely believable as a
grizzled general who personally leads his Roman legions into
ferocious hand-to-hand combat with the barbarian hordes.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Crowe is a sleek, trim, tanned fellow who doesn't
look a day over his 36 years. His speech is blunt, sprinkled with
Aussie-isms like ''mate'' and ''bloke'' and the kind of earthy
Anglo-Saxon expressions family newspaper don't print.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe says he always knew he wanted to be a performer, and he
grew up around the movie business. His grandfather was a
cinematographer and his parents were film set caterers. He was a
child extra and landed a part in an Australian TV series when he
was just 6.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Crowe thought he wanted to be a rock star; he still
writes songs and plays guitar in an Australian band, 30 Odd Foot of
Grunts. He also tried his hand at theater, doing 415 performances
as Dr. Frank N. Furter in ''The Rocky Horror Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe landed his first film role in 1990 in Australia and his
first Hollywood role (''The Quick and the Dead,'' a gunfighter film
produced by Sharon Stone) in 1995. The big breakthrough was two
years later, in the critically acclaimed ''L.A. Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   He is now shooting his 22nd film, ''Proof of Life,'' a kidnap
thriller with Meg Ryan, and has a Depression-era drama directed by
Jodie Foster, ''Flora Plum,'' lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Success, he says, is sweet. And a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to work with the best actors I possibly could. I
wanted to do the greatest work I possibly could,'' he said. ''And I
can do that because I've kept focused. I've done what I set out to
achieve.''

<HEADLINE> Corporate War Deprived ABC Viewers  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- By the time it ended, few could recall exactly
why it began.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone knew this: It had gone on too long and exacted a
dreadful human toll. Three and a half million cable subscribers
went 39 hours (give or take) without ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City and other trouble zones, many viewers still
remember the day their hardship began -- May 1, 2000. They turned on
their TVs expecting to find Regis Philbin and Susan Lucci, Diane
Sawyer and Bill Maher. But where ABC had burned brightly only a day
before, without warning, darkness had descended.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly darkness. For those millions of bereft
subscribers to Time Warner Cable, the channel on their tuner box
that had once brimmed with ABC fare now glowed a chilly blue.
Inscribed on the screen were these bitter words: ''Disney has taken
ABC away from you.'' Nothing could be heard but a withering
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers wondered if this blackout (blueout?) was an April
Fool's Day trick a month late. (It wouldn't have been the first
time the cable company missed a date.)
</P>
<P>
   Others mistook the blue screen for new specialty programming:
The Disney-Has-Taken-ABC-Away-From-You Channel. They watched it.
They liked it. Here, years after ''Seinfeld,'' was really a show
about nothing!
</P>
<P>
   Then the awful truth sank in. Some terrible dispute was raging
between the cable company's parent, Time Warner, and the Walt
Disney Co., owner of ABC. It had something to do with Disney
wanting more money to let Time Warner Cable carry Disney-owned
channels, and with Time Warner Cable not wanting to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Caught helpless in between were those 3.5 million customers in
New York, Houston, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., Philadelphia, northwest
Ohio and Racine, Wisc., as well as Los Angeles and Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   They were ordinary people from coast to coast, now united by
mutual adversity. And facing sacrifices they would someday tell
their grandchildren about.
</P>
<P>
   By then, this sort of corporate clash will likely seem quaint,
even barbarian. By then, the merger of TimeWarnerAOLDisneyViacom
with SonyNewsCorpBertelsmannGE will mean just one global
conglomerate (along with the two Microsofts). There'll be no one
left to fight with.
</P>
<P>
   But back on May 1, 2000, the Old Capitalism was still in play.
Under that brutal paradigm, competing companies sometimes butted
heads. And customers got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, subscribers were heartened by an added on-screen
message in which Time Warner Cable declared, ''We're not going to
let Disney force our customers to 'walk the plank.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's a blessing, they told themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Time Warner Cable helpfully proposed that they buy a
TV antenna to receive ABC over the air. Of course, this was the
sort of thing viewers used to do without being told. And without
subscribing to cable. And without losing their picture in the
fourth quarter of a championship sportscast. And without taking a
day off from work to wait for a cable repairman who never showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, they were grateful for the tip.
</P>
<P>
   But in a New York newspaper advertisement, Disney-owned WABC-TV
countered that Time Warner Cable wasn't really the subscriber's
best friend: ''They violated your trust as a viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about extorting money from cable customers,'' a Time
Warner spokesman stormed, while a Disney exec charged that ''some
deranged individual has deprived all of these people of ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   And the hours of deprivation dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   ''How did 'Arabian Nights' come out?'' viewers wondered. ''Who
won on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'? What's Ted Koppel up to? Is
it true he's turning 'Nightline' over to Leonardo DiCaprio?''
</P>
<P>
   Before too long, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani surely would
have taken steps to calm the situation. Drawing inspiration from a
predecessor who read comic strips on the radio during a 1940s
newspaper strike, Hizzoner might have recited scenes from ''NYPD
Blue'' on subway platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Cassettes of ''The Drew Carey Show'' and ''Dharma &AMP; Greg'' could
have been air-dropped to viewers in the worst-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Support groups would have sprung up on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But, happily, it didn't come to that. Tuesday afternoon, the
warring parties agreed to lift the blackout, extend the deadline
and negotiate a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ABC was back as viewers, grateful but still shaken, began
putting their lives back together. Once, things had been normal. It
seemed like only yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Producers Want Apology From Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Shubert Organization is demanding that actor
Patrick Stewart apologize for complaining at curtain calls that
producers weren't doing enough to promote the Broadway play ''The
Ride Down Mt. Morgan.'' They've also complained to the Actors
Equity union.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed with the union alleges unprofessional
conduct by the star of the Arthur Miller play.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought the matter should be brought to Equity's
attention,'' said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the powerful
Shubert Organization, one of the producers. Schoenfeld also wants a
written apology from Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The union had no comment, spokeswoman Helaine Feldman said
Wednesday. She said she did not know if the union had ever
disciplined an actor for curtain call comments.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers and its chief publicist, Michael Hartman,
said about $1 million had been spent on advertising for ''Mt.
Morgan,'' more than for two comparable plays last season, ''The
Blue Room,'' starring Nicole Kidman, and ''Amy's View,'' featuring
Dame Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
   More publicity would be forthcoming, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, best known for television's ''Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' made his complaints during curtain calls for
Saturday's matinee and evening performances.
</P>
<P>
   Other cast members, through a secret ballot, elected not to join
Stewart on stage during the speeches, The New York Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and producers will be invited to speak before an Equity
hearing committee, the Times said. No date was set.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old actor could be expelled from the union,
reprimanded or fined if the union sides with the producers.
Expulsions are rare and do not bar actors from Broadway
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mt. Morgan,'' which opened three weeks ago and is scheduled to
run through July 23, has enjoyed positive reviews and has done well
at the box office. Producers, however, would not say how much
revenue the show is taking in or if it is making money.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart accepted a lower salary than usual for ''Mt. Morgan''
and is to receive a cut of the play's profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mt. Morgan'' is the story of a bigamist whose wives learn of
each other when they visit him in the hospital after he's injured
in a car crash.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 172; Nasdaq Off 106  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a broad retreat today as
interest-rate worries weighed on the market and investors punished
companies that warned of slowing earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 172.50 to 10,558.62.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also falling. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 27.17 to 1,419.12, and the Nasdaq
composite index was down 106.83 to 3,678.62.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for a second session as interest-rate fears kept
many buyers on the sidelines. The Federal Reserve is widely
expected to raise interest rates on May 16 in its continuing bid to
slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting a quarter-percentage point
increase, but worries that the Fed could boost rates by as much a
half-percentage point are rattling the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next key piece of economic data will hit the market on
Friday, when the Labor Department releases employment data for the
month of April. Until then, analysts say, investors will continue
to move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is looking for some comfort in the numbers to come
on Friday,'' said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at
First Union Securities in Chicago. ''Especially for investors in
the Old Economy stocks, interest-rate worries are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, AT&AMP;T fell 1 15/16 to 40, hurting the blue-chip Dow.
PaineWebber and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette downgraded the stock a
day after company officials warned that full-year operating profits
will likely come in below previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, software maker Novell fell after warning Wall Street that
it will miss financial targets in its fiscal second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods rose 10 11/16 to 61\. Late Tuesday, the maker of
Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise rejected an $18.4
billion takeover offer from multinational consumer products
conglomerate Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The offer valued Bestfoods at 66 per share, a 31 percent premium
to Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday. But Bestfoods said the offer
was not financially adequate and not in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever fell 2 3/16 to 22 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several other food companies rose today as investors anticipated
that any or all could come into play. Heinz rose 3 5/16 to 37\ and
Campbell Soup rose 2 3/16 to 28 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were mostly lower after Goldman Sachs removed
several prominent retailers from its list of recommended stocks.
Kohl's fell 4{ to 47 5/16, Target fell 4 15/16 to 63 15/16 and
Costco fell 3 5/16 to 51 7/16. All were downgraded from
''recommended'' to ''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also lowered its rating on Dow component Wal-Mart,
sending its shares down 4 5/16 to 53 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 450.38 million shares
at midday, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace. On the Nasdaq,
decliners led by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 11.35 to 494.00.

<HEADLINE> Divided Panel OKs Congress Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided House subcommittee today approved a
$1.8 billion measure financing Congress' own expenses for fiscal
2001 in the latest of the partisan budget clashes that will prevail
during this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pushed the bill through a subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee by a party-line 6-3 vote. When the Senate
adds expenses for that chamber later, the bill will total nearly
$2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure provides $106 million less than this year's bill, a
cut of almost 6 percent. Democrats complained that the reductions
would cause 1,600 layoffs of legislative aides, Capitol police and
other workers. Republicans said the cuts were part of an effort to
keep the budget balanced, but said they would try to provide more
money as the bill moves through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be making changes,'' said Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C.,
the subcommittee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a separate appropriations subcommittee used a voice
vote to approve the first spending bill, providing $8.6 billion for
military construction. That legislation, loaded with money for
virtually every state, is traditionally among the most popular of
the 13 annual spending measures that keep agencies functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with White House budget chief Jack Lew threatening
Clinton will veto bills that shortchange his plans for schools,
land conservation and other programs, GOP leaders said this could
be a confrontational year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy working with Jack Lew,'' said House Appropriations
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. ''I'm satisfied there will be
a lot of opportunity for me to enjoy that pleasure'' in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Urban Institute, Lew said unless Republicans
provide more money for administration priorities in the spending
bills, ''the president simply cannot and will not sign them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew said Clinton wants about $20 billion more for education and
other domestic programs than Republicans seem ready to provide,
which is about $293 billion. The overall federal budget is about
$1.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The military construction measure finances facilities like bases
and housing. It would provide nearly $300 million more than this
year's total, and $600 million more than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   However, it includes only $83 million of the $104 million
Clinton requested to build radar facilities in Alaska as part of a
possible anti-missile defense system the administration is
considering deploying. The subcommittee said it might provide the
additional money later.

   George Carlin began performing comic routines in nightclubs in
the 1960s. ''Then I changed from being a superficial comic and
began to entertain people who would be considered counterculture:
college kids and hippies. I had a rebellious side of me that needed
expression,'' he says. Carlin played the part of Cardinal Glick in
Kevin Smith's film ''Dogma.'' His 1997 book ''Brain Droppings,''
published by Hyperion, was a best seller. Carlin was born on May
12, 1937.

<HEADLINE> House Condemns Hanoi Communists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Wednesday marked the 25th
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War with a resolution
condemning the communist government in Hanoi and urging an end to
political repression in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's truly unfortunate that 25 years after the end of the
Vietnam War, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is still a one-party
state ruled and controlled by the Vietnamese Communist Party,''
International Relations Committee Chairman Ben Gilman, R-N.Y. said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam remains ''one of the most repressive societies on the
face of this planet,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., a senior
member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The non-binding resolution, approved 415-3, requests the
president to make clear to Vietnam's leaders that the United States
expects Vietnam to respect the political and religious rights of
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, authored by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., urges
Vietnam to release all religious and political prisoners and
abolish article 4 of its constitution that ensures the supremacy of
the Communist Party as the only political party in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the bill were three Republicans, Paul Gillmor of
Ohio, Ron Paul of Texas and Helen Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho.

<HEADLINE> EU Bodies OK Greece Euro Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Central Bank and the
European Commission have each endorsed Greece's bid to join the
European Union's single currency and replace its drachma with the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Solbes, EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs,
told the European Parliament's economic committee on Wednesday that
Greece met all necessary requirements on inflation, deficit and
debt for entry into the euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is now expected to join the single currency in January
2001, pending final approval by EU leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   Solbes rejected criticism that Greek membership would further
drag down the euro-zone's single currency which was traded at a new
low of under 89 cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Greece's bid was based on the same economic criteria as
the other 11 members, which began using the currency in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that this will bring any difficulty to the
euro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solbes warned however that Greece still faces the risk of high
inflation due to high interest rates and its exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be necessary for the Greek government to maintain its
stability-oriented strategy, in particular, a tight budgetary
policy stance and a continuation of wage moderation.'' Solbes said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank also gave its approval to Greek
membership in the euro-zone on WEdnesday, but echoed concerns that
Greece must keep its inflation in check and said that it must
reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yiannos Papantoniou, Greek finance minister, welcomed the
endorsement and said the reports were ''the justification, the
reward of an economic policy which was exercised with insistence,
with stability, with punctuality for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   The country was kept out of the euro's 1999 launch because it
failed to meet the requirements for entry at that stage.

<HEADLINE> Minn. To Review ING on Holocaust  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The state will review a Dutch finance giant's
record of paying life insurance claims for Holocaust victims when
deciding whether to let the company acquire a U.S. insurer.
</P>
<P>
   ING Group, Europe's fifth-largest financial services firm,
announced Monday it had agreed to acquire the Minneapolis-based
ReliaStar Financial Corp. for $6.1 billion, subject to shareholder
and regulatory approval. The acquisition would make ING the
third-largest U.S. life insurer.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commerce Department, required by state law to help
Holocaust victims recover unpaid claims, will review allegations
that ING is one of several European insurers that haven't done
enough to honor the victims' life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Al Parsons, president of the Insurance Federation of Minnesota,
said state regulators ''have a lot of power,'' but said he doubts
the department would reject the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ING said the Nazis seized 22,368 ING policies owned by Jews
during World War II. After the war, ING tracked down Holocaust
survivors and their families, and by 1955 only 10 percent of the
affected policies remained unclaimed, the company said. Those
policies were turned over to the Dutch government, which took over
reparation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Several European insurers have faced allegations that they
didn't make good on insurance policies written before the war. Five
European insurers formed the International Commission on
Holocaust-era Insurance Claims to find uncompensated Holocaust
victims and their heirs and make reparations.
</P>
<P>
   ING has applied to join but is not yet a member of the
commission. The company's initial delay brought concern from
commission head Lawrence Eagleburger, the World Jewish Congress and
various state insurance commissioners. Some have called on
Minnesota to delay ING's plans to buy ReliaStar until the issue is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   State Commerce Commissioner Jim Bernstein said the department's
acquisition approval process is expected to take about 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Rubble Role Boosts Stephen Baldwin  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- So, Stephen Baldwin, how did you perfect Barney
Rubble's laugh for the new ''Flintstones'' film?
</P>
<P>
   ''To do the laugh, you innately have to be a little kooky. It
was something that kind of just came naturally to me anyway because
I grew up watching the show and loved it so much. Yeah, I know it
sounds a little silly that it 'came naturally,''' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' is the second live-action
comedy based on the cartoon series. This prequel to the 1994 film
is the story of the courting days of Fred and Wilma Flintstone,
played by Mark Addy (''The Full Monty'') and Kristen Johnston of
NBC's ''3rd Rock From the Sun,'' and of Barney and Betty Rubble,
with Jane Krakowski of ''Ally McBeal'' playing Betty.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.,
''Viva Rock Vegas'' took in $10.5 million on its opening weekend,
putting it in second place behind ''U-571,'' which took in $12.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, 33, is the youngest of the four acting Baldwin
brothers. His previous films include ''Last Exit to Brooklyn,''
''The Usual Suspects'' and ''Friends and Lovers.'' He will appear
in the upcoming film ''Cutaway'' with Tom Berenger.
</P>
<P>
   He said the positive publicity surrounding the film caused a
one-week rise in the value of Stephen Baldwin (SBALD) from $978 to
$1,500 on the online game Hollywood Stock Exchange
(http://www.hsx.com), where actors are traded like bonds and movies
are traded like stocks. Baldwin is involved in the online game,
which he plays regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only on Wall Street do they call that much of an increase of a
stock over a three-day period a 'Yabba Dabba Do,''' joked Baldwin,
who had been lobbying hard on behalf of his ''StarBond'' on the
Hollywood Stock Exchange Movie Market.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have no problem challenging any or all of
brothers Alec, William and Daniel for the right film role.
</P>
<P>
   His childhood love for musical theater would have led him to
acting even if his brothers hadn't, he said, although following in
their footsteps hasn't always opened doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it helps now, but it was kind of a 50-50 split when I
was starting out. I think that was because of the expectations
people in the business had based on their experiences with a
sibling. If a producer worked with Alec, and then I was going to
work with that producer, his attitude might be different if he
liked him -- or he didn't. I've been in that situation before.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, his wife Kennya and daughters, Alaia, 7, and Hailey, 3,
live in Nyack, N.Y., a suburb of New York City, where the family is
renovating an old farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He is very popular at home these days, thanks to his Barney
Rubble role and an endless supply of M&AMP;Ms, a perk from his job as a
pitchman for the candy.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin would like to do a New York-based TV series, which would
give him a regular schedule and let him spend more time at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to wake up in the morning, get in the car, drink my
Starbucks, read the Daily News and listen to Howard Stern,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dabbling in different projects and taking on a variety of roles
keeps him interested and makes him interesting to audiences, said
Baldwin, who is managing the career of a New York State Golden
Gloves boxing champion.
</P>
<P>
   He recently retooled his Manhattan restaurant to add an upscale
cocktail lounge, and changed the name from Alaia to Luahn
(Brazilian for ''lunar'').
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to keep them guessing, and I like working a lot,'' he
said. ''They can't hit a moving target, you know what I mean?''

<HEADLINE> Vic Damone Plans Retirement Tour  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vic Damone promises fans ''A Farewell to
Remember'' when his yearlong retirement tour begins May 27 at the
Westbury Music Fair on Long Island, N.Y. The tour will end next
year with a performance at Carnegie Hall on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   Damone, 71, will sing standards from the catalog known as the
''Great American Songbook'' of the 1930s-1950s. Then he'll retire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like young people to hear some Rodgers, Gershwin, Porter
and some other songwriters, and let them know what there is for
them to listen to out there, as well as the junk they're listening
to now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His tour will include dates in Atlantic City, N.J.; Las Vegas;
the Royal Festival Hall in London; and, he hopes, the Hollywood
Bowl. He will also appear at performing arts centers, some colleges
and other dates in England.
</P>
<P>
   After his last appearance at Carnegie Hall in 1998, The New York
Times described Damone as ''the most gifted singer of standards
today,'' saying ''his modest, effortless style is at one with the
finely wrought music he perfects.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My voice is still good, knock wood. I do exercises -- vocal and
physical. You've got to be physically strong to be able to perform.
I don't drink the hard stuff. I have a glass of wine with meals.
I've always taken good care of myself,'' Damone said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Frank Sinatra, who announced retirement at 55 and then
returned with an ''Old Blue Eyes Is Back'' tour two years later,
Damone says he is serious about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   One part of his concert, especially when he appears with an
orchestra, is a tribute to Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to miss you and your wonderful arrangements.
They were a perfect marriage. Let me sing for you, pay tribute to
you. Let me borrow some of those arrangements,'' Damone said he
told Sinatra after the legendary singer had retired a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra asked Damone which album he liked best. Damone told him
it was ''Nice and Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Frank always had to have the last word, to be in control,''
Damone recalled. ''He said, 'I'll give the arrangements to you -- if
I choose the songs.' He sent about 15 of them. He never gave them
to anybody, except to Sammy Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribute to Sinatra is something special to Damone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep the music out in front of me, on a stand, and look at
it. There are his little notations. It gives me inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   After he retires, Damone plans to play golf near his home in
Palm Beach, Fla., and work on his autobiography, ''Singing Was the
Easy Part.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he is looking forward to his retirement tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Great popular songs bring back nostalgic moments for people my
age. I feel sorry for the kids. What are they going to listen to
when they're older?''

<HEADLINE> Giant Jordan Is Star of IMAX Movie  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The inspiration struck Don Kempf while he was
sitting in the back row of a giant-screen movie about Niagara Falls
at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   He decided he would use the massive IMAX screen for something
other than a nature film. He wanted the world to have an
eight-story movie about one of his heroes: Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the results of that epiphany arrive in IMAX
theaters around the country this weekend -- an extremely close-up
celebration of the world's most famous athlete, called ''Michael
Jordan to the Max.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's successful, you can expect fewer IMAX movies about
natural wonders and more about sports and other fast-moving human
dramas. Think Super Bowls instead of supernovas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's any other way that Michael Jordan should
be shown,'' said Kempf, 33, who with his 29-year-old brother,
Steve, formed a company called Giant Screen Sports. ''Very few
people have had the opportunity to see Michael Jordan that close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kempfs are already working on their next IMAX projects,
including films about Wayne Gretzky and World Cup soccer.
</P>
<P>
   IMAX theaters' giant screens fill viewers' peripheral vision,
immersing them in a setting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jordan movie, the effect puts the audience on the
basketball court with 20,000 fans clamoring all around. Slow-motion
footage gives the viewers a sense of Jordan's artistry and time to
examine rivulets of sweat on his body and the pained expressions on
his opponents' faces.
</P>
<P>
   After the invention of IMAX technology more than 30 years ago,
IMAX theaters were mostly in museums or amusement parks, and they
tended to explore natural subjects, such as the wonder of flight
and African elephants.
</P>
<P>
   But around the time the Kempf brothers were putting together
their Jordan idea, IMAX Corp. -- which makes the projection and
sound systems and distributes many IMAX films -- was expanding,
signing deals with commercial theater chains. There are more than
200 IMAX theaters worldwide, 130 of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in the Toronto suburbs, posted record profits
for the fourth quarter last year; 1999 revenue was $203 million.
The company also landed its first feature-length film, Disney's
''Fantasia 2000,'' which has taken in $64 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the makers of ''Michael Jordan to the Max''
believe they have hit on a winning formula. It cost just $7.2
million to make.
</P>
<P>
   The Kempf brothers hooked up with director Jim Stern, whose
first feature film, ''All the Rage,'' also comes out this spring.
Stern happens to be a part owner of the Chicago Bulls, which helped
the filmmakers get Jordan to participate. Jordan's agent and NBA
Entertainment also signed on as producers.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Jordan through his final performance -- the 1998
NBA playoffs, when he led his aging Bulls team to its sixth
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But with non-IMAX old footage and the narration of actor
Laurence Fishburne, the film also slows down to recount Jordan's
life story, from his initial failure to make his high school team,
through his father's murder and his short-lived baseball career to
his finals-winning shot in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing fast-paced sports footage courtside presented some
challenges not faced by IMAX filmmakers on savannahs or above
volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   IMAX cameras weigh about 100 pounds and are bulky -- Stern jokes
that they ''look like they could pitch batting practice.'' Also,
the cameras can handle only three minutes of film at a time, and it
takes about four minutes to change rolls.
</P>
<P>
   That forced the filmmakers to roll spare cameras at all times,
so as not to miss any action. They ended up shooting a half-million
feet of film, enough for 30 hours. The finished film runs just 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Gelfond, one of the two IMAX chairmen and chief executives
who bought the company in 1994 and have led its recent expansion,
said the company is closely watching the success of the Jordan
movie. IMAX might even be able to show live sports events someday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that two of the format's biggest stars this year
have been Mickey Mouse and Michael Jordan. ''Ten years ago,'' he
quipped, ''the stars of IMAX movies were beavers.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Claim Mayor's Death  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters dragged a small-town
Chechen mayor from his car and shot him to death as part of a
campaign to terrorize Chechens who cooperate with Russian forces,
federal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came during a week when Chechen militants allegedly
tried to throw explosives at a pro-Moscow Muslim leader and rebel
warlords have reportedly threatened violence against Chechen
leaders who negotiate with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks suggest Chechens are far from reconciled to Russian
rule even as wide-scale rebel resistance has declined, replaced by
ambushes and sneak attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Alman Mesiyev was mayor of the town of Khattuni in the southern
Vedeno region, where steep slopes and valleys covered in thick
forests provide easy cover for guerrilla units. Mesiyev had worked
with federal troops to root out the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters pulled Mesiyev from his car and shot him at close
range on Saturday, according to a statement from Russia's military
headquarters in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rebels killed three traffic police officers in a
northern area that federal forces had claimed to control, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. The officers were driving home from the
town of Shelkovskaya, 35 miles east of the capital Grozny, when
attackers opened fire with automatic weapons Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo admitted Wednesday that
Chechnya remains a patchwork where federal control is weak in some
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no illusions, even though it is more or less stable in
a number of regions. In some regions grave crimes are being
committed, such as attacks on policemen,'' Rushailo said.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent pro-Moscow Chechen Muslim leader, Mufti Akhmad
Alidkhadzhi Kadyrov, said his guards detained two Chechens carrying
explosives who were trying to kill him on Monday. Kadyrov was
dismissed as Chechnya's top mufti last year after he met with
Russia's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Chechnya's rebel
leaders called the meeting a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has said it is working with Chechen groups, including
President Aslan Maskhadov, to find a political solution to the
8-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian news reports, Maskhadov has been threatened
by other rebel commanders for proposing a peace deal with Moscow.
Maskhadov's wife and daughter have left Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In a conciliatory move, Russia announced the release of 30
rebels in the village of Znamenskoe on Wednesday. The release
brings to 135 the rebels set free under a parliamentary amnesty for
Chechen fighters found not to have committed grave crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian attack jets flew 11 sorties in the last 24 hours,
targeting trails used by rebels in the south, officials said
Wednesday. Helicopters flew 30 missions, providing air support to
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces swept into Chechnya in September, quickly taking
control of the republic's northern two-thirds. But progress has
stalled in the southern mountains, where the terrain favors the
rebels' hit-and-run tactics.

<HEADLINE> White House Aide Focused on Y2K  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential aides didn't ask Congress for
money to recover e-mail missing from the White House archiving
system because they were preoccupied by the looming Y2K computer
problem, an aide testified today.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers want to know why White House officials
didn't reveal the e-mail problem to congressional committees and
other investigators examining a variety of allegations against the
Clinton administration who had subpoenaed such documents.
</P>
<P>
   During a House Government Reform Committee meeting today,
Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., suggested the White House didn't ask
for money because it was trying to cover up the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not ask for funds'' to correct the e-mail problem
because ''our singular purpose was Y2K,'' Michael Lyle, director of
the White House Office of Administration, told congressional
Republicans on the House Government Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing, Lyle acknowledged he was aware that huge amounts
of e-mail had not been stored in a searchable database from
mid-1996 to late 1998, but insisted, ''I am not aware of any
subpoena compliance issues'' with various investigations from
Whitewater to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Lyle took his White
House post in November 1998, after the problem was discovered and
focused on the technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans suggested the White House was covering up
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you don't have an honest president, you wonder whether
the people who work for him are telling the truth,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said that internal
White House documents turned over to the committee ''seem to
indicate that there was a long debate over whether to ask Congress
for money to fix the problem. ... If they revealed the problem,
then Congress would know that document requests and subpoenas had
not been complied with.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the administration is doing its best to retrieve
unsearched e-mails that are being reconstructed from back-up tapes,
a process that is just now starting and is expected to take months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have become obsessed and intoxicated with the notion of
investigating,'' complained Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pounced on a document that says White House
officials were considering deleting e-mail of Clinton aide Sidney
Blumenthal, whose contentious attitude toward Ken Starr's office in
the Lewinsky scandal drew plaudits from Clinton supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle said a single e-mail to Blumenthal had gone awry,
duplicating itself so many times that it crashed Blumenthal's
computer. Lyle said the White House simply decided to delete the
duplicates, while saving the original.
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying was White House computer expert Karl Heissner,
who in early 1999 outlined a way to recover large amounts of e-mail
that had not been placed into a searchable archive. Heissner's
steps weren't acted on at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Heissner said he doesn't know why no steps were taken in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   White House computer experts discovered the e-mail problem in
June 1998 and passed on information about it to the White House
counsel's office, which was responsible for producing documents to
congressional investigators, the Justice Department and Independent
Counsel Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House Counsel Charles Ruff is set to testify
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renewing Health Care Push  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to meet with House and
Senate negotiators on Monday to find out what is preventing them
from writing a bill to regulate health plans. Advocates pledged
today to step up their lobbying efforts next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been enough delays,'' Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala said. ''At the meeting, we hope to find out
what the final issues are and what we can do to make sure that we
get a very strong patients' bill of rights ready for a vote very
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and John Podesta, White
House chief of staff, met for an hour-long strategy session at the
White House today and expressed frustration that Congress has been
working on the issue for three years without success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fed up,'' said John Crosby, executive director of the
American Osteopathic Association. ''We want to see action in the
conference this month and we are prepared to activate our entire
membership and the patients we serve to get that message to Capitol
Hill and anybody else who will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee has been working for more than 10 weeks
to combine House- and Senate-passed versions of a bill giving
Americans more rights when dealing with managed care organizations
and other health plans. The negotiators, who had set an April 23
deadline for delivering a bill to Clinton, have agreed on several
provisions, but still must tackle the most contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Osterberg, a spokeswoman for Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,
who chairs the conference committee, said Nickles was waiting to
receive further details from the White House about the upcoming
meeting. She stressed that the committee has been making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This committee is a congressional negotiating process that has
had bipartisan, bicameral success and we will continue working,''
said Osterberg.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills -- a bipartisan House bill and a Republican-crafted
Senate bill -- have many similarities, including provisions that
would make it easier for patients to see specialists, give patients
the right to appeal to an outside panel when coverage is denied and
allow patients to use out-of-plan hospitals in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the two bills differ greatly on two key issues -- whether
patients should be allowed to sue plans if they are harmed when
care is denied and who should be covered by the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, supported by Democrats and many Republicans,
allows lawsuits and covers all Americans who have private insurance
-- about 161 million people. The Senate bill doesn't expand existing
rights to sue and covers only those people whose health plans are
exempt from state regulations -- about 55 million.

<HEADLINE> 6 Percent of Rwandans Have HIV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- AIDS is running rampant in Rwanda and its
victims are swamping the country's hospitals and overtaxing its
medical workers, Rwanda's health minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500,000 Rwandans, or 6 percent of the population, are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, Health Minister
Ezechias Rwabuhihi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Women from 25-29 years of age are most at risk and 21.5 percent
of them have contracted HIV, compared to 13.9 percent of men in the
same category, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are facing a silent and devastating epidemic which
threatens national security,'' Rwabuhihi told a U.N. conference in
the capital Kigali. ''Our hospitals are overwhelmed, the staff is
overwhelmed, some services of the internal medicine are
overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of patients in Kigali's main hospital were
suffering from AIDS-related illnesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 8.2 million people, Rwanda is one of
Africa's most densely populated countries. It is also one of its
poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Large migrations related to the 1994 genocide of more than
500,000 people are thought to have contributed to the high
HIV-infection rate. Rape and promiscuity spread the disease in the
refugee camps, while many widows of the genocide have been forced
to turn to prostitution to survive.

<P>
   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Two ferries caught in a storm sank in
the Meghna River in eastern Bangladesh, killing at least 73 people
and leaving more than 100 missing and feared drowned, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a day after the accidents, rescuers pulled out 27
more bodies from the passenger cabins of the two ferries. A search
for those still missing was suspended at nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   The MV Dolphin capsized Tuesday with over 150 people aboard 50
miles east of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. In neighboring
Narsingdi district, at least 20 passengers swam ashore as their
ferry, Bengal Bird, began sinking with 61 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was unlikely any more survivors would be
found.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Euro Falls Below 89 Cents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The euro stumbled to yet another low against the
dollar in European trading today, not only falling below 90 cents
for the first time, but also slipping below 89 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless the European Central Bank performs a miraculous rescue
mission, anyone on board the euro may as well be on board the
Titanic,'' said Neil Parker, senior European economist at Royal
Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was mostly higher against major currencies. Gold
prices rose.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, the single currency of 11 European nations, fell as
low as 88.90 cents in early European trading, down from 90.66 cents
late Tuesday. It recovered some lost ground to reach 88.97 cents in
late trading in Europe. Later, in midday trading in New York, the
euro was worth 89.36 cents. The previous low was 90.30 cents,
reached during trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other dollar rates in Europe today, compared with late Tuesday,

</P>
<P>
   In midday trading in New York, the dollar bought 109.17 yen, and

<HEADLINE> War Heroes Honored With New Stamp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Wednesday unveiled
commemorative postage stamps honoring four American war heroes,
including Sgt. Audie Murphy, the most decorated World War II
soldier and later a movie actor.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of each of the four attended a ceremony in the
Pentagon courtyard hosted by Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-cent stamps feature black-and-white photographs of the
four men.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, of Kingston, Texas, was awarded the Medal of Honor for
saving the troops in his company by breaking up a German attack in
France in 1944. He later starred in movies, including ''To Hell and
Back.'' Murphy died in a plane crash in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored was Sgt. Alvin York, of Pall Mall, Tenn., who was
awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in World War I. As a member
of the 82nd Division, York captured 132 German soldiers in the
battle of the Argonne forest in France on Oct. 8, 1918. In his
diary, York summed up the fight in which he killed more than 20
Germans: ''So we had a hard battle for a little while.'' York died
in Nashville, Tenn., in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the stamps is in memory of General of the Army Omar
Bradley, of Clark, Mo., who commanded a million-man U.S. Army group
in Europe and later served as Army chief of staff and as the first
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is the last U.S. general
to hold the five-star rank. He died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth hero is Gen. John Hines, who was from a distinguished
military family. He rose from the rank of major to major general
during a 16-month period in World War I. He was awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal for
bravery and leadership in combat. He went on to become Army chief
of staff.

<HEADLINE> Feds Approve Alcoa-Reynolds Merger  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved Alcoa Inc.'s
$5 billion acquisition of Reynolds Metals Co. on Wednesday after
requiring Alcoa to sell a Reynolds refinery in Texas and Reynolds'
controlling interest in a state-of-the-art Australian refinery.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust concerns raised by the merger of the nation's two
largest aluminum producers would be resolved by divestiture of the
two refineries, which produce alumina, a powder used in aluminum
and other products, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Together with divestitures required earlier Wednesday by the
European Commission, the agreements require Alcoa to sell all of
the alumina capacity owned by Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   With the European and U.S. antitrust approvals in hand, the
companies announced Wednesday that they had completed their merger,
which Reynolds shareholders had approved Feb. 11. Each outstanding
Reynolds share will be converted into 1.06 shares of Alcoa common
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will rapidly integrate Reynolds and thereby create
additional value for Alcoa and Reynolds customers and other
stakeholders,'' Alcoa President and chief executive officer Alain
Belda said. ''Proceeds from the sale of the divested assets will
contribute significantly to investment in further profitable growth
for Alcoa.''
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Alcoa is the largest aluminum
company in the world with 1999 revenues of more than $16 billion.
Reynolds, based in Richmond, Va., is the second largest U.S.
aluminum company and third largest in the world, with 1999 revenues
of more than $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies mine and refine bauxite into smelter grade and
chemical grade alumina and smelt alumina into aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The aluminum industry produces a wide variety of important
commercial and consumer products and is dependent upon ample
supplies of alumina at competitive prices,'' said Joel I. Klein,
assistant attorney general in charge of the department's antitrust
division. ''These divestitures will protect against a loss of
competition for the aluminum producers, businesses that use
aluminum to manufacture products and American consumers who buy
these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Alumina refineries produce two grade of alumina from bauxite
ore. Smelter grade alumina is a critical input in the production of
aluminum metal, used for such products as aluminum foil, beverage
cans, building materials and aircraft skin. Chemical grade alumina
is used to produce numerous industrial and consumer products,
including detergents, countertops and flame retardants.
</P>
<P>
   The government filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court here
to block the original deal and simultaneously filed the agreement
that would resolve that lawsuit. The agreement must be approved by
the court.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said that the original acquisition would have
substantially reduced competition in refining and sale of both
grades of alumina, resulting in higher prices to aluminum
manufacturers and their customers, including consumers who buy
products containing alumina.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Alcoa will sell Reynolds' controlling
interest in high-volume Worsley refinery, located in Western
Australia's Darling Range. Worsley is one of the world's lowest
cost alumina refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for the sale of Reynolds' Corpus
Christi, Texas, refinery, which produces both grades of alumina.
</P>
<P>
   Without the divestitures, the government said, Alcoa would have
owned or controlled about 38 percent of the world market for
smelter grade alumina and 59 percent of the North American market
for chemical grade alumina.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, the European Commission announced that it also
would require divestitures of the companies, including the sale of
Reynolds' refining operation in Stade, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department consulted extensively with antitrust
authorities at the European Commission during their respective
investigations of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an excellent example of how international cooperation
between antitrust agencies can lead to harmonious resolutions that
benefit consumers around the world,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies announced that their agreements with antitrust
enforcers also will require the sale of a 25 percent interest in
Reynolds' Longview, Wash., aluminum smelter.
</P>
<P>
   They said the revised merger would give Alcoa the Reynolds'
brand name, its packaging and consumer products businesses,
smelting operations with a capacity of one million metric tons,
manufacturing operations serving the construction and
transportation markets, bauxite reserves in Brazil, Guyana and
Guinea and two petroleum coke plants.

<HEADLINE> 3 Arrested in Yugoslavia Fight  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three anti-government students have
been arrested on charges of trying to kill associates of President
Slobodan Milosevic's son following a fight between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   Dejan Randjic, head of the anti-Milosevic students' group Otpor,
or Resistance, said the three -- all Otpor members -- were beaten up
Tuesday evening at an outdoor cafe by employees of the ''Madonna''
disco club, owned by Milosevic's son, Marko. The incident occurred
in the Milosevic family hometown of Pozarevac, 50 miles east of the
capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of events leading up to the fight at the cafe remained
unclear, but Momcilo Veljkovic, one of those arrested, claimed
Marko Milosevic's associates provoked one of the students.
</P>
<P>
   Veljkovic told the Belgrade-based Beta news agency that when he
tried to persuade the Milosevic associates to leave his colleague
alone, they hit him on the head. In the struggle that followed,
Veljkovic said he grabbed a gun from one of the assailants and
fought back.
</P>
<P>
   The fight involved fists and pistol butts. Dozens gathered
around to watch, some joining the brawl. There were conflicting
reports on whether a gun went off once and who fired it.
</P>
<P>
   Veljkovic and two others from Otpor were later detained by
police and charged with attempted murder. One of the three was
transported to a Belgrade clinic, suffering from a broken nose and
head injuries, Beta reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that Veljkovic managed to snatch away the pistol he
was being beaten with is now being used as pretext to charge the
three Otpor members,'' Randjic said. He said all three had been
transferred to Belgrade prison.
</P>
<P>
   A local police statement said the three Otpor members were
''known as persons of delinquent behavior.'' Yugoslavia's
information minister and a high-ranking Communist party official,
Ivan Markovic, said a ''group of hooligans with Otpor's fascist
symbol'' were the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   But Vukasin Petrovic, another Otpor leader, rejected Markovic's
accusations and said Marko Milosevic and his associates in this
town had ''frequently threatened and assaulted Otpor members'' even
before the fight Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth accusations reached the national political
level.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Democratic Party issued a statement saying the
''brutal terror by Marko Milosevic and his circle of associates ...
has been going on for months,'' while Milosevic's ruling Socialists
said the ''heinous attack by Otpor ... constituted a criminal act
by people who daily plot all forms of terrorism, up to the murder
of honest citizens and patriots.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed Iraq's air-defense
system Wednesday in the northern no-fly zone after coming under
fire themselves, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi forces targeted allied planes with radar and fired
anti-aircraft artillery from a site near Bashiqah, 250 miles north
of Baghdad, according to a statement from the Germany-based U.S.
European Command.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi News Agency said three people were injured

<HEADLINE> British Cops Admit Curbing Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- London's police force admitted in court Wednesday
that some officers broke the law by removing banners and flags from
demonstrators who wanted to embarrass Chinese President Jiang Zemin
during a state visit last year.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise admission was in response to a legal challenge
brought by the Free Tibet Campaign, which accused the police of
suppressing the protest over the Chinese occupation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was unlawful for individual officers to remove banners and
flags from people solely on the basis that they were protesting
against the Chinese regime,'' lawyers representing the Metropolitan
Police told the High Court.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed ''that it would be unlawful to position police
vans in front of demonstrators if the reason for doing so was to
suppress free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the police maintained the vans were put in front of the
protesters to prevent public disorder, not to hide them from
Jiang's view during his five-day October visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Tibet Campaign agreed to accept the police admissions
and drop its legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a victory for the democratic right to peaceful protest
in this country, something sadly lacking in Chinese-occupied
Tibet,'' director Alison Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   An internal police review concluded in March that officers acted
reasonably and were not put under any political pressure to keep
protesters from annoying Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has denied protesters'
accusations that it ordered a clampdown on the demonstrations for
fear of jeopardizing trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   During Jiang's visit, China ordered 28 Airbus planes, made by a
consortium including BAE Systems, formerly British Aerospace, worth
$2.64 billion.

<HEADLINE> Treaty Terms Are Israel's Priority  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Trying to win political support for land
concessions, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants to settle the
basic terms of a peace treaty before saying how much land he will
give the Palestinians in an interim withdrawal, an aide said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. mediator said the two sides will need at least six more
weeks of intense negotiations to reach an outline of the treaty --
meaning they will miss yet another peace deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The outline was initially due Feb. 13 and then postponed to this
month. The full treaty, which will tackle issues like Palestinian
statehood, Palestinian refugees, contested Jerusalem and Jewish
settlements, is due Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are also to discuss the scope of a third and final
interim Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. But Barak is trying
to postpone those talks, in exchange for giving the Palestinians
full control over three Jerusalem suburbs as a good will gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hopes that Israelis will be more likely to support giving
land to the Palestinians if the broad outlines of a final peace
treaty are already in place. He has promised to bring the treaty to
a national referendum and is considering putting the outline
agreement to a referendum vote, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, who often speaks for Barak, said
talks in the Red Sea resort of Eilat would stall if negotiators
tackled the interim withdrawal now.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go now directly to negotiations on the third phase of
redeployment means that there is no chance to reach any
agreement,'' Ramon told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   During the latest round of talks, which began Sunday, there have
been alternating sessions on both issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Barak cannot even get his diverse Cabinet to
agree to give up the three villages.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the issue, originally planned for Wednesday, was
postponed due to opposition from parties in Barak's coalition,
including the ultra-Orthodox Shas party that wants Barak to hand
over millions of dollars to its struggling religious school system.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said he hoped Shas would agree to the handover within
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two hawkish coalition parties, the National Religious Party and
Israel B'Aliya, which represents immigrants, have threatened to
leave the government if Israel hands over the suburbs, which are
already under Palestinian civil control.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have reacted coolly to the initiative, calling
it a ''trial balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israeli coalition
politics were hurting the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Gaps remain wide between the two sides, and U.S. Mideast envoy
Ross said he would shuttle between the negotiators, Barak, and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that over the next six to eight weeks, we are
going to see if there is a potential and a need to make big
decisions to reach a framework agreement,'' Ross told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ross is to hold separate talks with Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want to establish a state in all of the West
Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast war. Israel wants to keep all of Jerusalem and annex parts
of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said it would step up its involvement,
including presenting its own proposals at some stage.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Fire Safety Office Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six weeks after Congress' workplace was
formally cited for fire code violations, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers proposed Wednesday creating an office to bring the
Capitol into compliance with standards applying to buildings
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Director of Fire Safety and Protection, if approved by
lawmakers, would develop a comprehensive fire safety plan for the
Capitol complex, test and maintain all fire protection equipment,
identify hazards and devise ways to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation was introduced in the House on Wednesday to create
the office and plans were underway to sponsor a similar Senate
measure.
</P>
<P>
   To meet a main concern of the Architect of the Capitol, who
would be in charge of the office, the legislation would allow for
modification of fire code standards to preserve the architectural
features of the Capitol and several congressional buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said that bringing the complex into
compliance with fire codes was ''vital not only for the people who
work here, but also for the millions of tourists who visit each
year.'' He said the office was ''long overdue'' and would be
designed to make congressional buildings, including the Capitol,
''fire safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., founder of the Congressional Fire and
Emergency Services Caucus, called the bill ''an attempt to head off
a potential disaster before it happens. Our lack of preparedness
would be considered a gross violation at any American
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress' health and safety agency, the Office of Compliance,
issued eight citations in March directing the architect to install
fire doors, test fire-suppression equipment and alarms, and train
maintenance employees on storage of hazardous chemicals. The
citations cover the Capitol and other buildings, including those
housing members' offices and committee hearing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Green, general counsel for the Office of Compliance, said
testing of sprinklers and alarm systems has been ''almost uniformly
disregarded for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, House Inspector General Steven A. McNamara concluded
the architect has much work to do before the Capitol complex is
safe from fire hazards, although additional emergency equipment has
been installed in buildings cited for code violations.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 216; Nasdaq Off 115  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks staged a broad retreat today as
interest-rate worries weighed on the market and investors punished
companies that warned of slowing earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 216.09 to 10,515.03.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also falling. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 29.27 to 1,417.02, and the Nasdaq
composite index was down 115.90 to 3,669.55.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for a second session as interest-rate fears kept
many buyers on the sidelines. The Federal Reserve is widely
expected to raise interest rates on May 16 in its continuing bid to
slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting a quarter-percentage point
increase, but worries that the Fed could boost rates by as much a
half-percentage point are rattling the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next key piece of economic data will hit the market on
Friday, when the Labor Department releases employment data for the
month of April. Until then, analysts say, investors will continue
to move cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is looking for some comfort in the numbers to come
on Friday,'' said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at
First Union Securities in Chicago. ''Especially for investors in
the Old Economy stocks, interest-rate worries are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that non-technology, ''old economy''
stocks could be most hurt by rising interest rates because their
earnings are growing more slowly than the profits of high-tech
companies. Higher interest rates cut into earnings by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, AT&AMP;T fell 2{ to 39 7/16, hurting the blue-chip Dow.
PaineWebber and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette downgraded the stock a
day after company officials warned that full-year operating profits
will likely come in below previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, software maker Novell fell 6{ to 11 1/16 on the Nasdaq
after warning Wall Street that it will miss financial targets in
its fiscal second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods rose 11 9/16 to 62[. Late Tuesday, the maker of Skippy
peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise rejected an $18.4 billion
takeover offer from multinational consumer products conglomerate
Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The offer valued Bestfoods at 66 per share, a 31 percent premium
to Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday. But Bestfoods said the offer
was not financially adequate and not in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever fell 2 3/16 to 22 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several other food companies rose today as investors anticipated
that any or all could come into play. Heinz rose 3 11/16 to 37| and
Campbell Soup rose 2 15/16 to 29 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were mostly lower after Goldman Sachs removed
several prominent retailers from its list of recommended stocks.
Kohl's fell 4 7/16 to 47], Target fell 5 3/16 to 63 11/16 and
Costco fell 2~ to 51~. All were downgraded from ''recommended'' to
''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also lowered its rating on Dow component Wal-Mart,
sending its shares down 3 15/16 to 53 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 657.57 million shares
at midafternoon, slightly ahead of Tuesday's pace. On the Nasdaq,
decliners led by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 12.71 to 492.64.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Iranian Jew Confesses to Spying  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- Two more Iranian Jews confessed today to
spying for Israel, even as defense lawyers cast doubt on an earlier
confession by one of the 13 defendants in the espionage trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers also criticized the Islamic revolutionary court
in which the judge acts as prosecutor and jury -- echoing Western
concerns whether the judiciary, controlled by Iran's fundamentalist
Muslim faction, will dispense justice.
</P>
<P>
   The trial takes place amid a power struggle between reformers
who are trying to improve ties with the outside world and Islamic
hard-liners who want to scuttle those hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, one of the accused, Shahrokh Paknahad, a religion
teacher, told reporters outside the court that he had confessed to
organizing a spy network for Israel in Isfahan, 200 miles northwest
of Shiraz. A stalwart of the small Jewish community in Shiraz, he
said he had used his position to recruit more agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I completed four successful missions for them (Israel),''
Paknahad, 30, said.
</P>
<P>
   Another defendant, Ramin Nematizadeh, also told the court today
that he had passed to Israel defense information he gathered during
his stint of military service mandatory for all Iranians, his
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Esmail Naseri, told reporters that he would argue to
the court that no classified information had changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has denied that the 13 Jews were spying for the Jewish
state, which Iran fiercely opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accusations against them are cruel lies, once again we are
in a situation where Jews are imprisoned just because they are
Jews,'' Israel's Diaspora Affairs Minister Michael Melchior said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to death, the
maximum penalty for passing secret information that damages
national security. Two Jews were hanged three years ago on similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Provincial judiciary chief Hossein Ali Amiri said that the
young age of the defendants would be taken account when verdicts
are handed down. ''All I can predict is that their sentences may
not be execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first defendant to confess, Dani Tefilin, told
journalists outside the court today that he had not been under
psychological pressure and he repeated his admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am well in every respect,'' he said, appearing calm before
his lawyer made his final arguments today. Tefilin was unshackled,
wearing a gray prison suit.
</P>
<P>
   Tefilin, the first defendant to be arrested more than a year
ago, made his admissions Monday on state television -- also
controlled by the hard-line Islamic clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been spying for Israel. In my trip to Israel in 1994, I
was trained for my activity in Iran,'' he said. He later told state
radio he spied for money.
</P>
<P>
   Naseri said Tefilin refused to retract his confession when Judge
Sadeq Nourani gave him the opportunity. Nourani told Tefilin he
could change his statement ''if you are influenced by any matter,
(or) if someone has made promises to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Iran's Islamic laws, a confession by a person who has
spent a year or more in prison has no value, Naseri, who represents
three of the 13 and is a spokesman for the defense team, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused may have been sick and tired of his condition and
prison and may be willing to say anything to get his ordeal over
with one way or another,'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirzad Rahmani, Tefilin's lawyer, said he had ''absolutely no
access to classified information and he lacked the necessary
intelligence to try to gather such information.''
</P>
<P>
   About 80,000 Jews lived in Iran before the 1979 Islamic
revolution; 25,000 remain today. Jews are generally allowed to
practice their religion freely, but cannot travel to or have any
contact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 defendants are being tried without a jury in a
revolutionary court where the judge is also the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Naseri said the whole trial, which began last month and was
expected to last a few more weeks, was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge accuses the defendants, then proceeds to defend the
accusation. On top of that, he also wants to pass sentence. How can
this be?'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge makes the accusation of espionage, but when we ask
for evidence he remains silent,'' Naseri said, adding the
confessions seen by the lawyers were very general.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries, the United Nations and human rights groups
have either condemned the arrests or called on Iran to ensure that
the proceedings are fair.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Mohammad Khatami, the leader of reformists
who seek better ties with the West, promised a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's faction is under assault by the hard-liners, who have
used the judiciary to close down 16 pro-democracy newspapers
recently and arrest or question about a dozen reformist journalists
and activists.

<HEADLINE> IRS To Test Reforms for Next 2 Yrs.  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next two years will be critical in
determining whether reforms intended by Congress to make the
Internal Revenue Service more taxpayer-friendly and modern become
permanent, the IRS chief said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we know what needs to be done,'' IRS Commissioner
Charles Rossotti told a House-Senate panel that reviews the agency
each year. ''We are at a crossroads where we will show either this
will happen or it won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, who is about halfway through his five-year term, said
the IRS has implemented most of the provisions of the 1998 reform
law, including massive training programs for its thousands of
employees. Examples of the many changes include additional steps in
all IRS seizure cases to satisfy unpaid taxes, new due process
rights for taxpayers and new relief for innocent spouses of
taxpayers who run afoul of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 to 24 months, Rossotti said the IRS must make
the new system work better and ensure employees' attitudes undergo
a permanent change. A key to success, he added, would be approval
by Congress of a $769 million budget increase for fiscal 2001 to
help the IRS improve service and slow a steep decline in audits and
other enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first priority was implementing the taxpayer rights. This
did stretch our capacity to the limit,'' Rossotti said. ''We have
several years of work ahead to make these provisions work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, agreed that Congress ''must
provide appropriate funding'' but added that the IRS must do a
better job of managing its existing resources and be held
accountable for not straying from the 1998 reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Funding is part of the answer, but with most things, just
throwing money at a problem won't fix it,'' Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said the IRS must not allow the drop in audits
and enforcement actions to become permanent, lest honest taxpayers
begin to question the fairness of the system and cheating becomes
more rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the IRS is in the throes of this enormous restructuring,
it must continue to collect taxes,'' Grassley said.

<HEADLINE> Town leaders head to camp to learn environmental lessons  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   With development pressures creeping into even the most rural
corners of Connecticut, environmental leaders are holding a
first-of-its-kind camp to help volunteer town officials do their
jobs better.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty officials from small eastern Connecticut towns are
gathering at a YMCA camp in Woodstock this weekend to learn the
basics of soil, water and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also make contacts and learn the preferred ways to
develop housing and business while minimizing the impact on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Members of inland wetland commissions, planning and zoning
boards, economic development boards and conservation commissions
are scheduled to attend the free, three-day camp.
</P>
<P>
   Since most people on these boards are volunteers, they may not
have the experience necessary to make the best decisions about land
use, said Steve Broderick, a forester with the University of
Connecticut Cooperative Extension System who is helping teach the
weekend camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is to raise the background level of people who are
making such key decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Lanzit, a first selectman from Chaplin who is attending
the camp, hopes to learn how small-town leaders can work together
to keep the area's character intact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've really got a great area here. My goal is to work in
partnership with some of the surrounding towns to try and preserve,
maintain, promote. I think we can have it all, but we need to work
together,'' Lanzit said.
</P>
<P>
   The towns participating are part of the Quinebaug-Shetucket
Heritage Corridor -- a 35-town region formed around the Quinebaug
and Shetucket riversheds north of Norwich, to the Rhode Island
border and into Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the last large tract of undeveloped land in coastal
sprawl extending from Boston to Washington,'' said Charlene Cutler,
executive director of the corridor group.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the most remote and rural parts of Connecticut, but
it is seeing more development pressures as suburbs expand from
Providence, R.I., Worcester, Mass., Hartford and the casino areas,
Broderick said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an area grows and changes with time, we're not just talking
about conservation and open space protection. We're also talking
about the need for economic growth,'' he said. ''The issue is, how
do we balance those things, build what needs to be built and
protect what needs to be protected?''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said the program fits with the corridor's federal mandate
to preserve the natural, historic and cultural resources of the
area. Congress has established 18 such corridors around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to integrate preservation goals with local
economic development needs to revitalize communities, Cutler said.
People who attend the camp are urged to share their knowledge with
other town officials.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick said he hopes to make the camp an annual event.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Safety Needs Listed  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- You've heard it before and you'll hear it
again but experts say it's still the most important safety message
out there: Buckle up!
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to lose 40,000 of our citizens on our nation's
highways'' annually, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman
Jim Hall said Wednesday. ''We as a nation need to change our
culture to stop this carnage and we can do it most effectively with
seat-belt laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's comments came as the board held its annual review of what
it considers the most important transportation safety needs in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are the so-called primary seat-belt laws which allow
police to stop drivers and issue tickets for failure to wear a seat
belt. Many states require belts, but list it as a secondary law
under which police can't act unless they have already stopped the
car for some other reason.
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize Hall's point, the Journal of the American
Medical Association published a report on drunken-driving accidents
showing that most children younger than 15 who were killed in such
crashes were riding unrestrained.
</P>
<P>
   The board's wish list grew a bit, expanding from 10 last year to
11 now, with the a call for improvements in commercial truck and
bus safety.
</P>
<P>
   The agency added proposals for easier opening emergency exits on
buses, performance standards for buses, on-board recording devices,
tighter school bus crashworthiness standards and new hours of
operation limits for bus and truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Another item that the board has long pursued is installing a
system to keep railroad trains from colliding.
</P>
<P>
   Called ''positive train separation,'' such electronic systems
are used in some subways and on European railroads, officials said.
They have been pressing both the nation's railroads and federal
regulators to develop similar systems.
</P>
<P>
   With positive train separation, electronic systems can take
control and stop one or both locomotives if they approach each
other too closely. ''The system is a backup to the human being so
that a single mistake won't lead to disaster,'' explained Robert
Lauby, director of the board's office of railroad safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was created in 1967, the safety board, which does not
have to consider the cost of what it recommends, has sent 11,485
proposals to government regulators and transportation industries.
Hall said nearly 83 percent have been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues on their safety want list -- in no particular order
-- included:
</P>
<P>
   --Reducing the presence of explosive mixtures in aircraft fuel
tanks, such as by cooling the tanks and filling empty areas with
inert gas like nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   --Improving ways of eliminating ice buildup on airplanes on the
ground and in flight.
</P>
<P>
   --Increasing recreational boating safety, such as with boat
operator training, requiring life preservers and outlawing drinking
and boating.
</P>
<P>
   --Preventing pipeline accidents, including requirements to check
with utilities before digging.
</P>
<P>
   --Reducing the number of incidents of aircraft interfering with
one another on runways.
</P>
<P>
   --Reducing human fatigue in operating all types of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   --Installing automatic recording systems -- like those black boxes
used in airliners -- on other transportation modes such as trucks
and locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   --Increasing child and youth safety in traveling with booster
seats, graduated driving license systems for young drivers, limits
on youths driving at night and zero tolerance of alcohol use by
youths.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton unveils first television ad; blasts Buchanan again  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled the
first television advertisement of her Senate campaign on Wednesday,
telling New Yorkers she is ''more than a first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a stop in the Washington County village of Fort
Edward, also defended herself against an attack from Pat Buchanan
that she wasn't acting much like a lady.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, during a forum for Senate candidates in Buffalo
hosted by the New York wing of the Reform Party, Clinton told party
members that she would not run on a ticket headed by Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the New York Daily News published
Wednesday, Buchanan fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that kind of inflammatory language comports with
being a first lady,'' he said. ''I think the first lady ought to
always try to be a lady even if she falls short. She certainly did
in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Buchanan's comments, Clinton said the conservative
commentator ''has a history of making prejudiced, anti-Semitic and
intolerant comments and that's why I said last Saturday that I
wouldn't run on a ballot with him. I took the position that anyone
who wants to represent all of New York and all New Yorkers should
be taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Senate rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who also attended Saturday's Independence Party forum, had also
been critical of Buchanan, but has stopped short of saying he
wouldn't share the ballot with him.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's comment was the closest she came to criticizing
Giuliani. Since the mayor announced last week that he was battling
prostate cancer, Clinton has virtually eliminated criticism of him
during her appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the first TV ad her campaign has paid for, Clinton
doesn't mention Giuliani, or her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never crossed my mind,'' she said when asked about not
having the president in her ad. She then laughed. ''I'm using this
opportunity to introduce myself and what I've done for 30 years to
the majority of New Yorkers. There's so much that I want to
communicate to people ... that the real challenge was to put into
30 seconds everything that I wanted to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been running TV ads off and on for several months
and the state Democratic Committee ran pro-Clinton TV ads late last
year. Aides said Clinton's biographical ad would begin running
immediately all across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Both the first lady and her campaign aides have made it clear
that she believes she must establish her identity independent of
the president if she is to win the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said Wednesday that it is still uncertain if
he will attend New York's Democratic state convention on May 16
when she will be nominated. Nonetheless, she said ''I hope he'll be
able to campaign with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And, taking note of a humorous video President Clinton used at
the White House Correspondents Association dinner on Saturday night
in which he is shown chasing after her limousine with a bag lunch
he had made for her, she added: ''To put your mind at rest, he gave
me my lunch today as I was leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady did reiterate her disagreement with her husband's
administration over Vieques Island. She said she wanted a quick
referendum by local residents on the future of the island off
Puerto Rico. The administration has said a referendum should be
held by 2002. She also called for the Pentagon to continue
negotiations with protesters on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani today ridiculed the notion of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know, maybe we should not have a president and we
should have polls and referendums to decide things,'' Giuliani
said. ''And what we can do is, we can save the money for a
president, and we can hold a poll and then the automatic whatever
will execute whatever the poll says.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stop at a tourist center in Fort Edward, where she was
greeted by more than 100 local residents, marked the 59th of New
York's 62 counties that she has visited. Clinton plans to complete
the full tour of the state on Thursday when she makes campaign
stops in Clinton County near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has traveled much less frequently across the
state, planned to be in Rochester on Wednesday night for a college
forum hosted by MSNBC's ''Hardball'' show hosted by Chris Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's visit took her to heavy Republican country in
both Fort Edward and Indian Lake in Hamilton County, the heart of
the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   But she picked up some Republican support in Fort Edward.
Leonard and Clara Bradway said that while they were Republicans,
they planned to vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's a very great lady,'' Clara said. ''She's endured
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans were not swayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a threat to New York state,'' said Dwayne Swanson a
machine operator from South Glen Falls.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Air Defenses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHIGNTON (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed Iraq's air-defense
system Wednesday in the northern no-fly zone after coming under
fire. ''If there is a threat to our forces, we will respond,'' the
State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi forces targeted allied planes with radar and fired
anti-aircraft artillery from a site near Bashiqah, 250 miles north
of Baghdad, according to a statement from the Germany-based U.S.
European Command.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi News Agency said three people were injured
during the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   All allied planes left the area safely, it added.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition aircraft have been enforcing no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to
protect Kurds and Shiites from the forces of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam says the zones violate Iraq's territorial integrity. He
has been challenging the patrols since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, in his first briefing as James P. Rubin's
successor as spokesman, said the State Department works on Iraqi
problems ''every single one of them, every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a threat to our forces, they're going to respond,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're actively working to prevent Saddam's illegal oil exports
and as well as to make the oil-for-food program work. We're
patrolling the Persian Gulf. We're taking diplomatic action. We're
working with opposition forces every day of the year,'' Boucher
said.

   ABC Offers Satellite TV Rebate
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC stepped up its battle with Time Warner
today, offering a $198 rebate to certain cable customers who want
to switch to satellite television. The offer was made through
full-page newspaper ads to Time Warner cable subscribers in New
York City, Houston and Los Angeles. They were among the 3.5 million
customers around the country who lost ABC's signal for a day and a
half because of a battle between the network and Time Warner.
Rebates were made available to the first 1,000 people to respond by
telephone in each city. Within 2{ hours, all of the rebate coupons
were gone, ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said. Time Warner yesterday
reached a temporary truce with ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Co.,
restoring the network's signal to its customers and setting a July
15 deadline to resolve its dispute over compensation for rights to
Disney's cable networks.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell for a second session today as
interest-rate fears kept many buyers on the sidelines. Just before
3 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 257.51 at
10,473.61. The Nasdaq composite index was down 152.22 at 3,633.23.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates on
May 16 in its continuing bid to slow the economy enough to keep
inflation at bay. Most economists are expecting a
quarter-percentage point increase, but worries that the Fed could
boost rates by as much a half-percentage point are rattling the
market.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five interest rate hikes by the Federal

the United States. Orders to U.S. factories rose a
bigger-than-expected 2.2 percent in March, led by the largest jump

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved Alcoa Inc.'s

Alcoa to sell a Reynolds refinery in Texas and Reynolds'
controlling interest in a state-of-the-art Australian refinery.
Antitrust concerns raised by the merger of the nation's two largest
aluminum producers would be resolved by divestiture of the two
refineries, which produce alumina, a powder used in aluminum and
other products, the department said. Together with divestitures
required earlier today by the European Commission, the agreements
require Alcoa to sell all of the alumina capacity owned by
Reynolds.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with cash from a booming economy, the
Treasury Department is setting a regular schedule for buying back

four buybacks already carried out led it to set a regular schedule
for buying back the debt through July, Treasury officials said.
Buybacks will be held in the third and fourth weeks of each month,
with the next one to occur on May 18. In a buyback operation, the
government offers investors cash to turn in certain securities

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Health maintenance organization Kaiser
Permanente has ended a policy that requires psychiatrists to
prescribe depression and anxiety medications for patients they

examination of patients before writing prescriptions, the HMO
announced yesterday. Kaiser is the nation's largest not-for-profit
HMO, serving 8 million members in 11 states and the District of
Columbia. Almost 6 million of its patients are in California. A
former Kaiser psychiatrist, who said he was fired for not following
the old policy, filed a lawsuit last month that drew national

<HEADLINE> McCartney's Case of Puppy Love?  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Paul McCartney's girlfriend says their romance is
a case of puppy love. Her dog is crazy about him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oliver is a great judge of character,'' Heather Mills told
reporters Wednesday as she posed with the 3-year-old terrier at the
launch of a campaign to encourage better treatment of pets. ''He
and Paul get on very well together.''
</P>
<P>
   The former model, whose left leg was amputated below the knee
after she was run down by a police motorcyclist in 1993, said she
couldn't stay with anyone Oliver didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, 32, said she wished she had met McCartney's longtime
wife, Linda, who died of breast cancer in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''To keep any marriage going for 30 years is a fantastic
achievement, but to keep a rock 'n' roll marriage going for that
long is unbelievable,'' Mills said. ''She did a wonderful job with
Paul and her family and I have got nothing but admiration for
her.''

<HEADLINE> German 'Green Cards' Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- An agreement on Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's plans for a U.S.-style ''green card'' system intended
to open borders to foreign high-tech experts came under scrutiny
Wednesday, with economists saying it doesn't go far enough to
entice workers.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on who qualifies for work permits are so tight,
economists said, that even Bill Gates would be barred because he is
a college dropout. At the same time, a five-year limit on how long
they can stay in the country could also keep workers from ever
feeling at home in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which could bring in up to 20,000 workers from Eastern
Europe and India, has been praised by German high-tech businesses
who have pushed Schroeder to help them keep pace with U.S.-based
rivals who routinely poach workers from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a step in the right direction,'' said Heidi Sherman,
chief economist with the Munich-based economic institute Ifo. ''But
it's still on an experimental level. We still have to see who will
want to come to Germany and how many will apply. There are a lot of
question marks surrounding this.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Christian Democrats have loudly opposed the
plan, arguing it would be better to promote education rather than
bring in foreign workers. To make the point, the party's candidate
for governor in North Rhine-Westphalia state has campaigned under
the controversial slogan ''Kinder statt Inder,'' or ''Children
instead of Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes have raised concerns over whether foreign workers
let into Germany under the plan will be able to overcome the
country's lingering reputation for being less-than-welcoming to
foreigners -- despite the fact that more than 7 million already live
here.
</P>
<P>
   Germany also lags behind the United States in incentives such as
stock options, a fringe benefit sought-after technicians have come
to expect. And it has the disadvantage of slapping professionals
with weighty taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people we are trying to attract are not just sitting there
waiting for green cards from Germany,'' said Ulrike Hasbargen, a
senior analyst with Arthur Andersen. ''There are a lot of countries
vying for these experts and just giving green cards is not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives hammered out the details with
government officials late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which applies only to employees in the
information technology sector, workers can receive a five-year work
permit after they prove they have completed a university degree or
have an annual salary of at least $46,500.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, 10,000 workers will be let in, followed by as many as
10,000 more later. Their family members will also be allowed to
move to Germany. None will be eligible for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies have urged the government to help ease what
they say is a shortage of 75,000 qualified workers. But many said
Tuesday's deal is too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under this proposal, even Bill Gates would never have been
allowed,'' said Josef Siegers, a board member of the German
Employers Association, referring to the fact that Gates dropped out
of Harvard to found Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats also criticized the plan for opening the
floodgates to demands from other industries which have begun
clamoring for equal access to foreign workers -- particularly in the
health care and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's Cabinet defended the plan, saying information
technology was not like other sectors because its rapid growth has
outstripped the country's ability to fill the demand for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Top chancellery aide Hans-Martin Bury said the Cabinet would
approve the proposal later this month, with approval expected from
parliament's upper house in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   At that pace, officials said workers could begin coming to
Germany as soon as Aug. 1.

congressional report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said any risk is far outweighed by
the program's benefits, with U.S.-supported scientists of at least
15 Russian institutes rejecting approaches from other nations to
conduct ''questionable research.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office provides no evidence
that Moscow is working on germ weapons, but says it is dangerous to
improve the skills of scientists who have worked on such deadly
pathogens as anthrax, plague and smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the United States has provided $20 million to fund
alternative pursuits by Soviet-era scientists who worked in
biological weaponry programs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposes to spend $220 million over the next
four years expanding the effort to redirect the work of former
Soviet biological weapons institutes, some of which are still
off-limits to foreigners, according to a General Accounting Office
report released Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found that expanding the program will pose certain risks to
the United States,'' by sustaining Russia's existing biological
weapons facilities and advancing Russian war scientists' skills for
conducting offensive research, said the report by the GAO,
Congress' investigative arm.
</P>
<P>
   The report said nothing prevents scientists assisted by the U.S.
program designed to lower the risk of weapons proliferation from
engaging in offensive activities at Russian military facilities or
from selling their skills to rogue states or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, in responding to the report, said there is
no evidence that Moscow is developing germ warfare weapons and
danger of U.S.-assisted Russian scientists helping terrorists or
rogue nations is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   It acknowledged some risks but said they have been reduced to an
acceptable level and ''the benefits far outweigh the remaining
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest anthrax production facility is being
dismantled and Russians are conducting new research that may help
combat some of the world's deadliest diseases, said the State,
Energy and Defense departments in a joint statement accompanying
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ''Congress must carefully evaluate the risks and
benefits of this program to ensure that it does not have unintended
consequences that could jeopardize the national security,'' said
Rep. Floyd Spence, Armed Services Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that some officials who ran Moscow's
clandestine biological weapons programs during the Cold War remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although Russia has generally allowed the United States access
to its nonmilitary institutes that receive U.S. nonproliferation
assistance, Russia has consistently rebuffed U.S. efforts to
inspect its military institutes currently managed by the Ministry
of Defense,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO's conclusions were based on unclassified documents and
on interviews with officials running the U.S. program, with experts
from nongovernmental organizations and with former and current
Russian scientists. Investigators also visited six former Soviet
nonmilitary biological weapons facilities currently receiving U.S.
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Rep.: Mother's Day in Jeopardy  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mother's Day in America could be abolished if
the United States ratifies an international treaty on women's
rights, Rep. Christopher Smith contended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement caused a stir at the House International Relations
Committee, where witnesses urged lawmakers to pass the 20-year-old
U.N. Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow committee member challenged Smith's interpretation of
the treaty and another joked about it.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no laughing matter for an anthropologist and women's
rights activist from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get up and slap him,'' Zieba Shorish-Shamley said
later. ''But then I wouldn't be able to come here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorish-Shamley was one of three women who never got to tell the
committee Wednesday how systematic discrimination in their
homelands has hurt them. No discrimination victims were scheduled
to testify, so three spoke afterward at a news conference scheduled
by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Shorish-Shamley said she lost her 56-year-old sister to cancer
because access to health care is denied to women in Afghanistan,
along with education, jobs, or even the right to leave their homes
unaccompanied by a man.
</P>
<P>
   Meme Akoko of Nigeria said her genitals were cut with an
unsterilized razor blade when she was 3 months old, under a tribal
practice aimed at keeping women sexually faithful to their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been to many doctors and none have been able to undo
what damage the circumcision has cause,'' she said, adding that an
aunt, younger sister and a cousin died because of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brave women ... who tell their personal stories know just
how much ratifying CEDAW will mean to women everywhere,'' Woolsey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in December
1979, requires that women have equal rights to work, pay, benefits
and safe working conditions and prohibits discrimination against
women in political activities. So far, 165 nations have ratified
it.
</P>
<P>
   At the committee hearing, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., called
it an ''an absolute embarrassment'' that the United States has not
ratified the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the convention promotes abortion, could override
the U.S. Constitution and could force social engineering by
dictating the roles husbands and wives will have in their own
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many countries have come under the scrutiny of CEDAW and been
encouraged, admonished, and even compelled to change their laws,''
said Smith, R-N.J., calling the treaty ''controversial and
fundamentally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do our constituents ... really want a group of international
bureaucrats telling them that the day set aside to honor our
mothers must be abolished,'' he said. ''I think not!''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., came in for harsh criticism at the
hearing and the press conference. The chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Helms for years has refused to
schedule hearings or submit the treaty to the full Senate for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is trying to stonewall crucial protection for women's
rights around the world,'' Woolsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms was not immediately available for comment, but said on
International Women's Day March 8: ''This treaty is not about
opportunities for women -- it's about denigrating motherhood and
undermining the family.''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: Quantum Project  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   In every sense, ''Quantum Project'' is a movie for the Internet
generation.
</P>
<P>
   It is billed as the first extended Internet movie with an
established cast and crew. And the movie's plot, production values
and themes of technology vs. humanity are tailored to appeal to the
cyber-sensibilities and fleeting attention span of savvy Web users.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quantum Project'' will be available for $3.95 starting at
12:01 a.m. EDT Friday at SightSound.com, which distributes films
over the Internet. The transaction is a purchase, not a rental, so
viewers can watch the movie as often as they like.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dorff stars in the 32-minute movie as Paul Pentcho, a
brilliant physicist whose humanity has been stunted by his quest to
find God through science. While experimenting in a particle
accelerator, Paul has visions of former lover Mia (Fay Masterson)
and an encounter with a talking electron that asks him what he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation steers Paul into an examination of chance, fate
and will. Freakish coincidence reunites him with Mia, rekindling
his struggle between devotion to science or commitment to love.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hackneyed theme, and ''Quantum Project'' asks a lot of
stereotypical questions without attempting answers more substantive
than that people ''can create their own reality.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cleese makes his estimable presence felt as Paul's father,
an Internet pioneer wrestling with the same questions and lamenting
that he, the ''OB-Gyn at the birth of the Internet,'' now lives in
fortified isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately for the Internet medium, ''Quantum Project'' plays
out like a spoken-word music video, with lightning-quick cuts,
fast-motion effects and more form than substance. Dialogue is
repeated like musical refrains: ''Until you look for it, it doesn't
even exist,'' and the omnipresent ''What do you want?'' -- an echo
of Microsoft's tag line, ''Where do you want to go today?''
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million production has visual effects that might look
cheap on a theater screen but appear reasonably impressive on
computer or TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quantum Project'' represents a technically solid baby step
into the Internet's uncertain future as a movie-delivery system.
Creatively, though, it's little more than a collage of
impressionistic images stitched together by a loose plot.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet is going to become a new outlet for first-run
films, the requirement is the same as it is for television and
movie theaters: If you want an audience, tell a good story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quantum Project'' was made by Metafilmics, which produced the
Robin Williams movie ''What Dreams May Come,'' and was directed by
Academy Award-winning art designer Eugenio Zanetti
(''Restoration'').
</P>
<P>
   SightSound.com estimates ''Quantum Project'' will take 10
minutes to download with high-speed connections such as DSL or
cable and four to six hours for a 56K telephone modem.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 304; Nasdaq Down 166  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more
than 300 points today as interest-rate worries weighed on the
market and investors punished companies that warned of slowing
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 304.66 to 10,426.46. The Dow's
declines were broad-based, with AT&AMP;T, Hewlett-Packard and Wal-Mart
all stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also sharply lower. The Nasdaq
composite index was down 166.73 to 3,618.72 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was down 40.23 to 1,406.04.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for a second session as interest-rate fears kept
many buyers on the sidelines. The Federal Reserve is widely
expected to raise interest rates on May 16 in its continuing bid to
slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting a quarter-percentage point
increase, but worries that the Fed could boost rates by as much a
half-percentage point are rattling the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next key piece of economic data will hit the market on
Friday, when the Labor Department releases employment data for the
month of April. Until then, analysts say, buyers will remain
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is looking for some comfort in the numbers to come
on Friday,'' said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at
First Union Securities in Chicago. ''Especially for investors in
the Old Economy stocks, interest-rate worries are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that non-technology, ''old economy''
stocks could be most hurt by rising interest rates because their
earnings are growing more slowly than the profits of high-tech
companies. Higher interest rates cut into earnings by making it
more expensive to borrow money to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, AT&AMP;T fell 2 15/16 to 39, hurting the blue-chip Dow.
PaineWebber and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette downgraded the stock a
day after company officials warned that full-year operating profits
will likely come in below previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company is still at least a few quarters away from hitting
its stride in key business segment operations,'' said Eric
Strumingher, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Also, software maker Novell fell 6| to 10 15/16 on the Nasdaq
after warning Wall Street that it will miss financial targets in
its fiscal second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods rose 11 13/16 to 62]. Late Tuesday, the maker of
Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise rejected an $18.4
billion takeover offer from multinational consumer products
conglomerate Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The offer valued Bestfoods at 66 per share, a 31 percent premium
to Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday. But Bestfoods said the offer
was not financially adequate and not in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever fell 2 1/16 to 22 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several other food companies rose today as investors anticipated
that any or all could come into play. Heinz rose 3 13/16 to 37} and
Campbell Soup rose 3] to 29~.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stocks were mostly lower after Goldman Sachs removed
several prominent retailers from its list of recommended stocks.
Kohl's fell 5 9/16 to 46\, Target fell 5 3/16 to 63 11/16 and
Costco fell 3 to 51}. All were downgraded from ''recommended'' to
''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also lowered its rating on Dow component Wal-Mart,
sending its shares down 3 15/16 to 53 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 769.70 million shares
in late afternoon, slightly behind Tuesday's pace. On the Nasdaq,
decliners led by a 2-to-1 margin.

<HEADLINE> Hill, McGraw Lead Country Nominees  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Country music's power couple, Tim
McGraw and Faith Hill, led the list of nominees at Wednesday
night's Academy of Country Music awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks, with five nominations, and McGraw and Hill,
with 13 between them, were expected to walk away with an armful of
the cowboy hat-shaped trophies at the 35th edition of the show.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw and Hill planned to offer their first televised
performance of ''Let's Make Love.'' The couple haven't performed
together on television since singing ''It's Your Love'' during the
1997 awards.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, Hill, the Dixie Chicks, Sawyer Brown and Shania Twain
were all nominated for entertainer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The winners are selected by the 3,000-member academy.
</P>
<P>
   Country music great George Jones, who suffered a 1999 near-fatal
auto accident, capped a comeback year with three nominations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the show is without Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, declared the country music artist of the decade last
year, didn't get any nominations this year and said he wouldn't
attend. He spent much of 1999 promoting a pop music album he
recorded under the alias Chris Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   The academy also honored Tammy Wynette, known as the first lady
of country music, who died in 1998. She is the first singer to
receive the academy's Pioneer Award posthumously.

<HEADLINE> Swedish clothier sparks frenzy on Fifth Avenue  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shopping on ritzy Fifth Avenue never used to
mean standing in line. On the priciest stretch of this famous
street, a bulging wallet has always been more important than a
patient heart.
</P>
<P>
   Until a Swedish invader turned things upside down, drawing
throngs of shoppers with low prices in a neighborhood better known
for high-end names like Tiffany and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Hennes &AMP; Mauritz, or H&AMP;M, began its American expansion in
midtown Manhattan a month ago, and has quickly become the hottest
Swedish import since the 1970s supergroup Abba.
</P>
<P>
   Frugal, fashionable shoppers mob the three-floor store daily for
$11 stretchy shorts, $35 shimmery purple pants and $17 bikini
swimsuits. Security guards often ask bargain-seekers to wait
outside until the crowd ebbs, and lines frequently twist down the
block and around a corner.
</P>
<P>
   What's all the fuss about?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cute, trendy clothes for low prices,'' said shopper
Malaika Elcock, 27, of Brooklyn. ''It's more fashion-forward than a
lot of other stores. For basics, I would go to the Gap, but for
trendy stuff I would come here first.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm-based H&AMP;M ventured across the Atlantic in March and
now has three U.S. stores -- on Fifth Avenue, in West Nyack, N.Y.,
and Paramus, N.J. -- with at least one more planned for Manhattan
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fashion-conscious, word is traveling fast.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Hoppins, of Los Gatos, Calif., said she heard about the
store from friends at home and decided to visit during a recent
trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just saying, 'You've got to go see it,' so that's
why I'm here,'' she said as she stood on a short line waiting to be
admitted. ''I just came out of the cab and said, 'Oh, my God, you
have to wait on line to get in?' Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the megastore, hundreds of shoppers, mostly teens and
twenty-somethings, had to squeeze past each other on a recent
afternoon to browse through clothes, outerwear and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Long cash register lines snaked through the showrooms as
customers snatched up the stylishly retro merchandise, including
1970s-esque items like flared brown-and-orange pants and crocheted
purple ponchos.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a phenomenon because the prices are very attractive, and
because the fashions are so different from what has been shown here
before,'' said Walter Loeb, who runs the retail consulting firm
Loeb Associates.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;M -- which now has stores in 14 countries -- says it's thrilled
with the response it's gotten in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over what we expected,'' said Christian Bagnoud, a
company spokesman. ''What we tried to do is exactly what we have
done in Europe. We haven't changed anything in the variety, the
garments.''
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;M announced a profit drop just before the Fifth Avenue store
opened, but it was believed to be mainly a result of the expensive
U.S. expansion, not serious financial problems. Stock prices
plunged when CEO Fabian Maansson resigned around the same time, but
they have since regained most of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish newcomer's biggest draw is its low prices, but the
chain also keeps its stock varied, selling most styles only briefly
and replacing them quickly with new ones to keep customers
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you find something that you like, you have to buy today,
because tomorrow it might be that you can't find it anymore,''
Bagnoud said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers seem to like the high-turnover approach, which
eliminates the worry -- common among shoppers at some clothing
chains -- of ending up dressed just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a much larger variety,'' said shopper Brenda
Singleton, 37, of Raleigh, N.C. ''The Gap is really basic, they
hone in on a few things. Here they have a little bit of
everything.''
</P>

   Singleton, loaded down with an armful of tops and pants, called
them ''play clothes'' and said she knew they might go out of
fashion quickly, but didn't mind because she wasn't paying much.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't come here for work clothes. But it's good prices
for stuff I know I might wear only for (one) summer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of lower quality,'' said a woman who came to make a
return and gave her name as Tammy. ''Disposable things. ... It's
cute stuff but it doesn't look like it's made that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeb, the retail analyst, said the excitement around the Fifth
Avenue store is likely to quiet down. But if H&AMP;M expands
aggressively in the United States, he said, it could pose a real
challenge to chains like the Gap, Old Navy and Kohl's.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't expect to have lines around every store, but I see
the (H&AMP;M) stores crowded around every part of Europe, so why
shouldn't it'' be the same here, he said. ''I think it will be
strong competition.''

<HEADLINE> Carpenter ants symptom of bigger problems  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- If Amy Howansky sees evidence of a carpenter
ant invasion, the first call she makes isn't to an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   It's to a contractor. Or a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   The exterminator can kill the ants that wreak $750 million worth
of havoc on buildings every year nationwide, but at the root of
their presence is a leaky pipe, broken screen, cracked foundation
or other condition that's letting them in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a headache,'' said Howansky, consumer horticulturist
for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Albany County. ''When you have
a headache, the headache isn't the problem, it's a sign of a
problem. When you have ants, it's a sign that you have a leak maybe
somewhere you didn't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Extermination, she said, is only a short-term fix, she said.
''You're going to kill the ants but not get rid of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ants like houses for the same reasons people do. They're warm,
dry and, even with a meticulous housekeeper, usually good sources
of food in the form of crumbs and spills.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, the ants find comfortable cavities between walls,
under floors, even in the hollow of the shower curtain rod and set
up colonies, which can grow to 100,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter ants are one of the largest of the species living in
North America, growing up to 3/4-inch long. They are generally
black but can be brown, red or red and black. They will eat any
kinds of food but prefer sweets and will travel up to 300 feet from
the nest in search of a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter ants don't eat wood. They burrow through it, carrying
out a smooth and clean sawdust -- and the corpses of fallen workers
-- as they tunnel into a house. Piles of sawdust and ant bodies are
a good sign of infestation. They prefer wet or decayed wood and
they can seriously damage a house. The sandy soils and pine trees
of upstate New York are an inviting habitat for the creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Recent warm winters may mean more ants this spring, said David
Swann of Terminix International.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chance of infestation:
</P>
<P>
   -- Inspect doors, windows, plumbing, the roof and other points of
entry, repairing even small holes, leaks or cracks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Store firewood off the ground at least 15 feet away from the
house.
</P>
<P>
   -- Remove dead trees and stumps and trim branches that hang over
or touch the house.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep cupboards clean.
</P>
<P>
   -- Store garbage in dry places, empty often and keep the bin
clean.
</P>
<P>
   If the house is infested, there are over-the-counter poisons
available or the homeowner can call an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   Exterminators may need to repeat applications to get rid of the
persistent pests, Swann said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing that is for sure, when people built their houses,
they built them on top of ants,'' Swann said. ''The ants were here
first.''

<HEADLINE> Croatian Ship Captain Arrested in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A tanker captain has been charged with failing
to report a leak in his ship, after an investigation that began
when a member of his crew slipped a note to Coast Guardsmen who had
come aboard for a routine inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Davor Maric of Croatia was arrested and released on $30,000 bail
Tuesday. His passport was confiscated and his movements were
restricted to metropolitan Baltimore and the Croatian Embassy in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from an incident March 22, when Maric attempted
to unload part of the Norwegian tanker's cargo of liquid ammonium
nitrate in Baltimore before proceeding to Tampa, Fla., prosecutors
said. Ammonium nitrate is used in fertilizer and other products.
</P>
<P>
   When a Coast Guard team boarded the ship that day, a crew member
slipped an inspector a handwritten note that read, ''THIS IS
CONFIDENTIAL. ''DON'T SHOW TO THE C/E SIR.'' ''C/E'' stands for
''chief engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   The note said the tanker had a crack in its hull. Another crew
member then told an inspector the ship was taking on water and was
in danger of sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors found a large, hastily patched 12-by-18-inch hole in
the engine room of the 6,379-ton Freja Jutlandic. They later
uncovered records indicating the ship's operator had asked the
captain to keep quiet about the damage, first discovered March 12
en route from Europe to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The ship initially leaked about 105 gallons of oily water per
hour. The crew later estimated the ship leaked about five times
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Maric stem from the safety hazard of not
reporting the structural damage to the ship, not from environmental
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Coast Guard inspectors said they ''observed a
cascade of water flowing into the bilge from a square cement patch
on the side of the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship was later placed in dry dock, repaired and allowed to
leave for Tampa, returning to Baltimore with a cargo of molasses on
April 23. The ship was searched again on April 25. That search
uncovered the documents that led to Maric's arrest Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Maric faces charges of violating federal laws that require
reporting hazardous conditions to the Coast Guard and with creating
false entries in the ship's record to conceal the dumping of
untreated oily waste. Both violations carry possible five-year
prison sentences.

<HEADLINE> Greece-Turkey Relations Improving  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said
Wednesday that relations with Turkey have improved, partly the
result of cooperation in earthquake relief, and Athens is helping
Turkey prepare for membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Greece does not believe that Turkey's Muslim culture should be
an obstacle to joining the 15-nation EU, Papandreou told reporters
at the Greek Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is truly a blossoming of nongovernmental contacts,
business people, journalists,'' he said. ''Day in, day out.''
</P>
<P>
   The same spirit prevails among the Turkish and Greek Cypriot
communities on divided Cyprus, he said. He cited a turnout of blood
donors from both along the dividing line to help two children with
leukemia, one Turkish Cypriot, the other Greek Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this new spirit, this dividing line is an anachronism,''
Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the United Nations due to convene a third round of
talks on May 23, Papandreou said, ''We haven't seen much of a
change'' on moving toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides was to have an
intestinal operation Friday, and will be on the sidelines for two
weeks, possibly forcing him to postpone negotiations with Turkish
Cypriots, Cyprus Radio said Wednesday in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish troops invaded the island in 1974, occupying about
one-third of the country. An independent republic was established
that is recognized only by Turkey and is bolstered by Turkish
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Rauf Denktash was sworn in last month for his fourth term as
president of the republic and pledged to work ''to elevate the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.''
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou said Denktash apparently wants to be ''king of the
hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, the Greek minister said, is to build on
increasing good will and contact between the two communities and
consider ways two zones can be locally administered under a federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one knows if this round is going to be successful,''
Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the long run, he said the new atmosphere between Greece
and Turkey and on Cyprus itself ''will play a role -- either in
solving this problem or making it difficult for Turkey to be
accepted by the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou said later in a speech to the American Jewish
Committee that ''the road to reconciliation is not paved with
roses. Both in Greece and Turkey, there have been voices of
dissent. Extremist militant and nationalist elements have attempted
to undermine'' the improving relationship between Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''Cyprus can and must become a showcase -- living
proof of how different races and religions can live together in
harmony.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Chastises on 'Big Dig'  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, upset at massive cost
overruns for the ''Big Dig'' tunnel project through downtown
Boston, said Wednesday he may introduce legislation to ensure no
more federal money is spent on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think taxpayers deserve a law that says at some point this
has to stop,'' McCain told project officials during a hearing of
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that
he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican also berated the project's main
contractor for allowing costs to skyrocket and said future
contracts for big public works projects should include financial
penalties for overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be some penalty. I don't know many places in the
world that would submit or accept this kind of performance,''
McCain told Matthew Wiley, project manager for Bechtel/Parsons
Brinckerhoff.
</P>
<P>
   The project, officially known as the Central Artery/Third Harbor
Tunnel Project, will sink Interstate 93 beneath downtown Boston. It
originally was expected to cost $2.6 billion, but the latest
federal estimate pegs the price tag at $13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has earmarked $8.5 billion for the
project, which is expected to be completed in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gov. Paul Cellucci removed Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority Chairman James J. Kerasiotes after auditors detailed how
Big Dig officials in February failed to report $1.4 billion in
expected cost overruns to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, auditors said the failure to immediately
disclose cost overruns ''stands as one of the most flagrant
breaches of the integrity of the federal-state partnership in the
history of the nearly 85-year-old federal aid highway program.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Natsios, the new head of the turnpike authority, told
McCain's committee the state will not ask Congress for more money.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our problem and we are going to deal with it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has begun cost-cutting initiatives, such as
firing the Big Dig's contingent of legislative lobbyists and public
relations consultants.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, noting the project is only 60 percent complete,
expressed concern the federal government still might be tapped for
more money.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater acknowledged there
is nothing that would preclude Congress from spending more than
$8.5 billion on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cap is not in statute or necessarily in writing,'' Slater
told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said legislation to cap funding is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''In effect there is a cap already because no one in the U.S.
Congress is going to vote for giving us more money ever again.
Maybe the Massachusetts delegation might but we are going to be
roundly beaten,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry suggested a written agreement signed by all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Slater backed that idea. If such an agreement could not be made
to stick, then would be the time to look at legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day we may do that,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the beginning of the day we may do that,'' McCain shot
back.

<HEADLINE> Dry Outlook Boosts Grains, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Dry weather forecasts pushed soybeans futures
prices higher in trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade,
where they briefly reached new 17-month highs for the third
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures also closed strongly higher, partly due to worries
about dry weather in some of China's growing regions and
speculation that China will place orders for U.S. wheat next week.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures prices also continued to rise on news of dry
conditions in the western corn belt, and despite heavy planting.
</P>
<P>
   Grains and soybeans prices have been affected by forecasts
calling for continued hot, dry weather in the U.S. Plains and
western corn belt. Forecasts indicate that a complex weather
pattern could prolong the dry, warm conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 6\ cents to $2.72 a bushel; July
corn rose 4{ cents to $2.50} a bushel; July oats rose 1} cents to
$1.28\ a bushel; and July soybeans rose 6{ cents to $5.72 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures prices fell in trading Wednesday on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle was unchanged at 68.90 cents a pound; August
feeder cattle fell .77 cent to 84.70 cents a pound; June lean hogs
fell 2 cents to 74.27 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 3 cents
to 92.62 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bail cut for man accused of killing ex-girlfriend on wedding day  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- A state judge on Wednesday reduced the
bail for a prominent businessman accused of killing his
ex-girlfriend on her wedding day from $5 million to $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Agustin Garcia, however, are uncertain how quickly
they can post the new bail and indicated they will still pursue a
''passion provocation'' defense. They said they expect an
indictment soon, and that a trial is at least a half-year away.
</P>
<P>
   During a half-hour bail hearing, Assistant Bergen County
Prosecutor James V. Santulli argued against any reduction and said
a decision on whether to seek the death penalty ''would be made
shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 48, of North Bergen, has been jailed since the Sept. 26,
1999, shooting of Gladys Ricart at her home in Ridgefield as she
prepared to marry James Preston, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, well-known in the Dominican community in New Jersey and
New York as head of several nonprofit organizations, did not speak
during the half-hour hearing. He was shackled at the wrists and
ankles, and wore an orange jail jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He was unaware that the 39-year-old accountant was marrying
another man, his lawyers maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judge, this was not a premeditated situation,'' Garcia lawyer
Fernando J. Oliver said, arguing Garcia poses no danger if
released.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver discounted prosecution claims that Garcia had stalked
Ricart for eight months, asserting that defense investigators have
interviewed more than 60 people, including 24 who place Garcia and
Ricart together during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Those people say the couple introduced each other at political
and business events as ''husband and wife,'' and were ''in a
romantically involved relationship,'' even ''up to the night before
her death,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Although born in the Dominican Republic, Garcia is a U.S.
citizen and has deep family and social ties to the area, so would
be unlikely to flee, Oliver said, pointing to 40 Garcia supporters
in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Santulli, pointing to Preston and Ricart's family in the
audience, countered that Garcia is both a danger to them and a
flight risk since his parents remain in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''In taking a life in front of all those witnesses shows he is a
very desperate person, and a desperate person is a risk to flee,''
Santulli said, noting Garcia faces, at a minimum, significant
prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said it was ''uncontroverted'' that Garcia walked
into Ricart's home and emptied an illegal handgun by firing five
shots ''nearly point-blank'' at Ricart, striking her three times.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had additional bullets in his pocket and had opened the
chamber to reload'' when he was subdued by Juan Ricart, the bride's
brother, Santulli said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say a videotape taken by a professional wedding
photographer hired by Ricart shows some of what happened at
Ricart's house.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has not seen it yet and maintained that Santulli's
statements cannot be considered facts.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge William C. Meehan, noting that the
Dominican Republic has an extradition treaty with the United
States, said that in addition to posting $1.5 million bail, Garcia
cannot be freed until he provides the court with the New Jersey
address where he will reside and sign a waiver of extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, who set the $5 million bail in September, also ordered
that Garcia wear an electronic ankle bracelet to ensure he remains
under house arrest, aside from visits to lawyers and other approved
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Oliver said it appears that family and friends
will have to post property in order for Garcia to make bail.

<HEADLINE> Postal Finance Chief Named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Northern Virginia district postal manager
was named acting chief financial officer for the Postal Service on
Wednesday, replacing a man who resigned last month amid a furor
over excessive moving expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Strasser was appointed acting chief finance officer
and executive vice president by Postmaster General William
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming Northern Virginia operations manager, Strasser,
a 30-year veteran of the agency, had held postal financial and
management jobs, including serving as the agency's chief marketing
officer and chief planning officer.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds Richard Porras, who retired after a report from the
post office's inspector general criticized payment of $248,000 in
moving expenses for Porras and then controller John Ward, both of
whom moved less than 50 miles and continued working in the same
offices. Ward has been reassigned to the service's marketing
department.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar over the payments also prompted the agency's board of
governors to assume oversight of all future management moving
expenses and to launch a study of management pay and benefits.

<HEADLINE> Retrial Sought in Jail Chief Death  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES E. BEGGS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Eleven years after the murder of Oregon's
corrections chief, the man convicted in the stabbing is asking for
a new trial -- with the support of the victim's family -- based on
the claim that his lawyer was drunk during his 1991 trial.
</P>
<P>
   After years of appeals and repeated claims of innocence from
drug dealer Frank Gable, two days of hearings on his request for a
retrial were set to conclude Wednesday. It could be weeks before
Judge Frank Yraguen rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gable, 40, was convicted in 1991 of stabbing Corrections
Director Michael Francke in the heart while trying to break into
Francke's car outside state corrections headquarters. A jury spared
Gable the death penalty and gave him life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Gable, himself a recovering alcoholic, said his court-appointed
attorney, Robert Abel, was drinking during the trial and botched
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The job he did ... was horrendous,'' Gable said at the hearing
on Tuesday, recalling that he smelled alcohol on Abel's breath at
various times. ''He popped breath mints like they were going out of
style.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing on Wednesday, Abel denied the allegation that he
was drunk during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gable's claim of innocence is getting support from a surprising
quarter -- Francke's mother and two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear Frank Gable was not properly represented and was
denied his rights under Oregon law,'' said Kansas City businessman
Patrick Francke. He added: ''I don't think Frank Gable killed my
brother. There is nothing that connects Frank Gable to the murder
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Francke's mother, 86-year-old Helen Francke, and brother Kevin
Francke all said Tuesday they believe someone else committed the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Francke was 42 and had been head of
the state prison system for two years. The 1989 murder shocked
Oregon. There was speculation -- later discounted -- that the murder
was linked to an investigation by Francke into allegedly shady
dealings in his department.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gable's current lawyer called five witnesses who
testified that Abel smelled of alcohol at various times.
</P>
<P>
   Gable also contended that at least two people called as
witnesses at his trial lied about his whereabouts at the time of
the killing, and that Abel failed to counter them with witnesses
who could support his alibi.
</P>
<P>
   One of the witnesses, convicted drug dealer Cappie Harden,
testified at the trial that he saw Gable stab Francke. Harden was
apparently the only witness to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gable also said Abel wouldn't let him testify at the trial. ''I
demanded to testify, and Abel stood up and rested'' the defense
case, Gable said.
</P>
<P>
   Abel denied that he was drunk during the trial and rejected the
assertion that he didn't give Gable a chance to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never told him he couldn't testify,'' Abel said. ''That
would be insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Abel also rejected the claims that he had mounted an incompetent
defense. ''In a case like this, you do everything you can,'' said
Abel, adding that he made long and detailed preparations for the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, District Attorney Dale Penn said the
right man was convicted. ''Our goal was to get to the truth, and
there's no doubt in my mind that Frank Gable killed Michael
Francke,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Euro Plunges to Yet Another Low  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The euro tumbled to yet another low in
its steepest selloff ever Wednesday, not only falling below 90
cents for the first time, but also retreating below 89 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless the European Central Bank performs a miraculous rescue
mission, anyone on board the euro may as well be on board the
Titanic,'' said Neil Parker, senior European economist at Royal
Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The response of the central bank was calm, as its vice chairman
appeared before the European Parliament and predicted that the
currency of 11 nations would rebound due to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want a stronger euro and are confident that this will
materialize,'' Christian Noyer, the vice chairman of the ECB, told
the EU assembly's economic affairs committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly we have no sacred wish to push the euro down,''
Noyer said. He added that the central bank is well aware that a
falling currency can push inflation higher by raising the price of
imports, especially oil -- which is priced in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell as low as 88.85 cents Wednesday, down 2.2 cents
from its high point Tuesday of 91.07 cents, the biggest such
one-day decline ever. By the end of trading in New York, the euro
had recovered some lost ground and was quoted at 89.61 cents
compared with a late rate Tuesday of 90.73 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's previous low of 90.30 cents was reached during
trading last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The selling came as the European Commission and central bank
backed the entry of Greece into the monetary union, which critics
contended would further weaken the euro. Some analysts said the
currency was on its way down anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a very established trend, and once a trend develops,
it's hard for it to turn on a dime,'' said Grant Wilson, vice
president of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   At its new low, the euro was down 25 percent from the all-time
high of $1.1886 reached during its first day of trading, Jan. 4,
1999. It also was down 12 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the low euro raises the price of imports, it makes it more
difficult for businesses in the United States, Britain, Japan and
other strong economies to sell their products in the 11-nation
zone. But it helps tourists stretch their vacation dollars in
Europe and bolsters exports from the euro region.
</P>
<P>
   Noyer reiterated the central bank's concerns that a weak
currency carried inflationary risks over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But he would not comment on the euro's new low, or whether the
ECB would step in to try to turn it around-- a move the Frankfurt,
Germany-based institution has resisted so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never comment on possible intervention before'' it
happens, Noyer told the parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB nudged its key short-term interest rate up one-quarter
of a percentage point last week, to 3.75 percent, to counter
''inflationary pressure'' already being felt he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bernhard Pfaff, from Commerzbank in Frankfurt said the
interest rate hike by the ECB last week was interpreted by the
markets as not enough, thus it gave no support to the sinking
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff said the latest drop of the euro could not be explained by
fundamentals in the European economy, which are mostly good.
''Dollar investments just look more attractive,'' said Pfaff
especially given the ''dynamic U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   European leaders kept a stiff upper lip, insisting that the
economic recovery under way across the continent was bound to turn
the euro around soon.
</P>
<P>
   Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said the euro
''should not be measured on its value against the dollar (but) on
what it can safeguard in our area.''
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's spokesman, Uwe-Karsten
Heye, said the German government viewed the latest development
''with great calmness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the euro's woes, the European Commission and the ECB
backed Greece's bid to join the euro-zone by Jan. 1, 2001
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Pedro
Solbes, rejected criticism that Greek membership would further drag
down the euro-zone's single currency and said Greece's bid was
based on the same economic criteria as the other members.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Launches Euro Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The government launched a campaign
Wednesday to persuade Danes to adopt the euro -- the same day the
currency slid to a new low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is aimed at garnering support for a referendum
being held in September that will ask voters whether they want to
switch from the Danish kroner to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're putting all our strength in getting a 'yes' on Sept.
28,'' said Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in launching the
''Best for Denmark'' publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate Danes are evenly split on whether to join
the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published last week showed 46 percent favor the euro,
44 percent were against, and 10 percent were undecided. The margin
of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Nyrup Rasmussen's ruling Social Democratic party strongly
endorsed the euro at a meeting Sunday. On Wednesday, he introduced
a 10-member team that will crisscross the country to drum up public
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''There won't be much summer holiday,'' Party Secretary Willy
Stig Andersen said. ''But it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party members and pro-euro activists will make statements,
answer questions and hand out promotional material at market
squares, shopping malls, beaches and just about anywhere they can
find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Since the euro was launched by 11 European Union countries in
January 1999, it has mostly sagged against the dollar. Denmark,
Sweden and Britain have declined to adopt the euro in its initial
phase.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was quoted as low as 88.85 cents Wednesday -- 25 percent
off its all-time high and the first time it has sunk below 90 cents
-- before moving slightly higher to 89.61 cents in New York trading,
</P>
<P>
   Nyrup Rasmussen said the euro ''shouldn't be measured on its
value against the dollar (but) on what it can safeguard in our
(European) area.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Denmark is not part of the euro zone, its Central Bank
governor and economics minister have little say in policies decided
by the European Central Bank, where their EU colleagues sit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I joined the Social Democratic Youth Party when I was 13
because I wanted to have influence on our lives,'' said Nina Groes,
a 21-year-old party campaigner. ''This is exactly the same we're
doing when we're voting to join the euro. We want to be where the
decisions are taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents -- chiefly on the far right and left political flanks --
say the euro will undermine Denmark's sovereignty and its social
welfare system. They claim Denmark would lose part of its national
identity if coins and bills with the image of Queen Margrethe were
replaced by EU coins and bank notes.

<HEADLINE> EU Bodies OK Greece Bid for Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Central Bank and the
European Commission have each endorsed Greece's bid to join the
European Union's single currency and replace its drachma with the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Solbes, EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs,
told the European Parliament's economic committee on Wednesday that
Greece met all necessary requirements on inflation, deficit and
debt for entry into the euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is now expected to join the single currency in January
2001, pending final approval by EU leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   Solbes rejected criticism that Greek membership would further
drag down the euro-zone's single currency which was traded at a new
low of under 89 cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was quoted as low as 88.85 cents Wednesday -- 25 percent
off its all-time high -- before moving slightly higher to 89.61
cents in New York trading.
</P>
<P>
   He said Greece's bid was based on the same economic criteria as
the other 11 members, which began using the currency in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that this will bring any difficulty to the
euro,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solbes warned however that Greece still faces the risk of high
inflation due to high interest rates and its exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be necessary for the Greek government to maintain its
stability-oriented strategy, in particular, a tight budgetary
policy stance and a continuation of wage moderation.'' Solbes said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank also gave its approval to Greek
membership in the euro-zone on WEdnesday, but echoed concerns that
Greece must keep its inflation in check and said that it must
reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yiannos Papantoniou, Greek finance minister, welcomed the
endorsement and said the reports were ''the justification, the
reward of an economic policy which was exercised with insistence,
with stability, with punctuality for six years.''
</P>
<P>
   The country was kept out of the euro's 1999 launch because it
failed to meet the requirements for entry at that stage.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Police Storm Hijacked Bus  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGASHI HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- A teen-ager armed with a knife
hijacked a bus carrying about 20 people in southwestern Japan
today, stabbing three women passengers, one of them fatally.
</P>
<P>
   After a 190-mile chase and hours of negotiations, police stormed
the bus and arrested the teen-age hijacker early Thursday at a
highway rest stop. None of the people remaining on the bus was
injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid billowing smoke, police pulled out the passengers from the
bus where they had been trapped for about 16 hours. Earlier, the
teen had broken off previous negotiations and been allowed to get
back on the highway after he held his knife to the throat of a
6-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen police and news helicopters circled overhead during
the chase and standoff in a parking lot, and television stations
canceled regular programming to broadcast live updates.
</P>
<P>
   During the hijacking, a newspaper ran a fuzzy photo showing a
young man standing behind the driver wearing glasses and jeans. He
was identified as the hijacker. Passengers who were freed said he
carried a knife about 16 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the hijacker was 17. They were joined in
negotiations by members of the boy's family from Saga city on
Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu, where the bus trip had
departed around noon on its way to Fukuoka city.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking began about 1 p.m. on Sanyo Expressway. A male
passenger, Masayuki Kisikawa, told police the kidnapper suddenly
stood up, drew his knife and began yelling.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they learned of the hijacking from a female
passenger who escaped after she was let off the bus at a toll booth
near the city of Moji to go to the bathroom and called authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, another woman jumped out a window of the bus as it
was moving, said Yamaguchi Prefecture police spokesman Junichi
Takezaki. She was injured and taken to a nearby hospital, where she
told police she saw the hijacker stab and seriously wound at least
two passengers before she jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Kisikawa then became the third passenger to escape, jumping from
the moving bus and suffering light injuries. ''When I saw police
around the bus, I got up my courage and jumped when it slowed
down,'' police quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, television stations in Japan showed the white bus
driving down the Sanyo Expressway in Yamaguchi Prefecture followed
by police cars, and TV and police helicopters in a scene
reminiscent of the televised 1994 police chase of former football
player O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   About five hours after the ordeal began, the bus stopped near a
tunnel on the highway and the hijacker released four male
passengers, one of them injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police vehicles then blocked the highway in Hiroshima city with
a large bus and forced the bus to drive down a ramp into a nearby
parking area, where authorities began negotiating with the hijacker
through an open window. During the negotiations, they persuaded him
to free three women, all of whom had been stabbed in the neck, and
another passenger escaped. Police said one of the injured women,
68-year-old Tatsuko Tsukamoto, died later at Hiroshima University
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The bus then suddenly left the parking lot and headed east on
the highway toward Tokyo with police cars driving in front of and
behind it. Police said the bus was allowed to move after the
kidnapper held a knife to the throat of the 6-year-old girl and
demanded to be given a gun and driven to Tokyo. Strict gun-control
laws prevent most people from owning firearms in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes later, the bus stopped for gas. There, police
delivered food and tea to the vehicle and resumed talking with the
captor. The talks led to the release of two other women hostages,
reducing the number of captives to about six, police said.

<HEADLINE> S. F. Examiner Publisher Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp. suspended the San
Francisco Examiner's publisher after he testified that he offered
Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorials if he supported the
company's deal to buy the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Brown denied there was any impropriety and said he thinks the
Examiner's Timothy White was ''bushwhacked.''
</P>
<P>
   White, editor and publisher of the Hearst-owned Examiner, was
taking an ''indefinite leave of absence,'' Hearst announced late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White testified Monday in the federal antitrust trial
challenging Hearst's $660 million purchase of the rival Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In statements Tuesday, Hearst contended that the conversation
White described on the witness stand never happened, or, if it did
happen, violated company policy. And White recanted his testimony
in a statement issued by Hearst: ''I was tired and confused by the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein said he was present at
the lunch meeting when Brown talked with White and there was ''no
discussion whatsoever about any favorable coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of the kind of things that are being talked about,
'horse trading' and so forth, there was none of that,'' Bronstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown told the Chronicle on Tuesday: ''There was no impropriety
to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember a very pleasant lunch,'' Brown said. ''It sounds
like Mr. White was bushwhacked, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's spokeswoman told The Associated Press today that
Brown was referring to his questioning on the witness stand by
lawyer Joseph M. Alioto, representing businessman and political
figure Clint Reilly, who is challenging the newspaper sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''A wide variety of subjects were discussed but nothing seemed
inappropriate,'' Kandace Bender, Brown's spokeswoman said today.
''The mayor has led the charge to keep the Examiner alive. He wants
a two-newspaper town.''
</P>
<P>
   White's duties will be handled by George Irish, president of
Hearst Newspapers, the company said. White did not return a phone
message left at his office.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawyers said that no denial of White's statement was
offered in court under oath and that Hearst lawyers passed up a
chance to call White back to the stand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cowardly,'' Alioto, one of the lawyers, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked today for a restraining order prohibiting Hearst
Corp. from punishing employees for their testimony. He was turned
down by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Tuesday that Irish, Hearst CEO Frank Bennack Jr. and
other Hearst executives had to know about White's comments to Brown
because they received e-mail from White describing the meeting. He
said White was being used as a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chronicle, Managing Editor Jerry Roberts said the staff
was surprised and even upset about White's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it calls into question the credibility of what you
read on the editorial page,'' Roberts said. ''In other words, is
this really what the editorial board and the editorial writers
believe, or is this somehow something that's put in there for some
ulterior motive.''
</P>
<P>
   White's disclosure overshadowed the opening of the trial on
Reilly's lawsuit seeking to prevent Hearst from buying the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends the acquisition of California's second-largest
newspaper would give Hearst an illegal monopoly, despite approval
of the sale by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, an unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner, contends
Hearst's agreement to give its flagship newspaper to publisher Ted
Fang, along with a $66 million subsidy over three years, is
designed to let the paper fail quickly and leave the city with a
single newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   White testified Monday that he met with Brown on Aug. 30, as the
mayor's re-election campaign against Reilly and two other
candidates was heating up. Brown had publicly opposed Hearst's
plans, announced Aug. 6, to buy the Chronicle and sell or merge the
Examiner into the larger paper.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked White if he had told Brown that support of the sale
would get him ''more favorable treatment in the Examiner.'' White
said yes, and later specified that he was talking only about
editorials, not news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail sent afterward to the head of Hearst's newspaper
division and read in court, White said, ''I asked Willie how I was
going to justify to my superiors in New York wanting to support him
and cooperate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to
make our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the meeting, Brown worked behind the scenes
to support the Examiner sale.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Critical of Agency Reports  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many federal agencies are doing a terrible job
writing mandatory performance reports and should be penalized for
their shoddy work, Sen. Fred Thompson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chairman released a
study that ranked the agencies according to the quality of their
year-end reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these agencies still don't know how to write a
report,'' said Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A then-Democratic Congress passed a law in 1993 requiring the
reports, but the first ones were not due until this year. They
covered fiscal 1999 and had to be completed by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by George Mason University's Mercatus
Center, analyzed the reports by 24 agencies, then ranked them
according to readability and how well they documented public
benefits, forward-looking leadership and improvement strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development and the
departments of Transportation and Veterans Affairs were deemed to
have the best reports.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation ranked last for its disorganized
and poorly formatted report, according to the study. Among other
things, NSF did not attempt to compare 1999 results to those from
previous years and did not discuss management challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Commerce report was slightly better than the
NSF document but there is ''slim chance that many people will read
its 180 pages laden with undefined acronyms, technical jargon and
poorly designed tables,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies have had seven years to comply with the law and now
should pay for failing to meet all of the reporting requirements,
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There needs to be some sanctions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he ordered the General Accounting Office, the
inspectors general for the agencies and the Congressional Research
Service to further analyze the reports.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would forward the information they glean to chairs of
the congressional committees that control the agencies' budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be able to get them some useful information even this
year,'' Thompson said. ''Some people are going to have to answer
questions.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Boosts Stock Option Access  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation approved by the House on Wednesday
and sent to President Clinton would remove a possible obstacle to
companies offering stock option plans to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved 421-0, amends the 1938 Fair Labor Standards
Act to make clear that stock option profits should not be
considered a part of regular pay in determining overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Labor Department issued an opinion stating that
profits from the exercising of stock options would have to be
included in calculating the regular rate of pay. That decision
raised concerns that employers would be disinclined to offer stock
options to hourly workers if that would significantly drive up the
costs of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The House's chief sponsor, Rep. Randy ''Duke'' Cunningham,
R-Calif., said that when the 1938 law was written, no one knew that
want ads today would be filled with jobs offering stock options.
''Workers look at these things when they select a job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, stock options, stock appreciation rights
and bona fide stock purchases would be treated as employee benefits
and would not be used in calculating overtime compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stock option programs are new avenues for the front-line
worker,'' said Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y., in support of the
legislation. ''However, the right to overtime remains protected by
the Fair Labor Standards Group for this same group of employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The identical Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., passed the Senate last month by 95-0 and is supported by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   An administration statement said it would ''provide employers
with needed flexibility to reward their workers in a global economy
without weakening the vital protections provided by the Fair Labor
Standards Act for American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is S. 2323.

<HEADLINE> Democrats: DeLay Is Racketeering  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats filed suit under civil
anti-racketeering laws Wednesday against House Republican Whip Tom
DeLay, alleging he oversees an organization that extorts campaign
contributions and evades federal disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who chairs the Democratic campaign
committee, said Rep. DeLay stands atop an unprecedented operation,
''hammering contributors for money, threatening to punish those who
decline and setting up a shadow party structure outside public view
and our laws ...''
</P>
<P>
   Several of DeLay's aides greeted reporters arriving for the news
conference where the suit was announced and handed them written
statements accusing Democrats of ''resorting to ugly, unfounded,
politically motivated charges ...''
</P>
<P>
   His office later accused Kennedy and House Democratic Leader
Dick Gephardt of ''political terrorism and personal destruction''
and said DeLay deserves ''a personal apology.''
</P>
<P>
   In their legal complaint and in response to reporters'
questions, Democrats cited numerous newspaper and magazine articles
but said they had no independent proof of their claims. They said
they hope to question DeLay's associates as the lawsuit proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, is the latest in a
constant refrain of charge and counter-charge between the political
parties over alleged violations of campaign fund-raising laws.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as an election-season counter to a GOP effort to make
a campaign issue of Vice President Al Gore's controversial
fund-raising activities in the 1996 election. At the same time,
beginning with the departure of former Speaker Newt Gingrich 16
months ago, Democrats have periodically tried to turn DeLay, a
Texan whose nickname is ''The Hammer,'' into a symbol of the GOP
Congress they constantly accuse of arrogant extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gross, a private lawyer and former general counsel at the
Federal Election Commission, said ''it's a stretch to say you can
apply the (anti-rackeeting laws) to political fund-raising and make
it stick.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that if Democrats can win the right to
subpoena documents, they could gain access to internal memoranda
and ''cause a lot of consternation'' to DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic lawsuit alleges that as whip, DeLay has long
''threatened to withhold favorable action on'' legislation unless
an affected party increased contributions to Republicans and cut
them to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and his agents ''have engaged in a scheme to extort
political contributions from individuals and entities with
interests before Congress and to avoid otherwise applicable
reporting requirements relating to donors and political
contributions and expenditures,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   It alleges that DeLay has established a network of political
organizations, independent from traditional GOP groups, that are
not registered under federal election law and don't report on their
donors. The suit says DeLay's operation directs GOP donors to
contribute to these organizations, thus evading reporting
requirements that would otherwise apply.
</P>
<P>
   These organizations were identified as the U.S. Family Network,
the Republican Majority Issues Committee and Americans for Economic
Growth. The DeLay associates involved in their operation were named
as Ed Buckham, his former chief of staff; Karl Gallant and Jim
Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Gallant issued a statement labeling the suit ''an attack by
(Democratic) party hacks against independent issues groups, and
therefore an attack on the First Amendment as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy asked the Justice Department a year ago to investigate
whether the Republicans were violating campaign laws by raising
funds for the Republican Majority Issues Committee. The complaint
was eventually referred to the Federal Election Commission, often a
graveyard for such politically-charged disputes.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $140 million effort to restore the Lake
Pontchartrain Basin would be launched under a bill the House passed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The basin is 5,000 square miles and encompasses 16 parishes in
southeast Louisiana and four Mississippi counties. At its center is
the 630-square mile Lake Pontchartrain, the second largest lake in
the United States after the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed by a 418-6 vote, amends the Clean
Water Act to establish a program for water quality restoration
activities in the basin. The Senate has not acted on a companion
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the basin has been hurt over the years by
wetland loss, human activities and natural forces.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. David Vitter of Louisiana, the bill's sponsor, said the
measure would, ''facilitate and accelerate the restoration,

<HEADLINE> Barak: Settle Treaty's Basic Terms  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Trying to win political support for land
concessions, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants to settle the
basic terms of a peace treaty before saying how much land he will
give the Palestinians in an interim withdrawal, an aide said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. mediator said the two sides will need at least six more
weeks of intense negotiations to reach an outline of the treaty --
meaning they will miss yet another peace deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The outline was initially due Feb. 13 and then postponed to this
month. The full treaty, which will tackle issues like Palestinian
statehood, Palestinian refugees, contested Jerusalem and Jewish
settlements, is due Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are also to discuss the scope of a third and final
interim Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. But Barak is trying
to postpone those talks, in exchange for giving the Palestinians
full control over three Jerusalem suburbs as a good will gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hopes that Israelis will be more likely to support giving
land to the Palestinians if the broad outlines of a final peace
treaty are already in place. He has promised to bring the treaty to
a national referendum and is considering putting the outline
agreement to a referendum vote, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, who often speaks for Barak, said
talks in the Red Sea resort of Eilat would stall if negotiators
tackled the interim withdrawal now.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go now directly to negotiations on the third phase of
redeployment means that there is no chance to reach any
agreement,'' Ramon told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   During the latest round of talks, which began Sunday, there have
been alternating sessions on both issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Barak cannot even get his diverse Cabinet to
agree to give up the three villages.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the issue, originally planned for Wednesday, was
postponed due to opposition from parties in Barak's coalition,
including the ultra-Orthodox Shas party that wants Barak to hand
over millions of dollars to its struggling religious school system.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said he hoped Shas would agree to the handover within
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two hawkish coalition parties, the National Religious Party and
Israel B'Aliya, which represents immigrants, have threatened to
leave the government if Israel hands over the suburbs, which are
already under Palestinian civil control.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have reacted coolly to the initiative, calling
it a ''trial balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Israeli coalition
politics were hurting the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Gaps remain wide between the two sides, and U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross said he would shuttle between the negotiators, Barak,
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that over the next six to eight weeks, we are
going to see if there is a potential and a need to make big
decisions to reach a framework agreement,'' Ross told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ross is to hold separate talks with Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want to establish a state in all of the West
Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in the 1967
Mideast war. Israel wants to keep all of Jerusalem and annex parts
of the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said it would step up its involvement,
including presenting its own proposals at some stage.

<HEADLINE> Attorney says 'zero tolerance' policies don't prevent schoolviolence  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Middle School has a bullying
policy. Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around
with identification badges. And in Hamilton Square, guidance
counselors are ordered to tell administrators when a student talks
of wanting to hurt someone.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators sharing their tactics for averting school
violence at a second annual conference Wednesday unveiled elaborate
safety plans and said they preferred to err on the side of caution
when dealing with threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never be too safe,'' said Linda Batz, the principal of
Hunterdon Central Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Since two teen-agers at Columbine High School killed twelve
other students, a teacher and themselves in Littleton, Colo., on
April 20, 1999, some critics have said that schools have taken
zero-tolerance discipline policies to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Sayreville school officials said they would review the
district's zero-tolerance policy after complaints about the
three-day suspension of four kindergartners who were pointing their
fingers at each other while playing ''cops and robbers'' in the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   Six elementary school students in Plainfield were suspended for
two days in March after an 11-year-old boy threatened to ''get a
gun'' if other children did not stop teasing him.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Duca, a retired police officer who works as a security
coordinator for the South Brunswick Schools, said school officials
are fearful of not doing enough to stop another Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody is running scared,'' Duca said. ''They're
afraid of being held responsible'' if a school threat escalates
into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Boylan, an attorney at the Education Law Center who
handles students-rights cases, said zero-tolerance policies
illegally keep students from receiving educations and don't result
in safer schools. She cited research that concluded harsh
punishment for intolerable behavior does nothing to stop the
behavior or increase school safety.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of school districts in the nation have such
policies, she said, and yet suspensions and expulsions have doubled
between 1990 and 1997, indicating that students are not deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the mind of students, it's overcontrol,'' she said, adding
that it may lead to more violence.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woolley, the principal of Lawrence Middle School in
Lawrence Township, said that his school might meet with a parent or
a school psychologist about a student threat before deciding upon a
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   He might not suspend a student for threatening to shoot a rubber
band at someone, for example, but may suspend the student if the
spitball seriously injures another person.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is incumbent on us all to make reasonable decisions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hammond, the Jefferson County (Colo.) superintendent whose
district includes Columbine, said one of the most important lessons
she learned from the tragedy was that student safety isn't a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have learned to accept that I cannot guarantee the safety of
all of our children,'' Hammond said in a keynote address. ''I
cannot even guarantee my own safety for the rest of this day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel stress every day we have school,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have taken different approaches to the problem. Lawrence
Township's bullying policy bans students from intimidation, use of
force or ''habitual or persistent cruelty.'' The school has made
efforts to reach out to alienated students, Woolley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Students must feel that people care about them and that they
have a voice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon Central Regional High School has practiced evacuation
drills. The school requires student identification badges and
equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns. The high
school recently sent a police officer dressed in a fright wig and
carrying a gun case to test the school's response to an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   Some students directed the officer to principal Batz' office
when he asked, but Batz said in a second drill the ''intruder'' was
reported in two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Square guidance counselors are told to report any
threat a student makes in a counseling session to school
administrators, said Superintendent Neil A. Bencivenga.

<HEADLINE> 7 Peacekeepers Die in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Fighting between rebels and U.N.
peacekeepers rebels killed seven peacekeepers and injured three
others, officials said Wednesday as they tried to secure the
release of dozens of peacekeepers and military observers seized by
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was a major blow to this West African nation's
fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, the rebel Revolutionary United Front -- which
remains, at least officially, part of a power-sharing government
created to end Sierra Leone's civil war -- has seized 50 U.N.
workers in three towns, officials said. The whereabouts of many
more workers remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions and killings came as the U.N. peacekeeping force
is taking charge of security in the country. The force, which
numbers about 8,500, was dispatched to replace a West African
intervention force known as ECOMOG that defended the government
during eight years of civil war. The last ECOMOG troops left the
capital, Freetown, this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.N. officials were concerned that the abductions might be
a move by Foday Sankoh, the Revolutionary United Front leader, to
end the nearly year-old peace. Sankoh was brought into the
government last year, but he recently has refused to talk to
government officials, including President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as if Foday Sankoh is trying to derail the peace
process,'' U.N. force commander Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley said.
</P>
<P>
   His worries were echoed by Freetown's newspapers, many of which
have long feared rebel plotting to try to seize power.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh ''has sensed that the peace process is becoming
irreversible and this will not mean well for his diabolical
plans,'' The Democrat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of U.N. peacekeepers were surrounding Sankoh at his home
in Freetown while negotiations continued for the release of the
U.N. hostages, U.N. officials said. Sierra Leonean officials said
the home was not being surrounded as a prelude to an arrest, but to
make sure the rebel leader was available for discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria was sending a delegation to press for the release of the
hostages, Nigerian Information Minister Jerry Ghana said. In
addition, diplomats representing the Economic Community of West
African States, the main regional organization, were expected in
Freetown by Thursday, Sierra Leonean officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes began Monday when RUF rebels captured eight U.N.
military observers and peacekeepers in Makeni after the United
Nations refused to return 10 former fighters who had turned in
their arms at a U.N.-run disarmament center, officials said. About
100 RUF fighters surrounded the center and fired shots in the air
before capturing the U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   More peacekeepers and civilians were seized Tuesday in the
eastern town of Kailahun, a rebel stronghold, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least four of the dead peacekeepers were Kenyans, a U.N.
official said on condition of anonymity. The official said they
were killed during a gunbattle after their post came under heavy
attack by rebels Tuesday in Magburaka.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Winslow, a spokesman for the U.N. mission, said all
fighting in the country was over by late Wednesday morning.
Reinforcements had been sent to U.N. positions that have come under
rebel attack.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General
Kofi Annan condemned the deaths of the peacekeepers, and both said
much of the blame rested with Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general believes that all those responsible for
this unacceptable and criminal behavior, especially leaders with
authority, must be held accountable for their actions,'' U.N.
spokeswoman Marie Okabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Security Council members and countries that contributed troops
to the 8,500-member U.N. mission in Sierra Leone were discussing
increasing the size of the force, U.N. and diplomatic officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   While authorized to use force, the peacekeepers -- mainly
Indians, Kenyans and Nigerians -- have avoided confronting the
rebels, who during the war killed tens of thousands of civilians
and intentionally maimed many more. Tens of thousands of rebels
also have refused to give up their guns, U.N. officials said.

<HEADLINE> Kids Are Kidnap Targets in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY PRATT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Less than a month before he was snatched
off a school bus by three armed men, 9-year-old Dagoberto Ospina
drew a poster of a child with a red band over his mouth, tears on
his cheeks and chains on his hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is this how you shape Colombia's future?'' the boy wrote
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Dagoberto's kidnapping last week has become a rallying point for
national outrage over the increased targeting of children by
leftist rebels, drug gangs and common criminals. Dagoberto remained
missing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty children and teen-agers were reported abducted in the
first three months of this year in Colombia -- an increase of
one-third from 1999, according to the independent anti-kidnapping
group Pais Libre.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, which has the world's highest kidnapping rate, had
2,945 reported kidnappings last year; 7 percent of those victims
were children.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is consistent with the logic of the war here,'' said
Nidia Quiroz, 50, a UNICEF child psychologist in Bogota, the
capital. ''As the peace process continues,'' she said, ''the rebels
want to show more force, and need more money.''
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana's government has been engaged for 15
months in peace talks with Colombia's largest rebel army, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, for whom ransom
kidnappings are a key revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has a sort of domino effect with common criminals,'' said
Quiroz. ''And within Colombia's culture of easy money, well,
children are a gold mine -- parents would pay anything to recover
their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagoberto was kidnapped on April 25 as he, 32 classmates and
three teachers were riding in a school bus to the Alferez Real
school on the outskirts of Cali, Colombia's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   A pickup truck cut off the bus and three men with revolvers and
grenades rushed aboard. One pointed his gun at the driver's head.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lower your heads or we'll blow up everyone,'' screamed
another, according to adult witnesses. They asked for ''Victor
Ospina,'' getting the child's first name wrong. No one responded
and they began checking notebooks until they got to one that said
''Ospina.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the men grabbed the boy, who began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't take me!'' he pleaded before being dragged into the
waiting truck.
</P>
<P>
   Dagoberto's kidnapping followed the March 1 seizure of three
teen-agers from another Cali school by the country's No. 2
guerrilla band, the National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   His poster of the child in chains was made as part of a school
project to protest that abduction. The poster showed a child in
shorts and a blue baseball cap -- similar to the one he himself was
wearing in a photo Colombian news media have distributed in a
''Free Dagoberto'' campaign demanding his release.
</P>
<P>
   Parents in Cali now fear letting their children play outside,
often keeping them indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Ramirez, 10, misses ''playing hide-and-seek and soccer''
with his friend Dagoberto.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys helped formed a school group called ''Shapers of
Peace'' two years ago after watching armed guerrillas on the TV
news.
</P>
<P>
   The group's goal was ''to get adults to listen to us, since we
have ideas, too, and want children left out of the conflict,''
Cesar said.
</P>
<P>
   After Dagoberto's abduction, the ''Shapers of Peace'' decided to
go to the FARC rebels to ask if the guerrilla group was holding
their friend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a FARC commander, Marcos Calarca, spoke by
walkie-talkie with about 50 children at the school and told them
his group did not have the child. Then he fielded questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were scared at first,'' said Cesar. ''We didn't want to say
our last names, because maybe they would come for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The children's questions included, ''Why do you kidnap
children?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ''We don't kidnap, we raise funds -- just as the
(Colombian) army does with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ''Don't you have children?''
</P>
<P>
   That was met with silence.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, four police agents shot and killed one of
Dagoberto's alleged kidnappers in a Cali shopping center. Officials
said he was part of a band that abducts people and turns them over
to guerrillas, drug mafias or other outlaw groups for up to
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The groups then demand ransoms of families. But as of yet,
nobody has asked the Ospina family for a ransom for Dagoberto,
authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Saturday was Children's Day, a holiday widely
commemorated in Latin America. An estimated 30,000 children marched
in Colombia's major cities, waving white flags and chanting
Dagoberto's name.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Farlis Calle, 18, an activist with the Children's
Movement for Peace, a youth group twice nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize for its work preaching nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ''My generation is going to be different,'' Calle said.

<HEADLINE> Killed Journalists Added To Wall  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The names of 40 journalists killed around
the world last year were added Wednesday to a lengthening roster on
a memorial wall of gleaming glass. The additions include AP
television producer Miles Tierney, shot dead in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Joining their names were those of 292 others who died while
covering the news since 1812 and whose fates were discovered or
verified since the establishment of the Journalists Memorial by The
Freedom Forum four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's additions brought to 1,369 the number of men and
women -- writers, reporters, editors, photographers and their
colleagues -- who died while doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wall is filled with the names of journalists who cared and
cared deeply about their craft and their responsibilities. They
felt journalism is something worth risking their lives for,'' said
Tom Johnson, chairman and CEO of Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those whose names are on the memorial would say they
were ''just doing their job'' and ''got unlucky,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But for most of the people in the news business, there is in
their dedication to their work a deep strain of idealism that leads
them to take risks for truth and understanding that sometimes,
tragically, leads to their personal injury or death,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 list of 40 journalists includes 10 killed in Sierra
Leone, seven in Colombia, six in Russia, four in Sri Lanka and
three each in Yugoslavia, Indonesia, and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney, 34, from New York City, was a Kenya-based producer for
Associated Press Television News. He was killed in Sierra Leone on
Jan. 10, 1999, when a rebel soldier shot up the vehicle in which he
was riding.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Smith Tunney, director of corporate communications for The
Associated Press, read Tierney's name along with those of the other
22 AP journalists who have died on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Journalists Memorial stands in Freedom Park adjacent to the
Newseum and the Freedom Forum World Center just across the Potomac
River from Washington, D.C. The Freedom Forum is a nonpartisan
foundation that promotes a free press and free speech.

<HEADLINE> White House: We'll Enforce China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, stepping up its
campaign for a China trade package, on Wednesday promised Congress
''the most intensive enforcement'' effort ever to hold Beijing to
its commitments to open its markets to U.S. goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press poll, meanwhile, showed that nearly half of
the House's 211 Democrats say they will oppose the package. The
survey showed fewer than three dozen have vowed publicly to support
it, while more than 80 say they are still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With three weeks to go to a showdown vote, and organized labor
waging a fierce campaign against the bill, there is little
incentive for members to declare themselves before they have to,
sponsors suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The administration pressed its case for granting China permanent
normal trade relations through a high-powered array of present and
former Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement with China is a one-way street,'' Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers told the House Ways and Means Committee,
contending all the concessions had been on China's side and that
Beijing had agreed to open its markets to an unprecedented degree.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease congressional concerns, Summers and other officials
announced a $22 million program to make sure China lives up to its
market-opening promises if Congress approves the trade measure.
</P>
<P>
   Summers called it ''the most intensive enforcement and
compliance effort ever mounted for a single trade agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would include a new position of deputy assistant
secretary for China at the Commerce Department to head up a ''rapid
response compliance team'' of at least 12 trade specialists working
in Washington and China.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration intends to vigorously monitor and
aggressively enforce the terms of this agreement,'' Commerce
Secretary William Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. manufacturers and farmers long have complained that China's
trade barriers are costing them billions of dollars in lost sales
in the world's largest market.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told the committee that
passage of the trade deal could mean $1.6 billion to $2 billion
more a year for U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its effort, the administration also brought back
former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, now a top executive at
Citigroup in New York, for his first congressional appearance since
leaving the administration a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional rejection of the China bill ''could have
substantial adverse impact on our nation's economic prospects in
the years and decades ahead,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said that winning
the vote ''will not be easy,'' given opposition from the House's
top two Democrats, Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and
Minority Whip David Bonior of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Archer questioned the impact on Chinese officials who are
pushing for reform -- including Premier Zhu Rongji -- if the measure
is rejected. ''Zhu Rongji will likely be deposed if we vote down
this agreement. It will play into the hands of the hard-liners in
China,'' Archer asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior, meanwhile, said the administration's proposal for an
enforcement program was ''a desperate gesture to sell this flawed
China deal that is floundering here in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ''China has repeatedly violated every trade agreement it has
ever signed with the United States,'' Bonior said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give China the same permanent low-tariff access
to U.S. markets now routinely extended to nearly every U.S. trading
partner. China now must have this status renewed every year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based organization that sets the rules for
world trade.
</P>
<P>
   An AP survey of 211 House Democrats, conducted over the past
week, showed that as of Wednesday, 32 listed themselves as for the
legislation, 95 were against it and 83 were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Only one member -- Rep. Gary Condit of California -- declined to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who is counting Democratic votes
for the administration, estimates that 70 to 80 Democrats will wind
up voting yes, despite the present high number of undecideds.
</P>
<P>
   An AP survey of Republicans was under way. Sponsors of the
measure said that of the 222 Republicans, they expected about 150
would support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill needs 218 votes to prevail. House debate is set to
begin May 22. The Senate, where passage was virtually assured,
planned to take it up in June.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is opposing the trade bill, fearing it will cost
U.S. jobs. Business groups, eager to gain access to a vast market
in China, are for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest criticism at Wednesday's hearing came from
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the panel's senior Democrat who
remains undecided, asked why the measure shouldn't be postponed
until next year, when a new president and a new Congress take
office. ''What do we lose?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine a worse result than Congress voting it down or
the administration having to withdraw it,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky. She suggested China would give
the rest of the world its market-opening concessions -- but deny
them to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China made those commitments last fall to obtain U.S. backing
for its bid to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky, meanwhile, announced that China had separately
agreed to make it easier to market U.S. fertilizer there.

<HEADLINE> Teen Hijacks Bus in Japan, One Dead  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGASHI HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- A teen-ager wielding a large
knife hijacked a bus Thursday, killing a woman and holding the
blade to the neck of a 6-year-old girl before police stormed the
vehicle to end the 15-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
   After a 190-mile chase and hours of negotiations at a highway
rest stop, police charged into the bus before dawn, entering
through a window and an emergency exit, and arrested the teen. None
of the remaining passengers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking, which began about noon Wednesday on Sanyo
Expressway in Fukuoka prefecture, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo,
riveted Japan. TV stations interrupted regular programming to bring
overhead shots of the white bus moving slowly down the highway,
windows drawn, chased by several police cars.
</P>
<P>
   As shocking as the hijacking was for this low-crime nation, what
troubled many even more was the age of the suspect -- 17, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder why juveniles keep committing crimes. I'm shocked.
It's becoming more and more like America,'' said Yoshio Zuigyo, 50,
who happened to drive by the highway rest area where the bus
eventually stopped, trailed by police cars and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people were aboard the passenger bus when it was
commandeered. During the ordeal, three women passengers were freed
at a parking lot after being stabbed in the neck with the
hijacker's 16-inch knife, and one -- 68-year-old Tatsuko Tsukamoto --
died, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other hostages escaped by leaping out windows of the bus,
two of them as the vehicle was moving. The two wounded survivors
and one of the passengers who jumped off were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   During the standoff at the rest stop late Wednesday, the
suspect's mother arrived at the scene, but he refused to speak with
her.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker's name was withheld because of his age. He demanded
a gun, but police refused to give him one. NHK TV reported that he
also demanded cash and wanted to be driven to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper photo shot through the front window of the bus
showed a pudgy, bespectacled youngster with a pageboy hairstyle,
sitting next to a girl behind the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Takahide Kurata, an official with the bus company, Nishi-Nippon
Railroad Co., said the 6-year-old hostage was Yuuki Ishibashi, who
had been traveling alone to visit her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned of the hijacking when a passenger asked to be let
off at a toll booth to use the restroom and called from a highway
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Two passengers who jumped off the bus told police that the
teen-ager went to the front of the bus, took out the knife, slashed
several passengers and sat behind the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Mikiko Matsuno, a 30-year-old nurse who jumped from the bus,
told police the hijacker paced back and forth ''with a bloody knife
dangling from his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When my eyes accidentally met his, he asked my name and told
me, 'I'll kill you,' '' police quoted her as saying in the
hospital, where she was being treated for bruises and a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-hour chase, the bus was stopped by two large police
vehicles and forced into a parking area.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the captor released four male passengers, one of them
injured. Another passenger escaped through a window at the parking
lot. The bus later moved to another rest stop, where two more
passengers were released.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a series of high-profile juvenile crimes in
Japan. Although still low compared to the United States, the
juvenile crime rate has climbed recently, with murders by
youngsters up by 56 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what happens when kids grow up in solitude in a
virtual world,'' said Takashi Ota, an honorary professor at Tokyo
University. ''With just man-made things to play with, kids have
lost the natural feeling of sharing experiences with friends.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Congressman Fights Term Limits  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman targeted by ads from
a term limits group after reneging on his pledge to leave office
after three terms is lashing back with a brutal attack ad of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Rep. George Nethercutt's radio ad says U.S. Term
Limits Executive Director Paul Jacob ''is a convicted felon who
served a long prison sentence. ... So when you see the next U.S.
Term Limits ad, recognize it for what it is -- lies from convicted
felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob served 5{ months in prison in 1980 after refusing to
register for the draft. President Carter reinstated the draft for
18- to 25-year-olds after Soviet troops entered Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The draft refusal, Jacob said, was ''a matter of principle''
because he doesn't believe in forced military service. He said
Nethercutt's ad is ''a fairly mean-spirited, cheap-shot attack that
only shows he's desperate to change the subject as to why he won't
take a stand on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt's promise to serve no more than three terms helped
propel him to an upset victory over then-House Speaker Tom Foley in
1994 and made him a hero of the term limits movement.
</P>
<P>
   But when he announced last year that he would seek a fourth term
and said it had been a mistake for him to agree to the limit, U.S.
Term Limits pounced.
</P>
<P>
   The group began running radio, TV and newspaper ads against the
Republican, criticizing him for having too few campaign donors,
taking trips paid by outside groups and voting to raise his pay.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt grew tired of ads that lied and distorted his record,
said Jim Dornan, Nethercutt's spokesman. And though Nethercutt has
a large war chest and no major Democratic opponent, his campaign
worried voters would believe the ads and Nethercutt's image would
be damaged, Dornan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fighting fire with fire ... . We're just not going to
take it anymore,'' Dornan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance LeLoup, chairman of the political science department at
Washington State University, said the attack ad seems
out-of-character for Nethercutt and could tarnish his reputation as
genteel and easygoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a danger of making it look like he wants this job too
badly,'' LeLoup said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nethercutt ad, which also accuses U.S. Term Limits of having
''secret donors'' and ''massive funding by a New York real estate
millionaire,'' began running Monday night in eastern Washington and
will continue through next week.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits responded Wednesday with a new radio ad
charging ''Nethercutt will say or do anything just to stay in
power.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Is Near Death  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, ailing since he
underwent brain surgery last summer, was near death Wednesday, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we say in the Hail Mary, pray for us at the hour of our
death,'' said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New York. ''The cardinal is at the hour of his
death. We do not know precisely when he will die ... but I think it
is clear that he is, in Catholic terms, at the hour of his death.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 80, was in his residence behind St. Patrick's
Cathedral with a sister, other relatives, co-workers and clergy,
Zwilling said. The spokesman said the cardinal was not able to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the night, the condition of His Eminence ...
worsened,'' Zwilling said. ''We invite the prayers of all for His
Eminence at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said the cardinal was not in any pain, and two to three
visitors at a time were being allowed to sit with him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, long one of the city's most visible public figures,
began to fail when he had a brain tumor removed in August 1999. He
suffered complications from his treatments and often appeared weak
and bloated.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor frequently missed Mass and made his last public
appearance at St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 5, when he did not
lead the service but spoke briefly to parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to Italy for a final visit to the pope in February.
He was unable to take his customary spot in front of the Cathedral
in March to bless the St. Patrick's Day Parade. He missed Easter
services in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has not yet named his successor. Many speculated
that the pope would replace O'Connor soon after his Jan. 15
birthday because cardinals lose their power to vote for a new pope
when they turn 80.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, born in 1920, spent most of his clerical life in
military uniform, joining the Navy in 1952 in response to a call
for more chaplains during the Korean War. He rose to rear admiral
and chief of Navy chaplains before leaving the Navy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He became an auxiliary bishop and was assigned to the military
vicarate under Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York. In May 1983,
O'Connor was appointed bishop of Scranton, Pa. He held that post
less than a year before being chosen to succeed Cooke -- who died of
cancer -- as New York archbishop in 1984. He was elevated to
cardinal in May 1985, and has since been the spiritual leader of
2.4 million Catholics in Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and
seven upstate counties.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor once said he would have been satisfied to be a parish
priest or teacher: ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply
that 'He was a good priest.'''

<HEADLINE> Judge Sends Edwards Jurors Home  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Jurors in the federal racketeering trial
of former Gov. Edwin Edwards were sent home Wednesday, marking the
second day in a row that deliberations in the four-month trial were
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola told the jurors that he is
still conducting an investigation related to the case and would not
finish it by the end of the day. Polozola has not said what the
investigation involves. Attorneys on both sides refused to discuss
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this is an aggravation, but I can't avoid the
circumstances,'' Polozola told jurors when he dismissed them at
1:30 p.m. and told them to return Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Polozola dismissed the jury after private meetings with
attorneys and defendants in the courtroom and in his chambers. The
judge met behind closed doors with the parties in the case Monday
and Tuesday as well.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son Stephen, state Sen. Greg Tarver and four others
are accused in a series of extortion schemes to manipulate the
licensing of Louisiana riverboat casinos from 1991 through 1997. If
convicted on all counts, Edwin Edwards, 72, would face more than
300 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors got the case April 24, but have spent very few days
deliberating, either because of their own requests to be excused
early or because they were awaiting responses from Polozola about
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could continue to deliberate if the judge removes one
juror from the case, leaving 11 to sort out the long verdict form.
An alternate juror must be called up if two jurors are removed.
</P>
<P>
   Once jurors resume deliberations, they must vote on 91
individual counts. Edwards is accused on 26 counts.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Inflation Threat Looms  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The record-breaking U.S. economy is putting
pressure on employers to boost wages as they scramble to find
scarce workers, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a national
survey that sounded the central bank's strongest warning bells
about potential inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's survey, based on reports from its 12 regional banks,
said shortages of workers persisted in all areas, something Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan and other economists fear could lead to
future wage and price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Given the strong economic growth and the tight labor market
conditions cited in the report, economists believe it lays the
foundation for the Fed to boost interest rates on May 16 and in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 250.99
points to close at 10,480.130 as fears of higher interest rates
rattled the market and investors punished companies that warned of
slowing earnings growth. The Nasdaq was more resilient, cutting a
late loss of 192.66 points to 78.14, finishing at 3,707.31.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report confirms that there are some inflationary pressures
building in the labor market and the Fed will do all it can to
combat that and make sure it doesn't filter into consumer prices,''
said Richard Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed survey, known as the beige book for the color of its
cover, said ''there were more frequent reports of intensifying wage
pressures as shortages of workers persisted in all districts. ...
Difficulty in finding and retaining qualified employers remained a
common refrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices remained ''relatively stable'' in most areas as
competition and increased productivity helped keep them in check,
the Fed said. But Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Kansas City
reported more frequent price increases in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The surging economy, in its longest-ever streak of uninterrupted
growth, has pushed the nation's unemployment rate near a
three-decade low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To attract workers, employers have been getting more creative in
their recruitment efforts, offering bonuses, child care, education
and better health care benefits, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   While that's good for workers, economists and some members of
the Fed worry that these increased costs could be passed along to
consumers in the form of sharply higher product prices, touching
off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said New York, Cleveland and Chicago cited significant
increases in health care costs as contributing to intensified cost
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   While companies reported rising prices for certain materials --
some of which were related to surging energy prices -- there were
few instances in which these increased costs resulted in higher
consumer prices, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will be used when Fed policy-makers meet May 16 to
review the central bank's stance on interest rates. It was based on
information collected before April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has boosted interest rates five times by a quarter-point
each since June 30 in an effort to slow the supercharged economy
and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many analysts
widely expect the Fed will raise rates at the May meeting and again
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The economy showed ''moderate to strong'' growth in the majority
of areas around the country during March and part of April, the Fed
survey said. Retailing, commercial construction and manufacturing
activity all were brisk. The volatile stock market did little to
cool red-hot growth.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that new
orders to American factories rose a bigger-than-expected 2.2
percent in March after two straight sluggish months.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for electronic and electrical equipment, including
household appliances and communications equipment, led March's jump
in total factory orders, rising 10.2 percent, the biggest gain
since August 1997.

<HEADLINE> Possible AIDS Crisis Seen in Asia  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In 10 years, the AIDS epidemic could be
sweeping through Asian and Pacific Rim countries even faster than
it's going through sub-Saharan Africa today, an intelligence
official says.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, sub-Saharan Africa led the world in AIDS deaths in
1998 with 2 million -- four-fifths of the world's HIV-deaths, said
David Gordon, the National Intelligence Council's national
intelligence officer for economics and global issues. The council
advises the CIA director.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sub-Sahara Africa ... will continue to remain the most
vulnerable region to infectious diseases over the next 20 years,''
he told a Congressional forum on infectious diseases and national
security.
</P>
<P>
   However, ''Asia and the Pacific ... is likely to witness a
dramatic increase in infectious disease deaths, largely driven by
the spread of HIV/AIDS in south Asia and southeast Asia and its
potential spread to east Asia,'' he said Wednesday. ''In the next
decade the region could surpass Africa in HIV deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was one of the people who produced the national
intelligence estimate called ''The Global Infectious Disease Threat
and Its Implication for the United States.'' The report said
dependance on traditional medicine and the vulnerability of the
private health care delivery system to economic downturns were part
of the problem in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has used the National Intelligence
Council report to defend their decision to classify AIDS as a
threat to national security. Administration officials say AIDS has
become such an epidemic that, in years to come, it threatens to
destabilize nations and the economies of whole continents.
</P>
<P>
   The quick spread of the disease has the potential to destabilize
relations between already shaky countries and could lead to
internal upheaval in countries that have high death rates, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   And ''although several emerging infectious diseases, such as
HIV/AIDS, were first identified in the United States, most,
including HIV/AIDS, originate outside U.S. borders, with the entry
of the West Nile virus in 1999 a case in point,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nils Daulaire, president of the Global Health Council, cheered
the quick declassification of the January report, saying government
officials will have to adjust their thinking away from what would
normally have been America's traditional enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The enemy here is microbes,'' he said. ''They only care about
meat. They don't care whether it's American meat or Iraqi meat or
Russian meat or Chinese meat. And they don't read.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., has introduced a bill to increase
U.S. funding for global health initiatives to $2 billion annually,
double what is currently spent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Crowley's district that was hit with the West
Nile Virus, which killed seven people in New York City. This was
the first time the virus had appeared in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''This outbreak was a wakeup call,'' Crowley said. ''A disease
knows or respects no boundaries.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Spar Over Social Security  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's plan for individual Social
Security investment accounts, which Al Gore attacked Wednesday as
''stock market roulette,'' is an idea that has long enticed
lawmakers and Americans. The trade-offs and potential risks make it
a tough political sell, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very bold move for sure'' by Bush, said Alicia Munnell,
a former member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers
and now a professor at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate will outline a Social
Security proposal that includes personal stock market accounts next
week, advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his Democratic rival, has already begun to hound the Texas
governor, accusing him of being too willing to take risks with the
nation's retirement program -- something polls show Americans are
wary of.
</P>
<P>
   In a January poll by CNN-USA Today-Gallup, six in 10 people said
they favor proposals to divert some Social Security taxes into
personal retirement accounts invested in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   However, previous polls have shown supporters drop to four in 10
if the questions mention that such a move could leave retirement
income vulnerable in case of a stock market decline.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, Gore wants to give Social Security future
government surpluses, which he says will come from the interest
savings gained from his plans to pay down the national debt. He has
tried to dissociate himself from a Clinton administration proposal
that would have the government, rather than individuals, invest
some of those surpluses in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush trusts Americans; Gore trusts big government,''
said a statement from the Bush campaign on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is appealing to an emerging class of voters, including a
new generation of senior citizens who have been investing in the
stock market and 401(k) retirement accounts and who may be more
open to the idea of putting Social Security money into Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of personal investment accounts say Gore's surplus
plan carries its own risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that workers would find it more risky to bet that
(government) debt is going to be paid off down the road than to
have the choice of investing themselves,'' said Leanne Abdnor,
director of a lobbying coalition that includes the National
Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, which is financed with a special tax deducted
from workers' paychecks, is expected to run short of cash after the
huge baby boom generation begins collecting benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting retirement benefits or raising payroll taxes are
possible solutions, but politically unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money by letting individuals invest Social Security
taxes in the stock market has seemed like a magic remedy by
comparison, and has drawn devotees among lawmakers in both
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   It has also grown in public appeal during the Wall Street boom
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers attempting to flesh out the idea have had to answer
some difficult questions, however -- often asked by opponents on the
campaign trail. Chief among these: What happens to people's
retirement income if their investments do poorly?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm actually surprised that anybody is still advocating
individual accounts given the enormous fluctuations that we are
seeing in the stock market,'' said Munnell.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to protect people against investment risks,
however, said John Goodman, a Bush adviser on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   First, investment choices could be limited to relatively safe
stock and bond mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Also, under congressional proposals Bush is studying, only a
small portion of a person's Social Security taxes would go into his
investment account. The rest would be kept in the old system and
used to pay the balance of benefits, with a government guarantee
that no one would end up worse off.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden costs of switching to a new Social Security system
are also problematic. Right now, current workers' taxes pay the
benefits of current retirees.
</P>
<P>
   But if younger workers are allowed to divert their Social
Security taxes into stock market investments, where would the money
come from to pay promised benefits to those already retired or near
retirement?
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that additional cash would be needed for the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan congressional proposals suggest possible solutions:
using government surpluses that are also being eyed for tax cuts or
new spending programs, a higher retirement age or more modest
annual cost-of-living raises for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Social Security investment accounts say they are
anxious to know which of those tradeoffs Bush supports.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hickey, director of a campaign by labor and civil rights
groups to oppose Social Security privatization, said: ''Those are
very, very controversial and objectionable elements to most voters
and I think you're going to see a lot of political debate as to
whether that's a wise thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Sets Debt Buyback Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with cash from a booming economy,
Treasury is setting a regular schedule for buying back portions of
the national debt, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury initiated the first buyback of debt in 70 years in
March and has conducted a total of four such operations.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the those first four sales led Treasury to set a
regular schedule for buying back the debt through July, Treasury
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Buybacks will be held in the third and fourth weeks of each
month with the next one to occur on May 18. In a buyback operation,
the government offers investors cash to turn in certain securities
before they mature.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday, Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers contrasted the administration's effort
to eliminate the national debt held by the public to proposals
being advanced by Republicans to use a bigger share of the budget
surplus for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a compromise could be reached with the
Republican-controlled Congress on at least a modest package of tax
reduction measures, Summers said, ''There is a potential to find
common ground. But we will lose the ability to do those things
(reduce taxes) if our debate comes to turn on large tax cuts that
threaten our economic well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Treasury has bought back a total of $7 billion of
outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds. Because those bonds carry
higher yields than the current market yield on comparable
securities, it paid sellers roughly $1.8 billion in premiums to
cash in early.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the saving in interest payments will be more
than the costs of buying back the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of debt Treasury bought back in each of the four
operations ranged from $1 billion to $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing upcoming buybacks, Gary Gensler, Treasury's
undersecretary for domestic finance, said: ''We expect these
operations will be in the size ranges approximating those we have
conducted to date.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Treasury said it would like to buy back up to $30
billion of debt this year. Gensler said those plans haven't
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we conduct further buybacks, we will continue to learn from
these operations and adjust our procedures where appropriate to
achieve the best results for the American taxpayers,'' Gensler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of bulging government surpluses -- helped along by a
booming economy that is generating lots of tax revenue -- is making
it possible for the Treasury to repurchase debt.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bought back thus far is a tiny fraction of the $5.7
trillion national debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury buys back debt using a process known as a ''reverse
auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a competitive
basis based on the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Treasury said Wednesday that it plans to sell $20
billion in securities at its quarterly refunding auctions next
week. It will sell $12 billion of 5-year notes maturing May 15,
2005 and $8 billion of 9}-year notes maturing Feb. 15, 2010.

<HEADLINE> Mother Charged in Baby's 1982 Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- The mother of a 2-month-old boy who died in
1982 was charged with murder after police were given a handwritten
confession in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a person investigators didn't identify delivered
the spiral notebook to the McCracken County sheriff's department in
which Deborah Humphreys had written that she shook the baby and
caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys later confessed that she had shaken the baby, who went
into a coma, according to court documents filed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, there's a bunch of unknowns,'' said public
defender Rich Leary, Humphreys' court-appointed attorney. Leary
declined further comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The August 1982 death of Randy Dwain Hicks Jr. had been
described as a case of sudden infant death syndrome. The infant's
death certificate lists as the cause ''cardiac arrest Aborted
Sudden Infant Death.'' No autopsy was performed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when we brought her in and showed her the proof we
had, it was just a matter of letting out something she had bottled
up for 18 years,'' Sheriff Frank Augustus said.
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys, 37, was charged Monday and pleaded innocent to murder
Tuesday. She remains in jail in lieu of $250,000 cash bond.
</P>
<P>
   Augustus would not say who provided the notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can tell you is a subject called us and brought us
information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge cleared the way for Randy's body to be exhumed so an
autopsy can be performed. McCracken Commonwealth Attorney Tim
Kaltenbach said the autopsy request was aimed at ensuring that all
evidence in the case is gathered, but he wasn't sure how much could
be learned after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The father of the dead baby, Randy Hicks Sr., apparently didn't
know what had happened 18 years ago, Augustus said.

<HEADLINE> USDA To Buy Surplus Apples  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department will make a large
purchase of apple products for school lunches and government food
programs to help growers get rid of a huge surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The department will buy nearly 1.65 million cases of applesauce,
juice and slices. It will take bids from growers around the country
and buy the cheapest apples for delivery from July 1 to Sept. 30,
George Chartier, spokesman for the USDA's agricultural marketing
service, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to help out the farmers, which is something we do
with these purchases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple farmers from Eastern states have been lobbying the federal
government to buy apples to keep the 59 million bushels sitting in
storage as of April 1 from going to waste. The purchase will only
eliminate a small percentage of the surplus, but growers say
anything is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Frost-free nights, adequate moisture for good pollination and a
long fall harvest period allowed the apples to grow plump and
plentiful in the East. Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia each had crops 17 percent to 31 percent
higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions were not as favorable in Washington state,
which typically produces about half the nation's apples. Washington
harvested 121.5 million bushels last year, about 10 million less
than the average of the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   Kraig Naasz of the U.S. Apple Association said U.S. growers also
were hurt by China selling apple juice concentrate at below-market
prices. The International Trade Commission is expected to rule May
15 on increased duties on Chinese apple imports.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thankful for the recognition of the terrible economic
conditions now confronting our industry,'' said Naasz, adding that
he would be ''happier still'' when the commission rules on the
association's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA's purchase includes 1.06 million cases of apple sauce,
285,600 cases of apple juice, 228,000 cases of canned apple slices
for pies and other desserts, and 66,000 cases of frozen apple
slices.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 250; Nasdaq Down 78  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled as much
as 331 points Wednesday as interest-rate worries weighed on the
market and investors punished companies that warned of slowing
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Selling pressure eased in the final hour of Wall Street's
regular session, allowing market averages to pare their losses.
Nonetheless, analysts said the broad-based selloff was a stark
reminder that the pessimism that dominated the market just a few
weeks ago still hangs over Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a significant change in investors' perceptions,''
said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union
Securities in Chicago. ''Until early March, bad news was ignored.
Now, bad news is perceived as bad news and even good news is
treated with skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow average fell 250.99, or by 2.3 percent, to close at
10,480.13, having edged back from a drop to just above 10,400 in
late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was more resilient, cutting a late
loss of 192.66 points to 78.14 and closing at 3,707.31, a drop of
2.1 percent. Broader stock indicators were also sharply lower. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 31.19 to 1,415.10.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell for a second session as interest-rate fears kept
many buyers on the sidelines. The Federal Reserve is widely
expected to raise interest rates on May 16 in its continuing bid to
slow the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting a quarter-percentage point
increase, but worries that the Fed could boost rates by as much a
half-percentage point are rattling the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next key piece of economic data will hit the market on
Friday, when the Labor Department releases employment data for the
month of April. Until then, analysts say, buyers will remain
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is looking for some comfort in the numbers to come
on Friday,'' said Chalasani, ''Especially for investors in the Old
Economy stocks, interest-rate worries are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that non-technology, ''old economy''
stocks could be hurt the worst by rising interest rates because
their earnings are growing more slowly than the profits of
high-tech companies. Higher interest rates cut into earnings by
making it more expensive to borrow money to finance growth.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, AT&AMP;T fell 2 1/8 to 39 13/16, adding to Tuesday's
14 percent slide and further hurting the blue-chip Dow. PaineWebber
and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette downgraded the stock a day after
company officials warned that full-year operating profits will
likely come in below previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company is still at least a few quarters away from hitting
its stride in key business segment operations,'' said Eric
Strumingher, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Also, software maker Novell fell 6 15/16 to 10| on the Nasdaq
after warning Wall Street that it will miss financial targets in
its fiscal second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sector fell broadly after Goldman Sachs remove
several prominent retailers from its list of recommended stocks.
Kohl's fell 3 13/16 to 48, Target fell 5[ to 63} and Costco fell 2
9/16 to 52 3/16; all were downgraded from ''recommended'' to
''market outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also lowered its rating on Dow component Wal-Mart,
sending its shares down 4 3/16 to 53 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gains in Wednesday's market came from the typically
bland food sector. Bestfoods rose 10 11/16 to 61\. Late Tuesday,
the maker of Skippy peanut butter and Hellmann's mayonnaise
rejected an $18.4 billion takeover offer from multinational
consumer products conglomerate Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The offer valued Bestfoods at 66 per share, a 31 percent premium
to Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday. But Bestfoods said the offer
was not financially adequate and not in the best interest of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever fell 2 3/16 to 22 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Several other food companies rose Wednesday as investors
anticipated that any or all could come into play. Heinz gained 3
11/16 to 37| and Campbell Soup rose 3 1/16 to 29 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.19
billion shares, compared with 1.22 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.79 to 495.56.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. Germany's
Xetra DAX index fell 2.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 3.0
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.9 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Ends Medication Policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Health maintenance organization Kaiser
Permanente has ended a policy that requires psychiatrists to
prescribe depression and anxiety medications for patients they
haven't examined.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser psychiatrists must now rely on their own examination of
patients before writing prescriptions, the HMO announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is the nation's largest not-for-profit HMO, serving 8
million members in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Almost 6
million of its patients are in California.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by Dr. Thomas S. Jensen of San Diego, sought
to halt Kaiser's prescription policy. Under that policy,
psychiatrists wrote prescriptions on the recommendation of
nonmedical personnel such as social workers, social-work interns
and family therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said prescriptions from absentee psychiatrists endanger
mental patients and violate ethics codes of the American
Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Oliver Goldsmith, medical director for Southern California
Permanente Medical Group, said Tuesday the HMO decided to review
its policy amid the public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public attention was a stimulus for us to take another
look at this practice,'' Goldsmith said. ''We felt that this was a
street we had to come back from.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Goldsmith maintained no patients were harmed by the
previous policy, which was restricted to Kaiser's psychiatric
clinics in the San Diego area. About 24,000 patients were treated
there last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser acknowledged its old policy differed from standards
generally accepted by the psychiatric community, but said the
practice was designed to allow psychiatrists to treat more
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen's attorney, Cliff Palefsky of San Francisco, cautioned
that his client would not drop the lawsuit against Kaiser until he
sees changes that are ''real and complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations said
the agency intends to continue its investigation.

<HEADLINE> Conservation Group Buying Islands  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An isolated speck in the center of the Pacific
Ocean, the Palmyra Atoll, a pristine network of 52 small islands is
being purchased by a conservation group to guarantee the
preservation of its pristine marine wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The Nature Conservancy will announce Thursday that it is buying
the uninhabited islands -- 680 acres of land in all -- and adjacent
coral reefs and lagoons, from the Fullard-Leo family in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The price was not disclosed, but is said to be in the range of
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although privately owned, the atoll is considered a territory of
the United States and under the civil jurisdiction of the Interior
Department. The Nature Conservancy hopes that two-thirds of the
atoll eventually will be administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service as a wildlife refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ''jewel of America's Pacific coral reefs,''
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the atoll -- just north of the
equator and 1,052 miles south of Honolulu -- ''should be protected
from exploitation'' and preserved for future generations to see.
</P>
<P>
   The island's colorful history dates back more than two centuries
and includes everything from buried pirates' treasure and talk of
an island curse to a battle before the U.S. Supreme Court over
ownership. It played a key part in a murder mystery that eventually
produced a best seller and a made-for-television movie. And while
now seen as an ideal place for ecological research, in the 1970s it
almost became a placed to dump nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore has it that in 1816 a Spanish pirate ship, full of Inca
treasures, wrecked on the Palmyra reefs and its crew supposedly
buried the loot under a palm tree. But treasure hunting is only one
of the potential threats to the island's plush, tropical foliage,
pristine coral treasures and crystal clear lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been a range of threats over time'' prompting the
Nature Conservancy's interest in buying the atoll, says Nancy
Mackinnon, who has been working on the Palmyra project for the
conservation group since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the Energy Department saw Palmyra as a place to
dump nuclear waste, only to abandon the idea. Private entrepreneurs
more recently wanted it for chemical and nuclear waste storage.
Other buyers have had plans to build a hotel and casino and even a
retreat for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Palmyra was a U.S. Navy waypoint for
airplanes crossing the Pacific. A 6,000-foot runway and other
buildings were built, but they are now dilapidated and overgrown by
jungle. No one lives on the islands today.
</P>
<P>
   Mackinnon says the island's rich ecological treasures will
provide a paradise for research and ecotourism. ''But only in small
groups,'' she adds quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The islands, which receive 175 inches of rain a year, are
covered by lush tropical vegetation that provides a place for an
estimated million nesting seabirds. Countless birds rely on the
islands as a resting place as they migrate -- some from as far away
as Alaska to the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The atoll's reefs have three to five times the number of coral
species found in Hawaii or the Florida Keys. Black-tip and tiger
sharks abound in its waters and other marine species include pilot
whales, bottlenosed dolphins, hawksbill turtles, giant clams and
the coconut crab, the world's largest land-based invertebrate that
cracks open coconuts with its claws.
</P>
<P>
   Some old salts have suggested the atoll is cursed because of
tales of mariners who have landed there and later fell upon
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, a San Diego, Calif., couple were murdered aboard their
expensive yacht by another couple they had befriended, and their
bodies were dumped in waters near Palmyra. The woman's skeletal
remains were found six year later after they had washed ashore. The
double murder later became a best selling book, ''And The Sea Will
Tell'', and a made-for-television movie.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push for Patient Rights  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to meet with House and
Senate negotiators next week to discuss the holdup in legislation
that would grant Americans more rights when dealing with health
insurers, administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan negotiators who have worked for 10 weeks on a
patient' bill of rights have made some progress in reconciling
differences in legislation passed by both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the conference committee has yet to tackle thorny questions
about who should be covered by the federal protections and whether
the bill should allow patients to sue health plans for damages they
suffer because they were denied coverage for treatments.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting set for Monday, Clinton wants to help lawmakers
work through their differences and stress that this legislation was
a top priority, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is pushing to give patients that right to sue and is
seeking to extend federal protections to all Americans with private
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are working to combine a House-passed bill, favored
by Clinton, congressional Democrats and some Republicans, with a
Senate-passed bill backed by Republicans that would not expand
rights to sue and would cover fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is concerned that lawmakers have yet to begin
discussions on resolving these differences, said Chris Jennings,
Clinton's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to get a status report and talk about time frames and
substance,'' said Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers invited to the meeting include Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., the conference committee chairman, along with the
co-chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and lawmakers from
committees with jurisdiction over health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Osterberg, Nickles' spokeswoman, said he was waiting for
more details from the White House before responding. She stressed
that the committee has been making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are important decisions that will affect every health
plan in America and the conferees, Republican and Democrat alike,
are taking the time to make sure they do it right,'' said
Osterberg.
</P>
<P>
   Activists complained about the committee's slow progress and
expressed concern that other health care issues, such as
prescription drug coverage and correcting medical mistakes, are
diverting lawmakers' attention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some lawmakers returning from a two-week spring break
have said voters are more concerned about getting help paying for
their medicines than reining in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue has lost focus,'' said John Crosby, executive
director of the American Osteopathic Association. ''They forget
that this is our highest priority''
</P>
<P>
   The two bills at issue have many similarities, including
provisions that would make it easier for patients to see
specialists, give patients the right to appeal to an outside panel
when coverage is denied and allow patients to use out-of-plan
hospitals in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill expands lawsuits and covers all Americans who
have private insurance -- about 161 million people. The Senate bill
does not expand existing rights to sue and covers only those people
whose health plans are exempt from state regulations -- about 55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend that state laws are inadequate and that HMOs
should be held liable for care decisions, just as other private
companies can be sued if they are negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, insurers and business groups say Americans with
health plans regulated by states don't need federal protections and
warn that lawsuits will drive up insurance costs, leading companies
to stop offering health benefits to workers.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Outlines Upcoming Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert told fellow
Republicans on Wednesday he hopes to pass several tax cuts in the
next few months while agreeing to compromises on Democratic
priorities such as minimum wage and HMO legislation, party sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hastert
outlined an ambitious goal of completing work on all 13 annual
spending bills by the end of August. In the past, the last of these
measures has rarely reached the White House until late September or
early October.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert included legislation to provide prescription drug
benefits for the elderly on his agenda, and said he hopes it can
pass the House by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois lawmaker addressed fellow House Republicans at
their weekly closed-door meeting, the first since a long spring
break.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP sources said he provided an upbeat assessment of the
majority Republicans' political fortunes. Recent polling indicates
the two parties are at rough parity in support. That represents a
sharp improvement for the GOP from 18 months ago, when they were
reeling from the loss of seats in the mid-term elections and
attempting to recover from the fallout of their impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are mounting a strong effort to gain the six seats
they need to win a House majority this fall, and routinely charge
Republicans with failing to act on important legislation, the
minimum wage and health bills among them.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt, said that if the GOP wants compromises on important
bills, ''they have a funny way of showing it.'' She said the
minimum wage and HMO bills are stalled, and on prescription drug
legislation, ''they are late to the game and their proposal is
inadequate. ...They've made no overtures to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal, Hastert spokesman John Feehery, said, ''The
Speaker's confident we can have a very successful year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hastert, House Majority Leader Dick Armey told
Republicans in closed session what he said on Tuesday to reporters:
the leadership hopes to win approval for permanent normalized trade
status for China in the new few weeks, as well as a spate of
measures aimed at supporting the ''new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's remarks amounted to a political playbook for the final
several months of the 106th Congress, and these sources said he
stressed the need to play offense on issues such as taxes, while
playing ''smart defense'' on legislation such as the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts Hastert mentioned include income tax relief from
the so-called ''marriage penalty.'' Legislation on that subject has
passed the House, but is held up in the Senate by Democrats, who
want to force votes on a series of alternative proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the speaker mentioned a reduction in estate taxes,
passed as a companion to the minimum wage increase; a repeal of the
3 percent federal telecommunications tax; and liberalized
contributions to individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed a minimum wage measure, and efforts to
fashion a compromise with the Senate have been held up in part by
Democratic objections to a bankruptcy bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses have approved legislation to enhance the rights of
patients dealing with their HMOs, but compromise efforts have
sputtered recently.
</P>
<P>
   Neither House has yet tackled a prescription drug measure,
although House Republicans unveiled a proposal earlier this spring,
and Democrats are attempting to unite behind an alternative that
builds on a White House proposal.

<HEADLINE> FDA Announces Biotech Food Rules  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Food labels will not have to disclose any
genetically engineered ingredients, the Clinton administration
decided Wednesday, instead adopting a series of industry-backed
steps intended to assure the public that the products are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scientific evidence does not show that these products are
any different from a health and safety standpoint,'' said Joe
Levitt, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry say there isn't enough known about
possible allergic reactions to the food or the potential harm to
the environment and have been demanding both mandatory labeling of
the products and tougher testing standards for biotech plants and
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan would formalize the FDA's review
process for new biotech crops, set labeling standards that would
restrict the claims of biotech-free foods, and also conduct a
six-month review of environmental regulations that cover
gene-altered plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech companies will be required to notify the FDA at least
four months in advance of releasing new genetically engineered
ingredients for food and animal feed and to give the agency their
research data.
</P>
<P>
   Companies now consult voluntarily with the FDA before going to
market. The new plan would codify the practice and make it harder
for a company to challenge the agency in court if it objected to a
new crop. The agency would post its conclusions and product safety
data on its Web site for consumers to read.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said there is no need now to require any
additional testing beyond what they already ask companies to do.
</P>
<P>
   Having a voluntary review process ''did not provide the level of
public confidence that the FDA is really out there looking out for
the consumer,'' although agency officials ''absolutely stand behind
the safety'' of food now on the market, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, FDA also will propose guidelines for food
makers who want to label products made with or without the use of
bioengineered ingredients. The guidelines will ensure that labels,
such as those claiming foods are biotech-free, are ''truthful and
informative,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar guidelines have limited the marketing of organic dairy
products that claim to be free of growth hormones. The labels must
acknowledge that tests cannot distinguish between treated and
untreated milk.
</P>
<P>
   The government has approved some 50 varieties of genetically
engineered crops. Gene-altered soybeans and corn can be found in
foods throughout the supermarket. Biotech animals, including leaner
hogs and fast-growing salmon, are in development.
</P>
<P>
   A few food companies, including Frito-Lay and Gerber, have
stopped using genetically engineered crops, citing consumer
concern. But recent efforts by shareholders to get other companies
to follow suit have failed overwhelmingly. On Wednesday,
shareholders of Frito-Lay's parent company, PepsiCo Inc., voted 90
percent to 4 percent against removing the gene-altered products.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech critics said the government's proposal falls short of
what's needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan is like some fat-free foods -- it's not very good and
there isn't much substance,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, a senior
scientist for Environmental Defense. She did, however, praise the
administration's decision to review its environmental regulations
to see if they are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who is sponsoring a mandatory
labeling bill, called the administration's plan ''a hollow step.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech companies and food manufacturers applauded the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the steps announced today serve to further strengthen
public confidence in the United States' already strict regulatory
system and the safety of our food supply, then they must be
considered appropriate and positive,'' said Carl B. Feldbaum,
president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said the government oversight ''should further boost consumer
confidence in the safety of America's food supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department will begin certifying new
tests designed to detect the presence of biotech ingredients in
food. Such tests, ensuring that food labeled biotech-free meets
uniform standards, would make it easier for some farmers to sell to
U.S. and foreign consumers who refuse to buy gene-altered products.
</P>
<P>
   The plan stemmed from public hearings last year amid a public
outcry, primarily overseas, about genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   FDA won't propose new rules for the mandatory review process and
voluntary labeling program until this fall, officials said, meaning
they probably won't take effect until next year, after a new
administration takes office.

<HEADLINE> Plane Stopped From Landing in Gaza  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAQ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Israel prevented an Egyptian airplane
from landing at the Palestinian territory's Gaza airport Wednesday,
forcing it to return to Egypt in a dispute over air routes.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the EgyptAir plane said he turned back to Cairo
when he saw two Israeli fighter jets approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's civil aviation administration said the pilot was denied
landing permission because he flew an unauthorized route instead of
the route agreed upon by Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He approached in a route that is not recognized'' on
international flight charts, said Israeli civil aviation director
Avner Yarkoni.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has requested a change in the route its planes take to
arrive at the airport, which is run by the Palestinians but subject
to overall Israeli security control, including regulation of flight
routes. The Egyptian plane flew according to the modified route
that has not yet been approved by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Yarkoni said the route change request was under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian aviation officials said Israel had also prevented a
Royal Air Maroc plane, flying from Morocco to Gaza via Cairo, from
landing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two Palestinian flights, bound for Amman and Cairo, were
grounded at the last minute Wednesday morning after Egypt insisted
they take the new route over the Egyptian coastal town of El Arish,
Palestinian officials said. Israel did not approve the flight plan,
the officials said, and the flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said they were trying to persuade Egypt to
return to the original flight route.

<HEADLINE> Food Cos. Seen As Ripe for Mergers  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-dormant U.S. food companies are suddenly
being appraised like so much fine wine.
</P>
<P>
   An $18.4 billion offer by international food conglomerate
Unilever for Bestfoods, with brands including Skippy peanut butter,
Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorrs soups, has rekindled interest in
the sleepy U.S. packaged food industry.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were so enthusiastic Wednesday at the proposition of a
wave of food company takeovers that they bid up the stocks of
virtually every well-known U.S. food company.
</P>
<P>
   The surge came despite a broad selloff throughout the rest of
the stock market that saw the Dow Jones industrial average fall
250.99 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods' stock benefitted the most, climbing $10.68}, or 21
percent, to close at $61.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Campell
Soup, up $3.06\ to $29.56\, and ketchup maker H.J. Heinz, up $3.68}
to $37.62{, also saw strong gains. But Unilever's U.S. shares
slipped $2.31\, or 5 percent, to $43.12{.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Unilever's offer means that two of the largest U.S.
food companies are now takeover targets. Nabisco Group Holdings put
itself on the market last month after financier Carl Icahn
announced he was prepared to buy the company, which owns a
controlling stake in the maker of Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Englewood Cliffs, N.J.-based Bestfoods rejected
Unilever's bid of $66 a share, or a 31 percent premium on
Bestfoods' closing price Tuesday, shows that Bestfoods feels it has
strong leverage in any negotiations, analysts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the huge multinational companies that are looking
to expand their markets through acquisitions of smaller companies
know they will need to add strong brand names, similar to those now
owned by companies like Bestfoods, Heinz and Campbell Soup.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need more power brands,'' said Prudential Securities
analyst John McMillin.
</P>
<P>
   That need evidently served as the impetus for Unilever's recent
acquisitions of gourmet ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's for $326
million and diet food company Slim-Fast Foods for $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The global food industry has grappled with slow sales growth for
much of the past decade, said William Leach, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, a New York investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, food company executives are under pressure to
expand their markets while at the same time cutting costs. And the
best way to do that is to acquire well-known brand names that can
be sold through existing distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor adding to the apparent urgency of large food
companies to purchase smaller ones has been consolidation with in
the retail grocery store sector.
</P>
<P>
   As grocery chains have merged and become larger and stronger,
food companies have realized that they must keep pace, according to
McMillin.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't have your customers getting bigger and bigger and
you're doing nothing,'' he said. ''You're forced to find partners
to gain some scale so you can look them in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   While Unilever's $18.4 billion offer for Bestfoods fits
comfortably into the changing landscape of the food sector,
analysts said the proposal was unique in several respects.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was the largest of its kind for more than a decade,
since the British distiller Grand Metropolitan bought Pillsbury Co.
for $5.8 billion in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Second, $18 billion deals aren't expected to come along every
day since only two companies -- Unilever and Nestle -- can afford to
pay such a high price.
</P>
<P>
   So in the absence of numerous large companies being bought up by
even bigger companies, analysts expect so-called ''mergers among
equals.''

<HEADLINE> Humana Earnings Improve in 1Q  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SCHREINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Humana Inc. reported improved
first-quarter earnings Wednesday, but fell short of Wall Street's
expectations. Revenue increased 7 percent and the company's new
chief executive predicted a turnaround for the managed health care
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had net income of $21 million, or 13 cents
per share, for the quarter ending March 31, compared with a loss of
$16 million, or 10 cents per share, for the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter showing fell short of analysts' expectations
of 15 cents per share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter revenue reached $2.6 billion, the company said.
The increase was due mainly to significant increases in premium
yields, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCallister, named Humana's president and chief
executive officer earlier this year, said the company was making
strides toward solid profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to have seen even more progress during the
quarter,'' said McCallister.
</P>
<P>
   McCallister said that as Humana carries out its business
strategy, he was ''cautiously optimistic'' about new momentum for
the second half of 2000, continuing into next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain confident that the steps we are taking -- investments
in infrastructure, ongoing market and product rationalization and
emerging e-health initiatives -- will return Humana to solid growth
rates and improvement in operating results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Humana Inc. has been trying to regain its footing after losses
incurred a year ago because it underestimated medical care
expenses. The company also has undergone considerable upheaval
since a planned multibillion-dollar merger with United HealthCare
Corp. collapsed in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Shove, who follows the managed care industry for
Prudential Securities Inc., said Humana executives ''have a lot of
work to do'' to complete their turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Shove said the disappointing first-quarter numbers underscored
that Humana has a number of unresolved problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that they have a lot of irons in the fire,'' he
said. ''They are trying to fix things at once, and they aren't
getting things fixed as fast as they had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Humana said commercial premium yields averaged 11.4 percent for
the first quarter, compared to 6.3 percent for the same period last
year. The company said the increase did cause its commercial
membership to decline 3.4 percent to 2,977,500.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare premium yields rose to 6.2 percent in the first
quarter, compared to 2.1 percent a year ago, Humana said. Medicare
membership increased 29,500, or 6 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's positive. They are getting better pricing,'' Shove
said. ''Some things are improving, but they still have some
Medicare markets that are not performing up to their expectations,
and they have some small-group business that is not performing up
to expectations.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Congressional Pay Raise Considered  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two top House lawmakers have discussed the
possibility of pursuing a cost-of-living pay raise for members of
Congress this year, but they and others say no final decisions have
been made.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and Rep. Steny Hoyer,
D-Md., acknowledged Wednesday that they had a brief discussion
about a possible pay raise earlier this year. Many lawmakers are
reluctant to publicly support higher congressional salaries,
particularly in election years, but the two men long have been
vocal supporters of regular increases for legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're simpatico, that's for sure,'' DeLay said of himself and
Hoyer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress gave itself a 3.4 percent raise that took
effect this past January, pushing lawmakers' pay to $141,300
annually. Under a formula set by law, the new increase -- which
would take effect next January -- could be no more than about 3
percent, or about $4,200.
</P>
<P>
   This year's increase was the second in the past three years.
Prior to that, the last raise took effect in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1989 law, members of Congress' salaries are
automatically increased each year unless lawmakers specifically
vote to block it. The mechanism is designed to avoid annual,
potentially politically embarrassing salary votes.
</P>
<P>
   That law also established a formula that keeps members' raises
below those received in private industry or by federal workers.
President Clinton has proposed raising federal employees pay next
year by 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a surplus, we've managed the finances of the country
very well,'' said Hoyer, top Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee subcommittee that oversees the Treasury. By tradition,
any vote to block the raise occurs as an amendment to that
subcommittee's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be for leaders of each party to explore
whether the pay raise can be approved without a partisan or
embarrassing battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't do it if one side will try to get the other side,''
Hoyer said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and John Feehery,
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., both said
Gephardt and Hastert have not met to discuss the issue. Such a
trust-building meeting is often held before a final decision on
raising lawmakers' salaries is made.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th Amendment to the Constitution forbids lawmakers from
approving salary increases that take effect before the next
congressional election. This increase, should it occur, would take
effect after the next election, when the 107th Congress begins.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal courts have ruled that raises enacted under
the 1989 law do not violate the Constitution because it is that law
-- and not a new act of Congress -- that triggers the pay increase.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Agency May Leave Kosovo City  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.N. refugee agency threatened on
Wednesday to pull out of a tense ethnically split city in Kosovo
because ''we're not prepared to be sitting ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or
UNHCR, issued the warning days after Serb rioters attacked U.N.
workers in the city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The northern Kosovo city is one of the few in the overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian province where many Serbs remain, and a UNHCR
pullout could lead to the exodus of other humanitarian agencies who
follow the refugee group's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although no UNHCR worker was hurt by the Serb rioters who
pummeled a Kenyan policeman with the U.N. administration, McNamara
said his agency would leave if security fails to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not prepared to be sitting ducks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. administrators and 40,000 NATO-led troops moved into
Kosovo in June after a 78-day NATO bombing campaign forced Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his forces, which had
carried out a massive crack down on ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara planned to meet on Friday with the local Serb leader,
Oliver Ivanovic, before making any recommendations to superiors on
whether to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic criticized McNamara's warning, calling it a ''a
reckless act that is supposed to blackmail,'' the Serbs, who live
in the northern part of Mitrovica, with the ethnic Albanians in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   ''The security situation in Mitrovica is no worse than elsewhere
in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riots and disturbances have broken out frequently in Kosovska
Mitrovica in recent months amid building frustration by Serbs who
reject U.N. and NATO control of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 Kosovo Serbs rallied Wednesday in the tense city
demanding a safe return for Serbs who fled. The city's Serbs massed
on the main square and shouted ''We Want Our Homes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, UNHCR reported progress on the return of
Kosovo's 30,000 non-Serb minorities, including Roma, or Gypsies,
targeted by ethnic Albanians who accuse them of being Serb allies.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Officials Arrested in Probe  </HEADLINE>
By RON JENKINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The deputy state health commissioner was
charged Wednesday with accepting a $1,000 bribe from a nursing home
operator to help the home qualify for federal funds, and Oklahoma's
attorney general said he expects more arrests to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Drew Edmondson said the case involved not just
financial fraud but also rule violations by nursing homes that
could have endangered the lives of elderly and incapacitated
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy health commissioner, Brent VanMeter, 46, was led from
Health Department offices in handcuffs by the FBI Tuesday afternoon
as investigators searched six locations, including the Health
Department, VanMeter's home and unspecified private businesses.
Several boxes were removed from VanMeter's home.
</P>
<P>
   VanMeter had been in charge of his agency since April 24, when
Commissioner J.R. Nida went on medical leave following surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which began the investigation in 1996, alleges that
VanMeter solicited and accepted a payoff to qualify a nursing home
operator for federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI affidavit quotes a taped telephone conversation on April
17 in which the nursing home operator asked VanMeter to falsify
Health Department records so as to generate an extra $50,000 in
income. The affidavit said VanMeter asked for $1,000 -- 2 percent of
the $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   VanMeter was charged with one count of bribery and released on
his own recognizance. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   VanMeter's attorney, Mack Martin, said he had no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson said charges could be filed against other Health
Department workers and nursing home operators.
</P>
<P>
   VanMeter and seven other Health Department workers were
suspended with pay as the investigation unfolded. Officials said
the other suspensions were not disciplinary, but were ordered to
allow the probe to continue in their areas of the Health Department
without interference.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Regier, a member of Gov. Frank Keating's cabinet, was
appointed acting director of the Health Department after VanMeter's
arrest. Regier said the case could put federal funds that Oklahoma
receives at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Keating characterized the case as ''raw, unadulterated
corruption'' and added: ''This is intolerable.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Laura Bush in 1963 Car Wreck  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Details in a 1963 accident report say that
Laura Bush, then 17, ran a stop sign in the Texas crash that killed
a friend in another car. The report, adding information to previous
reports of the crash, was released to The Associated Press on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush now is the wife of Republican presidential
nominee-to-be George W. Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very tragic accident that deeply affected the
families and was very painful for all involved, including the
community at large,'' said Mrs. Bush's spokesman, Andrew Malcolm.
''To this day, Mrs. Bush remains unable to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say in March, when asked at a campaign stop about the
crash, ''I know this as an adult, and even more as a parent, it was
crushing ... for the family involved and for me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been published accounts of the accident, but city
officials had declined to release the records because those
involved were under 18. The police report was released Wednesday in
response to an open-records request that was submitted to Midland
officials in March.
</P>
<P>
   According to the two-page accident report, Laura Welch was
driving her Chevrolet sedan on a clear night shortly after 8 p.m.
on Nov. 6, 1963, when she drove into an intersection and struck a
Corvair sedan driven by 17-year-old Michael Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Although previous news accounts have reported Douglas was thrown
from the car and broke his neck, those details were not in the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of Laura Bush's car was illegible on the report. The
speed limit for the road was 55.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush and her passenger, Judy Dykes, also 17, were taken to
a hospital and treated for minor injuries, according to an accident
account printed at the time in the Midland Reporter-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   The police report indicates no charges were filed. That section
of the report was left blank.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we know, no charges were filed,'' said Midland city
attorney Keith Stretcher. ''I don't think it's unusual that charges
weren't filed.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Spent $762,000 on Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has spent more than
$762,000 on the Elian Gonzalez case, including nearly $230,000 on
the April 22 operation that removed him from the home of his Miami
relatives and reunited him with his father here.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released Wednesday cover federal government costs
from the discovery of the 6-year-old Cuban boy off Florida last
Thanksgiving through last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The swift, predawn raid April 22 by heavily armed federal agents
followed by the boy's flight to Washington on a government jet with
medical personnel aboard, all dubbed Operation Reunion, cost
$229,686. That includes overtime, security, travel, transportation
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 131 Immigration and Naturalization Service agents and
18 U.S. marshals participated, including the Border Patrol's
tactical unit brought by commercial aircraft from El Paso, Texas.
They trained for a week before the raid. The cost of travel for a
Public Health Service flight surgeon and a psychiatrist who
accompanied Elian aboard the flight to Washington was $2,811.
</P>
<P>
   The largest costs were incurred by INS which spent 420,000. The
Marshals Service has spent 299,000.
</P>
<P>
   Private sources are paying the costs for Elian, his father, Juan
Miguel, step mother and infant half brother to stay at the secluded
Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS and marshals have paid to provide security there,
using 58 agents at a cost of more than $168,000 for the first five
days.
</P>
<P>
   The marshals have 18 witness security inspectors and 19 deputy
marshals on duty at Wye River. From April 26 through April 30, the
marshals spent $27,600 for daily travel and transportation expenses
plus $35,100 for overtime and $75,000 for equipment.
</P>
<P>
   INS has 21 agents at Wye, working 12-hour shifts. During the
same period, INS has paid $14,910 in daily travel and
transportation expenses and $15,755 for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The government also will pay $8,000, including travel, for three
mental health experts brought in to evaluation the Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
   It did not pay for Juan Miguel Gonzalez' stay at the home of a
Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md., before he was reunited with his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Travel, transcripts and copying for lawyers in U.S. Attorney's
offices and in the department's civil division have come to
$18,000.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Community Relations Service spent $25,000 to
send mediators and conciliators to Miami and to communicate with
them as they helped with negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There are no figures for the regular salaries for lawyers,
agents, or mediators because the salaries would have been paid
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The federal figures are dwarfed by those incurred by the City of
Miami, which last estimated its costs at $1 million, mostly in
police overtime, but that was before the April 22 raid and the
street disorders that it set off.

<HEADLINE> Medical Research Deaths Probed  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration was accused
Wednesday of doing too little to protect thousands of people
enrolled in medical research despite warnings two years ago that
the current safeguards were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to do something to stop the foot-dragging,'' Rep.
John Mica, R-Fla., said at a hearing before the House Government
Reform subcommittee that he heads. ''We'll subpoena the (Health and
Human Services) secretary if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The HHS inspector general's office warned in 1998 that the local
review boards supposed to oversee clinical tests were overworked.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the inspectors' suggestions have been put into practice,
George Grob, deputy inspector general for evaluations and
inspections, told the subcommittee on criminal justice, drug policy
and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed in the lackluster response to the inspector
general's report,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The death in September of Jesse Gelsinger, 18, of Tucson, Ariz.,
while undergoing a gene therapy procedure at the University of
Pennsylvania put a new focus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The intense scrutiny since Gelsinger's death will help change
things, Grob said. ''I think the interest is there now and I expect
to see some changes coming down the pike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Raub, HHS's deputy assistant secretary for science
policy, said officials conducted on-site investigations at 10
institutions between June 1998 and March 2000, compared with only
one on-site investigation the previous 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Raub also said the number of routine on-site investigations by
the Food and Drug Administration increased from 213 in 1997 to 336
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Health and Human Services is fully committed
to protecting human research subjects,'' Raub said, acknowledging
more needs to be done.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Pressures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell sharply on Wednesday amid two
reports showing that inflationary pressures persist despite the
Federal Reserve's attempt to cool the economy with higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 21/32 point, or
$6.56 per $1,000 in face value. It's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, rose to 6.39 percent compared with late
Tuesday's rate of 6.30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond fell 1 13/32 points, or $14.06 per $1,000 in
face value. The long-bond's yield rose to 6.11 percent compared
with 6.01 percent a day earlier, according to Bridge Telerate news
service.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the session, the Commerce Department reported that new
orders to American factories rose a bigger-than-expected 2.2
percent, led by the largest jump in demand for electronic equipment
in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the Federal Reserve issued a report on
regional conditions that said employers may be forced to boost
wages as they scramble to find scarce workers, heightening
pressures to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has boosted interest rates five times since last June in
an effort to slow the economy and keep such pressures in check. But
given the strong growth and tight labor market conditions cited in
Wednesday's report, economists believe the Fed may see no other
choice but to boost rates a few more times in the coming months.
Inflation makes the fixed payoff on bonds less attractive to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Wednesday, short-term Treasury securities fell
between 5/32 point and [ point while intermediate maturities fell
between 5/16 point and 7/32 point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.90
percent while the discount held steady at 5.74 percent. Six-month
yields finished at 6.21 percent with a discount of 5.95 percent, up
0.01 percentage point. One-year yields slipped to 6.17 percent as
the discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 5.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6.06\ percent compared with late Tuesday's 5.87{
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 17/32 point to 93|. The average yield
to maturity rose to 6.10 percent compared with 6.06 percent a day
earlier.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Special Ed Funding  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House agreed Wednesday to live up to a
promise made a quarter-century ago by backing a gradual increase in
federal aid to special education from $5 billion this year to $25
billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Full funding for the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act
has been a top priority of Republicans, but the 421-3 vote
reflected strong backing from Democrats as well. The money would
still have to be approved in annual budget bills.
</P>
<P>
   The near unanimous House vote contrasted with a partisan fight
in the Senate, where Republicans used their majority to advance
their own measure governing the federal education effort for grades
K-12 and reject a Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal includes a provision to give states more
discretion in their use of federal funds, although they would also
be required to demonstrate improved performance. ''If more
decisions are made closer to our students lives by people who know
those students, the quality of their education will improve,'' said
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said that instead of investing
in proven reforms that work, the Republican bill ''gives a blank
check to the states to conduct business as usual.'' A Democratic
alternative was rejected, 54-45, strictly along party lines. It
would have targeted funds for more teachers and smaller classes.
</P>
<P>
   No final vote is expected until next week at the earliest, and a
fight looms over Democratic efforts to attach a gun control
provision to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed legislation on special education, which now
goes to the Senate, would authorize spending of $7 billion in
fiscal year 2001 and allow an increase of $2 billion a year until
the figure reaches $25 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   At that level, the federal government would be providing about
40 percent of the extra costs needed to give children with special
needs access to education.
</P>
<P>
   The 1975 law requiring schools to educate children with
disabilities allows the federal government to contribute up to 40
percent of those costs, but it has never come close to that amount,
shifting the cost burden to the states and local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't put our money where our mouth was,'' said Education
and the Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., the
chief sponsor. He said that in the past four years the GOP-led
Congress has managed to more than double IDEA funds to $5 billion,
but that still only takes care of 12.6 percent of the national
average of $6,300 a child it takes to educate the 6 million
children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep, Matthew Martinez, D-Calif., who has promoted similar
legislation, said the Los Angeles unified school district must
spend $891 million a year to educate 81,000 special needs kids. He
said it receives $500 million from the state and $42 million from
the federal government, meaning it must tap into its general
education funds to make up the more than $300 million shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Even with passage of the bill, it still remains for the
Appropriations Committee to actually insert the money in the annual
budgets, and that could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the difficult work comes in finding appropriations to
meet those levels,'' said Education Department spokeswoman Erica
Lepping. She said the administration supports full funding, ''but
in order to achieve that goal, other important initiatives
shouldn't be jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has argued that priority in education
spending should go to hiring more teachers, reducing class sizes
and rebuilding old and inadequate school structures. Republicans
have countered in the annual budget battles that full federal
financial support for special education would free up states and
local school districts to fund other pressing education needs,
including more teachers and new buildings.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Student To Live on Internet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A Chilean journalism student sequestered
himself in a house on Wednesday planning to live the next eight
months with only one link to the outside world: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Piraces, 23, carried only a sleeping bag, as he moved
into an empty house in the Chilean capital. The other essentials of
apartment life -- a bed, a television set, a microwave oven,
refrigerator, books and food -- he plans to buy over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think my first purchase will be a heater,'' he said,
referring to the Southern Hemisphere's descending winter. He added:
''I am not afraid as I know I will be able to find everything
through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Piraces said his eight-month project is in part to test the
''the state of virtual trade in Chile.'' The project is being
sponsored by several local businesses, and his experience will be
broadcast over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Piraces said some sixteen cameras have been installed throughout
the house -- apart from the bathroom -- enabling people to track his
experiences over the Internet as they happen.

   ''The cameras are not to keep watch on me, but to share my
experience with people who might be interested,'' Piraces said
before entering the four-room house.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to leave the house at the end of the year, although
will not abandon his studies during that time -- he plans to do his
schoolwork over the Net, too.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the experience is unique in Latin America, where
the Internet has only recently began to take hold, although similar
projects have been developed in the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Those entering the Pirace's Internet address will be able to
chat with him, he said, ''and give me their opinions, whatever they
might be.''

<HEADLINE> Aide Questions Arrival of E-Mails  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Dan Burton said Wednesday he doubts the
White House will produce any messages in the e-mail controversy
until well after Election Day, but presidential aides stuck to
their timetable of saying the first e-mails will be turned over as
early as June.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arose after Burton's staff on the House Government
Reform Committee disclosed that a White House contractor will take
two months longer than expected to complete work on an archive of
hundreds of thousands of e-mails that presidential aides have never
reviewed in connection with various subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Eric Duong, told committee staffers April 25
that loading information into an archive won't be finished until
the day before Thanksgiving. The White House originally projected
the material could be searched completely by the end of September.
The cost of the system also has gone up dramatically, to between $8
million to $10 million, Michael Lyle, director of the White House
Office of Administration, told the committee at a hearing. An
earlier White House estimate was $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we will get'' e-mail ''until after the
election,'' on Nov. 7, Burton told reporters. ''I think they will
run this thing beyond the election. I doubt seriously they will
give us any before Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Jim Kennedy predicted that ''we'll
still be able to search and produce e-mails as early as June and
we'll be able to continue to do so on a rolling basis throughout
the summer and fall. We also expect to do our searches on a
priority basis so that the most important information can be
derived early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the White House still needs to establish a priority
list of which material will be searched first. The e-mails are
stored on thousands of back-up tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the rising costs stem from the need for another
contractor to review the work to ensure it is done in a proper
manner and extra hardware and labor to expedite the process.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers want to know why the White House didn't
reveal the e-mail problem in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   White House computer experts say the White House counsel's
office was told of the problem, but presidential aides say the
lawyers thought it was a ''glitch'' that had been corrected. In
fact, incoming e-mails haven't been archived from the summer of
1996 to November 1998. That period covers the Lewinsky and the
campaign fund-raising scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, R-Ind., suggested the White House didn't ask Congress
for money to correct the problem last year because it was trying to
cover up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not ask for funds'' to correct the e-mail problem
because ''our singular purpose was Y2K,'' Lyle testified.

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Mourners Urge Racism End  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALIQUIPPA, Pa. (AP) -- Mourners who gathered to remember a
22-year-old black man shot to death in what police say was a
racially motivated killing spree pledged Wednesday to rise above
racism and not answer hate with hate.
</P>
<P>
   Garry D. Lee, gunned down at a karate school, was the last of
five people killed in Friday's shooting spree in the Pittsburgh
suburbs. Police say 34-year-old Richard Baumhammers, charged with
five counts of homicide and seven hate crimes, chose the victims
because of their ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Color meant something to the man that shot him, but color
means nothing to me,'' Melvin Jones, a close friend of Lee's, told
about 400 people gathered for the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from President Clinton expressing sympathy to Lee's
mother, Zetta Lee, was also read out loud. ''Violence in our
society hurts us all, but few have had to endure its effects so
personally,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Melvin E. Clark of Church in the Round, which Lee
attended about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, called on members
of the mostly black congregation to pray for guidance to end racism
and hate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell him about a world of racism and strife,'' Clark said.
''It didn't just start. Racism is alive in America and God is going
to judge it. God despises it.''
</P>
<P>
   The others killed in Friday's shooting spree were a Jewish woman
who lived next door to Baumhammers, an Indian man at a grocery, and
a Chinese manager and Vietnamese delivery driver at a restaurant.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Studies Women's Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mother's Day could be threatened by
international enforcers if the United States ratifies a global
treaty on women's rights, Rep. Christopher Smith contended
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement caused a stir at the House International Relations
Committee, where witnesses urged lawmakers to pass the 20-year-old
U.N. Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow committee member challenged Smith's interpretation of
the treaty and another joked about it.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no laughing matter for an anthropologist and women's
rights activist from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to get up and slap him,'' Zieba Shorish-Shamley said
later. ''But then I wouldn't be able to come here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorish-Shamley was one of three women who never got to tell the
committee Wednesday how systematic discrimination in their
homelands has hurt them. No discrimination victims were scheduled
to testify, so three spoke afterward at a news conference scheduled
by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Shorish-Shamley said she lost her 56-year-old sister to cancer
because access to health care is denied to women in Afghanistan,
along with education, jobs, or even the right to leave their homes
unaccompanied by a man.
</P>
<P>
   Meme Akoko of Nigeria said her genitals were cut with an
unsterilized razor blade when she was 3 months old, under a tribal
practice aimed at keeping women sexually faithful to their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been to many doctors and none have been able to undo
what damage the circumcision has cause,'' she said, adding that an
aunt, younger sister and a cousin died because of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brave women ... who tell their personal stories know just
how much ratifying CEDAW will mean to women everywhere,'' Woolsey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in December
1979, requires that women have equal rights to work, pay, benefits
and safe working conditions and prohibits discrimination against
women in political activities. So far, 165 nations have ratified
it.
</P>
<P>
   At the committee hearing, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., called
it an ''an absolute embarrassment'' that the United States has not
ratified the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the convention promotes abortion, could override
the U.S. Constitution and could force social engineering by
dictating the roles husbands and wives will have in their own
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many countries have come under the scrutiny of CEDAW and been
encouraged, admonished, and even compelled to change their laws,''
said Smith, R-N.J., calling the treaty ''controversial and
fundamentally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Do our constituents ... really want a group of international
bureaucrats telling them that the day set aside to honor our
mothers must be abolished,'' he said. ''I think not!''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., came in for harsh criticism at the
hearing and the press conference. The chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Helms for years has refused to
schedule hearings or submit the treaty to the full Senate for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is trying to stonewall crucial protection for women's
rights around the world,'' Woolsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms was not immediately available for comment, but said on
International Women's Day March 8: ''This treaty is not about
opportunities for women -- it's about denigrating motherhood and
undermining the family.''

<HEADLINE> 7 Peacekeepers Killed in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebel leader agreed
Wednesday to free any hostages held by his movement, after dozens
of U.N. peacekeepers and unarmed military observers were seized and
at least seven peacekeepers killed in clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, Revolutionary United Front rebels have captured 50
U.N. workers in three towns in Sierra Leone's interior, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven peacekeepers were killed and three more were injured in
clashes in the central towns of Makeni and Magburaka, U.N.
officials said. The fighting in Magburaka, where the U.N. post came
under heavy attack, ended Wednesday morning, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission reported another clash Wednesday in the
northwestern town of Kambia. There were no details, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions and killings came with the U.N. peacekeeping
force taking charge of security in the country, which has been
wracked by years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Foday Sankoh -- in an agreement signed Wednesday
after meeting with Nigerian National Security Adviser Alieu
Mohammed and read on state radio and television -- pledged to ''to
release any hostages if held'' by his group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Sankoh also said he would continue with
dialogue about the peace process, allow freedom of movement by U.N.
peacekeepers, humanitarian workers and civilians in all the areas
formerly under RUF control, and to work toward disarmament based on
the July peace accord that ended eight years of fighing in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But Sankoh has repeatedly made similar promises in the past, and
it was unclear exactly when the U.N. hostages -- who he did not
directly acknowledge were held by the RUF -- would be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of U.N. peacekeepers surrounded Sankoh's home in Freetown
while negotiations continued for the release of the hostages, U.N.
officials said. Officials denied they were planning to arrest
Sankoh, saying they wanted to make sure he was available for
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,500-member U.N. force was dispatched to replace a West
African intervention force, known as ECOMOG, that defended the
government during the civil war. The last ECOMOG troops left the
capital, Freetown, this week.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the increasing violence, U.N. Security Council
members and countries that contributed troops to the U.N. mission
in Sierra Leone on were discussing increasing the size of the force
closer to its authorized strength of 11,100, U.N. and diplomatic
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The council and Secretary-General Kofi Annan both condemned the
deaths of the peacekeepers, and laid the blame on Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who was in Paris Wednesday night, said that several
African heads of state were sending envoys ''to put pressure on him
(Sankoh) to pull his men back so that peacekeepers can do their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that the situation was not ''encouraging'' for future
U.N. missions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we need to reassess after this incident ... what
changes in attitude, what changes in our relationship with him
(Sankoh) and others have to be made,'' Annan told Associated Press
Television News.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ''We went into this realizing there will be risks
... but I hope we will be able to ... continue our work.''
</P>
<P>
   United States officials suggested Wednesday that Sankoh be
declared a war criminal, which would enable U.N. peacekeepers to
arrest and detain him. There was no indication, however, that the
United Nations supported that move.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the actions by the rebels violated the peace accords meant to end
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States condemns these actions in the strongest
possible terms,'' Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Foe of class-actions defends proposed diet-drug settlement  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Columbia University law professor who
often criticizes class actions defended a proposed $3.75 billion
national settlement of health claims against the diet drug
combination fen-phen, saying Wednesday it would be likely to
benefit those claiming injuries from the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a case where my usual criticisms do not apply,'' John
C. Coffee said in documents filed with U.S. District Judge Louis
Bechtle.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee testified Wednesday that there are marked differences
between the diet drug case and other settlements which he has
opposed, particularly a large asbestos settlement involving Amchem
Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He said that unlike potential victims of asbestos exposure,
those who took the diet drugs Pondimin or Redux, the ''fen''
portion of the so-called fen-phen combination, did so under
doctors' prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   They were aware of their exposure, and in many cases have
undergone tests to determine the likelihood of ill effects, Coffee
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence with the diet drugs of the ''latency''
effect of asbestos exposure, in which victims may not be aware they
have been exposed and may not develop symptoms for 30 years or
more, said Coffee, whose arguments were cited by the U.S. Supreme
Court in rejecting the Amchem settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the proposed diet-drug settlement avoids the problem of
potential future claims that could not be accurately anticipated in
the asbestos case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a much tighter, less sprawling, less amorphous
class,'' Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits were filed in connection with the
drugs, which were taken off the market by American Home Products
Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst division in St. Davids, Pa., in September 1997
after a Mayo Clinic study linked the combination to potentially
fatal heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtle tentatively approved the settlement in November, and is
hearing arguments from attorneys for Madison, N.J.-based American
Home Products and patients who took the drugs. He is expected to
decide this summer whether the settlement will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee said other provisions he favored included provisions that
allow claimants to opt out of the agreement at three separate
stages without losing rights to pursue litigation against the drug
maker on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement provides for those injured by the drugs to
receive payments ranging from about $37,000 up to $1.5 million, but
Coffee noted that those who accept less than the maximum would have
the right to later seek more money if their condition becomes
worse.

<HEADLINE> Rabbi's lawyer demands reporter's notes of interview with slayingsuspect  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Lawyers for a rabbi accused of arranging
his wife's killing subpoenaed the notes Wednesday of a newspaper
reporter who said she witnessed the confession of the middleman in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Dennis Wixted said he wants all notes and records kept by
Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Nancy Phillips during interviews
over the years about the 1994 killing.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips ''crossed the line'' when she talked to Leonard Jenoff
and allowed the prosecutor and a homicide investigator to join the
conversation at a diner, Wixted said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper plans to fight the subpoena, said Phillip Dixon, a
deputy managing editor. Any additional information that Phillips
has about the case will be reported in the paper, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a reporter provides information in a criminal case, either
at the behest of the prosecution or defense, the reporter runs the
risk as being perceived as partisan to the side that benefits from
the information,'' Dixon said. ''We believe that undermines the
free flow of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Wixted said he personally served Phillips with the subpoena when
she arrived at his office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the prosecutor must by law turn over to the defense a
summary of the interview with Jenoff, but Phillips is under no
requirement, thus the need for the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a witness. We don't know whether she entreated him or
encouraged him or what,'' Wixted said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff said Rabbi Fred Neulander offered him $30,000 to hire
someone to kill 52-year-old Carol Neulander, according to Phillips'
account in Tuesday's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The confession was made Friday. Jenoff, 54, and Paul Michael
Daniels, 26, were arrested Monday in the Nov. 1, 1994, beating
death.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who had been the only person charged, faced a trial
next month. The trial has been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, a private investigator who had been counseled by
Neulander for his own marital problems, was in a car with Phillips
to visit a location that he said was essential to the story, the
Inquirer reported Wednesday. Instead, Jenoff asked Phillips if they
could meet with Camden County prosecutor Lee Solomon because he had
something to say.
</P>
<P>
   The three, along with homicide detective Martin Devlin, went to
a New Jersey diner, where Jenoff confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff said the rabbi offered him the money to kill a person he
claimed was an enemy of Israel, the newspaper reported Tuesday.
Jenoff said the rabbi told him he could get him a job with Israel's
secret service if he pulled off the murder, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's lawyer, Francis Hartman, said his client was haunted by
what had happened and felt compelled to confess.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was something that was eating at him. The trial is coming
up and the thought occurred to him that the rabbi might be
acquitted and that might be a terrible thing,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels has also confessed, prosecutors say. Jenoff was being
held on $200,000 bail. Bail for Daniels was $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's lawyer said Phillips became much more than a
reporter working on the story when she called the prosecutor to
join the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips ''was not a reporter any more'' when she arranged the
interview and held off on reporting the story, Wixted said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 57, who founded what became the largest synagogue in
Cherry Hill, was long suspected in the killing but was not charged
until 1998. He resigned three months after his wife's death, after
reports surfaced about two extramarital affairs with members of his
congregation.

<HEADLINE> Man Cleared in Rapper's Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A mortgage broker has been cleared of
suspicion in the killing of rap artist Notorious B.I.G.,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Amir Muhammad said he learned in December that he had been a
suspect when he read a Los Angeles Times article that cited
confidential police documents.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martin, the detective in charge of the case, said Tuesday:
''We are not pursuing that theory and have not been for more than a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times article included Muhammad's driver's license
photograph. Muhammad said he spent days hiding in his home for fear
an angry rap fan might seek revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Notorious B.I.G., 24, who real name was Christopher Wallace, was
gunned down outside a Los Angeles museum on March 9, 1997. No
arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had reported that police were investigating whether
Muhammad was paid to shoot Wallace by rival rap mogul Marion
''Suge'' Knight and Muhammad's former college roommate, David A.
Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, a former police officer, is now in prison for bank
robbery. Knight is serving nine years for a 1992 attack on two

<HEADLINE> Mich. Mom Shot Two Children, Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLVAN TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Autopsies showed a woman found
dead in her home with two of her children shot the youths before
killing herself, an investigator said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no other evidence that indicates any other scenario,''
Michigan State Police Lt. Beth Moranty said. ''Why she would do
that I don't think we're ever going to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Young's husband, Daniel Young, and other relatives have
been cooperative with investigators but unable to pinpoint why the
38-year-old woman would kill Cooper Young, 9, and Makenzie Young,
4, before taking her own life, Moranty said.
</P>
<P>
   Moranty said autopsies revealed that Makenzie was shot once in
the head, Cooper once in the chest before their mother apparently
killed herself with a single shot to the head. They were found
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Another child, Sydney Young, 12, was grazed on the head by a
bullet but was not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our family is deeply saddened by yesterday's events,'' Daniel
Young and family said in a written statement. ''We want everyone to
know that we have been a very loving family, and an extremely close
one, and that we love our children very much.''

<HEADLINE> Feds: Time Warner Violated Rules  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission
determined Wednesday that Time Warner violated a communications law
when it dropped ABC stations from its cable systems in some markets
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a petition filed by ABC on Monday, the commission
found Time Warner breached a provision that prohibits cable
companies from deleting local signals during the period known as
''sweeps.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeps, a period when ratings are used to set local
advertising rates, began Thursday and runs until May 24.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision comes a day after the two companies
called a cease-fire and set a new July 15 deadline for their
negotiations over compensation for cable channels. FCC officials
said enforcement actions would be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time Warner Cable committed a clear violation of FCC rules,''
FCC Chairman William Kennard said. ''Unfortunately, millions of
consumers paid the price. No company should use consumers as pawns
in a private contract dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   If the FCC decides on enforcement action, it could assess
forfeitures of $7,500 per violation per day up to a maximum of
$250,000, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC argued that Time Warner overstepped the law when the cable
company stopped airing ABC programs in a number of markets at 12:01
a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's cable service bureau sided with ABC, asserting that
the law did cover the case even though the dispute involved two
companies engaged in private contractual negotiations over
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clarification provided by today's action will protect
consumers from experiencing a disruption in viewing a local
television station during the sweeps period,'' the FCC said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner pledged to pursue further review of the order and
said it was disappointed that the decision was made by the cable
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we agree this ambiguous rule needs clarification, it is
unfortunate that on an important issue affecting the entire cable
industry, and where there was no emergency, that this was done
without the full commission being involved,'' said Marc Apfelbaum,
senior vice president and general counsel of Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish left 3.5 million cable TV customers without the
ability to watch ABC for 39 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The media giants have been fighting over the money The Walt
Disney Co. -- ABC's corporate parent -- wants for letting Time Warner
air some of its cable channels. When they face their new July 15
deadline, the companies will be in another sweeps months -- meaning
that the FCC rule again would apply.
</P>
<P>
   ''We appreciate the speed with which the FCC acted, and are
obviously pleased with the decision,'' ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters chief, Edward Fritts,
said Time Warner's action ''once again shines a spotlight on the
cable industry's gatekeeper power.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, ABC stepped up its battle with Time Warner by
offering a $198 rebate to certain cable customers who want to
switch to satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was made through full-page newspaper ads to Time
Warner cable subscribers in New York City, Houston and Los Angeles.
They were among the 3.5 million customers around the country who
lost ABC's signal for a day and a half because of a battle between
the network and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Rebates were made available to the first 1,000 people to respond
by telephone in each city. Within 2{ hours, all the rebate coupons
were gone, Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner reacted angrily to what an executive called ''an
assault on our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is preparing its own offer to customers that will
demonstrate the company's regret over what happened, Time Warner
spokesman Michael Luftman said. He would not offer details.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's offer was made with the satellite TV provider DirecTV.
EchoStar Communications, which manufactures competing satellite
systems under the brand Dish Networks, has offered Time Warner
customers a free dish and installation if they agree to buy a
year's worth of programming for $40 a month.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Contestant Arraigned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- A contestant on the reality CBS TV show
''Survivor'' pleaded innocent Wednesday to allegations he abused
his 9-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch, 39, was arraigned in Family Court on a charge of
second-degree child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police that Hatch, just back from being marooned on
a remote tropical island off Borneo for the television program,
woke him at 4:30 a.m. one morning to go running because he wanted
the boy to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said when he got tired and started walking, Hatch pulled
him by the ear and wrapped his hands around his neck to move him
along.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's lawyer, Christopher Behan, did not return calls to his
office. Hatch's friends have said the boy, who Hatch adopted, was
troubled and lied about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch was among a group of 16 people left on the remote island
in March to live without running water or electricity. Every three
nights, the contestants voted to eject someone from the community.
It was not revealed how long Hatch lasted.
</P>
<P>
   The final person left at the end will get $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has said the show will go forward with Hatch in it. The show
will be aired weekly starting May 31.

<HEADLINE> Forest fire threatens housing developments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Firefighters in southern New Jersey managed
to contain a forest fire that threatened housing developments in
Medford and Shamong townships Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out shortly after 6 p.m. in a wooded area between
Quail Ridge Court in Medford and Bunker Hill Road in Shamong.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had considered evacuating the 25-unit Woodside
development in Shamong, but were able to bring the fire under
control before that became necessary, said Bert Plante, the state
Forest Fire Service's assistant warden.
</P>
<P>
   The fire burned about 20 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Fire Service had four pumpers at the scene and one
tractor-plow to help fight the fire, along with volunteer
firefighters from six Burlington County departments.
</P>
<P>
   Additional manpower was being rushed to the fire scene, and
small ''backfires'' were being set along the perimeter of the fire
in order to deprive it of fuel it needs to spread.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was centered on an old cranberry bog, making it
difficult for firefighters to reach it, Plante said.
</P>
<P>
   But winds in the area were light, which assisted firefighters in
bringing it under control.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Wednesday's Baseball Game Notes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Derek Jeter singled in the first inning of Wednesday
night's game and has reached base in 25 of 26 games and hit safely
in 21. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch missed his second straight game with
a sprained left hand and wrist. Manager Joe Torre said Knoblauch
would be examined again on Thursday and a decision about placing
him on the DL would be made Friday. Knoblauch went 1-for-16 before
Torre decided to sit him. ... Torre said the key to the success of
New York's bullpen has been the pitching of Jeff Nelson and Mike
Stanton. Nelson has not allowed a run in his last five appearances
(6 1-3 innings) and Stanton has pitched seven straight scoreless
innings. ''We get to the seventh inning and we really don't
consider anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said Roberto Alomar, who
entered the game in a 2-for-19 slump, has a sore left elbow. Manuel
wanted to rest Alomar for Wednesday's game, but the All-Star second
baseman insisted on playing. ''He keeps telling me he's fine,''
Manuel said. ''But his timing isn't there right now and he's not
getting good swings.'' ... RHP Charles Nagy was fined for his
involvement in Sunday's brushback war with Boston. ... Catcher
Sandy Alomar left for Florida where he will join the team's
extended spring program. Alomar, who has been on the DL since April
18 with a pulled hamstring, will join the Indians in Minnesota on
Sunday.
Angels-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: SS Gary DiSarcina was not in the starting lineup with
tightness in his right shoulder. ... RHP Troy Percival, the
normally dominating closer who blew a save in the Angels' 7-6 loss
to Baltimore on Tuesday, is 0-4 with a 6.08 ERA lifetime versus
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: 1B Will Clark was placed on the 15-day DL with a
strained left hamstring. ... The Orioles recalled INF Ryan Minor
from Triple-A Rochester, where he was hitting .265 with five homers
and 17 RBIs. ... RHP Tim Worrell, who had been designated for
assignment when the Orioles claimed INF Mark Lewis from Cincinnati
last week, was waived.
Tigers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers were without manager Phil Garner and third
baseman Dean Palmer, who are serving eight-game suspensions for an
April 22 brawl in Chicago. ... Juan Encarnacion extended his
hitting streak to 15 games with a first-inning single. He is
5-for-7 against Pete Schourek in his career. ... The Tigers won
coming from behind after the seventh inning once all last year.
They have already done it twice this year. ... After not facing a
lefty in their first 12 games, Detroit has faced six in their last
13 games.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Pedro Martinez was suspended for five games and fined
for plunking Roberto Alomar on Sunday. Martinez will appeal the
suspension, and he will be able to pitch until the appeal is heard.
... With his second-inning homer, Mike Stanley has four homers in
his last five games.
Rangers-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: DH Rafael Palmeiro was scratched from the lineup because
of tightness in his left hamstring. ... It could be a couple of
days before a decision is made on whether OF Gabe Kapler will go on
the DL with a strained right hip flexor. ... Jason McDonald
replaced Kapler in the lineup Wednesday night ... LHP Justin
Thompson, recovering from shoulder surgery, threw for 20 minutes in
the bullpen and didn't report any soreness. ... OF Rusty Greer, who
had arthroscopic surgery April 26 to remove bone spurs from the
front of his right ankle, has been running in the outfield and
batting off a tee. He could be ready to return in a couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: SS Kevin Stocker was not in the lineup after being
hit by a pitch on the right calf by Rick Helling on Tuesday. He was
replaced by Ozzie Guillen, but could be ready to return Thursday.
... The Devil Rays organization and Dwight Gooden will deliver
supplies and a cash donation Thursday to the Belmont Heights Little
League in Tampa. The youth group's baseball complex lost about
$5,000 worth of supplies, food and baseball equipment in a burglary
last weekend. Gooden, Gary Sheffield and Derek Bell are major
leaguers who once played for Belmont Heights.
Athletics-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Dan Glass, son of new owner David Glass, was
walking around the stadium before the game meeting people. The new
club president this week and already is discussing ideas of
improving the stadium, including installing a picnic pavilion
behind the Royals' bullpen. He dismissed any suggestion that the
Glass family has long-range plans to move the team out of Kansas
City. ''This team will be here forever,'' he said. ...
Right-fielder Jermaine Dye was named the AL's player of the month
after hitting .388 with 28 RBIs and leading the league in home runs
(11) and doubles (12).
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: RHP Kevin Appier, who has been nursing a strained right
forearm, is due to come off the DL next Wednesday. But the A's do
not expect him to pitch that day against Anaheim, figuring he will
take a few more days to get ready. ... The A's had a group of fans
from Russia. Twenty-eight members of the touring Russian national
team were in the stands and most seemed to be fans of the A's.
''There are many players on the A's that our players like very
much,'' said Andrei Artamonov, commissioner of the Russian Baseball
Federation.
Blue Jays-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays 6.42 ERA .42 in April was the highest for
any month in team history. The previous was 6.04 in April, 1996.
... Blue Jays closer Billy Koch is another successful survivor of
''Tommy John'' ligament replacement surgery. After appearing in
just three minor league games in 1997, Koch blew out his elbow. He
came back one year and a day after the surgery, won 14 games in the
minors and then made the majors the following season. Dr. James
Andrews, who did the surgery on the Cubs' Kerry Wood, performed the
operation. ''I just had a great surgery. It didn't affect my arm
angle or my mechanics,'' said Koch, whose fastball this season has
been clocked at 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Manager Jerry Manuel served the sixth of an eight-game
suspension as punishment for a brawl with Detroit last month.
Manuel is keeping his whereabouts during the games a secret until
after his sentence is over. ''It's been difficult,'' he said. ''I
didn't realize it would be as tough. I guess the length of it is
what is frustrating.'' ... The White Sox are averaging one error a
game. SS Jose Valentin made 11 in the first 24 games, including
four in one contest. ... The White Sox play an exhibition game
Thursday night against their Class AA affiliate at Birmingham,
Ala., then begin a six-game trip to Kansas City and Boston.
Mariners-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners have used 23 lineups in their first 24
games. ... Seattle has not lost a season series against Minnesota
in seven years under manager Lou Piniella. ... Seattle pinch
hitters entered Wednesday hitting just .125 (2-for-16) with no
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Twins lefty J.C. Romero, out since spring training
because of a strain in his pitching shoulder, started a 30-day
rehabilitation assignment at Class A Fort Myers. ... Twins
president Jerry Bell traveled to Milwaukee on Tuesday to meet with
commissioner Bud Selig and discuss realignment. Minnesota is not
pleased with the league's proposal of putting six teams in the
Central Division and four in both the East and the West.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Reds-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Deion Sanders agreed to a 10-day rehab assignment
extension at Triple-A Louisville through May 11. He has three
homers and eight steals in 18 games. ... The Reds are 2-0 in the
only two games in which their projected opening day lineup has
played. Sean Casey opened the season on the DL and Barry Larkin was
injured two games after Casey's return.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Terry Francona flip-flopped Ron Gant and Mickey
Morandini in the batting order after just one game. Gant returned
to the No. 2 spot in the order and Morandini dropped back to No. 7.
... The Phillies have faced their opponent's ace in each of their
nine series this season. ... The Phillies haven't beaten the Reds
in a series since taking two of three in Cincinnati in September
1998.
Astros-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Jeff Bagwell may have a gaudy batting average, but he
gets in slumps just like everybody else. He was 0-for-13 until his
single in the ninth inning Wednesday. ''I've had three bad games,
but this early in the season, it makes it look like 40 games,''
said Bagwell, who is hitting .319. ''But I'd rather go 0-for-5 and
get the win than get that single in the ninth.'' ... Jose Lima,
shelled for nine runs and 13 hits Tuesday by the Cubs, didn't hold
it against their fans. He sat on top of the Astros' dugout signing
autographs before the game, turning around at one point to sit with
the crowd of fans waiting for his signature. ... Richard Hidalgo
was 0-for-5 this series before hitting a solo homer, his seventh
this season, in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: When Mark Grace crossed home plate in the first inning,
driven in by Henry Rodriguez's double, it was his 1,000th career
run scored. He's the eighth Cub to reach the milestone. ''I've
scored 1,000 more runs than I was supposed to,'' said Grace, a
24th-round pick in 1985. ''I've really exceeded everybody's
expectations. Including mine.'' ... Almost lost among the Kerry
Wood hoopla is the return of Ismael Valdes, who's been on the DL
all season with tendinitis in his shoulder. Valdes is scheduled to
start Thursday. ''I'll probably look at him the same way as Kerry,
maybe 20 pitches less,'' manager Don Baylor said. ''Just take it
for five innings or whatever he can do, bring him along maybe a
step behind Kerry.'' ... The Cubs have beaten the Astros four
straight times, the most since winning four in a row at the end of
the 1991 season and beginning of 1992.
Diamondbacks-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Steve Finley, who hit two homers in Monday's 5-1
victory in Milwaukee, raised his average to .330. But he's hitting
.395 at County Stadium, including 10-for-18 with 13 RBI in his last
four games in Milwaukee. ... In its last 37 road games in 1999,
Arizona was 29-8; thus, the team is 38-12 in its last 50 away from
home.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Manager Davey Lopes celebrated his 55th birthday.
''I'm just thankful that I'm still healthy,'' Lopes said. ... With
his offense struggling, Lopes started Sean Berry at third base
against Arizona. Berry is batting .118 (2-for-17). ''You've got to
try something,'' said Lopes, whose team batting average of .231 is
ahead of only Philadelphia (.226) in the majors. ... LHP Matt
Williams cleared waivers and had to be offered back to the Yankees,
who claimed him for $25,000. That's half what the Brewers paid the
Yankees to obtain him as a Rule 5 player. ''I still think he's
capable of doing a good job,'' Lopes said. ... The Brewers sent P
Ray King to Indianapolis to make room for P Horacio Estrada, who
was 2-1 with a 2.67 ERA in five starts at Indianapolis.
Pirates-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The six-run eighth inning Tuesday matched the team's
season high, also done April 7 at Arizona. ... The Pirates were
6-for-17 with runners in scoring position Tuesday, ending a
1-for-29 slide. ... Pirates pitchers had allowed a league-low 20
homers before giving up four Tuesday. ''Like I said, we were going
to silence their home run bats,'' manager Gene Lamont joked. ... In
the first 10 road games, Pirates starters did not have a single
1-2-3 first inning. Jason Schmidt gave up a two-run home run to
Mark McGwire in the first Tuesday. ''He didn't hit 70 home runs for
nothing,'' Schmidt said. ''He got it up in the air, and when he
does that, it's going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Pitcher Matt Morris, out since April 1998 due to
elbow surgery, will make his second rehab start for Double-A
Arkansas Sunday at Little Rock. He threw 55 pitches Tuesday and
will be at that same pitch count in the second start. ''I like the
way my curve and changeup are coming along,'' Morris said. The
Cardinals expect to active him in June. ... The Cardinals'
two-error game Tuesday matched their season high. ... Mark McGwire
entered the game with 531 career homers in 5,705 at-bats. Jimmie
Foxx, who's in ninth place with 534 homers, had 8,134 at-bats. ...
Half of Shawon Dunston's six hits are home runs. ... Backup catcher
Eli Marrero has two stolen bases, both as a pinch runner.
Expos-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: OF Rondell White did not play Wednesday and may not
return until Saturday because of a sore left knee. He has been
playing in pain since being hit by a pitch April 20. .... The Expos
optioned RHP Jeremy Powell and RHP Brad Rigby to Triple-A Ottawa
and replaced them with RHP Mike Johnson and RHP Felipe Lira. ...
LHP Graeme Lloyd was placed on the 60-day DL. He is scheduled to
have surgery on his left shoulder Friday. ... OF Vladimir Guerrero
was named NL Player of the Month on Wednesday after hitting .410
with eight homers and 27 RBIs in April. ... C Chris Widger returned
to the lineup after missing Tuesday's game with soreness between
his left thumb and index finger. He went 0-for-2. ... The 24 hits
allowed by the Expos on Wednesday broke a 29-year-old team record
for an opponent. The Cincinnati Reds had 23 hits against Montreal
on June 29, 1971. ... Montreal's team ERA jumped to 5.29 from 4.15
in three games against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: LHP Brian Bohanon reluctantly accepted a demotion to
the bullpen. ''I didn't sign here to be a reliever,'' said Bohanon,
who is in the second year of a three-year, $9 million contract. ''I
signed here to be a starter. Come on. You didn't expect me to be
happy, did you?'' Bohanon, who is 0-3 with a 9.67 ERA. ... RHP
Jerry Dipoto had surgery to repair a bulging disk below his neck
and will miss the rest of the season. ... C Scott Servais, who
missed 14 games with a sprained right ankle, was activated from the
DL and went 2-for-5 in his first game since April 17. He was
injured while stepping on a ball during batting practice and his
teammates welcomed him back with a sign on the batting cage that
said: ''DANGER. Watch your step!'' The sign also had a sketch of a
foot stepping on a ball. ... Colorado set a club record by scoring
16 runs without a homer. The previous high was 14 runs April 16
against St. Louis. ... OF Tom Goodwin left the game in the fifth
inning with a strained left adductor muscle. His status is
uncertain for Friday's game at San Francisco.
Mets-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: RHP Bobby Jones threw 82 pitches in a three-inning
simulated game Tuesday and is expected to make a rehabilitation
start Sunday for Triple-A Norfolk. The Mets do not have a timetable
for his return. ... Manager Bobby Valentine said OF Darryl
Hamilton, who will have surgery on the big toe on his left foot
within the next week, will be sidelined for about a month. ... C
Mike Piazza, who has missed the last five starts with a bruised
right wrist and hyperextended right elbow, is expected to return to
the starting lineup Thursday against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Wednesday's game was one of two 4:05 p.m. PDT
starts this season at Pacific Bell Park. The team is experimenting
with the new starting time to see if it will appeal to business
people who want to come to the game after work. Since almost all
games at the new stadium are sold out this season, it's a move with
the future in mind. ... Because of the 4:05 p.m. start and
complaints by players of glare coming off the bleachers in center
field, workers painted the aluminum benches and a stairway green
before the game. ... OF Ellis Burks, who has missed the last five
starts with a slight strain to his left quadriceps, is expected to
return to the Giants' lineup this weekend.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The coronation of the Los Angeles
Lakers is not going exactly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the NBA with a 67-15 record and comfortably
winning the first two games of their best-of-five playoff series
against the Kings, the Lakers expected to leave Sacramento with a
few days to relax before the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they headed home needing a victory Friday night to
advance. And with Shaquille O'Neal struggling with his shooting,
the once invincible Lakers -- who had winning streaks of 19, 16 and
11 games this season -- seem flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to dig deeper and play my game,'' said O'Neal,
18-for-44 from the field in the last two games after shooting 63
percent in the first two games. ''As a team, we didn't shoot
well.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing a second straight game in Sacramento, the Lakers
will be forced to focus on the Kings while the Phoenix Suns -- who
dethroned the San Antonio Spurs in the first round and await the
Lakers-Kings winner-- can look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The conference semifinals begin Sunday in Los Angeles if the
Lakers win Friday night or in Phoenix if the Kings win.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want to be in this situation,'' said Lakers guard
Glen Rice, whose team never lost three straight during the regular
season. ''Now we're in it, and we have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber had 23 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists, seven
blocks and four steals Tuesday night as the Kings beat the Lakers
101-88 to even the series at 2-2. Los Angeles never led in the
game, and got no closer than six points in the fourth quarter
</P>
<P>
   Jon Barry had 17 points, Tony Delk had 12 and Predrag Stojakovic
11 as the Sacramento backups, who call themselves the ''Bench
Mob,'' outscored the Lakers' reserves 42-8 and provided the
decisive spark for the second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   While Sacramento point guard Jason Williams went 1-for-8 from
the field and was benched for nearly the entire fourth quarter for
the second straight game, the Kings' reserves outscored their Los
Angeles counterparts 20-5 in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our game is not our bench, that's their game,'' Lakers coach
Phil Jackson said. ''It's playoff basketball, it's a different type
of basketball, and we didn't pick up the intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had 32 points for the Lakers, O'Neal had 25 points
and 16 rebounds and Glen Rice had 17 points. But the rest of the
Los Angeles squad had 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know Shaq and Kobe are great players and they're going to
get their points,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman said. ''We kept Rice
around his average and the other players didn't hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The normally unflappable Jackson looked pained at times, and his
brow was covered with sweat. A sign in the crowd mocked ''Zen
Schmen,'' referring to Jackson's sometimes mystical approach to
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento is trying to become the 13th team to come back from
trailing 2-0 to win a series. No team has done it since the Houston
Rockets in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers began preparations for Game 5 by meeting and watching
film Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they're stunned, I think what they are is angry,
there's frustration,'' Jackson said afterward. ''They've used their
talent well during the year. There's no reason to break from that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Lakers' confidence, Jackson said, ''It's got to
be shaky. We're pretty human. That's what shakes teams into action
is when they get anxious about surviving. That's what this is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers said Sacramento benefitted from referees' calls -- or
lack of calls -- on its home court, and they hope that will be
reversed when the series moves back to Los Angeles. They accused
the Kings of playing an illegal zone defense around O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the aggressive defenses they got away with here on
their home court, hopefully they won't get away with that on our
court,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he expects the officiating to be different Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''You play at the level the referees let you compete at, and
that changes from game to game,'' he said. ''Now we have to go back
and see what this brings on our court, and see if the refereeing is
going to be the same style. It probably won't be. That's the
difference in basketball between home and away.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Jackson said his team ''failed dramatically'' in its
first playoff test on the road, he said that won't matter if the
Lakers can win in Los Angeles. The Lakers have home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team doesn't have to do anything but win home games to
win a championship,'' he said. ''We have to go out and enjoy
playing basketball again. We've played with much more weight on our
shoulders than we had to.''

<HEADLINE> MSU's 'Flintstones' Celebrate  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA R. MOSES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Waving green-and-white pompoms, hundreds
gathered Wednesday to cheer the Michigan State players who put
their hometown on the basketball map.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a wild ride,'' Spartans guard Charlie Bell said at
the homecoming celebration honoring him and national championship
teammates Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Flint Mayor Woodrow Stanley unveiled banners bearing their names
that will hang in the IMA Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''We salute you and we salute Michigan State University,''
Stanley said as a band played the school's fight song.
</P>
<P>
   The trio, known as the ''Flintstones,'' combined for 48 points,
14 assists and 12 rebounds as Michigan State beat Florida 89-76 on
April 3 to win the school's first national championship in 21
years.
</P>
<P>
   Spartans coach Tom Izzo was recognized as an honorary
''Flintstone'' in the Greater Flint Area Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo praised each player, saying ''These guys, you should be
proud. ... They worked harder than any players I've coached and
I've coached a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player also thanked his family and presented a bouquet of
flowers to his mother.

<HEADLINE> Senate budget committee scowls at budget cut for parks  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Members of the Senate budget committee
balked Wednesday at the Department of Environmental Protection's
plan to cut $4 million from its budget for maintaining state parks.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, $10.4 million of the department's $416 million budget
is allocated for maintenance projects at state parks.
</P>
<P>
   Department Commissioner Robert Shinn spoke of the cut during his
presentation to the committee on the department's spending plan.
Lawmakers are reviewing the various agencies to be funded in Gov.
Christie Whitman's $21.3 billion budget for the 2000-2001 fiscal
year beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Littell, R-Sussex, the committee chairman, reminded
Shinn that state parks need to be maintained before the department
embarks on any bold open-space preservation program to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are actively buying land, a lot of (it) has buildings on
it, and we can't take care of what we have,'' Littell said.
</P>
<P>
   Shinn acknowledged that many open-space acquisitions ''do
increase the responsibility for staffing and maintenance.'' He told
Littell he would discuss the park appropriation with Treasury
department officials, who design the overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Littell said either way, he will see to it himself by
proposing to amend Whitman's budget bill to replace the $4 million
cut and perhaps to add more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise, we should never buy another acre of land,'' Littell
said. ''It is frustrating. I thought we went all through this one
time (last year) and made it clear this was a priority of the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   If Littell succeeds, the Department of Environmental Protection
would still be short of the $16 million-per-year goal for annual
maintenance work recommended in a 1998 report by the Council on New
Jersey Outdoors, a panel Whitman created by Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   The report found a $160 million backlog of maintenance projects
over 10 years that left natural resources unused or underused, and
threatened historic structures with ruin, like the recently
demolished High Point tower in Sussex County. The historic tower
once provided a vantage of three states.
</P>
<P>
   ''How are we ever going to catch up,'' asked Littell.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel said park neglect
''has been a real disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I can't understand, at a time of record budget surpluses
... is that we're nickle-and-diming our parks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All six senators at the meeting raised the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''If every legislator is talking about it, I have to be
sensitive to it, aside from the need,'' Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Also during his presentation, Shinn said the department has made
progress in reducing air pollution, improving water quality in
lakes and streams, and formulating ambitious plans to regulate
pollution and development according to their effect on regional
watersheds.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Joins Actors' Strike  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra
and Tiger Woods are on the same team: They've joined a strike by TV
and radio commercial actors against the advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra canceled a Dunkin' Donuts commercial shoot scheduled
Thursday for Fenway Park in Boston, the Screen Actors Guild said.
On Tuesday, Woods refused to film a Nike commercial at the golfer's
home course near Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists,
which represent about 135,000 actors, authorized the strike that
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these people, that's their living. You've got to
respect that,'' Garciaparra said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts spokeswoman Jane Powell said Wednesday the
company supports Garciaparra. Nike has said it was a joint decision
by Woods and the company not to shoot the ad because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   William Daniels, SAG president and co-star of the ABC sitcom
''Boy Meets World,'' praised Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's hit a home run for us, and that's what we're seeing from
all of our members,'' Daniels said Wednesday. Union membership is
required for anyone who acts on TV or in movies, athletes included.
</P>
<P>
   The strike on behalf of mostly anonymous actors has also
received celebrity support from Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the
wrestler-turned-politician who remains a guild member.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Chicago on Wednesday, Ventura came across a
group of about 100 union protesters and asked reporters to step
aside so he could shake hands with the group. As he left, the
protesters chanted, ''Jesse, you're a member,'' and Ventura
responded with a fist raised in salute.
</P>
<P>
   But Ira Shepard, a Washington lawyer negotiating on behalf of
the advertisers, said the union's support is not across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials were being filmed nationwide with both union and
nonunion actors who weren't observing the walkout, Shepard said. He
declined to identify any ad agencies or clients because, he said,
that could expose them to the risk of union disruption.
</P>
<P>
   The guilds have vowed to picket filming locations during the
strike, which both sides have said could be protracted. A 1988
actors' strike lasted three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the pay structure for commercials. Actors get a
minimum of about $478 for a day's work and also get
''pay-per-play'' residuals of roughly $50 to $120 each time a spot
airs on network television.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cable TV commercials, performers receive only a
flat fee of $1,000 or less for each 13-week, unlimited run. With
two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors are
demanding that pay-per-play be extended to cable.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers want to extend the flat fee from cable to the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, advertising industry representatives filed unfair
labor practice charges against the unions with the National Labor
Relations Board. The filing claims SAG and AFTRA are threatening to
permanently ban actors who cross picket lines from the union.
</P>
<P>
   The NLRB filing is groundless and without merit, the unions
responded.

<HEADLINE> Kan. Athlete Reports Sexual Battery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Police are investigating a University of
Kansas soccer player's report that she was fondled, spanked and
taunted by two Kansas football players.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said Kansas football coach Terry Allen discouraged her
from telling police she had been sexually attacked outside a
Lawrence night club Feb. 27. No charges have been filed and the
players have not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The woman went to the police April 26, two months after the
alleged battery. Police made the report public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. George Wheeler said officers were investigating but
that neither football player had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The woman didn't immediately go to police about the incident,
she said, because Allen promised he would punish the players in an
''appropriate way'' if she didn't press charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only punishment they got was they had to run stairs at the
stadium one day,'' she said Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Allen said Wednesday that he told the woman he would support her
if she reported the incident to police, and that he would handle it
with the two players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not, in any way, trying to make a deal with the
student-athlete for her not to report this matter to the police,''
Allen said. ''The actions that I have taken related to this
incident are not limited to what has been reported by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the players would be dismissed from the team if
convicted of a crime.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Go On 'Millionaire'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Do Drew Carey and Rosie O'Donnell sweat like
regular folks when confronted with big-money questions on ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, though Carey admitted he was nervous. What was more
important to ABC was the record-breaking number of people watching
this week to see how celebrities perform in the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's first celebrity edition of ''Millionaire'' drew 35.8
million viewers, the most ever to watch the game show, even though
3.5 million Time Warner subscribers were unable to get it on cable
because of the company's dispute with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Indications from sample markets are that Tuesday's edition did
even better, though final Nielsen Media Research numbers weren't
in. For the first time, ''Millionaire'' had more viewers than all
of the competing shows on CBS, NBC, Fox, UPN and the WB combined,
said Marc Berman, an analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''The show is unbelievable,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was the big winner the first two nights, earning $500,000
for his charity, the Ohio Library Foundation. He declined a chance
to risk his winnings on the $1 million question: Which football
star was the first to film a commercial for Disney World? The
answer: Phil Simms.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, the show's most vocal celebrity backer, matched Carey
by picking up a $500,000 check for her charity, the For All Kids
Foundation, on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   She walked a high wire, correctly guessing that Agnes de Mille
was the choreographer for ''Oklahoma,'' that the Fields Medal
honored excellence in mathematics and that Beethoven planned to
dedicated his Third Symphony to Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with the million-dollar question -- about what degree
playwright Anton Chekhov earned at the University of Moscow -- she
decided to pass because she didn't know the answer was medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I could risk it,'' she said, ''because that's
too much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor David Duchovny blew his chance to win $500,000 the night
before by missing a movie question, and was knocked down to
$32,000. Each of the celebrities appearing is guaranteed at least
$32,000 in winnings for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the wave of popularity, ABC scheduled 17 nights of ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' for the 24 nights in May's ratings
sweeps. This week it added No. 18, a special behind-the-scenes peek
at making the show, and audaciously scheduled it for May 18
opposite the season finale of ''ER.''
</P>
<P>
   When first approached about doing a celebrity ''Millionaire''
series, executive producer Michael Davies questioned whether it
would work. He believes one reason the show is so appealing is the
notion that any average American could win.
</P>
<P>
   Davies went ahead with the celebrities because, with the show on
at least three nights a week, he needed something to keep things
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ''What was very clear when we started to book the show was the
enthusiasm the celebrities that said yes had for the program,'' he
said. ''I knew that enthusiasm would be infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   He is planning a second celebrity week for November. O'Donnell
is almost certain to be back, and probably Regis Philbin
impersonator Dana Carvey will, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has also suggested a special ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' with contestants who already are millionaires, he
said. It would be for charity.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Millionaire'' so far impervious to oversaturation, Davies
said he isn't concerned that the show needs a rest to keep interest
up. He is more worried about his own rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this show is still a very, very powerful brand, and I
think these last few nights have proven it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers rush toward midnight deadline  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Rushing toward a midnight deadline, the
General Assembly on Wednesday passed a $12.3 billion budget that
includes $171 million in new tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved a $270 million bonding package that
includes money for the University of Connecticut and the state's
public university system. It passed the Senate on a unanimous vote,
and the House on a 138-12 vote after an hour of debate.
</P>
<P>
   The tax and spending plan caps a 12-week legislative session
that focused on governmental reform, and a major riverfront
development for the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature passed bills to abolish the state's sheriff
system, revamp the treasurer's office and reform Connecticut's
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland signed the sheriff and treasurer reform
bills, but has not said whether he will make the campaign finance
measure law.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has already signed legislation to use $455 million
of state money to build Adriaen's Landing in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes a 700-room hotel, a convention center,
entertainment and retail space and nearly 400 housing units. Also
planned is a $90 million stadium in East Hartford for the
University of Connecticut. The development is expected to create
about 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new state budget, motorists will get a 7-cent
reduction in the gas tax and shoppers will have more money in their
pockets after buying clothes.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Wednesday afternoon, it did not look like parents who
send their children to private elementary and secondary schools
would get the tuition tax credit that Gov. John G. Rowland was
pushing for. Leading Democratic lawmakers blocked the $500 credits
from the budget, and Republicans had not tacked the measure on a
separate bill.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes $75 million in tax breaks to the
state's hospitals and $54 million in tax cuts for industry, of
which $15 million goes to Bristol-based ESPN. The sports
broadcasting giant is planning a $500 million expansion of its
world headquarters that could mean up to 1,000 new jobs in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Warburg Dillon Read, the former Swiss Bank based in Stamford, is
getting $157 million in loans and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the major tax breaks, the Legislature showed it's
sweet side to candy lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, the Senate slipped in a $200,000 tax
exemption for items sold through vending machines for 50 cents or
less, such as gum balls.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Belden, R-Shelton, called the cut ''frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is $200,000 worth of revenue that disappears, that we
won't have to spend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anne McDonald, D-Stamford, said there wasn't enough time
left to whittle the so-called ''rat'' out of the tax package.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you have to swallow hard and accept something you
really don't like,'' she said. ''We cannot at this time send this
whole package back to the senate over gum ball machines.''
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 billion budget is about $150 million more than what
the Legislature agreed to spend last year for the 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $40 million of the increase is going to new programs; the
rest is needed to make inflation adjustments and cover agencies and
programs running in the red.
</P>
<P>
   About $3 million is slated for beefing up the state's three
juvenile detention facilities in Bridgeport, Hartford and New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Another $4.4 million is earmarked to ease prison overcrowding by
creating more treatment programs. Since last year, 484 Connecticut
inmates have been transferred to a Virginia prison to thin the
state's prison population.
</P>
<P>
   About $1.5 million is being used to expand eligibility
requirement for the state's ConnPACE prescription drug program.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the budget expenditures, lawmakers doled out $250 of
the state's surplus money.
</P>
<P>
   About $20 million of that is earmarked for a bailout of
deficit-plagued University of Connecticut Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another $34 million of the surplus would be given to towns in
one-shot grants. Municipalities would be able to decide how best to
use the grant money, which ranges from $22,000 for Union to $3.3
million for New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus also will sink $43 million into school construction
and $10 million into getting classrooms wired for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also has a Democratic-backed measure that pushes the
clothing tax exemption from $50 to $75. In return, the GOP won a
one week-long sales tax exemption on clothing priced up to $300.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax cut is expected to save $85 to $140 a year for a
family that drives 30,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 billion budget stays about $51 million under the
state's mandatory spending cap. But expenditure of the surplus
breaks the spending cap by about $200 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Kicks Off Education Tour  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- The students of Audubon Elementary are
examples of some of President Clinton's favorite education maxims --
chief among them that poor children can learn just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ''Income is not destiny,'' Clinton said Wednesday after a tour
of the school in an agricultural patch of western Kentucky where
two-thirds of the students qualify for free or subsidized school
lunches. It was the start of two days of visits to public schools
where students are beating long odds.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced a new federal report-card system for
low-performing schools. The Education Department will compile a
list of such schools and what they are doing to improve, and teams
of federal experts will try to help, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   At Audubon, teacher Crystal Davidson was hired through a federal
program to reduce class size, which studies show greatly improves
student performance. She told the president she is known at school
as a ''Clinton teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The class-size program, which has won some support in Congress,
helps local school districts subsidize the hiring of new teachers,
although it often does not cover the entire cost.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to hire 100,000 new teachers nationwide this way,
as well as building or modernizing 6,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon was among the state's worst in 1994. It now ranks 18th
in the state in overall student performance and second statewide in
writing skills.
</P>
<P>
   The school was Clinton's first stop on a two-day tour of
education success stories in the Midwest. Each school exemplifies a
different component of Clinton's plan to lower class sizes,
modernize schools and increase community and parental involvement
in public education.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can have the kind of educational excellence we need for
every child in the country if people will take the basic things you
have done here and do them,'' Clinton said at Audubon, where
federal dollars helped reduce the class size to between 15 and 22
students.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Clinton visited a Davenport, Iowa, high school
built in the early 1900s that soon will get high-tech
communications and science equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want every single school in America to be a school of the
future,'' Clinton told the Central High students. ''You need it,
you deserve it and if Congress will pass my proposals, you will get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton planned stops at a public charter school in
St. Paul, Minn., and an elementary school in Columbus, Ohio, where
improvements are just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is also meant to tweak congressional Republicans who
have been cool to many of his education plans. Last month, both the
House and Senate approved a $1.83 trillion package that includes
large tax cuts and reductions in many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House backed a gradual increase in federal aid
to special education from $5 billion this year to $25 billion in
2010. But Senate Republicans used their majority to advance a GOP
measure that would give states more discretion in their use of
federal funds. At the same time, they rejected a Democratic
alternative would have targeted for more teachers and smaller
classes.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP measure also would provide vouchers for poor families to
finance private or parochial school if they want to take their
children out of a failing public school. Clinton advocates national
standards and charter schools, which are public schools created by
parents and teachers and run with exemptions from many state laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee criticized Clinton's agenda as
a formula for centralizing federal control over local schools and a
concession to teacher unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton and Al Gore are so beholden to partisan teachers'
bosses that they refuse to take control, or money, out of
Washington,'' RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly enjoyed a made-for-the-cameras reading session
Wednesday with Davidson's third- and fourth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the class breezed through passages of the E.B. White
classic, ''Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Others followed along with their fingers as they read, or
stumbled a bit over tough words such as ''exertions.'' That,
Clinton told them, ''is a fancy word for 'effort.'''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 4, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Jose Offerman and Trot Nixon hit consecutive
doubles to break an eighth-inning tie on Wednesday night and lead
the Boston Red Sox to a 4-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the first time after being benched for two games,
Offerman snapped an 0-for-15 slump with a double that eluded first
baseman Tony Clark when it took a bad hop off the bag. Right
fielder Wendell Magee also had trouble: a fan appeared to throw a
beverage at him as he went to the wall to field it.
</P>
<P>
   There was more interference when a fan reached over the wall to
catch Nixon's fly ball down the right-field line, giving him a
ground-rule double and scoring Offerman. Nixon took third on Brian
Daubach's groundout and scored to make it 4-2 when Nomar
Garciaparra beat out an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe (2-0) earned the victory with two perfect innings of
relief, and Jeff Weaver (0-4) took the loss despite taking a
four-hitter into the eighth. Weaver allowed four runs and six hits,
striking out three and walking four in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Pete Schourek allowed two runs and six hits in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit took a 1-0 lead when Shane Halter doubled to lead off
the game and scored on Juan Encarnacion's base hit. The single
extended Encarnacion's hitting streak to 15 games; he is 5-for-9
against Schourek in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 2-1 when Garciaparra walked and Mike Stanley
homered -- his fourth in his last five games. The Tigers tied it on
Tony Clark's solo homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pedro Martinez was suspended for five games and fined for
plunking Roberto Alomar on Sunday. Martinez will appeal the
suspension, and he will be able to pitch until the appeal is heard.
... The Tigers were without manager Phil Garner and 3B Dean Palmer,
who are serving eight-game suspensions for an April 22 brawl in
Chicago. ... After not facing a left-handed starter in their first
12 games, Detroit has faced six in its last 13 games.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuke Treaty Changes Denounced  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The former U.S. government official who
leaked the Pentagon Papers sharply criticized proposed U.S. changes
to the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and warned Wednesday that it
would put the world in danger.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. efforts to change the treaty to build a limited missile
defense would encourage an arms race with Russia at a time when the
former Soviet Union's nuclear forces are ''vulnerable and
accident-prone,'' Daniel Ellsberg told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at the United Nations on Wednesday where meetings were
continuing on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Joined by the
mayor of Hiroshima and the deputy mayor of Nagasaki, Ellsberg said
current discussions on weapons programs demonstrated that the world
had forgotten lessons learned after the atomic bombings of the two
Japanese cities in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the current policies of my country, and other weapons
states, there is no assurance whatever that the crime and error
will not be repeated,'' said Ellsberg, a former U.S. nuclear war
planner.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants Russia to clear a legal path for a
limited missile defense system to shield the United States from an
attack from ''rogue'' states such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The move would require modifying the 1972 U.S.-Soviet
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Russia so far has refused, warning
that changes could touch off an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsberg said the changes would encourage Russia to resume
stockpiling weapons and return missile warheads to a state of
alert.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is considering a limited missile defense, but
many conservative Republicans in the U.S. Congress would go further
by scrapping the pact and proceeding with a space-based weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to advance a domestic political agenda ... the U.S.
is encouraging the Russians to remain on and advance a
launch-on-warning system,'' Ellsberg said, explaining that a new
American program would force Russia to devise new deterrents.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the U.N. conference to establish a strong disarmament
agenda over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsberg joined the U.S. Defense Department in 1964 and then
worked for the State Department. Outraged by U.S. policies in
Vietnam, he copied a classified 47-volume study of the U.S. role in
Indochina and gave it to The New York Times, which published the
so-called Pentagon Papers in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ellsberg, who is based in Washington, has been
an activist against nuclear proliferation.

<HEADLINE> World Runner en Route to Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The British man trying to become the
first person to run the length of each of the Earth's continents
left the Venezuelan capital Wednesday for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-month rest in Caracas, during which he acquired a
new girlfriend and stocked up on new clothes and camera equipment,
33-year-old Robert Garside took off from a midtown square for what
he expects to be an eight-day journey to the Colombian border.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of his time in Caracas trying to get safety
assurances from armed groups in Colombia, where a Russian cyclist
on a similar round-the-world mission was murdered four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably not going to get any armed protection,'' he told
The Associated Press from a cell phone. ''I'm going to keep it nice
and simple. Just smile and be friendly because I don't know what
else is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Garside, who calls himself The Running Man on his Web site, has
already run across Australia, Asia and Europe and the length of
South America in a three-year journey that has taken him more than
20,000 miles and earned him the world record in long-distance
running.
</P>
<P>
   To complete his goal, Garside must still run across North
America, Africa and Antarctica. He aims to accomplish that within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   But to get to Central America, he must first run through
northern Colombia, where leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitary
death squads and drug runners control huge swaths of territory.
</P>
<P>
   Garside said he has received two assurances by telephone from
rebels of Colombia's National Liberation Army that he would be safe
in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since setting off from set London's Piccadilly Circus of Dec. 7,
1996, the former psychology student has dodged bullets in Russia,
got robbed in Brazil, collapsed from heat exhaustion in Australia
and went to jail in China.
</P>
<P>
   While running, Garside films himself every 90 minutes or so to
prove he's actually running, and also collects receipts and witness
statements along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Garside broke the world long-distance running record in
September 1998 in Australia, where he eclipsed the old mark of
11,134 miles held by American Sarah Lovington-Fulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a 15-pound backpack, Garside runs to the music of
Pavarotti, Beethoven, Dire Straits and Enya.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid being classified as a walker, he must maintain an
average speed of 6 mph.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 5, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Paul Byrd returned to All-Star form -- for
one night at least.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd allowed three hits in seven innings and Bobby Abreu hit a
two-run double as the struggling Phillies snapped a four-game
losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Philadelphia's second win in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd (1-2), who lowered his ERA from 10.19 to 7.66, struck out
four, walked one and allowed one run. Eddie Taubensee got the only
hits off Byrd, including a seventh-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd left the game with a strained right groin. Wayne Gomes
pitched the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd has struggled since last year's All-Star break. He was 4-9
since then with a 6.45 ERA entering Wednesday's game. He went 11-5
with a 3.94 ERA before the break and was picked as an All-Star for
the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 2-0 lead off Steve Parris (1-4) in the
fourth with help from Cincinnati's defense. Abreu led off with a
walk and Scott Rolen singled to put runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Both runners scored when second baseman Pokey Reese made an
errant throw to shortstop Gookie Dawkins on a grounder by Rico
Brogna. It was the fifth error for Reese, who won a Gold Glove last
season after committing just seven errors.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd started a two-run fifth with a walk. He advanced to second
on a one-out single by Ron Gant and Abreu made it 4-0 with a double
off the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Parris allowed four runs -- three earned -- and seven hits in five
innings. He struck out four and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee, who doubled in the second and singled in the fifth,
made it 4-1 with a two-out solo homer to right in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The hit came after a fan ran on the field and slid headfirst
into second base. It was the second straight night a fan ran on the
field at Veterans Stadium. In Tuesday's game, a fan shook Ken
Griffey Jr.'s hand and did a dance before falling to his knees and
surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey went 0-for-4 Wednesday as his average fell to .200.
After Cincinnati cut it to 5-2 in the eighth with an unearned run,
Griffey grounded into an inning-ending double play with runners at
the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Phillies have struggled, Mike Lieberthal and
Brogna made a play in the second inning reminiscent of the team's
glory days.
</P>
<P>
   The pair converged on a foul pop by Dante Bichette and the ball
squirted out of Lieberthal's glove and into Brogna's as Lieberthal
fell into the Phillies dugout and knocked over a television camera.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies catcher Bob Boone and first baseman Pete Rose made a
similar play in the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 1980 World Series
against Kansas City. The Phillies beat the Royals in six games to
win the only championship in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reliever Amaury Telemaco accepted his assignment to
Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre rather than opting for free agency.
He was designated Saturday to make room for Curt Schilling. ...
Parris was originally drafted by the Phillies in the fifth round of
the 1989 June draft. ... Arias broke an 0-for-27 slump with a
single in the third. ... Taubensee is now 5-for-9 off Byrd. ...
Injured reliever Jeff Brantley pitched one inning at Triple-A
Scranton Wilkes-Barre. He allowed one hit and no runs.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Use Laser To Defend Border  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will deploy a laser shield developed
with U.S. technology to shoot down rockets fired by guerrillas
after Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon, the Defense
Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $250 million defense system will be installed later this
year after tests are completed in the United States and Israel,
said ministry spokesman Dan Weinreich.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland-based TRW company, which is building the THEL or
Tactical High Energy Laser, called it the world's first laser-based
air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in northern Israel have expressed concern they will be
the targets of guerrilla attacks when Israel withdraws from the
area it has occupied since 1982 to prevent cross-border attacks.
Anti-Israeli militias have frequently used Katyusha rockets to
attack Israeli communities.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day that Israeli warplanes
fired missiles near the home of a guerrilla commander in southern
Lebanon, slightly wounding his mother and five other civilians,
Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials reported that a rocket struck the car of Abbas
Hallal, a local commander of the Amal guerrilla group, that was
parked next to his house on the outskirts of Habboush village. It
was not clear where Hallal was at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's army spokesman's office in Jerusalem said that during
an air raid on guerrilla targets, a bomb, not a rocket,
accidentally struck the outskirts of the village, wounding a number
of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The army said that it makes every effort to avoid hitting
civilians, and that it was investigating Wednesday's incident.
</P>
<P>
   Israel TV said an airman in a fighter plane carrying out a
routine airstrike accidentally hit a lever that released a bomb,
which exploded in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Amal, a pro-Syrian Shiite Muslim group, and another group,
Hezbollah, are waging a campaign to oust Israeli occupation troops
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said he would withdraw
troops by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Lebanon have said they will not prevent Lebanese
guerrillas from attacking Israel after the withdrawal unless it is
part of an overall peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chances for security arrangements between the sides have
dwindled since peace talks between Israel and Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon, broke off in January.
</P>
<P>
   Weinreich said the THEL system includes radar and a laser system
that strikes at Katyusha rockets, tube-launched artillery used
against ground targets.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction Wednesday night from U.S. officials. A
Pentagon spokesman declined to comment and a State Department
spokeswoman said she knew nothing about it.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1996, President Clinton pledged to help Israel develop
a THEL system to defend its ''northern cities from the threat posed
by Katyusha and other short-range rockets,'' according to the U.S.
Army Space and Missile Defense Command's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said the system is expected to be ready for shipment to
Israel by October. Several tests must first be performed, including
an initial attempt to shoot down a Katyusha rocket over the White
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The laser shield, composed of powerful laser beams that can
pinpoint moving targets, would help Israel defend the border
without re-entering Lebanon. Barak has told the army that after the
withdrawal, troops must not violate Lebanese sovereignty on land,
sea or in the air, military officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak has also said Israel would retaliate harshly for any
attacks after the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army will stand cocked and ready to inflict a painful
blow, if necessary, against anyone who tries to harm us,'' Barak
said Wednesday, reiterating that the ''tragedy in Lebanon'' would
end in less than two months, when the pullout occurs.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Man Found Bound, Robbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) -- A man and a woman bound a disabled man,
hoisted him over his bed and then ransacked his apartment and stole
his rent money, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old man was found dangling over his bed Tuesday
morning, 10 hours after he was placed there by the robbers the
night before. He did not suffer serious injuries. His identity was
not released.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who has no legs, told police his usual visiting nurse
could not come to his apartment to help him from his wheelchair and
into his bed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he met a woman in a restaurant who told him she was a
health aide and would assist him. The man let the woman in, who
then let in her accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   The couple bound the victim's hands, and used a hoist, normally
used to help him out of his wheelchair, to lift him into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The couple ransacked his apartment and took money he had
withdrawn from the bank for his rent. Police were searching for the
robbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's stooping to a pretty low level, that's for sure,'' said
Detective Lt. William Conlon.

gave Columbus a 2-1 victory over D.C. United on Wednesday night,
the Crew's first ever victory in Washington.

<HEADLINE> NYC Shooting Victim's Family To Sue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Family members of a man shot by police said
Wednesday they intend to sue Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the police
commissioner and the police officer who killed him for $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorismond's relatives say they will sue because the city
and the police violated Dorismond's civil rights, said their
attorney, Johnnie Cochran. They are also suing for wrongful death
and pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, was fatally shot by an undercover police
detective during a drug buy-and-bust operation in Manhattan on
March 16, making him the fourth unarmed black man fatally shot by
police in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   His death sparked outrage among minorities, especially when
Giuliani authorized the commissioner to release Dorismond's sealed
juvenile record just hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the notice of claim filed Wednesday, the family alleges that
Dorismond was targeted by police because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD officials declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Williams Visits Team Before Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- On the eve of surgery to repair an aneurysm
near his right armpit, pitcher Woody Williams came to the ballpark,
put on his uniform, hung out around the batting cage and sat in the
dugout with his San Diego Padres teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He figured it was the least he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all the support they showed last night and the phone
calls and thoughts and prayers that had been given on their part, I
just wanted to come and show my support back to them,'' Williams
said Wednesday before the Padres played the Florida Marlins. ''It's
hard for me to stay away. It was real hard watching the game on TV
last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had gone home from the hospital on Tuesday after an
angiogram revealed the aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   The most emotional part for Williams was seeing his jersey
hanging in the dugout, placed there by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea that I meant so much to so many people. It made
me feel good,'' said Williams, who pitched 8 1-3 innings in a loss
to Florida on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he received a phone message from catcher Carlos
Hernandez that was so touching that he's not going to erase it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to make him feel better because I know in this
time, he needs that,'' said Hernandez, who missed all of 1999 after
rupturing his left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will have surgery Thursday morning and could be
sidelined for up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres say Williams' situation is similar to when New York
Yankees pitcher David Cone had an aneurysm in his right shoulder in
1996, sidelining him for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Cone and Williams were teammates in Toronto, and Cone called
Williams on Tuesday while he was still at the hospital, to
encourage him. Williams said he was having a hard time dealing with
the news when he got the call.
</P>
<P>
   ''When David called me, it kind of made me realize that
everything's going to be OK,'' Williams said. ''I just hope that
I'm no worse off than he was. I'm very positive and optimistic that
I'll be back. It may not be this year, it may be. I'm going to do
everything I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had performed tests during the weekend, one of which
showed a small blood clot had reached Williams' right forearm.
Another test showed that the circulation in his hand was fine, and
the team's medical staff felt any risk from him pitching Monday
night was relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was disheartened when he heard he had an
aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time, they say if I kept pitching, there's a
chance I could have lost my hand. My family's everything to me and
I'm just thankful they caught it when they did. Regardless of what
happens on the field, or if I ever get back, I can still play with
my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his wrist was sore and a little red after his
first start on April 5, and that his fingers started getting numb
and cold during his second start. He felt better during his third
start. ''The last three were pretty hard to get through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams felt the symptoms only when he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said everytime I raise my arm up, the aneurysm would act
kind of like a tube of toothpaste. Everytime I raised my arm it
would squeeze another drop out (of clotted blood) and it would go
down to my wrist.''

<HEADLINE> Osprey Aircraft Flights To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps' top general is ready to give
the go-ahead to resume flying the MV-22 Osprey aircraft, nearly one
month after one crashed in Arizona, killing 19 Marines, an official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines planned to announced on Thursday that Gen. James
Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, has cleared the fleet of
Osprey hybrid helicopter-airplanes to return to the air, according
to a defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The April 8 crash remains under investigation, the official
said. It was the Marines' deadliest air crash since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's flight data recorder was recovered intact several
days after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Flights of the four remaining production-model Ospreys were
temporarily halted immediately after the accident at Marana, Ariz.,
as a gesture of sympathy for the families of the 19 Marines killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones decided to allow the Ospreys to resume flying because
crash investigators have ruled out the failure of any of the
aircraft's major mechanical systems, the official said. The exact
cause of the crash remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter but rotates its
propellers for fixed-wing flight. The aircraft is built by Bell
Helicopter Textron and Boeing Co.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who charmed New Yorkers with his wit
and warmth while using his opposition to abortion and homosexuality to make
headlines and chastise politicians, died tonight. He was 80. O'Connor had been
ailing since he underwent brain surgery last summer. He frequently missed Mass
and made his last public appearance at St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 5, when
he did not lead the service but spoke briefly to parishioners. He traveled to
Italy for a final visit to the pope in February.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Fuels Disney Earnings  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Increased revenue from the ABC Television
Network helped boost earnings by 31 percent at the Walt Disney Co.	   Profits
generated by television and cable programming as well as
its theme parks fueled the company's profitable quarter, making up
for disappointing results from its film studio and consumer
products divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Disney reported net income for the second quarter ended March 31
of $369 million or 18 cents per share, compared with $281 million,
or 13 cents per share, for the same quarter last year. The results
handily beat the 14 cents per share expected by stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison was reported on a pro forma basis, as if the
company had created its Go.com subsidiary and sold Fairchild
Publications at the beginning of fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Disney officials happily reported that hit game show ''Who Wants
to be a Millionaire'' marked an all-time ratings high Monday night
despite the fact that ABC was blocked out of Time Warner Cable
outlets in New York, Los Angeles and several other cities. The
network was taken off the cable system for more than a day after
talks broke down in a dispute over how much Disney should be paid
for its programming.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Iger, Disney's president, said the popular game show
hosted by Regis Philbin won its ratings victory, ''with one hand
tied around its back.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge surge in advertising on the network, due largely to the
game show, increased revenue at Disney's media networks division by
30 percent in the quarter, to $2.4 billion. Improved ratings for
its ''Good Morning America'' daytime show also contributed to the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The results were partially offset by rising costs at ESPN,
stemming from deals the network made to broadcast National Hockey
League and Major League Baseball games in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also made more money at its theme parks without opening a
single new attraction. Officials said attendance and spending was
up at the parks due to its yearlong Millennium Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from film and video operations increased by 4 percent
during the quarter, but operating income fell 97 percent because of
declines in home video sales and lackluster performance by Disney
films at the box office. Profits from its hit ''Toy Story 2'' were
more than offset by losses from such films as ''Mission to Mars''
and ''Bicentennial Man,'' Disney said.

<HEADLINE> 19 Dead in Algeria Highway Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Islamic insurgents opened fire on a bus
Wednesday, killing at least 19 people after the driver refused to
stop at a rebel roadblock near Algiers, according to area
residents.
</P>
<P>
   About 26 others were injured in the 5 a.m. attack on the road
between Blida and Medea, about 50 miles south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was the worst in recent months in Algeria, which
has been in the grip of an Islamic insurgency for the past eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   The residents told reporters that some 20 militants opened fire
on the bus when the refused an order to stop at a roadblock the
rebels had set up. The residents said the attackers set fire to the
bus before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   The Blida-Medea road is surrounded by mountains that provide
cover for armed groups, which use such roadblocks to rob travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurgency violence in Algeria has continued despite the effort
at national reconciliation by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who
offered partial amnesty to insurgents turning themselves in by Jan.
13.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have been killed since the insurgency
erupted after the army canceled legislative elections that a
now-banned Muslim fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation
Front, was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody attack came as a delegation from Amnesty
International began a 12-day visit to Algeria, the first since the
London-based human rights organization was expelled from the
country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty is one of four human rights and press advocacy groups
invited here in May and June by Bouteflika who is campaigning to
refurbish the image of his country.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation head, Roger Clark, said on arrival Tuesday that
the group's ''priority of priorities'' would be inquiring about
past massacres and the thousands of people who have disappeared
since the start of the violence. Questions had been raised in the
past about village massacres that occurred near police and army
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the violence, Algeria has systematically
shielded what is referred to here as the ''national tragedy'' from
the probings of outside observers, expelling groups and refusing or
limiting visas to foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Daily violence continues despite Bouteflika's effort at national
reconciliation through an offer of partial amnesty for insurgents
who have not killed, bombed or raped. He said some 6,000 insurgents
had turned themselves in at the expiration date on Jan. 13. It is
not known how many insurgents remain active.
</P>
<P>
   The radical Armed Islamic Group, blamed for most massacres, and
a smaller group that targets soldiers and police refused the
amnesty outright.
</P>
<P>
   The violence erupted after the army canceled legislative
elections that a now-banned Muslim fundamentalist party, the
Islamic Salvation Front, was poised to win.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Unveils First Television Ad  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled the
first TV commercial of her Senate campaign Wednesday and also threw
a jab back at conservative Pat Buchanan, who said she wasn't acting
much like a lady.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Buchanan dispute started Saturday when the first
lady told members of the New York wing of the Reform Party that she
wouldn't run on their ticket if Buchanan were the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan fired back Wednesday, telling the New York Daily News:
''I don't think that kind of inflammatory language comports with
being a first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the first lady ought to always try to be a lady even
if she falls short. She certainly did in this case,'' Buchanan
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the comments, Clinton said Buchanan ''has a
history of making prejudiced, anti-Semitic and intolerant
comments.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why I said last Saturday that I wouldn't run on a
ballot with him. I took the position that anyone who wants to
represent all of New York and all New Yorkers should be taking,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The comment was the closest Clinton came to criticizing her
Senate rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been
critical of Buchanan but stopped short of refusing to share the
party's ticket with him. Since the mayor announced last week he has
prostate cancer, Clinton has nearly eliminated criticism of him
during her appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester during a nationally televised town hall meeting,
Giuliani said Wednesday he would be disappointed if he had to drop
out of the race, but said he could make no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I very much want to do it,'' he said. ''I want to do the same
kinds of things for the entire state that I've done for the city of
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The town hall meeting was broadcast live on the MSNBC program
''Hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first TV ad paid for by her campaign focuses on her
career as a lawyer and the causes she has worked for, including
fighting child abuse and chairing the board of the Children's
Defense Fund. It doesn't mention Giuliani -- or her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never crossed my mind,'' she said when asked about not
involving the president.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also reiterated her disagreement with her
husband's administration over military exercises on Puerto Rico's
Vieques Island. She said she wanted a quick referendum by local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said a referendum should be held by 2002.
The first lady called for the Pentagon to continue negotiations
with protesters rather than forcing them off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Giuliani addressed speculation about a woman
pictured with him in the New York Post, which called her the
mayor's ''mystery brunch pal.'' Giuliani called the woman, Judith
Nathan, a ''very good friend'' whose privacy should be respected.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is rarely seen in public with his wife, actress Donna
Hanover. They have refused to answer questions about their
marriage.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Woman To Stay in Peruvian Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo
promised Wednesday that an American woman serving a life sentence
in a Peruvian prison for terrorism will not go free if he is
elected in the May 28 runoff vote.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Lori Berenson turned into a campaign issue last week
when Toledo said in New York that he planned to create an
independent judiciary and that a new trial for the 30-year-old New
York native could be possible if evidence is found that she was
denied due process.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Peru, television networks and newspapers aligned with
incumbent President Alberto Fujimori seized on the comment,
reporting that jailed leftist rebels could be set free if Toledo's
Peru Possible party comes to power.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Berenson's fate during a campaign stop in Arequipa,
465 miles southeast of Lima, Toledo responded by saying that if
he's elected ''no terrorist, independent of his nationality, will
get out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Berenson was convicted of treason by a hooded military judge on
Jan. 11, 1996, for helping to lead a thwarted assault on Peru's
Congress by leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels. She
has maintained her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has been widely credited with stemming leftist rebel
violence since he was first elected in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Toledo accused Fujimori's government of setting
a runoff election to coincide with Venezuela's May 28 presidential
vote to divert the international spotlight away from irregularities
and charges of electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old economist on Wednesday called for a two-week
postponement of the second round showdown, also scheduled for Mary
28, to allow sufficient time to implement the recommendations of
international observers to ensure a clean vote.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has threatened to pull out of the race unless ''effective
measures'' are taken to guard against any irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate received the majority required for victory in
the April 9 first-round election.
</P>
<P>
   Romulo Munoz Arce, one of five members of the election board,
ruled out postponing the runoff vote, saying the constitution
required the ballot be held within 30 days after final returns were
officially registered.
</P>
<P>
   Slow ballot counting and rampant computer glitches sparked
suspicions that Fujimori was in the process of rigging an
unprecedented third term victory, a charge he has denied.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised to improve its vote counting system
and Fujimori's campaign this week started direct negotiations with
Toledo's camp on terms for a debate between the candidates.

<HEADLINE> Officer Misspoke on Canada Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Wednesday a senior
U.S. military officer misspoke when he said the United States might
choose, under certain circumstances, not to shoot down a missile
targeted at a Canadian city.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Herbert Browne, deputy commander of U.S. Space
Command, said Tuesday the United States might exercise that option
if Canada chooses not to take part in the proposed U.S. missile
defense project.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the remarks
attributed to Browne do not reflect official policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a close and a long-standing defense relationship
with Canada that includes both NORAD and NATO,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   NORAD is the joint U.S.-Canadian North American air defense
command.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not made a decision on missile defenses,
and Canada has not commented on a possible U.S. deployment.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for reporters on his command's role in national
missile defense, Browne said that if U.S. satellites detected a
hostile missile headed for Ottawa, ''we would have absolutely no
obligation to defend'' the Canadian capital, unless Canada was a
participant in the anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later to elaborate, Browne raised the theoretical
possibility that an attacker might shoot missiles first at Ottawa
and then at Detroit or another U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States expended its available missile interceptors
protecting Ottawa and was left with none to defend Detroit, the
American public would say ''that makes absolutely no sense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said that in many cases, hostile missiles would be
engaged over Canadian airspace even if they were aimed at American
rather than Canadian targets.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said Canada should not only participate in the
anti-missile project but contribute to it as well. He said Canada
could contribute by allowing the United States to put a
high-powered radar somewhere in eastern Canada to help track
incoming missiles.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 3, Devils 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Don't write off the Toronto Maple
Leafs just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Kaberle scored on a slap shot with 1:35 to play and Curtis
Joseph had 34 saves as the Maple Leafs beat the New Jersey Devils
3-2 to even their Eastern Conference semifinal series 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas Hoglund and Darcy Tucker also scored as the Maple Leafs
rebounded from a 5-1 embarrassment on Monday and a demoralizing
tying goal by Claude Lemieux late in the third period to tie the
best-of-seven series. Game 5 is Saturday night at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez, set up by Lemieux, had the other goal for New
Jersey, which lost for only the second time in eight postseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kaberle's first goal of the playoffs came on his second good
chance. His backhander from the left circle was stopped but when
Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer tried to clear the puck it came
back to Kaberle. His shot from above the circle beat Martin
Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux tied it with 5:46 to go on a somewhat fluky goal. Joseph
could not control Lemieux's slap shot on a 2-on-1 break and the
puck fell at the goalie's feet. Lemieux poked the puck while
sitting on his rear end but replays seemed to show Joseph may have
kicked it in with his skate.
</P>
<P>
   Either way it counted, but it wasn't enough to prevent Toronto
from regaining home-ice advantage in what is now a best-of-three
series.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto entered the third period with a 2-1 lead with all the
goals coming in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who scored the game winner in Game 1, almost had a
second. The Maple Leafs did a great job of keeping the puck in the
Devils zone. Igor Korolev won a battle along the left boards with
Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Berezin got the loose puck in the
circle. He skated toward Brodeur and sent a cross-ice pass that
Tucker let go through his legs before taking the puck and
backhanding just over the Brodeur's glove as he lay in the crease
at 16:02.
</P>
<P>
   Hoglund tied made it 1-1, taking advantage of a rare lapse in
the Devils' defense and a big hole between Brodeur's pads. Steve
Thomas and Mats Sundin made quick passes that allowed Hoglund to
split defensemen Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski, and he ripped a
rolling puck through the five-hole.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto was a little shaky coming into the game, and the start
didn't bode well for them.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the last two, including a 5-1 embarrassment on
Monday night, the Maple Leafs fell behind 1-0 less than two minutes
in.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker picked up a foolish penalty for cross-checking John
Madden 31 seconds after the opening faceoff. Gomez, whose game has
picked up since being nearly benched in Game 2, capitalized for the
Devils at 1:41, putting the rebound of Lemieux's shot into an open
net after Joseph could not control the shot from the right point.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Royce Clayton homered off Dwight
Gooden and Mark Clark pitched six scoreless innings Wednesday night
as the Texas Rangers beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-1 for their
season-best third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the fourth straight for the Devil Rays, who fell to
3-8 at home and have dropped eight straight to the Rangers at
Tropicana Field the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay avoided being shut out for the first time in 58 games
when Greg Vaughn hit an RBI single off Jeff Zimmerman in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez and Ruben Mateo had RBI singles off Gooden (2-1),
who also allowed Clayton's fourth homer with two outs in the fifth
inning. The pitcher's throwing error allowed the Rangers' fourth
run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Clark (3-2) allowed six hits in six-plus innings. He left after
allowing a leadoff single by Steve Cox in the seventh. John
Wetteland got five outs to earn to 299th career save.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Gooden's first in four starts since the 35-year-old
right-hander was obtained from Houston on April 13. He settled down
after allowing a run and three hits in the first inning to shut the
Rangers down until Clayton hit his 408-foot homer to center for a
2-0 Texas lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez led off the sixth with a double, giving him seven
extra-base hits in his last three games. The AL MVP scored when
Mateo singled to extend his hitting streak to a career-best seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's throwing error on a pickoff play allowed Mateo to score
from second base to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Clark gave up 12 runs and 13 hits in 6 1-3 innings in losses to
Minnesota and Boston, but rebounded with his longest outing of the
season for the Rangers. He walked one, struck out none and only
allowed one baserunner to reach as far as second base.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, who has earned three saves in five opportunities,
entered the game with two runners on and one out in the eighth. He
retired Vinny Castilla on a foul ball and got pinch hitter Jose
Canseco to hit into a force play to get out of the jam.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sheldon drove in the Rangers' last run with a RBI single
off Bryan Rekar in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A slight left hamstring strain kept 1B/DH Rafael Palmeiro
out of the Rangers lineup for the third time in four games ...
David Segui extended his hitting streak to seven games for Texas.
He's 14-for-28 during the streak and has now reached base in 24 of
26 games ... Devil Rays leadoff man Gerald Williams snapped an
0-for-11 slump with an infield single in the eighth ... Gooden has
allowed five homers in his last 15 innings ... Rangers 2B Luis
Alicea left the game in the sixth inning because of tightness in
his left calf.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Comic's Death Said Ordered  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Prosecutors said Wednesday they believe
the head of Colombia's notorious right-wing paramilitary ordered
last year's slaying of the country's most beloved humorist.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castano is the ''presumed'' mastermind of the August 13,
1999 assassination of television and radio satirist Jaime Garzon,
the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement also linking
the militia boss to two massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement could lead to new arrest warrants and
indictments of the fugitive Castano, who is already wanted in
connection with numerous mass killings of villagers and
assassinations of leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon was found slumped in his Jeep Cherokee after motorcycle
gunmen sprayed it with bullets while the 39-year-old comic headed
to his morning program at a Bogota radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The crime shocked and saddened Colombians, and speculation about
who might have order Garzon's killing immediately turned to
Castano.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands attended teary memorials to protest the slaying of man
whose irreverent lampooning of politicians and celebrities provided
comic relief for the Andean nation subsumed by daily news of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   One man is under arrest in the case, a 22-year-old detained in
January on suspicion he was one of the two shooters. Federal
investigators believe the alleged hit man, Juan Pablo Ortiz,
belonged to a gang of Medellin assassins who work on contract for
Castano.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also announced Wednesday that Castano was suspected
of ordering massacres in the eastern towns of Tibu and La Gabarra
last year in which 51 unarmed villagers were killed.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Indians 5  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mark Whiten, making his first start of the
season in center field, dropped Ricky Ledee's RBI double in the
ninth inning as the New York Yankees scored twice for a 6-5 victory
and a three-game sweep of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who make themselves at home every year in Jacobs
Field, rallied in the ninth off Steve Karsay (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   New York, which won the series opener on a weird double play in
the ninth, is 24-9 all-time at the Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, who homered earlier, keyed the comeback with his
first career triple. Scott Brosius tied it at 5 with an RBI single
and Ledee drove in the go-ahead run with a shot to center that
Whiten ran down on the warning track but couldn't hold on to.
</P>
<P>
   Whiten is only in center field because of injuries to Jacob Cruz
and Kenny Lofton. He was brought up from Triple-A Buffalo on Sunday
when Cruz was placed on the 60-day disabled list with a torn knee
ligament and Lofton went on the 15-day DL with a strained biceps
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings and Mariano
Rivera worked the ninth for his league-leading 10th save and third
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight game, Rivera put runners on in the ninth,
but got David Justice to fly to center for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer homered in the seventh and hit first triple in 356
at-bats in the ninth when the Yankees got to Karsay, who had been
5-for-5 in save tries.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 5-1, the Yankees crept back on Spencer's sixth homer
off starter Dave Burba and Paul O'Neill's two-run double in the
eighth off Paul Shuey.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a week, the Indians, who learned that
manager Charlie Manuel would have colon surgery Friday and could be
away from the team for two weeks, combined solid pitching with some
offense.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Cleveland's bullpen let them down.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which had scored 11 runs in its last five games,
managed 10 hits -- eight off starter David Cone -- and got a couple
of lucky bounces against the Yankees, who weren't sharp in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring just four runs in their previous three games, the
Indians opened a 5-1 lead with some help. Catcher Jorge Posada
dropped an excellent throw to the plate and Brosius dropped a throw
to third, both plays allowing runners to be safe.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burba is 0-5 in six career starts against the Yankees. ...
Five of Cleveland's last six games have been decide by one run. ...
Usually among the league leaders in every offensive statistical
category, the Indians rank 14th in hits and total bases and 12th in
batting average, runs scored and RBIs. Last year, Cleveland became
the seventh team in major league history and the first since 1950
to score 1,000 runs in a season.

<HEADLINE> Angels 6, Orioles 5  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mo Vaughn and Garret Anderson homered in a
three-run sixth inning that powered the Anaheim Angels past
Baltimore 6-5 on Wednesday night in a game that featured six home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck and Benji Gil also connected for the Angels, who
had lost nine straight and 14 of 15 to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle and B.J. Surhoff hit solo homers for the Orioles.
Belle went 3-for-4 and scored three runs.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-3, Vaughn led off the sixth inning by driving a
3-0 pitch from Jason Johnson (0-1) over the right-field scoreboard.
Tim Salmon then singled and Anderson homered on the first pitch
from Chuck McElroy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Conine hit a two-run single in the Orioles' half. But with
the bases loaded and one out, Mike Bordick popped out before Mike
Holtz retired Brady Anderson on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starter Ramon Ortiz (2-2) allowed four runs in five-plus
innings. Troy Percival, the fifth Angels pitcher, got three outs
for his seventh save. He got Surhoff to fly out with a runner on
second to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   One night earlier, Percival blew his first save of the season by
allowing two ninth-inning runs in the Orioles' 7-6 victory. He
entered the game with a lifetime 6.08 ERA against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Belle led off the second inning with his first homer since April
7, a towering fly to left that barely cleared the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck's solo homer in the third tied the score and doubled
both his home run and RBI output this season. Gil, the No. 9
hitter, followed with his first homer since August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore went up 3-2 in the fourth. Surhoff sent an 0-2 pitch
over the right-field wall before Belle singled and scored on a
sacrifice fly by Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pulled even in the fifth when Troy Glaus drew a
leadoff walk, took third on a double by Orlando Palmeiro and scored
on a two-out wild pitch by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anaheim's Darin Erstad, held hitless Tuesday, went 2-for-4
with a walk. He has reached safely in each of his 27 games. ...
Belle's homer was his 361st, tying him with Joe DiMaggio at No. 49
on the career list. ... The Angels have hit consecutive homers four
times this season. ... Baltimore fell to 10-3 at home. ... Before
the game, the Orioles put 1B Will Clark (strained hamstring) on the
disabled list and recalled INF Ryan Minor from Triple-A Rochester.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- High school guard DeShawn Stevenson, who
was expected to declare himself eligible for the NBA draft,
canceled a news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known why Stevenson canceled the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   According to ESPN.com and The Fresno Bee, the 6-foot-5 Stevenson
was to become the first high school player to declare for this
year's draft. He made his decision despite his parents' wishes for
him to honor his commitment to attend Kansas. Players have until
May 14 to declare for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The last high school guard to bypass college for the NBA was
Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a lot of confidence in myself,'' Stevenson said
Tuesday. ''I won't give up. Nothing scares me. Kobe was the only
other shooting guard and I'll be the next one. Everyone else who
has come out was a (small forward or power forward).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I wanted to do and it's my dream, and I'm going

is still not eligible academically for a Division I school but was
waiting for a standardized test result, according to the reports.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Derides Publisher Suspension  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Examiner publisher who
was abruptly suspended after admitting at trial that he offered
favorable editorial coverage to the mayor was only repeating what
he told the Justice Department several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. reacted with shock and suspended Timothy White,
publisher of the company's flagship newspaper, after he said he
offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorials if Brown supported
the company's effort to buy the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said the conversation White described with Brown may not
have taken place, and was a ''serious breach of Hearst's policy''
if it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But a deposition White gave in December to government antitrust
lawyers was virtually identical to his explosive testimony in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently they have fired this man not because of the
information itself, but because it was revealed in a public
forum,'' attorney Joseph M. Alioto said in court Wednesday as he
read from White's earlier deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto is representing businessman Clint Reilly, the former
mayoral candidate suing to block Hearst's purchase of the San
Francisco Chronicle and sale of the Examiner. Trial of the civil
case began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White, in a statement issued by Hearst after Monday's testimony,
said he had been ''tired and confused by the question.'' He was
placed on indefinite leave Tuesday, and was replaced as publisher
by George Irish, head of Hearst's newspaper division. Hearst said
it was launching an internal investigation into White's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of White's Dec. 16 deposition, Justice
Department lawyers questioned him about his meeting with Mayor
Brown on Aug. 30. At the time, Brown was publicly opposing Hearst's
plans to buy the Chronicle and sell or merge the Examiner into the
larger paper.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department lawyer asked if White was intending to
convey to Brown that his support for Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle ''would result in more favorable treatment'' by the
Examiner. White answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the same answer to the same question in court Monday,
and later specified that he was talking about editorials, not news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both Brown and Examiner executive editor Phil Bronstein, who
also attended the lunch meeting with the mayor, said outside of
court that no such discussion took place.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Corp. director of corporate communications Debra Shriver
said White was suspended entirely because of what he revealed in
his testimony on Monday. Regardless of whether any lawyers for the
company were present, ''senior executives at the company were not
aware of the content of the testimony'' until White testified in
open court, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition transcript shows that two Hearst lawyers were
present at White's deposition -- Gary Halling, the company's chief
attorney at the trial, and Jonathan Thackeray, Hearst's vice
president and general counsel. Shriver said Thackeray told her he
left the session before it ended and did not hear the testimony in
question. She did not know whether Halling remained throughout the
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like it's not the fact of these actions but the
exposure of these actions which motivated his removal,'' said Tom
Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism,
affiliated with Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said Hearst must have known what White told the Justice
Department, and cited White's deposition in asking for a court
order prohibiting Hearst from punishing witnesses for their
testimony. He was turned down by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker,
who is overseeing the non-jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to its readers Wednesday, the Examiner said: ''The
newsroom employees of The Examiner are proud that our editorial
support is not, and never has been, for sale. We fully expect any
employee to be held accountable for actions that undermine our
editorial integrity.''

<HEADLINE> Group Complains About Guatemala Head  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Human rights leaders on Wednesday filed a
criminal complaint against former President Fernando Romeo Lucas
Garcia in connection with 10 alleged massacres carried out during
the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, the first presented against a former Guatemalan
head-of-state, also accuses the ex-president's brother, Benedicto
Lucas Garcia, a former army commander, and former defense minister
Luis Rene Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   With some chanting ''Justice! Justice!'' leaders from the Human
Rights Legal Action Center presented their complaint to Guatemala
City's Municipal Prosecutor's office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Garcia ruled Guatemala with an iron fist from July 1978
until March 1982, when he was ousted in a coup by Efrain Rios
Montt, a retired general who is now president of the country's
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint centers on 10 massacres that occurred between Dec.
4, 1978 and Feb. 15, 1982 in indigenous villages in the western
Guatemalan highland states of Rabinal, Baja Verapaz and Quiche. It
is based on the testimonies of 48 survivors of those massacres in
which more than 150 peasants were killed, said Edgar Perez one of
the lawyers representing the center.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Garcia, who lives in Venezuela and is reportedly suffering
from Alzheimer's disease, offered no public comment Wednesday.

   Peace accords brought an end to the 36-year civil war in 1996.
The country's truth commission, which investigated abuses committed
during the war, issued a report last year blaming government
security forces for most of the 200,000 killings during the war.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert F. Craig, an activist who pushed AIDS
education, fought for West Hollywood's cityhood and founded the gay
newsmagazine Frontiers, died Friday from complications of AIDS. He
was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Craig co-founded Frontiers in 1982 and eventually became the
sole owner, turning the 16-page tabloid into a magazine with a
current circulation of 86,000.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Frontiers publicized the new threat of AIDS, to the
discomfort of gay bars and bathhouses, who vowed a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he co-founded a group for gay and lesbian business
owners that is now called the Los Angeles Business Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he was elected chairman of the West Hollywood
Incorporation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Craig is survived by a sister, a half-sister, Catherine, and a
nephew, great-nephew and great-niece.
Alonzo Crim:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Alonzo Crim, the first black school
superintendent of a major Southern city, died Wednesday following a
car accident. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Crim was named superintendent of Atlanta Schools in 1973. Over
the next 14 years, he was credited with raising school attendance
to more than 92 percent and increasing the graduation rate to more
than 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down from his post in 1987.
Arthur Dake:
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arthur Dake, the Portland chess expert who
became the first American to beat a sitting world champion, died
April 28. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, Dake defeated world champion Alexander Alekhine of
France just five years after learning the game from Russian
immigrants at Portland's YMCA. He also played on gold-medal winning
American Olympiad teams in 1931, 1933 and 1935.
Jonah Jones:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jonah Jones, a Grammy award-winning jazz
trumpeter who began his career on a Mississippi riverboat and
became a star playing with Cab Calloway, died Sunday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Jones performed around the Midwest with artists and bands
including Jimmie Lunceford, Stuff Smith, McKinney's Cotton Pickers
and Lil Armstrong, the wife of Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   His energetic solos with Smith's Onyx club band in the late
1930s earned him widespread attention, and he soon earned a spot
playing with Calloway from 1941 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Jones played Dixieland with Earl Hines and in 1954, made a
European tour.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a million copies of his versions of ''On the Street
Where You Live'' and ''Baubles, Bangles and Beads.'' Jones won a
Grammy award in 1959 for the album ''I Dig Chicks.''
Harry Newman:
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Former All-American quarterback Harry Newman, who
threw the first touchdown pass in an NFL championship game and
played with former President Ford at Michigan, died Tuesday. He was
90.
</P>
<P>
   Newman played for the New York Giants from 1933 to 1935. His
29-yard touchdown pass to Red Badgro gave the Giants a 7-6 halftime
lead in the first NFL title game in 1933, but they lost to the
Chicago Bears 23-21.
</P>
<P>
   With Newman's help, the Giants won the NFL title the following
year, beating the Bears 30-13 for the championship in the famous
''Sneakers Game.'' The Giants fell behind 10-3 at halftime, then
switched to basketball shoes for better traction on an ice-covered
field at the Polo Grounds.
Cardinal John O'Connor:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who charmed New Yorkers
with his wit and warmth while using his opposition to abortion and
homosexuality to make headlines and chastise politicians, died
Wednesday. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was the oldest active bishop in the United States and
one of the country's most influential Catholics. His health began
to fail after he had a brain tumor removed in August.
</P>
<P>
   Although he mustered the strength to make a farewell visit to
the pope in February, he made his final appearance at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was a familiar figure to devout Catholics as well
as average New Yorkers. He blessed parades as they passed St.
Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue; provoked a firestorm by
recommending excommunication for Catholic politicians who support
abortion rights, and he used his pulpit to weigh in on
controversies large and small.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics,'' said
President Clinton. ''The courage and firm faith he showed in his
final illness inspired us all.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor condemned a controversial painting of the Virgin Mary
at the Brooklyn Museum; held a conciliatory interfaith service
after police shot an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo; and
made front-page news by saying in 1990 that listening to certain
rock songs was ''a help to the devil'' that could ''lead to demonic
possession.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when American Catholics were increasingly inclined to
go their own way on matters of faith and morals, O'Connor staunchly
championed the Vatican line on birth control, abortion and
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also led opposition to local gay rights legislation
and kicked a gay Catholic group out of a parish church where it had
met for years. In 1989, enraged activists responded by chaining
themselves to pews and throwing condoms in the air during Mass at
St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Connor made unannounced visits to Catholic
hospitals where he ministered to AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said he would have been satisfied to be a parish priest
or teacher, and feared he might instead be remembered for ''the
alleged -- and to me, the mythical -- power, about my purported
political manipulations and all that kind of nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What I would like my epitaph to say is simply that 'He was a
good priest.'''
Steve Reeves:
</P>
<P>
   ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Reeves, star of European-made
action films of the 1950s and '60s whose Mr. Universe physique won
him a signature role as the mythical strongman Hercules, died
Monday of complications from lymphoma. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong bodybuilder, Reeves won the Mr. America title in
1947, which he followed with Mr. World and Mr. Universe titles in
1948 and Mr. Universe again in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   His imposing 6-foot-1, 215-pound frame attracted the attention
of filmmakers, who cast him in 18 films before he retired from
acting in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Reeves became one of the world's biggest box office
draws based on the success of ''Hercules,'' his third movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hercules'' was filmed in Italy with an all-European cast. It
was followed by films such as ''Goliath and the Barbarians,''
''Hercules Unchained,'' ''Last Days of Pompeii'' and ''Thief of
Baghdad.''

<HEADLINE> Chavez's Ruling Coalition Strong  </HEADLINE>
By FABIOLA SANCHEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez's coalition
showed signs of cracking Wednesday, a day after a showed him with a
strong lead over his closest rival in this month's presidential
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Fatherland for All, one of three parties making up
Chavez's leftist coalition, met to consider withdrawing their
support from Chavez in the May 28 vote. After the meeting, the
leaders said they would maintain their support for Chavez's
re-election bid as a group, but gave individual party leaders,
including two state governors, the option of breaking away from
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the organization's members have accused the president of
verbally attacking their candidates in local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fatherland for All ''has no intention of voting for Chavez,''
said Alexis Rosas, one of the group's leaders and the governor of
the eastern state of Anzoategui. ''It is useless for us to remain
in this alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was elected in December 1998 and is up for re-election in
May 28 after a new constitution he pushed through last year called
for new balloting to ''re-legitimize'' most public offices
including the presidency, governorships and congress.
</P>
<P>
   While a poll released Tuesday showed Chavez with a 21-point lead
over his closest rival, Francisco Arias, the political struggle
could hurt the president's pledge to help his political movement
sweep the elections for governorships and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, a former military leader who helped Chavez stage a failed
1992 coup attempt, has accused Chavez of amassing power and
abandoning the ideals behind their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The feud is just the latest in a series of pre-election
political clashes involving Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation from the Atlanta, Georgia-based Carter Center
arrived in the Venezuelan capital last weekend to meet with
political representatives in an attempt to ensure fair balloting.

<HEADLINE> Possible Successors to O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Possible candidates to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor
as
archbishop of the New York Archdiocese.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, 60, has been the archbishop for the
Catholic Archdiocese for the U.S. Military since 1997. He was born
in the Bronx borough of New York and educated at parochial schools
there and in suburban Westchester County before entering St.
Joseph's Seminary, where he served as rector in the late 1980s and
mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Connor, who was a career military chaplain, O'Brien has a
military background. He was a priest at the Military Academy at
West Point before joining the Army in 1970. He worked as a chaplain
with the 82nd Airborne in Fort Bragg, N.C., and then served in
Vietnam in 1971-72 with the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien served as an aide to O'Connor and his predecessor,
Cardinal Terence Cooke, in the mid-1980s, and was director of
communications for the New York Archdiocese in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Henry Mansell, 62, bishop in Buffalo, is a native of New
York City and was educated at parochial schools in the Bronx and
later at St. Joseph's Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   He served in a variety of administrative positions for the
church, including director of the Office of Parish Councils,
chancellor for priest personnel, and as an auxiliary bishop in New
York City and a former top aide and trusted adviser to O'Connor. He
has been the bishop of Buffalo since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Sean Patrick O'Malley, 55, has been bishop of Fall River
-- a diocese of about 400,000 in southeastern Massachusetts -- since
1992. Prior to that he spent eight years in the Virgin Islands,
where he was bishop of St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley is a Franciscan friar and often wears the brown robes
and sandals that are the uniform of the Capuchin Order, which is
dedicated to the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, O'Malley ran the Catholic Hispanic Center in
Washington, served as vicar for the Hispanic, Portuguese and
Haitian communities, and headed the church's Office of Social
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ohio, O'Malley attended Catholic schools in Butler, Pa.,
and Capuchin College in Washington, D.C. He also holds a doctorate
in Spanish and Portuguese literature from Catholic University in
Washington, where he taught for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Justin F. Rigali, 64, was appointed archbishop of St.
Louis in 1994. Before that, he had never led a parish. He went to
Rome as a young priest from California and spent 25 years in the
Vatican as a career diplomat, head of the Vatican diplomatic school
and papal translator.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II talked to Mother Teresa, Rigali stood
beside them translating. Like O'Connor, he is believed to be close
to the pope and holds similarly conservative views.
</P>
<P>
   Rigali hosted the visit of the pope to St. Louis in 1999 -- the
only such visit to a single diocese in the United States by the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Rigali was born in Los Angeles, one of seven children. He
attended parochial schools and seminaries in California and was
ordained a priest in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Royals' Center-Fielder Hurts Wrist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Royals center-fielder Carlos Beltran
left Wednesday night's game with a sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran, the AL's Rookie of the Year last season, made a great
diving catch of a sinking liner by Oakland's Ben Grieve with two
outs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   He trotted off the field to applause from the crowd but was
replaced by Scott Pose and taken to a hospital for X-rays. Doctors
said there was no break, and that his status would be day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran had hit safely in six of his last seven games and was
batting .234 after starting the season in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Last year as a rookie, Beltran hit .293 with 22 home runs and
108 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 7, Blue Jays 3  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Valentin, Frank Thomas and Paul Konerko hit
consecutive homers in the sixth inning Wednesday night and the
Chicago White Sox ended a three-game losing streak, beating the
Toronto Blue Jays 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson also homered in sixth, with his two-run shot
breaking a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin homered in the first, and the long ball display made it
easy for James Baldwin (5-0).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's homer and Valentin's second solo shot finished Kelvim
Escobar (2-4). Thomas and Konerko then connected off reliever John
Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, who didn't win his fifth game last season until Aug. 1,
allowed four hits and three runs in 7 1-3 innings, including solo
homers to Marty Cordova and Darrin Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin left after Homer Bush hit an RBI single in the eighth to
break an 0-for-20 skid.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke pitched 1 2-3 innings for his fourth save.
Notes: Baldwin's 5-0 start is the best by a White Sox pitcher
since Wilson Alvarez went 8-0 in 1994. ... The White Sox sixth
marked the first time the Blue Jays had ever allowed four homers in
one inning. ... The last time the White Sox went
back-to-back-to-back was May 26, 1996, when Thomas, Harold Baines
and Robin Ventura connected in order against Milwaukee. ... The
five homers give the White Sox 43 in 28 games ... Toronto's two
homers gave the Blue Jays seven in the three-game series and an
AL-leading 50 in 29 games this season. ... Escobar, now 0-4
lifetime against the White Sox, walked six.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Woman Snatches Baby, It Dies  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYWOOD, Ill. (AP) -- A woman who had told neighbors she was
pregnant snatched a premature baby from a hospital, apparently
concealing the child under a coat as the alarms went off, police
say. The baby was later found dead in a clothes hamper in her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they identified 24-year-old Vanecha Cooper
from surveillance video at Loyola University Medical Center in
suburban Maywood, where she had been visiting another baby on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators arrived at her apartment about 2 a.m.
Tuesday, prosecutors said, Cooper hid the baby in a clothes hamper.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time police were able to get permission to search the
apartment, the baby had died,'' Bob Benjamin, a spokesman for the
Cook County State's Attorney's office, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The county coroner said 2-week-old Zquan Wakefield, whose body
was found about 7 a.m., suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper told investigators the baby was alive when she put him in
the hamper and covered him with clothes, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged with murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Michael Sheahan said Cooper told investigators that she
had had two miscarriages. ''Her motive possibly could be that she
wanted a baby,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola officials said they first noticed Zquan was missing from
the nursery when an alarm sounded at the hospital about 10:30 p.m.
Monday, triggered by the baby's ID bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said in a statement that Cooper, who had
visited the nursery frequently, had been on a list of approved
visitors provided by her brother, whose girlfriend had recently had
a baby there.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Patricia Cassidy said a wristband alarm on
the baby was supposed to trigger the locking of a set of doors that
would have prevented the abduction, but a wiring malfunction
prevented that from working. Cassidy said that has been fixed and
new security measures have been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a woman large enough to pretend she was pregnant, had
told neighbors she was going to have a baby and due to have labor
induced Monday. Tests showed that she was not pregnant and had not
given birth.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary hearing Wednesday, Cooper's lawyer, Larry
Sommers, received permission to have her undergo a mental
evaluation. Bail was set at $2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Log Truck Crash Kills 4 in Maine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNVILLE, Maine (AP) -- A logging truck plowed into a station
wagon at the intersection of two highways Wednesday, killing three
young children and a 24-year-old passenger and leaving a 4-year-old
in serious condition, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the three children, Stacy Corson, was pulling into
the intersection when the logging truck hit the station wagon's
passenger side, said Stephen McCausland of the Maine Public Safety
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened about 1 p.m. in a wooded area near Cornville,
about 100 miles north of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Nathan Raymond, 25, of Solon and Corson's children
Vincent, 7, Wyonna, 4, and Trevor, 1. Raymond's son Jacob, 4, was
hospitalized in serious condition Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Corson, 25, of West Athens and 18-year-old Michelle Bouley of
Vassalboro were hospitalized in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, who was uninjured, apparently tried to avoid
the station wagon but couldn't, McCausland said. He said the truck
struck the vehicle and rolled into a ditch, spilling some of its
logs.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were reconstructing the accident Wednesday
afternoon and had not determined whether Corson stopped at the
intersection's stop sign, McCausland said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Sorry For Sheltering Nazis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- President Fernando de la Rua has
said Argentina must seek forgiveness for sheltering Nazis following
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua, who spoke at an event late Tuesday to mark the 57th
anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising by Jews, said the time had come
for Argentina to come to grips with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to seek forgiveness because Nazi criminals fleeing
justice entered our country and hid among us for a long time,'' he
said. ''Some were discovered, others perhaps not.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working in Argentina have said presidential papers
from former President Juan Peron indicate he may have encouraged
Nazi war criminals to come to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several former prominent Nazi officials sought
refuge in Argentina, including Adolf Eichmann, considered by many
to be one of the chief architects of the Holocaust, Josef Mengele,
a concentration camp doctor, and Erich Priebke, a former Nazi
captain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Argentine authorities arrested Dinko Sakic, who had
been a commander at Croatia's Jasenovac concentration camp. Sakic
had been living peacefully in Argentina. He was later extradited to
Croatia, where last year he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups said on Wednesday they welcomed De la Rua's
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''But beyond asking for forgiveness, we should make sure that
these things can't repeat themselves,'' said Samuel Kaplan,
president of B'nai B'rith Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office last December, De la Rua has publicly
condemned discrimination against Argentina's Jewish community, the
second-largest in the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 3, Red Wings 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Chris Drury's goal at 10:21 of overtime lifted
Colorado to a 3-2 victory Wednesday night and gave the Avalanche a
commanding 3-1 lead over the Detroit Red Wings in their Western
Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Drury snapped his third goal of the playoffs past Detroit goalie
Chris Osgood from the slot off nice passes from Peter Forsberg and
Adam Deadmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Klemm and Dave Andreychuk also scored for the Avs, who
return home for Friday's Game 5 of the best-of-seven series. A
sixth game, if needed, would played Sunday afternoon in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Vyacheslav Kozlov and Tomas Holmstrom scored for the Red Wings
who have been eliminated from the playoffs the last three times
they have fallen behind 2-0. Colorado won the opening two games of
the series at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs didn't appear to miss star defenseman Ray Bourque, who
sprained his left knee Monday night and sat out this game.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov, on his 28th birthday, scored his second goal to give
Detroit a 2-1 lead at 9:12 of the third period while Deadmarsh was
off for high-sticking Pat Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   But the Avs tied it 2-2 with 4:27 remaining when Osgood, trying
to clear Andreychuk's shot, scooped the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Avs goalie Patrick Roy made a spectacular save on Kozlov in the
slot at 5:42 of the overtime. Osgood stopped Forsberg from the left
circle at 8:19 of the extra stanza.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit outshot the Avs 25-16 during the first three periods of
the close-checking, heavy-hitting contest and 7-5 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Klemm's first playoff goal gave Colorado a 1-0 lead at 3:37 of
the second, marking the third time in the series the Avs have
scored first. Klemm, camped on the right side of the net, took a
nice pass from Joe Sakic and snapped it between Osgood's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom, by far the Red Wings' best player on this night, took
a pass from Doug Brown at the right side of the Colorado goal and
slid the puck between Roy's pads for his third goal and a 1-1 tie
at 9:47 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   The game was full of hard checks throughout. During one shift in
the first period, Avs defenseman Adam Foote took on Darren McCarty
and Martin Lapointe. Foote, who stepped up his game in the absence
of Bourque, lost his headgear taking McCarty into the corner, but
still came back to bump Lapointe away from Roy in front of the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roy and Osgood came up with tough saves in the first
period. The Red Wings came closest to a goal in the first 20
minutes when Brown flipped the puck past Roy at 7:36. It was waved
off, however, because Holstrom was checked into the net, knocking
it off one post.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom had a good chance near the left post with 1:00 left in
the first, but couldn't get the puck past Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Each goalie came up with nice saves late in the second. Osgood
robbed Sandis Ozolinsh, who got free in the right circle with 3:45
left in the period and Roy stopped Kozlov from the right circle
with 1:28 left in the second. Osgood also handled a clear shot from
the right circle by Forsberg with 51 seconds remaining in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 10 goals during the first three games came on power
plays, but penalties weren't much of a factor Wednesday until late.
Referees Kerry Fraser and Dave Jackson called two penalties, one on
each team, in the first 2:19.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't another penalty called until Detroit defenseman
Chris Chelios was sent off for high-sticking Forsberg at 2:04 of
the third period. Thirty-nine seconds later, Forsberg was called
for interference on Brendan Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Deadmarsh's double-minor for drawing blood on Verbeek.
Kozlov scored eight seconds later.

Cardinal John O'Connor Dies At 80
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who charmed New Yorkers with his wit
and warmth while using his opposition to abortion and homosexuality to make
headlines and chastise politicians, died tonight. He was 80. ''His eminence John
Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly journey and has gone home to God,''
said Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
''The cardinal died very peacefully with his sister, Mary Ward, and other family
members, clergy and co-workers at his side.'' O'Connor was the oldest active
bishop in the United States and one of the country's most influential Catholics.
His health began to fail after he had a brain tumor removed in August.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Olympic Bid Supported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- International Olympic Committee vice
president Kevan Gosper is backing the latest bid to have East Timor
included in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, Australia's most senior Olympic official, said he was in
contact with all the leading authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
   At its executive board meeting in Lausanne last month, the IOC
rejected the former Indonesian province's request to be involved in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, which voted for independence last year and is under
United Nations administration, is virtually independent but does
not fulfill the criteria for Olympic recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported Thursday that the
IOC, with the help of the Australian government, was seeking
clearance from the U.N. to ensure East Timor met the guidelines for
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Only three athletes -- in boxing, weightlifting and track and
field -- were identified as eligible to compete at the Games and the
Australian Olympic Committee was prepared to provide them with
financial aid, the ABC reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would keep in touch with Indonesia to make sure they were
comfortable with this, after all, the athletes we've identified may
well have recently represented Indonesia,'' Gosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said the proposal had full support from Portugal, former
colonial governors of the territory, and other nations around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing is to make sure all the players are involved
and everybody's traveling in the right direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the executive board meeting, IOC director general Francois
Carrard said the IOC recognized National Olympic Committees from
independent countries and states, but did not recognize East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   IOC regulations require a country to be a fully independent
state with at least five sports federations operating in its
territory.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Californians for Votes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Brushing aside claims that he has
written off California, Texas Gov. George W. Bush pledged Wednesday
to campaign ''all up and down'' the state, saying his efforts here
will propel him to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last time I was here in your great state, I think my opponent
might have been talking some wishful thinking out loud,'' Bush
said. ''The word was that somehow the George W. campaign wasn't
going to campaign in California. That's wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate kicked off his three-day
swing through Southern California with a brief rally under the
98-degree desert sun at the Palm Springs International Airport.
About 200 supporters crowded around him under a tent next to the
runway.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush visited the area, known as the Coachella
Valley, in March to raise money for his son's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   California has 54 of the nation's 270 electoral votes, giving it
the largest political pull in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore leads in California presidential polls,
but Bush has tried to bridge that gap by reaching out to the
state's Hispanics and distancing himself from former Republican
Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor alienated many of those voters with his
support for a measure to outlaw most state aid to illegal
immigrants and his opposition to affirmative action and bilingual
education.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Parsky, chairman of the California Republican Party,
pointed to the GOP candidate's trip this week as proof that he has
not ceded the state to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky introduced Bush at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the candidate's motorcade left Palm Springs for ritzy
Rancho Mirage, where Bush was to attend a fund-raiser at the estate
of billionaire philanthropist Walter Annenberg.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50 couples were invited to the event, which Parsky
said would raise money for both the Republican National Committee
and the California Republican Party. The fund-raiser reportedly
cost $25,000 per couple, although some sources said it was $25,000
per plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's more evidence,'' Parsky said. ''Money is raised and
staying in the state. ... This is the kind of enthusiasm we haven't
felt in the Republican Party in the last 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has collected a record $80 million for his campaign and,
just last month, raised a record $18 million at a single event for
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to continue his trip to California with a visit to
San Juan Capistrano on Thursday, where he was expected to speak
about school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech to the predominantly white, non-Hispanic crowd in
this GOP stronghold included a series of promises to help Americans
pay less taxes, which was greeted with cheers from flag- and
pompom-waving supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to return some of the national surplus to taxpayers,
eliminate the so-called death tax and lamented the amount of taxes
the poor pay.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he plans to use a projected surplus in Social
Security taxes to improve Social Security and pay down the federal
debt. Gore chastised Bush on Wednesday for not yet revealing
details of his plan to repair Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he planned to outline the principles of his plan next
week, but wouldn't reveal specifics. He did not mention his plans
at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked glowingly about his wife, Laura, during the rally
and told supporters he was sorry they didn't get to meet her. He
made no mention of a decades-old accident report that was released
Wednesday, revealing that a 17-year-old Laura Bush ran a stop sign
in 1963 and collided with another car, killing her boyfriend.

<HEADLINE> Albright: More Vigilance in Dept.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
''furious'' about recent security lapses at the State Department,
delivered an impassioned plea to department employees Wednesday for
greater vigilance to protect the nation's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 minutes, Albright admonished a
standing-room-only crowd of about 1,000 employees that the
country's vital secrets can be put at risk unless security measures
are strictly observed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care how skilled you are as a diplomat, how brilliant
you may be at meetings, or how creative you are as an administrator
-- if you are not a professional about security, you are a
failure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every senior department official attended the session
held in the agency's largest auditorium. The proceedings also were
made available through closed circuit video to offices throughout
the building and to many foreign posts.
</P>
<P>
   The ''town hall'' meeting was convened following February's
unexplained disappearance of a department laptop computer
containing highly sensitive information, and an incident last year
in which a seventh floor conference room was found to have been
bugged. A Russian diplomat was expelled from the country as part of
the fallout of that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Albright announced several steps aimed at improving
security.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, she asked all principal supervisory personnel to
stress the importance of security to their staffs. In addition,
annual refresher security briefings will be intensified, with
mandatory attendance for all appropriate department employees.
</P>
<P>
   An interagency panel, consisting of experts from the Secret
Service, FBI, CIA and the State and Defense Departments, has given
Albright a report recommending about 40 changes to improve
security, ABC News reported on its Web site Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations include consolidating the departments varied
security apparatus into its Bureau of Diplomatic Security; spending
more on security personnel, training and equipment; putting tighter
controls on State Department building passes; and further
restricting access to the main building in Washington to protect
against a terrorist threat, the report said. The department also
was advised to stop using private security guards and replace them
with federal law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Following the disclosure of the missing laptop last month, House
International Relations Committee Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
announced plans for hearings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ''casual attitude of the State Department toward
security must change.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, while not endorsing Gilman's premise, said, ''We
cannot and should not accept a culture within the department that
resists paying full attention to our security responsibilities. We
cannot and should not suggest that those responsibilities somehow
interfere with the performance of our jobs. For, in truth, this is
not possible. Security is an inherent, inextricable and
indispensable component of all our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the missing laptop contained large quantities of
documents about arms proliferation issues and highly sensitive
information about sources and methods of U.S. intelligence
collection.
</P>
<P>
   After Albright spoke, a senior official who briefed reporters
said it is still not clear whether the laptop was stolen or simply
misplaced. He also acknowledged that extensive publicity about the
laptop may be inhibiting an employee from returning it for fear of
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The official, asking not to be identified, said many people are
being interviewed as potential witnesses to what may have happened,
including cleaning people and contractors in addition to department
officials and other employees.
</P>
<P>
   The official said it was unfortunate that The Washington Post,
which had the first account on the laptop's disappearance, reported
on the highly classified nature of the information stored in it. If
the computer was stolen, he said, word that it contained top secret
data would increase its value, thereby making it much more
difficult to track down.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that there is a strong likelihood that the
person responsible for taking the computer would be able to access
the documents even if that individual does not know the password
normally needed to download them.

<HEADLINE> Text of NY Archdiocese's Statement  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Text of announcement made by Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New
York spokesman Joseph Zwilling on the death of Cardinal John
O'Connor:
<TEXT>
<P>
   His eminence John Cardinal O'Connor has completed his earthly
journey and has gone home to God. The cardinal died May 3, 2000, at
8:05 p.m., in his residence on Madison Avenue. The cardinal died
very peacefully with his sister, Mary Ward, and other family
members, clergy and co-workers at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's health took a sudden and dramatic turn for the
worse early in the morning of May 3rd. He was kept comfortable and
did not experience any pain.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal received the sacrament of the sick last Saturday
and on several other occasions during his illness. Cardinal
O'Connor had been experiencing a growing weakness over the past
month and a half. This weakness caused the cardinal to limit his
public activities and appearances in early March, and to cease
other official archdiocesan acts in late March.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cardinal's most passionate beliefs was that by
uniting our suffering with the suffering of Christ on the cross, we
can be instruments of enormous good in the world. As the cardinal
often said, Christ did not make possible the salvation of the world
through his teaching, his preaching, his miracles, but by his
suffering and death on the cross; when he appeared to be utterly
powerless, he was radiating the greatest power ever unleashed in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal united his own illness and suffering of these past
eight months with the suffering of Christ, and always accepted the
changes in his condition with great faith in God, and in his mercy
and gentle goodness.
</P>
<P>
   In all things, the cardinal followed the advice given to him on
the day he became bishop by Mother Teresa: ''Give God permission.''
</P>
<P>
   May the Lord grant eternal peace to the soul of our loving and
faithful archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor.

<HEADLINE> Twins 5, Mariners 4, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cristian Guzman hit a sacrifice fly in the
10th inning and the Minnesota Twins stopped a five-game losing
streak, defeating the Seattle Mariners 5-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones went 3-for-3 with a walk and Corey Koskie homered
for Minnesota, which almost blew a three-run lead for the second
straight night.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the 10th, Jones, pinch-hitter Midre Cummings and
Denny Hocking hit consecutive singles off Jose Mesa (1-2) to load
the bases. Guzman then hit a fly ball to left field and there was
no play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Guardado (2-1) pitched a perfect 10th inning for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-1, the Mariners scored a run in the sixth and two
more in the seventh to tie it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ibanez had an RBI single in the sixth to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Mark McLemore and Stan Javier hit one-out
singles. With two outs, John Olerud singled home a run off Brad
Radke and Edgar Martinez, who had three hits, had an RBI single off
reliever Bob Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Javier hit an RBI triple off Radke in the third to give Seattle
a 1-0 lead. Todd Walker had an RBI groundout in the bottom of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Koskie made it 3-1 with his first homer of the season, a two-run
shot off Brett Tomko in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hit a sacrifice fly in the fifth to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota had a three-run lead after five innings Tuesday night
against Seattle, but lost 5-4.
Notes: The Mariners have not lost a season series to Minnesota in
seven years under manager Lou Piniella. ... Jones hit a foul pop in
the third inning that hit one of the speakers attached to the
Metrodome ceiling. Seattle third baseman David Bell was ready to
make the catch, but the ball bounced off the speaker away from him.
... Koskie hit 11 homers last season, his rookie year. ... Right
fielder Matt Lawton made a leaping catch in the seventh on Alex
Rodriguez's foul out.

<HEADLINE> Dixie Chicks Said Best Country Group  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Shania Twain was named entertainer
of the year and the Dixie Chicks won group and album prizes for
''Fly'' at the 35th annual Academy of Country Music Awards
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lonestar's riveting ''Amazed'' was picked best song and single.
</P>
<P>
   Twain did not attend the show.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big night for country sweethearts, even though leading
nominees Tim McGraw and wife Faith Hill lost in the entertainer of
the year category.
</P>
<P>
   Each won their second consecutive vocalist of the year awards
and Hill won top video prize for ''Breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-member academy also voted the duet ''When I Said I
Do'' by Clint Black and actress-wife Lisa Hartman Black as the
vocal event of the year. Black hadn't won an ACM trophy since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been telling her for a month it's not going to be us so
don't worry,'' Black said, adding it ''was a true awards show
moment'' for him to see his wife's face when their name was called.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive album award for the Dixie Chicks --
Martie Seidel, Natalie Maines and Emily Robison. The trio's ''Wide
Open Spaces'' won last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fly'' also won the country album Grammy earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton, host of the three-hour CBS-TV show, arrived on
stage at the Universal Amphitheatre with a hearty, ''Howdy!'' It
was her first outing as show host -- a role she filled with
self-described ''tacky'' remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're both 35 years old. Well, parts of me are anyway,'' said
Parton, decked out in a sequined gown.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a major country music controversy head on, George Strait
and Alan Jackson led off the night's performances with ''Murder on
Music Row,'' the ''someone killed country music'' ditty that
asserts traditional country sound has been drowned out by
money-grubbing pop leanings.

<HEADLINE> Giants 8, Mets 5, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer in the 11th
inning and the San Francisco Giants beat New York 8-5 Wednesday for
their third straight victory over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard opened the 11th with a single off Turk Wendell
(2-1) and Barry Bonds walked on four pitches. Kent followed with
his seventh homer of the season into the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez (1-0) pitched one inning for the victory as the
Giants won for the ninth time in 11 games. They got back to .500
(13-13) for the first time since the sixth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   New York tied it at 5 in the seventh on a two-run triple by
Melvin Mora that skipped past Bonds in left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had taken a 5-3 lead by scoring three runs in the
sixth on four walks and two singles, chasing Mets starter Mike
Hampton -- who left the game after giving up bases-loaded walks to
Doug Mirabelli and pinch-hitter Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco earlier had RBI singles by Kent in the first and
Bonds in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Nunnally led off the game for New York with a homer. Derek
Bell had a run-scoring single in the third and Todd Pratt had an
RBI double in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was another tough outing for Hampton, who entered the game
with an 8-0 career record against the Giants. Hampton, traded to
the Mets in the offseason after going 22-4 for Houston last year,
allowed five runs on six hits and six walks in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The two-run rally in the seventh by the Mets saved Hampton from
his fifth loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz allowed three runs on six hits in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the third time Nunnally has led off a game with a
homer. The other times came in 1998, when he was with Cincinnati,
and in 1995, when he was with Kansas City. ... The Mets are 2-4 on
a 13-game trip, their longest since another 13-game trip in 1995.
... Mets catcher Mike Piazza missed his fifth straight start with a
bruised right wrist and a hyperextended right elbow, but doubled as
a pinch-hitter in the eighth. He is expected to return to the
starting lineup Thursday against the Giants. ... The 4:05 p.m. PDT
start time was one of two such late afternoon weekday game times at
Pacific Bell Park this season. ... Aaron Fultz pitched 2 2-3
scoreless innings for the Giants, the longest outing by a San
Francisco reliever this season.

By The Associated Press	   Reaction to the death of Cardinal John O'Connor:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''A legend has been called home to God. As a leader and teacher,
Cardinal O'Connor was absolute in his love for the church and
indefatigable in his defense for the vulnerable among us. He did it
all with great compassion and commonsense ... and with that
wonderful glint in his eye.'' -- Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church has lost a great warrior and the country has lost a
great patriot, who will long be remembered. ... He was a bold and
courageous man, who stood firmly for what he believed. He was loyal
and faithful to his friends and to his Church.'' -- The Rev. Billy
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church has lost one of its great leaders and the United
States has lost one of its most patriotic sons. But God has his
friend back with him. Cardinal O'Connor was a very religious,
patriotic American who served his country with pride and his God
with great care, great concern.'' -- Raymond Flynn, former mayor of
Boston and one-time U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, he has reached out with uncommon
fortitude to minister to the needs of America's Catholics. The
courage and firm faith he showed in his final illness inspired us
all.'' -- President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have lost an eloquent voice for human rights and human
dignity and a champion for the least among us.'' -- Texas Gov.

   ''A priest to the very core of his person, Cardinal O'Connor
lived out his priesthood with an energy, a spiritual dynamism and
commitment which inspired us all.'' -- Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was a late night visit to dying patients in AIDS
hospital wards or his determination to keep Catholic parochial
schools open and available to every child seeking a good education,
he was a man who sought to serve others at every opportunity.'' --
Cardinal Francis George of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 6 Tons of Marijuana Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- U.S. Customs Service inspectors stopped a
tractor-trailer loaded with nearly 6 tons of marijuana as the
driver tried to enter the country, the agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver fled on foot back to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kerven, El Paso port director for the Customs Service, said
Tuesday's seizure was the largest in the region in more than a
decade. The drugs have an estimated street value of $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A drug-sniffing dog on the Zaragosa International Bridge on El
Paso's southeast side alerted inspectors to the truck. Two
inspectors then discovered a total of 11,541 pounds of marijuana in
80 cardboard boxes that were mixed in with boxes of car seat belts,
Kerven said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Teen Arrested in Bus Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGASHI HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- A knife-wielding teen-ager
hijacked a passenger bus in Japan, killing a woman and holding the
blade to the neck of a 6-year-old girl, before police stormed the
vehicle Thursday and ended the 15-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
   After a 190-mile chase and hours of negotiations at a highway
rest stop, police charged into the bus before dawn, entering
through a window and an emergency exit, and subdued the youth. None
of the remaining passengers was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking, which began about noon Wednesday on Sanyo
Expressway in Fukuoka prefecture, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo,
riveted Japan. Television stations interrupted regular programming
to bring overhead shots of the white bus moving slowly down the
highway, windows drawn, chased by several police cars.
</P>
<P>
   As shocking as the hijacking was for this low-crime nation, what
troubled many even more was the age of the suspect -- 17, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder why juveniles keep committing crimes. I'm shocked.
It's becoming more and more like America,'' said Yoshio Zuigyo, 50,
who happened to drive by the highway rest area where the bus
eventually stopped, trailed by police cars and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was a mental patient who was on home leave, national
broadcaster NHK reported without elaborating on the illness.
Officials at three prefectural (state) police departments refused
to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking began when the teen-age suspect went to the front
of the bus, slashed several passengers with the knife and sat
behind the driver, according to passengers.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people were aboard the passenger bus, but nearly half
had either been released or had escaped before the hijacking ended.
</P>
<P>
   Three women were freed after each was stabbed in the neck with
the hijacker's 16-inch knife. Police said one of them, 68-year-old
Tatsuko Tsukamoto, died. Four male passengers were also released.
</P>
<P>
   Three other hostages escaped by leaping out windows of the bus,
two of them as the vehicle was moving, injuring one of them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the standoff, the suspect's mother arrived
at the scene, but he refused to speak with her. The hijacker's name
was withheld because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he demanded a gun, but officials refused to give him
one. NHK TV reported that he also demanded cash and wanted to be
driven to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper photo shot through the front window of the bus
showed a pudgy, bespectacled youngster with a pageboy hairstyle,
sitting next to a girl behind the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Mikiko Matsuno, a 30-year-old nurse who jumped from the bus,
told police the hijacker paced back and forth ''with a bloody knife
dangling from his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When my eyes accidentally met his, he asked my name and told
me, 'I'll kill you,''' police quoted her as saying in the hospital,
where she was being treated for bruises and a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   After an hours-long chase, the bus was stopped by two large
police vehicles and forced into the rest area, where police later
captured the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a nearby police station and charged with taking
hostages and carrying an illegal weapon, police said. He was not
immediately charged with murder, for which the maximum penalty is
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Joji Fujiha said the suspect admitted to the
hijacking but would not disclose a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the 6-year-old girl who had been traveling alone
to visit her grandparents was receiving psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking was the latest in a series of high-profile
juvenile crimes in Japan. Although still low compared to the United
States, the juvenile crime rate has climbed recently, with murders
by youngsters up by 56 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what happens when kids grow up in solitude in a
virtual world,'' said Takashi Ota, an honorary professor at Tokyo
University. ''With just man-made things to play with, kids have
lost the natural feeling of sharing experiences with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking was on the front-page in all major newspapers
Thursday. ''The Drive of Death,'' said a headline in the Mainichi
national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should all try to relate to our children better,'' said an
editorial in the Yomiuri newspaper. ''Their utter lack of
conscience or discipline is unsettling.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Hostages Killed in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) -- Four hostages were found dead
Wednesday -- shot execution-style and some mutilated -- after Muslim
rebels holding 27 captives stumbled across Philippine troops by a
river crossing and both sides opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hostages were children seized from a school. Fifteen
children and their teachers were rescued after the gunfight in
Basilan province, but military officials said others were taken by
the fleeing Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, rebel leaders holding a separate group of 21
hostages on neighboring Jolo island said two of their foreign
captives died during a clash with troops. But military officials
said they had no knowledge that any of the hostages -- who include
10 foreign tourists -- had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a radio station reported that two other hostages by
Abu Sayyaf guerrillas on Jolo had escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station DZMM, quoting an unidentified source at the rebel
hide-out, said the two males escaped Wednesday. Rebels searching
for them later clashed with troops that encircled the area, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two clashes came during a chaotic day of attacks in the
southern Philippines. As the hostage standoffs degenerated into
gunfights, the region's other major rebel group claimed
responsibility for a series of bombings that left at least four
dead and dozens wounded in several towns. It was the worst recent
outbreak of violence linked to the rebel groups fighting for a
separate Islamic state in the Philippines' impoverished Mindanao
region, home of the country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   In Basilan on Wednesday, soldiers chanced upon the rebels at a
river crossing and screamed to the hostages, ''Drop to the ground
and don't run away,'' said Regardo Gregorio, one of the rescued
children. He said they dropped down and the soldiers and rebels
began firing.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word on who killed the four hostages,
identified as a priest, a male teacher and two female teachers. But
there were indications that their captors were responsible. A
priest who saw the bodies said they had been shot at close range in
the head. Several, including the female teachers, had apparently
been hacked on their bodies and arms, the Rev. Martin Jumoad said.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the rescued hostages were injured, one seriously. They
were taken by helicopter to a military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 Basilan hostages, mostly children, were among about 50
people seized by the rebels on March 20 for use as human shields.
The rebels later released some captives, but they claimed to have
beheaded two male teachers two weeks ago. That claim led the
military to launch an assault on their stronghold. Troops overran
the area in fierce fighting over the weekend but failed to find any
of the captives.
</P>
<P>
   The rescued hostages said they had been taken from the camp
Saturday and forced to walk each night through forest trails.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we left the camp there were already explosions around
it,'' said Criselda Selvano, a sixth grader. ''They moved us from
place to place during the night. Sometimes we slept under the
trees, and when it rained we got wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's clash on Jolo apparently occurred when the separate
group of 21 hostages there were being transferred to another
location, officials said. Troops seized the bamboo hut where the
hostages had been held, but found no one inside. No bloodstains
were evident inside the hut, and medicines brought by a doctor on
Monday were left behind, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Robot, an Abu Sayyaf leader, claimed in a telephone
interview with the local ABS-CBN radio network that one hostage was
accidentally shot in fighting with Philippine troops and another
died of a heart attack. He apologized to their families and said it
was not the rebels' doing.
</P>
<P>
   Nur Misuari, the government's hostage negotiator, said he had
conflicting reports about whether the two hostages were dead or
only injured. He urged a halt to the government's military
operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have threatened to behead two foreign hostages if the
military does not pull back from the area, but the military said
they would stay put. At least two soldiers have been killed and six
injured in the fighting, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jolo hostages include tourists from Germany, France, South
Africa, Finland and Lebanon as well as resort workers from the
Philippines and Malaysia. They were kidnapped April 23 from a
Malaysian diving resort and brought to Jolo in the southern
Philippines, about an hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who accompanied a doctor to the bamboo hut Monday
said the hostages complained of food shortages, fevers and
infections. The doctor said she told the rebels that two captives
need to be hospitalized, but the rebels did not immediately agree.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two separatist Muslim rebel
groups in the region. Elsewhere in the southern Philippines on
Wednesday, the larger group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
claimed responsibility for the explosions that killed at least
four.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb concealed with plastic exploded in the General Santos
fish port, killing two people and seriously injuring at least 20,
Mayor Adelbert Antonino said. Almost simultaneously, a bomb inside
a taxi exploded in front of a municipal building, killing one
woman, and a bomb outside a second city building killed one man and
injured 10, he said. Police and military officials also reported
explosions in Cotabato, Zamboanga del Sur and Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the Moro Front began formal peace talks this
year, but clashes have escalated since last week.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 104, Jazz 93  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Considered all but dead after two straight woeful
performances on the road, the Seattle SuperSonics are headed back
to Utah for a deciding Game 5 in their first-round playoff series
with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton had his first career playoff triple-double with 35
points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists, while Rashard Lewis had 20
points and Vin Baker added 18 as the Sonics made it two straight
wins at home with a 104-93 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics held Utah to seven points on 3-for-21 shooting in the
second quarter, but the Jazz came back to get within two points
with 7:16 left. But Payton helped the Sonics pull away again as he
had 15 points in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Russell led the Jazz with 26 points, while Karl Malone had
23 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 will be Friday night and the winner moves on to face
Portland in a best-of-seven second-round series that begins Sunday
in Portland. The Trail Blazers wrapped up their first playoff
series against Minnesota in four games Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional fourth quarter when Malone and Utah coach Jerry
Sloan were both ejected after receiving their second technical
fouls, Jeff Hornacek hit a 3-pointer to cut Seattle's lead to
82-80.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics got two free throws from Payton with 6:50 to go
and the 20-year-old Lewis made another free throw before Greg
Ostertag of the Jazz made a free throw with 5:45 left to make it
85-81.
</P>
<P>
   Payton then hit a 3-pointer, Lewis made a 5-footer and then
another free throw and Seattle had a 91-81 lead with 4:15 left.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was thrown out with 1:11 left and Malone was ejected with
24 seconds to play. Malone departed after a jawing match with
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   With Payton sitting on the bench with four fouls, the Jazz cut
Seattle's lead to 78-71 over the final 3:26 of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, whose biggest lead was 65-48 with 6:51 left in the
third quarter, were up 73-61 when Payton went to the bench and was
replaced by Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz's horrible shooting in the second quarter helped the
Sonics to a 50-36 halftime lead as they outscored Utah 24-7 in the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Down by as many as eight points in the first quarter, the Sonics
scored the first 10 points of the second quarter. Baker opened up
the period with two baskets, Payton followed with two more and
Brent Barry drove in for a layup to give Seattle a 36-29 lead 2:57
into the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In the second quarter, the Jazz went more than five minutes
between baskets. After Scott Padgett's 3-pointer with 5:59 to go in
the period, Utah didn't score again until Malone's 15-footer with
37 seconds remaining in the first half. ... The seven points scored
by the Jazz in the second quarter were a team low in a period by
Utah in the playoffs. And the seven points also were a Sonics'
opponents' low for a quarter in the playoffs.

Cardinal John O'Connor Dies At 80

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor, who charmed New Yorkers with his wit
and warmth while using his opposition to abortion and homosexuality to make
headlines and chastise politicians, died Wednesday. He was 80. O'Connor was the
oldest active bishop in the United States and one of the country's most
influential Catholics. His health began to fail after he had a brain tumor
removed in August. Although he mustered the strength to make a farewell visit to
the pope in February, he made his final appearance at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
early March.
