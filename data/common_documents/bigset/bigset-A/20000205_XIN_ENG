<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates Opposition to Pro-Taiwan Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
reaffirmed Friday his opposition to the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act passed by the House of Representatives earlier
this week, which regulates closer military contacts between the U.
S. and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Chinese) don't like it, but I don't support that
bill either, and I don't think it's in Taiwan's best interest,"
Clinton said in an interview with NBC.
</P>
<P>
White House officials have vowed that the president would veto
the bill.
</P>
<P>
The president meanwhile stressed the U.S. stand of one-China,
saying "the resolution of the dispute between Taiwan and China
ought to be done by peaceful means".
</P>
<P>
China has expressed its "utmost indignation" and "firm
opposition" to the new legislation calling it a violation of its
sovereignty and flagrant interference in its internal affairs.

BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- As people in Beijing returned
home as early as possible today to prepare for the most important
dinner of the year on Spring Festival Eve, 52 foreigners were
arriving after a long trip to China to attend a celebration at the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
These special visitors from 44 countries are winners of the
global competition "Meet China in 2000" which attracted more than
one million foreign participants from June to November last year.
</P>
<P>
A campfire party on the Great Wall, the oldest part of which is
believed to have been built 2,500 years ago, was exciting to the
foreigners clad in down overcoats provided by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Far away from the Great Wall, bright lanterns decorate Lhasa
together with colorful fireworks on the eve of the Chinese Lunar
New Year. Legqog, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, came to
the Lhasa Telecommunications Bureau to greet staff members who
were still at work.
</P>
<P>
Legqog expressed his appreciation and presented them with hada,
a ceremonial silk scarf regarded as a token of respect in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect the chairman's visit and greetings," said
Gesang Lobu, a national model worker with the post office, "We all
feel warm and encouraged, and we'll do our best at work."

In the ancient city of Xi'an in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, the results of a special competition have disappointed
most participants who are eager to bring home an orphan from the
children's welfare institute during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and twenty people applied to be "acting mothers" of
six orphans within three days after the institute published a
story titled "Who Will Parent the Orphans on New Year Eve" in a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The institute had to choose six out of the 120, and those six
turned out to be a laid-off worker, an official, a worker, a
teacher, a self-employed person, and a special team of 11 male
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
To Yang Changfen in Kunming, capital of southwest China's
Yunnan Province, the most exciting thing about this Spring
Festival is that she made all her festival purchases via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
Yang had trouble one time amid the throngs of shoppers in the
stores, and this new "electronic supermarket" enabled her to
choose what she wanted at home and avoid the crowds.
</P>
<P>
In Chongqing, China's newest and largest municipality, in the
southwest, Wang Sufang, 72, is spending the last Spring Festival
she will spend in her wood-column room near the Yangtze River
branch of the Jialing River, where she has lived for nearly three
decades.
</P>
<P>
A hot topic at the dinner table is the upcoming move into a new
apartment.
</P>
<P>
The dark and damp rooms will be demolished soon after the Spring
Festival, and Wang and her family will move into a new apartment
in about two months.
</P>
<P>
Toasting with a glass of Coke in hand, Wang said that she
expects to decorate the new apartment in a way that will make it a
cozy new home.

The nuclear power plant is now undergoing the third phase of
its construction project, and workers have forgone their Spring
Festival vacation, the most important season for family reunions
in China.
</P>
<P>
"We must finish the work as scheduled," said Yu Fajiang, who is
guiding workers as they cautiously pour cement stirred with warm
water because the temperature is rather low, "we'll join our
families tomorrow and return here three days later because a new
process will start then."
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongxiao from Beijing is now in charge of the exchange of
documents and blueprints between the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant
and Canada. While his son joined him in Qinshan, his wife is also
busy, working abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a real family reunion when the nuclear power plant
is completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Guilin, the famous tourist destination in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, is greeting the new Year of the Dragon
amid grand-scale urban construction, and more than 1,000 workers
are in full swing around many construction sites.
</P>
<P>
The scenic city is putting on a new face by renovating its old
streets and buildings. Mayor Li Jinzao said that Guilin will
become a large park with clean water, many bridges, trees and
flowers, and sculptures by renowned Chinese and overseas artists.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a city of immigrants, used to see more than half of
its residents leave during the Spring Festival. But tonight this
city next to Hong Kong is filled with a festive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Li Zibin has invited 1,000 immigrant workers to a
dumpling feast to celebrate the season. Thanks to the
contributions from people in other places, Shenzhen has witnessed
admirable development over the past years.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Caricaturist Arrested for Insulting Hardline Cleric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary on
Saturday arrested Nik Ahang Kousar, a caricaturist of the reformist
daily Azad (Free), on charges of insulting a cleric in his
caricature which triggered a hardliners' sit-in in the central holy
city of Qom in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the branch 1410
of Tehran public court issued the arrest warrant on Kousar after
the press supervisory board and head of Tehran Justice Department
filed a suit against him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court also ordered managing director of the daily
Mohammad Reza Yazdpanah to appear in the court on Sunday to give an
explanation for publishing the insulting caricature, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Azad on Sunday published Kousar's caricature, in which a
prominent hardline religious instructor Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi
Mesbah Yazdi was drawn as a crocodile.
</P>
<P>
The caricature was published after Yazdi was reported to have
claimed that former head of the United States' Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) visited Iran with a briefcase of U.S. dollars to
Iranian reformist dailies.
</P>
<P>
The moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani soon urged the authorities to probe into the case and
moderate newspapers called for prosecuting and trying Yazdi for his
claim.
</P>
<P>
However, Yazdi denied the report and claimed that his speech was
distorted by newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Thousand of hardline clerics and religious students on Wednesday
started a sit-in in the holy city of Qom in protest to the
caricature and urged President Mohammad Khatami to sack Mohajerani
for tolerating the "insult" to Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in continued on Saturday and even the Society of the
Instructors of Qom Seminary announced its support for the sit-in
and castigated what it called "desecration of sanctities and
disrespect for the religious personalities."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Kousar and the daily Azad might
face serious punishment ahead of the sensitive parliamentary
elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary polls will be a battle between the moderates
who support President Khatami and the powerful conservatives, who
still dominate the country's major state organs.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Worth Millions Smuggled Into Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Zimbabwean dollars
worth of drugs alleged to suppress HIV virus are being smuggled
into the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, medicines used to treat sexually transmitted
diseases are being stolen from district hospitals to feed the
growing market, the daily Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled drugs are in most cases sold long after their
expiry dates, raising fears among experts that they could be
harmful to users.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Herald on Friday, Minister of Health
and Child Welfare Ministry Timothy Stamps said he was concerned
that some cunning business people were taking advantage of the
AIDS pandemic to defraud people of their hard-earned money.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no drug or vaccine that can suppress the HIV
virus.  He also took a swipe at the police he accused of not
being interested in assisting his ministry in its efforts to deal
with drug thefts from hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Leaders Underscore Secularism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said on Saturday that the Turkish nation will make the
secular regime "live forever," reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a message issued upon the 63th anniversary of the adoption of
the secularism principle in the Constitution, the president said
that "all ugly and inhumanitarian actions directed at secular
Turkish republic will be eliminated by the resolution of our state
and common sense of our people."
</P>
<P>
"The target of the Turkish republic is to reach the level of
modern civilization and to make its citizens benefit from the
advantages of modern life," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
"Secularism was adopted as a constitutional principle in 1937
after the reforms carried out in other sections of the social life.
Turkish nation has adopted secularism as a principle of political
life and it will never give up it claim of modernity," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish constitution, the Republic of Turkey
is "a democratic, secular social legal state."
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the pro-fundamentalist Welfare Party (RP) led
by former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan was closed for anti-
secularist activities.
</P>
<P>
The Virtue Party (FP), which came into being a few months after
the RP's closure, has been accused in recent months of pursuing the
same anti-secular line as the RP and is reportedly facing possible
banning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities have mounted a nation-wide crackdown
on the clandestine Islamic organization Hezbollah, which wants to
set up a fundamentalist regime in the overwhelmingly Muslim-
populated Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In his message addressed to the 63th secularism-adopting
anniversary, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said "Turkey will
continue to walk in the path drawn by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the
founder of modern Turkey."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardline Clerics Urge Sacking of Moderate Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of hardline clerics in
the Iranian holy city of Qom has urged President Mohammad Khatami
to sack the moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani for tolerating what they called the "insult" of
reformist newspapers to a prominent hardline cleric.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement in a sit-in protest, the clerics said that
their demand is not limited to the closure of a daily or an apology
from several "anti-Islamic" newspapers or "those run by the agents
of the world arrogance."
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
on Saturday, accused Mohajerani's ministry of allowing journalists
of some newspapers, banned for what the conservatives called anti-
Islamic offences, to "proceed with their conspiracy" in other
newspapers published immediately after the closure of the former
ones.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that thousands of clerics and
religious students staged a sit-in protest in Qom since Wednesday
after a reformist daily published a caricature on Sunday, in which
a religious instructor, Ayatollah Mohammd Taqi Mesbah Yazdi, was
drawn as a crocodile.
</P>
<P>
The caricature was printed after Yazdi was reported to have said
that former head of the United States Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) visited Iran with a briefcase of U.S. dollars to Iranian
reformist dailies.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani soon urged concerned authorities to probe into the
case and moderate newspapers called for prosecuting and trying
Yazdi for his claim. However, Yazdi denied the report and said his
speech was distorted by newspapers.
</P>
<P>
IRNA also reported that the Society of the Instructors of Qom
Seminary has announced its support for the sit-in and castigated
what it called "desecration of sanctities and disrespect for the
religious personalities."
</P>
<P>
The society called for "tranquility and calm" ahead of the
sensitive parliamentary elections slated for February 18, which is
expected to create a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the powerful conservatives, who
dominate most of the country's important state organs, intended to
put more pressures on the reformists with an aim to strengthen
their dominance on the Majlis (parliament) ahead of the polls.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections will be a battle between the
moderates who support President Khatami's reformist policies and
the conservatives who have lost some ground since Khatami's
election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, different political factions have run into a chaotic
wrangling after a split erupted inside the moderate camp between
the pro-Khatami leftists and the central-rightists who support
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani to run for the elections.

<HEADLINE> IRA Rejects "British" Disarmament Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army said
on Saturday it posed no threat to peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the guerrilla group said it believed the
current political crisis could be averted and the disarmament
issue resolved but not on British or Protestant Unionist terms nor
could it be advanced by "British legislative threats".
</P>
<P>
The IRA's statement was issued to a Belfast radio station as
David Trimble, leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party,
met Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein,for
crucial talks on the flagging peace process.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said it was firmly committed to the Northern Ireland
peace process but would not be bullied into disarming on anybody
else's terms.
</P>
<P>
It added that it recognized that the issue of disarmament
needed to be dealt with "in an acceptable way."
</P>
<P>
"The IRA has never entered into any agreement, undertaking or
understanding at any time with anyone on any aspect of
decommissioning. We have not broken our commitment or betrayed
anyone,"it said.
</P>
<P>
The republican guerrilla group also criticized Britain's
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson for saying that the IRA
has not honored its objectives.
</P>
<P>
The face-to-face meeting between Trimble and Adams was welcomed
by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. He said he hoped it would
help build trust and confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased that meeting is going to take place. I think
that will be an important part of what we are trying to achieve. I
hope the meeting goes well," he told Irish radio.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he didn't know if the IRA would disarm but warned
that an assurance must be given that movement would be made before
May -- the deadline set in the landmark peace deal for completion
of guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Behind-the-scenes talks are expected to continue in London,
Dublin and Belfast to resolve the disarmament row.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece Wants Peace in the Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis stressed here Saturday that Greece wants peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ruling party conference, Simitis said that Greece
wants peace with Turkey, adding that a fair and viable solution
must be found to the Cyprus problem, based on the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Turkey is called to contribute toward this
direction.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem,
who arrived here Thursday for an official three-day visit, also
hoped Saturday that the relations between Greece and Turkey will
continue to develop in a satisfactory way in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the two-day Greek-Turkish Journalist
Conference in Athens, Cem said that the press in both countries
has contributed greatly to the improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The rapprochement can take place by taking under consideration
the sensitivity of the two countries on certain issues, he said,
adding that if there is a will then bilateral problems can be
solved.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey have been at odds over their
territorial dispute in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but
the two long-time rivals have since last June taken positive steps
to improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the two countries have since late January signed
nine agreements for bilateral cooperation in a variety of sectors.

<HEADLINE> S. African Clarifies Bugging Act on German Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Affairs Department said on Saturday the government's setting up of
bugging devices outside the German Embassy last year was "handled
in an overzealous manner" by the intelligence operatives.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, a camera, which
was a counter-offensive device, was set up outside the German
Embassy in Pretoria by the South African National Intelligence
Agency in 1995 after several experienced South Africans were
reportedly approached by the Germans to work for their
intelligence network.
</P>
<P>
The embassy found the bugging device about two months ago and
the German ambassador immediately condemned the bugging act and
asked the South African government to clarify the incident.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation revealed that although the act was conducted
in the scope and framework of duty, it was nonetheless handled in
an overzealous manner by the intelligence operatives," South
African Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said that the German ambassador has expressed
satisfaction at the outcome of this investigation and will convey
the result to the German government.

for production of greenhouse fodder and will save up to 98 percent
of water usage, the Kuwait News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The project, established by the American company AV Technology
International with the participation of the Offset Program, aims at
constructing greenhouses that can control temperature, water, gas
and light. The total cost of the project will be 52 million Kuwaiti
dinars (171.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Director General of Kuwait's AMS Economic Consultative Company
Hussein Al-Saeed said that the green fodder project is vital in the
agricultural domain as the employment of modern technology allows
the production of pollution-free fodder in limited land and with
the consumption of a small quantity of water.
</P>
<P>
Al-Saeed said Kuwait presently imports 21 tons of green fodder
each year. The new plant will be able to satisfy Kuwait's needs in
about five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Offset Program was established in July 1992 by the Kuwaiti
government in a bid to attract foreign investment and benefit from
foreign expertise in establishing key state projects.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, all foreign contractors awarded government
contracts of over 1 million dinars (3.3 million dollars) bear an
obligation to invest in the country a capital equal to 30 percent
of the contract's value within eight years. Fifty percent of this
obligation must be fulfilled during the first four years.
</P>
<P>
Contractors from the United States, Europe and Japan have been
actively involved in the program in bridge construction, sewage
water, industrial and sanitary waste treatment and medical
information transferring.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Briefs Jordan on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian delegation
headed by Minister of Information of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), Yasser Abed Rabbo, arrived here Saturday to brief
Jordan on the latest developments of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo, also PNA minister of culture and arts, briefed
Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib on Thursday's
meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Abed Rabbo, who is also head of the Palestinian
delegation to the final status talks with Israel, was part of a
consultation mechanism between Jordan and the Palestinians on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo reiterated a Palestinian demand that ongoing peace
talks should discuss the maps of redeployment of Israeli troops
from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank, which had been scheduled
on January 20 but was postponed until mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The Barak-Arafat summit meeting failed to end the land disputes
occurring in the peace talks, and the Palestinians had vowed to
establish an independent state no later than September regardless
of the result of their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Khatib reiterated Jordan's support for the rights
of the Palestinians, including the establishment of an independent
state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
Khatib noted that Jordan would exert all efforts to help
overcome obstacles standing in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
which Jordan believed is a core issue to achieve a just, durable
and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been a key peace broker in the region after it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second Arab country
next to Egypt to strike a peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Israeli cabinet has given its green light
to the 6.1 percent troop withdrawal from the Western Bank, but
there are sharp differences between Israeli and Palestinians
negotiators as to which areas should be targeted for the
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Canada's TSE Reaches Record 9,209 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Just in one and a half months,
Canada's benchmark TSE 300 composite index reached another record
high at 9209.20, up 314.81 points, at the Toronto Stock Exchange
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The TSE has chalked up a gain of 9.45 percent this year, making
it the world's second-best-performing major equity index behind
the 10.87 percent gains by Sweden's OMX Index, according to local
media.
</P>
<P>
The 3.54 percent rise was dominated by gains of high-tech
Nortel and BCE companies, which account for almost 30 percent of
the TSE 300.
</P>
<P>
Nortel gained 18 Canadian dollars (about 12.49 U.S. dollars)
or 11.8 percent to 171 Canadian dollars (about 118.69 U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
BCE, which holds 39.2 percent of Notel, hit a record high of
171 Canadian dollars (about 118.69 U.S. dollars), up 14.25 dollars
(about 9.89 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The tech-led gains have been forming an upward trend, breaking
the 8,000 mark in mid-December last year, pushing through 9,000
Friday and aiming at the magic 10,000 level already gained by the
Dow Jones industrial average.

<HEADLINE> Wilkens: Higgins Unfairly Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Hawks Coach Lenny
Wilkens, president of the National Basketball Coaches Association,
said his organization would have fought to have the Golden State
Warriors release assistant coach Rod Higgins from his contract so
he could become the interim coach of the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
Washington wanted to hire Higgins after Gar Head was dismissed
last Saturday. The Warriors refused to release Higgins after
Washington declined to provide compensation for Higgin's services.
The Wizards hired former Bullets guard and Toronto Raptors coach
Darrell Walker.
</P>
<P>
While Wilkens did not blame the Wizards for hiring Walker, he
believes that if they had been more patient, an agreement could
have been worked out so Higgins could have taken over.
</P>
<P>
"If they would have waited, it could have been done, I believe,
" Wilkens told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "When I heard
about it I immediately went to Micahel Goldberg, executive
director of the coaches association, but it was too late. We
talked to the NBA office, however, and expressed our concerns. We
don't want to see this kind of thing happening again."
</P>
<P>
Wilkens said he was upset that Higgins was denied a chance at a
promotion, which, for the most part, is viewed as a breach of an
unwritten rule among coaches. However, some league officials said
it is uncommon for a coach under contract to switch teams during
the season.
</P>
<P>
"It's not right," Wilkens said. "If you're going after somebody
's head coach it's a different story. That's a lateral move. But
when an assistant has a chance to make that step, it's a
absolutely unfair to stand in his way like that."
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said he would like the NBA to set guidelines so coaches
cannot be held from accepting a promotion.

<HEADLINE> Russians Fly Flag Over Maskhadov's Residence in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops raised
their flag Friday over the residence of Chechen leader Aslan
Maskhadov in the breakaway republic's capital of Grozny, said the
Russian military Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops continued to chase the rebels in and around the
city as some 5,000 rebels had fled to the mountains in the south
to regroup.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Kazantsev, commander of Russian federal forces in the
North Caucasus, said federal troops have controlled most districts
and major facilities in the city and the military operation in
Grozny is close to completion.
</P>
<P>
A Russian NTV live showed many soldiers in Grozny gulped
celebrating shots of vodka and sang atop their armored personnel
carriers. One group painted a sign "We did it" over the charred
remains of a central Grozny building which once housed Maskhadov's
rebel government.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, adding a confident note to the campaign, Russian
Deputy Chief of Staff General Valery Manilov said the Kremlin had
made preparations for a "significant" pullout from Chechnya soon.
</P>
<P>
"The situation allows us to reduce the number of troops" in
Chechnya, said Manilov, adding that a 25,000-strong force will be
permanently deployed in the republic once the anti-terrorist
operation is over.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is still too early to proclaim Russia's all-
out victory in Chechnya and "the most important thing now is to
catch rebels" before they reach the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said Saturday that more than 50 rebels
have been killed over the past 24 hours when they tried to break
out of the city.
</P>
<P>
Most of rebel groups trying to escape shattered Grozny are
heading for the southern Argun valley to join the local militant
groups and some are trying to advance west into the neighboring
republic of Ingushetia or south towards the mountains, said the
military.
</P>
<P>
It warned that rebel leaders are continuing preparations for
terrorist raids on Chechnya's areas under federal control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian federal troops are battling militants
fleeing Grozny in the Alkhan-Yurt, Alkhan-Kala, and Zakan-Yurt
villages around the capital, where more than 600 rebels have been
blockaded.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reaffirms Opposition to U.S. Pro-Taiwan Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday reaffirmed
its opposition to the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act passed by
the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this week, which
regulates closer military contacts between the U.S. and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Moscow opposes the bill aiming to strengthen Taiwan's security
by military means, which has been approved by the House despite
objections from its administration as well as protests and
warnings from China, said the Russian Foreign Ministry in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of this legislative act, which is being submitted
to the Senate for consideration, "will hardly contribute to better
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan straits and to the
overall situation in the Asian and Pacific region," says the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that "Russia, as known, recognizes Taiwan as an
inalienable part of China, and the government of the People's
Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of that
country, including Taiwan province."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the so-
called Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which the Clinton
administration had said it may veto because it undermines the
stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which will hurt the U.S.-China relations and was
strongly condemned by the Chinese government, was approved 341 to
70 in the Republican-led chamber.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require the U.S. defense secretary to
establish direct communication with military forces in Taiwan,
increase training operations, allow more Taiwanese military
officers to attend U.S. military academies and require annual
Pentagon reports on threats to Taiwan's security.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A huge chafing dish ten
meters in diameter and capable of holding 20 tons of food was
confirmed here today as the largest of its kind in the world by
the Shanghai Office of the Guinness Book of World Record.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic dish is made of stainless steel and is heated
electrically, consuming 3,700 kwh an hour and capable of feeding
68 people at one sitting.
</P>
<P>
According to one chef, at least 5 tons of hot peppers, 1.5 tons
of "huajiao," a kind of Chinese spice, 2 tons of salt, 10 tons of
salad oil, and a large amount of other spices are needed for the
dish to start boiling and fast-cooking a variety of meat and
vegetable slices.
</P>
<P>
The pot will boil for 15 days starting today.
</P>
<P>
Chafing dish reportedly originates in Chongqing, the largest
municipality in southwest China, in the early 20th century, and is
well-known for cooking very spicy dishes.
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 40,000 restaurants in the city offering
these kinds of dishes, employing over 100,000 people and with
combined business turnover of 2 billion yuan (241 million U.S.
dollars) a year, over half of the city's total restaurant income.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Breaks Out in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fightings broke out
Friday and continued on Saturday in southern Somalia, causing
civilian deaths and hundreds of families to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the forces of the Islamic courts
controlling Lower Shabelleh region and the advancing Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA) claiming the region flared up Friday
afternoon at Garawleh bridge, just 10 km south of Kurtunwarrey
district, when the RRA fighters tried to take Kurtunwarrey
district, one of the main towns of Lower Shabelleh region, about
150 km South of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families fled the district as the fighting got
closer and closer to their town at about 5:00 p.m. local time.
The fighting also affected the villages of Muruq-Mal and Aflow
close to the town, where dozens of families also abandoned their
huts, makeshift houses and farms last night.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available so far, however
villagers confirmed the death of more than five people mainly
civilians during the fighting that lasted for more than three
hours.
</P>
<P>
The fighting again resumed early Saturday morning as more than
five battle wagons and nearly 150 heavily armed Islamic
reinforcement militiamen gathered from around the region have
attacked the RRA fighters at Bundo- Labad of Kurtunwarrey
district.
</P>
<P>
According to the eyewitnesses contacted on the short-wave
radios, both sides displayed a serious fighting as the Islamic
militiamen were decisive in taking control of the strategic
bridge, while the RRA fighters also showed stiff resistance on
their side. Both sides used heavy machine guns and anti-tank guns
together with assault rifles during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
After 10:00 a.m. this morning the RRA fighters were dislodged
from the Bundo-Labad and the fighting spread to Dhayney and
Bananey villages where again more exodus of refugees was reported.

<HEADLINE> Guarding Ancient Tombs at New Year's Eve (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- With thick stick and flashlight
at his hand, Wen Yanhua kept patrolling in darkness around the
ancient tombs on the night of February 4, the eve of Chinese lunar
New Year.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rest at ease because the ghouls usually launch
actions at the New Year's eve", said Wen, 22, farmer, and a
voluntary guard for the numerous ancient tombs in the Jishan town
under Jingmen city in Hubei province, central China.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of New Year, more and more villagers set off
firecrackers everyday. "Too much firecracker is not a good news,
tomb robbers will operate under the sound of firecracker explosion,
" Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Like Wen, about other 140 volunteers stayed tonight with tombs
and buried relics in stead of their families.
</P>
<P>
Wen's hometown used to be under the rule of Chu, the strongest
state about 2,300 years ago, which gave birth to famous Taoism and
left enormous tombs of aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
"One can find out precious cultural relics when randomly
digging some place here," said Cui Renyi, local archaeologist,
adding that there are about 297 tombs above earth covering an area
of around 12 square kilometers, excluding plenty of those under
ground.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Cui with his colleges unearthed here more than 800
pieces of bamboo slips with Confucian and Taoism masterworks
written on them, which is regarded as one of most important and
profound events in world archaeology.
</P>
<P>
One year after this discovery, a well-preserved 2,500-year-old
female corpse, stolen by local villagers and regained soon by
police, was confirmed after experts' examination as the oldest one
among the ever found.

The former underground funerary objects and dead bodies fell
unfortunately targets of some tomb robbers and international
smuggling groups. Before 1997, a couple of serious tomb robberies
took place in the town, and three local villagers involved were
convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Quan Chunjin, top official of the town, said that effective
measures have been taken to arouse villagers' awareness of
protecting cultural heritage and to date, no participation of
local residents in tomb robberies have been found since the year
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, tomb robberies by persons other than the local
residents have never stopped.
</P>
<P>
"To protect the tombs is just like protecting our environment,
and each person is responsible for it," said Wen, who guards the
tombs day and night and only gets token payment of 200 yuan (23 US
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Too much underground relics forbid intensive cultivation and
makes good harvest less possible. What's more, some volunteers
have become revenge target of criminal robbers. Just days before
the lunar New Year, Wen's beloved dog was killed with poison by a
unknown suspect.
</P>
<P>
"The farmers have never benefited from the tombs, which, on the
contrary, brought burden and loss to them," Quan said. Some young
people complain their forefathers of inhabiting near ancient tombs.
</P>
<P>
But Wen and his fellow men still persist in the voluntary job.
"The tombs are a treasure to our country and even the whole world,
I feel no regret," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Quan, the government is planning to develop local
tourism resources and expecting the income of tourism industry
will give more economic aid to the farmers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Greet Spring with Refreshed Hopes(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More Chinese people are becoming increasingly hi-tech savvy,
and now use telecommunications to extend festival greetings
instead of visiting their relatives and friends. Shenyang, a
northeast China city with 4.8 million people, had a 20-minute
traffic jam on its telephone paging system as one million users
thronged to the phone at midnight on lunar New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
As they used more of these new products of the information
revolution, many Chinese remain eager to preserve traditional
customs. Despite a ban on firecrackers, Guangzhou residents in
south China's Guangdong Province made colored lamps in the shape
of firecrackers and added audio tracks of the loud bangs to
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in east China's Shandong Province printed the words of
folk songs on festival paintings, and people in north China's
Shanxi Province inscribed historic and scenic sites with the word
"dragon."
</P>
<P>
Dragon lanterns and bonfires were lit in places such as Nanjing
in east China's Jiangsu Province, the city of Shenyang in
northeast China's Liaojing Province, and Inner Mongolia in north
China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese people are also faced with challenges in
their bid to make China take off like a flying dragon.
</P>
<P>
As the New Year comes in, the government of Anhui Province in
east China has allotted more than 52 million yuan to buy food for
laid off-workers living at the subsistence line, and the
provincial federation of trade unions opened a 24-hour hotline for
emergency relief for workers having difficulties during this most
important Chinese festival.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, during the Spring Festival holiday, about 1.
2 million travelers are expected to line up at the Gongbei border
gate in Macao to exit and enter inland China. Most of them are
from Taiwan, and because there are no direct air links across the
Taiwan Straits, visitors have to take a roundabout way through
Macao.
</P>
<P>
As bells tolled 108 times in an ancient temple in northwest
Beijing, the country stands at the threshold of a future full
hopes and great expectations.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese people
celebrated the first Year of the Dragon of the new millennium,
they embraced a brave new world of prosperity, hi-tech, and future
challenges with high hopes.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of the lunar New Year this morning, reverend
monk Pufa tolled the bell in an ancient temple in east China's
Fujian Province to save the souls lost to drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
"This is the sound of hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
He uses the sound of the bell to bless the new millennium and
mankind.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese people have become better off and closer to the
outside world, they have come to know the happiness and challenges
of being wealthy.
</P>
<P>
The tropical beaches of Hainan Island are one of the top
tourist destinations during this Spring Festival holiday. More
than 300,000 tourists are crowding the hotels on this second
largest island in China, including 250 boarding houses in local
households. Hotel prices have doubled or tripled, and everything
must be paid in advance.
</P>
<P>
The lunar New Year has also brought new hope to the consumption
market, which plays a key role in reversing the trend toward
deflation the China economy has suffered over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 apartments were sold in the city of Haikou in
Hainan Province over the past ten days, while residents in Chengdu
in southwest China's Sichuan Province were driving some 500,000
private cars to go shopping and sightseeing during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Citizens in Shanghai and in the city of Urumqi in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ordered catered food for
dinner parties at home and hired house cleaners from household
service companies.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Tianjin in north China now regard dinner parties,
travel, shopping, sightseeing, and festival fairs the top
activities for the week-long Spring Festival holiday.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Can Meet Revenue Target: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed confidence here Saturday that with his new
economic team,the government can meet the revenue target of 568
billion pesos (14 billion U.S. dollars) it set for this year.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said: "This year, we
expect to reach our target. The Bureau of Customs (BOC) meet its
January target by 500 million peso (12 million dollars), and I
expect the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to do the same."
</P>
<P>
These, he said, would complement the cost-cutting measures his
administration has adopted to save on government funds.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, the president appointed Jose Pardo as new finance
secretary, Dakila Fonacier as BIR commissioner and Ramon Farolan
as BOC commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"The new economic team headed by Secretary Pardo is studying
all means to encourage the public to pay the proper amount of
taxes. I am confident we can meet our targets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from these, Estrada said, his administration has adopted
belt-tightening measures, such as restrictions on foreign travels,
cut-backs on non-priority expenses and the freeze on hiring of new
government employees.
</P>
<P>
The president asked local government units to support the
austerity drive of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government had a budget deficit of 113.6 billion
pesos (2.81 billion dollars) as it failed to meet its revenue
target.

state-owned mass media, including radio and television stations,
senior government officials told a seminar this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Health Authorities Concerned About Smuggled Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean health
authorities are concerned about the smuggled drugs believed to be
able to suppress HIV, the Herald newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Health and Child Welfare Timothy Stamps
said he is concerned that some cunning business people are taking
advantage of the AIDS pandemic to defraud people of their
hard-earned money.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled drugs are in most cases sold long after their
expiry dates, raising fears among experts that they could be
harmful to users.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the anti-retroviral drugs are known to cause serious
damage to the body if discontinued.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that the HIV virus only changes its
characteristics and re-emerges in an even stronger form if the
course is discontinued.
</P>
<P>
Users pay through the nose as a full course for HIV treatment
can cost up to 30,000 Zimbabwean dollars (790 U.S. dollars) a
month.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said that his ministry was finding it difficult to
control the practice because dealers had arrangements with some
British and American suppliers of alternative medicines.
</P>
<P>
Drugs worth millions of dollars are reportedly being smuggled
into the southern African country while medicines used to treat
sexually transmitted diseases are being stolen from district
hospitals every day to feed the growing market.
</P>
<P>
Stamps also accused the police of not being interested in
assisting his ministry in its efforts to deal with drug thefts
from hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Former Ethiopian PM Convicted of Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Ethiopian Prime
Minister Tamirat Layne has been convicted of corruption and abuse
of power during his term of office, the Monitor newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in Addis Ababa Thursday convicted Tamirat of
involving an illegal 16-million-U.S. dollar deal to export textile
products and of using his power to export 1,000 tons of state
coffee worth 3.6 million dollars through a bogus firm.
</P>
<P>
The court also found him of fraudulently winning a tender to
supply construction equipment and of awarding a tender for road
maintenance to a certain bidder when cheaper bids had been
received.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat became prime minister of the interim government soon
after the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
overthrew Mengistu Haile Mariam's rule in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He became deputy prime minister in 1995 when Meles Zenawi
became prime minister under a new federal constitution.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat stepped down in October 1997 and has been in jail
since.
</P>
<P>
The court is due to sentence Tamirat next Thursday. He could be
jailed for between three and 25 years. He cannot appeal against
either the conviction or the sentence, legal experts said.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between EU, ACP States Fruitful: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The outcome of talks between the
European Union and the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
countries for a successor arrangement to the Lome IV Convention
was generally favorable for the ACP states as important agreements
were reached on all outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira
said in a statement on Friday that the agreements concluded in the
Belgian capital, Brussels, implied that Zimbabwe would continue to
benefit from the current trade preferences during an eight-year
transitional period when new negotiations on trade and economic
arrangements would be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
He said, "duty-free or reduced duty for most of Zimbabwean
exports to the EU shall continue to benefit from this
dispensation. This also means that Zimbabwe's current quotas of
9,100 tons and 30,225 tons of beef and sugar, respectively, will
remain in place."
</P>
<P>
He said major outcomes include the agreement on the
transitional period - - March 1, 2000 to December 31, 2007 --
during which the new negotiations on trade and economic
arrangements with the EU shall be negotiated and concluded.
</P>
<P>
The minister led a Zimbabwean delegation to the ACP-EU Council
of Ministers meeting in Brussels from February 2 to 3.
</P>
<P>
He added Zimbabwe was currently allocated 110 million euro
under the five-year eight EDF. These funds will be disbursed once
the mid-term review program has been approved by the EU.

<HEADLINE> EAC to Tackle Invading Hyacinth in Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The member states of the
East African Community (EAC), Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, have
agreed to form a team of experts to try to find ways to control
invading water hyacinth and weeds in Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
An official with the EAC Secretariat based in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha has said that the immediate task for the
team will be to make an environmental impact assessment of the
hyacinth and weeds which cover an estimated 12,000 hectares in the
lake.
</P>
<P>
Namajeje Weggoro, a senior economist, told local media on
Friday that significant amounts of hyacinth and weeds are also
found in other water bodies such as Lake Kyoga in Uganda, Lake
Naivasha in Kenya and Rivers Sigi and Pangani in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The widespread distribution and rapid proliferation of the
water hyacinth in the past 10 years have had severe socio-economic
and environmental impact in the East African region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the EAC Council of Ministers, the team of experts
will be part of the overall Lake Victoria Environment Management
Project (LVEMP). An East African ministerial meeting on water
hyacinth held last August agreed that the economic utilization of
water hyacinth has not been exploited fully.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had also approved some methods such as biological,
chemical and physical controls and ecological succession to
contain the Lake Victoria weeds problem.
</P>
<P>
The lake and its basin has a gross domestic product (GDP) of
three to four billion U.S. dollars supporting a population of more
than 25 million people in the region.

<HEADLINE> Manila Promises to Provide Assistance to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada assured East Timor leaders Saturday of the Philippines'
commitment to help rebuild East Timor's economy, particularly
through human resources development.
</P>
<P>
According to Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes, Estrada made the
promise during a meeting with visiting East Timor leaders Jose
Alexander Gusmao and Jose Ramos-Horta, who arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they asked the Philippines to help in the
rehabilitation of East Timor especially the area of the economy,
and in particular, in human resource development," said Reyes, who
was present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two East Timor leaders acknowledged that the
Philippines has a very good educational system, and they want to
send their students to study in Philippine schools.
</P>
<P>
Reyes added the two leaders suggested that this be done in two
phases -- firstly, for them to send their students in the
Philippines and later their technicians to learn agriculture and
fish farming.
</P>
<P>
"So as far as these areas are concerned, the president said the
Philippines can really help them. The Philippines can accommodate
East Timor students as well as technicians who would want to come
to the Philippines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that Gusmao invited Estrada to visit East Timor and
Estrada said that he may visit Filipino peace-keepers stationed
there.

<HEADLINE> Russian Tanker Detained by U.S. to Be Transferred to Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian tanker Volgoneft
held in the Persian Gulf by the U.S. Navy is going to be
transferred to Oman, the Russian Transportation Ministry said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the Volgoneft-147 on Wednesday was prompted by
suspicions that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Now the vessel is heading in the direction of the Omani port
and is being escorted by a U.S. warship, said the ministry in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Russian shipping company Transpetro, owner of the tanker, is
trying to establish contact with the tanker captain. However, the
efforts have been futile so far, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It complained that the U.S. has not lifted the ban on
communications with the vessel. Communications with Volgoneft was
interrupted after its seizure.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told the press
Friday that the U.S. had assured the Russian side that radio
contact with the tanker will be fully restored very soon.
</P>
<P>
The ship captain has been allowed to establish contact with the
Russian Embassy in the United Arab Emirates and the company which
owns the vessel, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reaffirms No Talks With Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Moscow will not negotiate with
any terrorists, in particular the Chechen rebels' field commander
Shamil Basayev, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"In the system of the political settlement of the so-called
Chechen problem, there is no, and cannot be, room for talks with
terrorists," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal by the prominent Russian politician
and businessman Boris Berezovsky to begin a political dialogue to
reach a settlement in Chechnya, Yastrzhembsky said, "There is
common sense in the State Duma deputy's arguments when he speaks
about the necessity of a political decision for settling the
problem."
</P>
<P>
"What is now going on in Chechnya, namely, the military phase
of the operation, is preparing the ground for this. In the end,
the Chechen problem can evidently be solved by means of political
procedures," Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
On Berezovsky's proposal to hold talks with Shamil Basayev and
other rebel field commanders, Yastrzhembsky said, "it is
impossible to agree on this."
</P>
<P>
"A political settlement is possible after the (Chechen)
military bases are wiped out, the militant rebels are neutralized
or eliminated and all well-known international terrorists, above
all Basayev, are arrested," Yastrzhembsky noted.

<HEADLINE> CAF Chief on 2006 World Cup Bidding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBAI, Februray 5 (Xinhua) -- African Football Confederation (
CAF) president Issa Hayatou warned Saturday that Africa's chance
of hosting the 2006 World Cup soccer tournament could be ruined if
South Africa and Morocco persist in putting up rival bids.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the Dubai daily emirati al-Ittihad newspaper,
Hayatou said: "If the two countries don't reach agreement and
refuse to coordinate (their position) it will be catastrophic for
the dreams of every African, and we will present the competition
to Europe."
</P>
<P>
"For the first time the occasion is right for Africa to host
the football World Cup (in 2006). But it might be that the chance
is missed if Morocco and South Africa continue to present their
separate bids," the 53-year-old CAF chief added.
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that Morocco and South Africa reach agreement,
before it's too late," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Once again Hayatou would not be drawn on siding with either
country.
</P>
<P>
The 2006 decision will be taken by FIFA's 24-strong executive
committee, which includes Hayatou, in Zurich next July and pits
the two African countries against England, Germany and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Sets Off Tourism Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Cold weather fails to stop
Chinese people from going out for a trip. An official with the
National Tourism Administration (NTA) predicted that during the
Spring Festival holidays, the number of domestic tourists will far
exceed 18 million as recorded at the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that tourist spending during the most important Chinese
festival this year is expected to have a sharp increase over last
year's 14 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have 7 days off in running on the occasion
of Spring Festival this year, including three days of festival
holidays and four week-end days.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Chinese State Council decided to extend public
holidays, and as a result, the country's tourist spots and scenic
areas have received many more tourists during the 50th National
Day on October 1 last year. They have all made detailed
preparations in a bid to make good use of the Spring Festival to
attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to related sources, large travel services have sold
out all the tickets two weeks ahead of the lunar new year for
traveling abroad; while Hainan, Yunnan and some other provinces in
south China continue to be top destinations for domestic traveling.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the Haikou Airport will serve over 30,000
tourists daily at peak times during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ice and snow activities in northeast China's
Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces are also very attractive to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The NTA official called on tourism departments and the whole
tourism industry to open new programs and improve services to
promote tourism development.
</P>
<P>
He said that tourism administrative departments have opened
hotlines that operate around-the-clock for tourists to deal with
their difficulties during the holidays.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Build Modern Labs for Fish in Victoria Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will construct
two fish laboratories to ensure sustainability of its fish
industry along the Victoria Lake, the Minister for Natural
Resources and Tourism has said.
</P>
<P>
Zakia Meghji, quoted by local newspapers, told stakeholders in
the fish industry in north-western town of Mwanza on Friday that
her ministry was presently discussing with various donors to
support the project.
</P>
<P>
She said that one referral fish laboratory in Dar es Salaam and
one microbiology laboratory in Mwanza would enable Tanzania as
well as neighboring countries to test fish samples.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has spent some 112,000 U.S. dollars to send fish
samples to Europe for testing in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"We should maintain zero tolerance for illegal fishing in Lake
Victoria" she said, adding that inspectors have been directed to
be extra watchful for the defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Meghji also flagged off three flights to inaugurate the
resumption of fillet export to the lucrative European Union
market.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has resumed its fish fillets export to Europe this
week following a 10-month ban, which was still active for its two
neighboring countries along the lake, Uganda and Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Establish Drug Supplies Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will soon
 establish an agency to handle the supply of drugs to health
facilities nationwide, the People daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The organization, named the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency, will
be responsible for planning, procuring and distribution of drugs
to over 3,000 health facilities in the country, Kenyan Minister
Amukowa Anangwe for Medical Services said in the capital Nairobi
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the new agency will work as a separate
and independent entity from his ministry, and operate on its own
so that it can make money and keep drug stocks at the required
level to benefit as many Kenyans as possible.
</P>
<P>
Anangwe noted that his government has been spending more than
2.3 billion shillings ( around 32 million U.S. dollars) every
year in the procurement of drugs, saying that Kenya contributes
only 40 percent of the money while the rest comes from donor
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the agency with a board of director will plan and set
up a revolving fund, hence making good use of the money that the
government collects through the existing cost sharing scheme.
</P>
<P>
It will also come up with its own income generating projects
so that it does not depend solely on the government and the donor
community for its survival, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Needs 170,000 More Men to Match UN Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Police has to enlist
170,000 more people, from its current 130,000 men, to match the
United Nations' suggested police ratio world-wide.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Saturday quoted a
spokesman of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) as saying on Friday
in Abuja that shortage was resulted in a six-year embargo on
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations (UN) ratio of one policeman to 400 citizens
requires it to have no fewer than 300,000 officers and men for the
nation's 120 million people.
</P>
<P>
Officers and men have been retiring and dying from disease or
in their fight against criminals, as a result, our number has
depleted considerably, said Young Arebamen, who is also deputy
commissioner of police and head of the Police Force Public
Relations Department.
</P>
<P>
But the present administration was determined to boost the
strength of the police force, he said. The government would
recruit half of the short number before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Police stations in rural areas are short by 50 percent of
required manpower while those in urban areas are short by over 75
percent, said the paper citing its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
Arebamen said, however, that recruitment of personnel to reach
approved international standard may not alone curtail crime in
the society considering the high technology equipment employed to
detect crimes in Europe and the unwillingness of some Nigerians
to give information to the police.
</P>
<P>
If Nigerian police have cooperation from the public, crime will
reduce drastically like that is in other parts of the world, he
said.

NANJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,200 red-crowned
cranes, about a half of this species living in the world, have
passed winter safely and comfortably in a nature reserve in
Yancheng city in east China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
Located at the coast of the East China Sea, the national-level
reserve has been designated as part of the World Biological Circle

Birds Reservation Network.
</P>
<P>
Occupying a total area of 453,300 ha, the reserve hosts 337
varieties of birds, 45 kinds of amphibians and 281 species of fish.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Expatriates Remit 1.8 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Expatriate Bangladeshi workers
remitted about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars equivalent to Taka 88.82
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The amount is 12.97 percent higher in terms of dollar in
comparison to those in the previous year, according to a
provisional estimate.
</P>
<P>
A total of 268,182 people, both skilled and unskilled, got
employment in some 13 countries last year.
</P>
<P>
The highest amount of remittance was earned from expatriate
Bangladeshis in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, followed by those in
the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Although employment of Bangladeshi citizens abroad remained
almost static as compared to those in the previous year,
remittance from the sector last year showed a remarkable increase.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the reasons mainly to recent devaluation
of local currency, increase in export of skilled manpower and
decrease in semi-skilled and unskilled manpower.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 5, (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of the boys and
women who fell victims of traffickers remained untracked, said a
study report published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Only 18 percent of boys, girls and women who were in the grip
of traffickers due to socio-economic reasons and taken to India,
Pakistan and Middle East were rescued by the law enforcing
agencies, said the Report on Socio-Economic Correlates of Children
and Women Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, on an average 6,944 people were trafficked
every year. According to the study conducted by the Bangladesh
National Women Lawyers' Association (BNWLA), 14,551 women and
children were trafficked in 1997, followed by 10,475 in 1998 and 8,
600 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among all these cases, the BNWLA found that only 14 cases were
filed with police in 1999 and 9 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
BNWLA Executive Director Salma Ali said trafficking is being
done in the name of giving jobs abroad. She urged the government
to help organizations in getting return of many trafficked women
and children from neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Hits 20-Year High in TB Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis cases in New
Zealand have rocketed to a 20-year high, according to the figures
released Saturday by the New Zealand Institute of Environmental
Science and Research.
</P>
<P>
There were 452 cases of tuberculosis last year, registering an
increase of 84 cases from 1998 and the highest number since 1980
when 474 cases were diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
Based on the figures, New Zealand has a tuberculosis rate of 12.
5 cases per 100,000 of population, compared with a rate of about 5.
2 in Australia.
</P>
<P>
In the past 15 years, most of New Zealand's tuberculosis have
been derived from overseas, often imported by immigrants. But last
year this seemed to change greatly.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that there was an increase in the local
transmission of tuberculosis and about half the rise in cases last
year occurred among people who had lived their whole life in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, the number of cases in this category was dropping,
but it had since leapt from 99 cases to 157, comprising about 34
percent of the tuberculosis problem last year.

<HEADLINE> Army Chief Warns Situation in Indonesia Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Army Chief General
Tyasno Sudarto on Friday warned that the nation is facing danger
amid the apparent showdown between President Abdurrahman Wahid and
incumbent Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Gen.
Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, the situation is getting more dangerous and
uncertain. All people should, therefore, see the situation and
condition clearly," Army Chief of Staff Gen. Tyasno Sudarto was
quoted by Indonesian Observer newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid has asked Minister of Defense Juwono Sudarsono
to ask Wiranto to resign from his cabinet post following a report
by the Commission of Inquiry on Human Right Violation in East
Timor (KPP HAM)that the former commander of the Indonesian
National Forces (TNI) was responsible for human right abuse in the
breakaway province of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The riots in East Timor last September caused death to
thousands of East Timorese and forced hundreds of thousand others
to take shelter in the neighboring province.
</P>
<P>
But, Wiranto has rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sudarsono on Friday said he had met Wiranto and
delivered the president's message on Wiranto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, I have met General Wiranto and delivered a request
from the president (Wahid). But no response from Pak (Mr.) Wiranto.
We agreed to wait until Mr. president returns home on February 13,
" Sudarsono told a press conference without further elaborating.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties to wait until the investigation, which is
conducted by Attorney General Office on allegedly involvement of
Wiranto in human right abuse in East Timor, is completed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Wahid, who is visiting some European
countries, was informed that a group of TNI generals conducted a
covert meeting in Central Jakarta, which has triggered
speculations over a possible coup by the military.
</P>
<P>
The president then asked the generals to be careful as he knew
what they have done (in the covert meeting).
</P>
<P>
But top military officials denied on Friday President Wahid's
allegation that a group of generals had held a covert meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such meeting held without TNI leaders' knowledge,"
TNI chief Adm. Widodo A.S. was quoted by the Jakarta Post as
saying at the military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lt. Gen. Hari Sabarno, a deputy chairman of the
People's Consultatives Assembly (MPR) said that the president
should not be worried about the meeting of generals, which is a
common one, according to him.
</P>
<P>
"Such a meeting is often held, but I don't know if there was a
covert meeting in central Jakarta," Sabarno was quoted by the Post,
adding it was impossible for the army generals to launch a coup
against president Wahid as they had been trained not to support
such an action.
</P>
<P>
Sabarno suspected certain people have whispered wrong
information to the president.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Gen. Wiranto and president Wahid has also
affected Indonesian's currency of rupiah which plunged into a
lower level early this week at around 7.600 rupiah per U.S. dollar
from 7.200 rupia per dollar last week.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Interested in Signing Agreement Succeeding 4th Lome Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry
confirmed Friday that Cuba has expressed to the presidency of the
Council of Ministers of the Group of Countries of Africa, the
Caribbean, and the Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) its interest in
signing a trade agreement that succeeds the fourth Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
The first ACP-EU trade agreement, or the first Lome Convention
(Lome I), was concluded in Lome, Togo, in February, 1975 and came
into force on April 1, 1976.
</P>
<P>
Lome I replaced the former Yaounde conventions and the Arusha
agreement, under which some of the former overseas possessions of
France and the United Kingdom retained privileged access to the
European market, together with financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to provide a new framework of cooperation,
taking into account of the varying needs of developing African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous four Lome Conventions, the European
Community and then the European Union funneled billions of dollars
to the ACP nations in aid for farming, environment, fisheries,
industry, mining, services, commodities, trade and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said the
decision would be adopted even if negotiations were not concluded.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez also explained the historical ties of Cuba had with
the 71 ACP states and the 15 European Union member nations.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas made a similar
statement Wednesday during his visit to Brussels on the occasion
of the final round of negotiations with the group, of which Cuba
has been accepted as an observer since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cuba received the unanimous support of the ACP in Brussels for
its admission in the cooperation agreement that substituted the
Lome IV Convention which is expiring at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Cuba joined the bloc as an observer at a meeting of the ACP
Ministerial Council in May, 1998, in Barbados, which was
recognized as another effort of the regional integration and the
south-south cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Big-Name Firms Linked to German CDU Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Some big-name German companies
have been linked to the German Christian Democratic Union's (CDU)
illegal donations, party documents publicized Friday in Bonn
showed.
</P>
<P>
CDU Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble and Federal Manager Willi
Hausmann presented new evidence after a special presidium session
at its Bonn headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The documents disclosed that CDU, which has ruled Germany for
more than 30 years, ran a secret web of slush funds for decades,
especially under its former leader Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
CDU's illegal practice began even before the 1970s, and lasted
for more than 20 years, former CDU financial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Among the secret donors were Siemens AG, one of Germany's top
industrial groups. Former CDU financial manager Uwe Luethje said
Siemens had given the party one million marks (about 500,000 U.S.
dollars) in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Siemens did not deny the evidence, saying it "has no clue about
the correctness of the statement."
</P>
<P>
CDU'S secret foreign accounts include money from the German
secret service and a trust set up at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Hausmann admitted he found that Swiss bank accounts had already
existed in 1971 when he took over the post. In 1974, the party
also set up another account in Switzerland to deposit its cash.
</P>
<P>
These accounts were under the control of Haussman and two close
aides of Kohl, he said.
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, Kohl said in a ZDF television interview that he
had nothing to do with the Swiss accounts and repeated he would
not point out those names behind the undeclared funding.
</P>
<P>
"I never had anything to do with these accounts," he said,
adding that he had heard about them for the first time following
the testimony of some of his former aides to a CDU committee on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Key figures questioned by party leaders and independent
auditors this week included Horst Weyrauch, former CDU tax adviser
and Kohl aide, Walther Leisler Kiep, former CDU treasurer, and
Luethje.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 5 Billion-Dollar Loan to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Friday a three-year extended-fund loan of
five billion U.S. dollars to support Indonesia's economic and
structural reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, about 349 million dollars is available
immediately, and further disbursements will be made available on
the basis of performance targets and program reviews in the period
ahead, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian authorities are embarking on a bold and
comprehensive program aimed at restoring growth, lowering
inflation, reducing public debt, phasing out dependence on
exceptional financing, and normalizing relations with private
capital markets," Stanley Fischer, first deputy director of the
IMF, said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the program envisages continuity in monetary and
exchange rate policies that have gained credibility as they
delivered low inflation, strengthened the rupiah, and facilitated
declining interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Despite these gains, the IMF said that more remains to be done
to revive the economy and lay the foundation for a sustained
recovery that could increase employment and reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
"These challenges constitute the principal agenda of the
authorities' comprehensive economic program, supported by the IMF,
which aims to accelerate the restructuring of Indonesia's economy
and meet the remaining challenges," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is seeking to help Indonesia restore an annual growth
rate in the vicinity of 5-6 percent by 2002, up from a projected
growth rate of 3-4 percent in 2000. The country's real gross
domestic product dropped by 14.2 percent in fiscal year of 1998/
1999 which ended on March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Belize Rejects International Arbitration Over Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Belize government on
Friday rejected proposals made by Guatemala that the two countries
return to previous international arbitration to solve their border
dispute, Belize Ambassador to Guatemala Mike Mena said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala wants to recover more than 12,000 square kilometers
of territory from Belize, basing its claim on a disagreement that
dates back to the colonization by Britain in the 17th century,
according to reports reaching here from Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"A claim of that size, of surrendering half our territory, is
something never heard of. We will not negotiate at the cost of our
territory," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Belize is willing to start a dialogue at the level
of foreign ministers or heads of state to solve the territorial
dispute, but not to put the matter to previous international
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
"We want to continue the dialogue, but not on the basis of
relinquishing half or any part of out territory, because the
demand made does not give any incentive to start talks," Mena said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a plan for marking borders would be considered.
</P>
<P>
If Guatemala plans to take the case to the International Court
of Justice in The Hague, in Holland, "It must have the Belize
agreement, and not as a unilateral decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Belize maintains the position presented
10 years ago, which would give Guatemala several miles of its
territorial sea in the southern part of the country, but this
would depend on a referendum among the Belize population.
</P>
<P>
Mena said that in case of reaching an accord, Belize would have
three nautical miles of territorial sea, and Guatemala 12.
</P>
<P>
However, the offer has not received an answer so far from the
Guatemalan authorities, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Destroys Opium Poppies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
National Police started a spraying campaign to destroy opium poppy
crops Friday cultivated in 6,700 hectares in the south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The operation was being carried out with the assistance of
three "Black Hawk" helicopters delivered by the United States in
cooperation with the Colombian government's efforts against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The program against illegal cultivation of drug plants was
formalized by Police Director General Rosso Jose Serrano and
Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez in Neiva, the capital of
the Huila department, one of the three departments where the
offense against drugs were being carried out.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to perform this year a very important task to
eradicate the plant, from which the substance to produce morphine
and heroine is obtained," said Serrano before leaving for the
Andean mountains where the campaign has already started.
</P>
<P>
Serrano said that "all Colombian heroin production is
exclusively sent to the United States."
</P>
<P>
The Colombian anti-drug authorities put into action for the
first time the "Black Hawk" or "UH-60" helicopters in armed
support for the "Turbo Truch" airplanes that spray glyphosphate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government plans to send 30 additional helicopters to
Colombia as part of the 1.6-billion-dollar assistance program that
President Bill Clinton proposed to Congress in January.
</P>
<P>
General Serrano said the purpose of the Anti-Drug Police is to
destroy the opium poppies cultivated in 6,700 hectares in the
Huila department and in the neighboring departments of Cauca and
Tolima.

<HEADLINE> Germany Ties Netherlands in Davis Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sjeng Schalken survived eight
set points and turned the match to beat a demoralized Rainer
Schuettler, putting the Netherlands in a 1-1 tie with Germany
after the opening singles Friday in Leipzig, Germany, at the World
Group first-round Davis Cup match.
</P>
<P>
Schalken won 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-1, 6-0 after overcoming a slow
start. Earlier, Tommy Haas had put Germany into the lead by
rallying to beat John van Lottum in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Schuettler breezed through the first set but the second set saw
a classic Davis Cup battle, with nearly every game going to
multiple deuces.
</P>
<P>
With the German up 6-5, Schalken fought off eight set points. A
volley by Schuettler that sailed long gave the Dutchman a set
point of his own and he whipped a crosscourt forehand passing shot
winner to equal the score. A stunned Schuettler put up virtually
no resistance in the last two sets.
</P>
<P>
Haas was a break of serve down in the second set before he
pulled his game together and prevailed 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Van Lottum served and returned well to break Haas' serve early
and take the first set.He went up 3-1 in the second, before Haas
battled back to tie the score at 3-3. The Dutchman kept Haas under
pressure but a passing shot return on his second set point allowed
Haas to clinch the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
After a quick exchange of breaks at the start of the third set,
Haas never looked behind again.

</P>
<P>
"I'd like to know what they propose before I commit myself to
something that would be very influential in our game at the moment,
but it certainly does warrant and merit great consideration,"
Ferguson added.
</P>
<P>
Pressure to limit the number of foreign signings to two per
club stems from concern within the game that homegrown talent is
being stifled by imported talent.
</P>
<P>
There are specific worries about the quality of players from
non-European Union countries. It is felt that quotas would limit
English clubs to signing only the very best players from outside
the EU.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said the limit of two players "sounds fair".
</P>
<P>
Fears that too many foreign signings are damaging the English
game are such that the Football Association, the Premier League
and the Football League have all pitched into the debate.
</P>
<P>
But the suggestion of quotas has met with condemnation in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who fields a teams consisting
almost entirely of foreign stars, was particularly damning of the
idea.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to compete when we play in Europe, there's no way
we can do that against the European clubs if we don't allow
continental players or non-EU players to join us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The other teams would simply be too good for us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Assistant President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Riek Machar, rebel-turned
assistant president and chairman of the Coordination Council in
south Sudan, has submitted resignation to President Omar el-Bashir,
Sudanese sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether President el-Bashir has accepted
Bachar's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Machar also resigned as leader of the United Democratic
Salvation Front (UDSF) but retained his leadership of the South
Sudan Defence Forces, said a UDSF spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Machar was previously No. 2 figure in the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, which has been fighting a 16-year-old independence
war in the Christian and animist-populated south Sudan from the
Islamic government in the north. He switched to the government side
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Machar accused the government of not
implementing a peace agreement it signed with eight south Sudanese
factions, including Machar's, in Khartoum in April 1997, which
stipulates a referendum after a four-year interim period to decide
the future of south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for his resignation is that the government failed
to consult the Coordination Council, the governing body in south
Sudan, in appointing new governors for the southern Sudanese states
recently.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hardline Clerics End Protest Sin-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian hardline clerics in the
central holy city of Qom ended a three-day protest sit-in after
receiving a message from the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
the state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's message was read to the protesters by the hardline
chairman of the Experts Assembly which is responsible for electing
and supervising the supreme leader, the television said, giving no
details of the message.
</P>
<P>
Thousand of hardline clerics and religious students in Qom
started a sit-in on Thursday in protest to a caricature published
by the reformist daily Azad (Free) on Sunday, the TV report said.
</P>
<P>
The protestors urged President Mohammad Khatami to sack his
moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani for tolerating the "insult" of the caricature to
prominent hardline cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
The caricature, in which Yazdi was drawn as a crocodile, was
printed after Yazdi was reported to claim that former head of the
United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) visited Iran with a
briefcase of U.S. dollars to Iranian reformist dailies.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani soon urged concerned authorities to probe into the
case and moderate newspapers called for prosecuting and trying
Yazdi for his claim. However, Yazdi denied the report and said his
speech was distorted by newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary on Saturday arrested the
caricaturist Nik Ahang Kousar and ordered Mohammad Reza Yazdpanah,
managing director of the daily, to appear on the court on Sunday to
give an explanation for publishing the insulting caricature.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Kousar and the daily might face
serious punishment ahead of the sensitive parliamentary elections
slated on February 18.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary polls will be a battle between the moderates
who support President Khatami and the powerful conservatives, who
still dominate the country's major state organs.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has successfully built a
hovercraft capable of carrying 26 troops and two tons of cargo and
the production line will come on stream soon, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hovercraft, built by the Iranian Defense Ministry, was
designed to move at 80 kilometers per hour on land, at sea and in
the marshlands with a capacity to travel 600 kilometers without
refueling.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said that the
construction of the 26-man hovercraft was a turning point in the
country's defense industry since Iran had already produced 2-man
and 4-man hovercrafts.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle is capable of carrying out logistical operations,
reconnaissance and relief missions, he added.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 4 Injured in Tehran Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and four others injured in a series of explosions on Saturday in a
main street in the Iranian capital city of Tehran, the state-run
television reported.
</P>
<P>
At least five consecutive explosions were heard at around 19:30
local times (1600 GMT) in the southern Vali Asr street, an area
close to key government buildings, including the presidential
office and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
An aide to the president said that President Mohammad Khatami
was not injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The television said that five pedestrians were injured in the
explosions, one of them died at hospital.
</P>
<P>
The television blamed the Iranian outlawed Mujahedin Khalq
Organization (MKO) for the explosions while Tehran radio said that
the MKO has claimed responsibility for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred when Iranian rival political factions
were engaged in a white-hot struggle ahead of the sensitive
parliamentary elections slated for February 18, which is believed
to create a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO was an active political and military group
which fought against the former Shah regime. It was announced
illegal in 1981 due to sharp differences with the Iranian cleric
regime.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the MKO launched series of attacks on
Iranian interests inside and outside the country. In retaliation,
Iranian air forces have also launched several cross-border raids on
the MKO bases near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.

This was announced Saturday by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Montealegre.

"The draft law has been already signed. The first step has been

Assembly," said the foreign minister.

Montealegre said that this measure fulfills a resolution of the

The Nicaraguan National Assembly passed on December 16, 1999,
the so called "Sovereignty Tax," as a retaliation against Honduras
for the ratification by that country of the Ramirez-Lopez treaty
between Honduras and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua says that the treaty deprives it of 130,000 square
kilometers of its territorial waters in the Caribbean Sea, and

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting France Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine confirmed here Friday that his country considers
Chechnya an inseparable part of Russia and will not recognize the
breakaway province's independence anytime, but urging a political
end to the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has the right and the duty to combat
terrorism, Vedrine told an interview with the Russian NTV(
Independent TV) station after his meeting with acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, France disagrees with Russia on the way of fighting
terrorism, because "an endless opposition with combat operations
is likely to grow into an endless guerrilla warfare," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Moscow to adopt a clear policy on Chechnya,
particularly, to definitely determine Chechnya's future political
and juristic status in the Russian Federation at an early date.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting Putin expressed his
dissatisfaction with the West's misunderstanding of Russia's stand
and measures on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin informed the guest of the situation in the North Caucasus
and of steps to be taken by the Russian government to normalize
the regional life "as soon as the main obstacle (terrorism) is
cleared."
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Vedrine, Putin said it is not only in its
own interests that Russia is fighting international terrorism, but
also in the interests of the whole region, noting that"
international terrorism may spread to any other country tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> IRA Says Arms Issue Can Be Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army issued
a statement on Saturday in which it said the deadlock over weapons
can be resolved - but not on British or unionist terms.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued shortly before Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams and the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble met at
Stormont in an effort to save the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Trimble said the IRA statement was
disappointing, and contained "nothing new".
</P>
<P>
"There's no new proposal contained in it and I think that's
most unfortunate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the two leaders had agreed to meet again.
</P>
<P>
He added the IRA statement underlined the difficulties created
for republicans by the Northern Ireland secretary in Westminster
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the issue of arms needs to be dealt with in
an acceptable way and that this is a necessary objective of a
genuine peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis can be averted and the issue of arms can be
resolved. But this will not be on unionist or British terms," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Irish government welcomed the IRA statement,
saying it was "positive".
