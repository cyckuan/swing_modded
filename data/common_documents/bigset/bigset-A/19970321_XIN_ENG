<HEADLINE> Another Major South Korean Corporation Goes Broke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A second big corporate collapse in
two months shocked South Korea today, trapping both South Korean
financial markets and the government in a potential crisis.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Sammi Group came as the financial markets
and the government were reeling from the blow of the earlier Hanbo
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government must be extremely careful in
dealing with the fresh event considering the possible impact on an
economy in difficulty as well as the political situation, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sammi Group, South Korea's 26th largest conglomerate, was
declared bankrupt on Thursday, unable to pay off an immense amount
of debt in principal and interest. It came only a day after its
flagship subsidiary, Sammi Steel Co., declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Total debt of the debilitated group amounts to 2.6 trillion won
(2.97 billion U.S. dollars), surpassing its total assets valued at
2.5 trillion won (2.9 billion dollars), according to company
figures.
</P>
<P>
Sammi Steel Co., a world leading speciality steel-maker, is
burdened with liabilities of 1.45 trillion won (1.64 billion
dollars), with an annual interest due of more than 100 billion won
(1140 million dollars), against assets of 1.53 billion trillion
won.
</P>
<P>
This is the second traumatic corporate collapse in two months.
The Hanbo Steel Industry Co., the number two steelmaker in South
Korea, had a January bankruptcy wrapped in a bribes-for-loans
scandal in which Kim Hyun-chol, the second son of President Kim
Young-sam, is involved.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is anxious about the potential
impact of the Sammi collapse on financial markets. It is
considering effective measures to take to relieve possible
negative influences.
</P>
<P>
The more serious challenge, however, may come from the
opposition parties, which dubbed the Sammi event "the second Hanbo
loans scandal." They asked for a probe into the reported
connection between the Sammi Group and Kim Hyun-chol and Choi
Hyung-Woo, the latter a consultant of the ruling New Korea Party
and congressman.

<HEADLINE> Wind Power To Produce Million KW by 2000 In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China has been looking closely at
wind power as an important source of electricity, and expects it
to provide one million kw by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of Electric
Power, China has developed 10 million small wind power generators,
with a total capacity of 20,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
China now has the capacity to produce 30,000 wind generators
annually, and built 15 large wind power generation fields with a
combined installed capacity of more than 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China will continue to carry out its
policy of developing small generators for individual families
living in border areas and remote regions who are not connected to
power grids.
</P>
<P>
The country is phasing out its plan to develop wind power in
provinces which are rich in wind resources and lacking in power
supplies. The official source said that China is abundant in wind
resources, and about two-thirds of the country is windy, with
total wind energy resources estimated at 253 million kw.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Ukraine Start Negotiation on Special Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennadiy Udovenko opened on
Thursday in Brussels their first round of negotiations toward the
formalization of the NATO-Ukraine relationship.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the talks, the two sides
stated that they were determined to conclude the NATO-Ukraine
agreement by the time of the NATO Madrid Summit in July, when NATO
will issue invitations to certain countries, most likely Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Solana, Udovenko and Volodymyr Horbulin,
Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine,
also held a meeting with the 16 ambassadors of NATO member
countries at the "16 plus one" format.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Udovenko told the ambassadors that he
and Horbulin discussed with Solana the basic principles and
modalities of a formal document and that he was very satisfied
with the results of today's talks.
</P>
<P>
While stressing Ukraine's wish to build up "a strong, enduring
and effective relationship" with NATO,Udovenko stated that his
country would not apply for NATO membership at present because of
"lack of all conditions."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "in the long run, accession to a
transformed and adapted NATO" was one of Ukraine's aims towards
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said Ukraine "highly" appreciated NATO's declared
position that it has no intention to deploy unclear weapons on new
member's territory.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that one of the basic elements of the
future NATO-Ukraine document should be the confirmation by NATO of
the condition for any applicant country to complete the settlement
of all territorial and other problems with neighbors, including
Ukraine, which is trying hard to settle the border dispute with
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving NATO Headquarters, Udovenko told reporters that
NATO and Ukraine agreed to establish a working group to negotiate
the practical preparations for the document.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment in which shape the document would be
concluded, either a charter or a legally binding agreement, only
saying that "it was for further negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The minister also told the press that Solana will pay a visit
to Ukraine on May 7, on the occasion of opening a NATO Information
and Document Center in Kiev.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Soars in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States Commerce
Department said today that America's trade deficit soared to 12.7
billion U.S. dollars for January because of higher oil prices and
rising auto imports.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the overall deficit in goods alone was 19
billion dollars, the highest in history, because of a 13.3 percent
jump in auto imports, led by a surge in shipments from America's
partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Car imports from Canada increased 25 percent while imports from
Mexico rose 12 percent. Car imports from Japan were also up by six
percent.
</P>
<P>
It also said that foreign oil bill rose 5.2 percent to 6.8
billion dollars. Four-fifths of the increase should be attributed
to higher volume and the rest to rising prices.
</P>
<P>
The average price of crude oil rose for a seventh consecutive
month to 21.99 dollars a barrel, the highest level since the Gulf
crisis in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Department's statistics show that the overall deficit
climbed to 114.3 billion dollars last year, the worst performance
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the deficit will climb even higher this year as
the strength of the dollar softened U.S. commercial
competitiveness on both overseas and domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Woman Militant Arrested in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police have arrested an
Algerian woman suspected of aiding militant activities in Egypt,
the Interior Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Jamila Maali al-Falaki, an Algerian, has been charged of
infiltration into Egypt to give instructions and funds to members
of the radical Islamic Jihad in Egypt, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She was arrested on Wednesday when contacting an Egyptian
lawyer who also belongs to the Jihad, which is fighting the
government in a bid to install a strict Islamic rule in the
secular country.
</P>
<P>
The security authority said the woman was employed to revive
the movement's activities and mastermind terrorist attacks on a
number of personalities and vital installations in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
However, it said her every movement had been closely watched by
the state security bodies ever since she entered Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The woman received instructions from Yasser Tawfik Ali, a
much-feared Jihad leader taking refuge in Britain, it added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt said members of the group, which assassinated
ex-President Anwar Sadat in 1981 and attempted to kill former
Prime Minister Atef Sedki in 1985, have received military training
in camps run by its exiled leaders.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,070 people have been killed in a five-year-old
drive by Islamic militants.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youngsters Urged To Contribute to Peking Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangen, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee, has urged young performers to contribute more to Peking
opera, which is the high point of Chinese traditional art.
</P>
<P>
Ding spoke recently at a symposium sponsored by the Propaganda
Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of
culture for a training class of outstanding young Peking opera
performers.
</P>
<P>
Young actors and actresses should study more to improve their
work, Ding said, emphasizing that young people should carefully
study the Party's principles and policy on art and devote
themselves to the people and to socialism.
</P>
<P>
Performers are also asked to learn from culture, literature,
and other forms of art to enrich themselves and to perform better.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the training class should help players
practice more to improve their skill, and should include
traditional pieces and newer ones.
</P>
<P>
The education in professional ethics has also been stressed at
the symposium. Ding said that young people should respect the
older generation and learn from their spirit of devotion to the
art.
</P>
<P>
Reviving traditional culture and art is a major part of China's
socialist cultural and ideological progress, which falls on the
shoulders of the younger generation, Ding said, and youngsters
should strengthen their sense of responsibility and grasp every
opportunity to improve their skills.
</P>
<P>
The training class, which started last October, has 26
outstanding young performers from Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> TB Causes Infertility, Says Nigerian Physician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB), a disease
commonly associated with pulmonary system, is one of the
causative factors for infertility.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Dr. Adedeji Ifederu head of the
Government Chest Hospital in Ibadan, a major city in southwestern
Nigeria, the Nigerian Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the medical expert, once the tiny mycobaterium
tuberculosis, which is the bacteria responsible to the infection,
enters the human body through the nostril, it can settle in any
part of the body to cause diverse forms of infection.
</P>
<P>
When the bacteria is disseminated through the blood system and
infects the fallopian tube in a woman or the testicle of a man,
it can lead to infertility if not properly treated.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Ifederu pointed out that TB infection does not
mean that the infected person will manifest the disease, because
most people have a natural resistance to the disease, especially
those who are not immuno-deficient.
</P>
<P>
A properly balanced diet provides good immunity against the
infection blossoming into full scale disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged people to maintain balanced diet in their
daily food intake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a
new treatment system which combines a multi-drug system to a
careful monitoring of patients as a new action plan that can save
millions of lives from the drug resistance form of TB, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima as
describing the system as the biggest health breakthrough of the
decade.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief, Mandela Optimistic About Zairean Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and South African President Nelson
Mandela expressed the view today that despite strong offensives
by rebel forces, there is still hope for a peace settlement in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town after his talks with
Mandela, Annan said although the rebels were doing "very well on
the ground", no one in Zaire, including rebel leader Laurent
Kabila, was demanding secession or the breakup of the country.
</P>
<P>
"They want a change of leadership. That change can be attained
in many other ways, including through the ballot box," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
The UN Chief expressed hope that following the on-going
preparatory summit in Nairobi, Kenya and the African Summit about
the Zairean crisis due to be held in Lome, Togo on March 26, the
warring Zairean factions would agree to a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
If a ceasefire was agreed to, the United Nations would have to
send peacekeeping troops to Zaire, Annan added.
</P>
<P>
South African President Mandela, who had talks with Zairean
rebel leader Kabila last month, also pointed out that Kabila had
insisted on meeting Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the fortunate position that despite his successes
on the battlefield, he realizes the importance of negotiations,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels, who began to launch offensives agaisnt the
government troops last October, had taken over one fifth of the
territory in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the rebels were advancing on Lubumbashi,
the second largest city in Zaire, after taking Kinsangani in the
northeast last Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nedbank, one of South
Africa's leading banking groups, has officially opened a new
branch in Maseru, capital of Lesotho, reported the South African
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an opening ceremony in Maseru, Nedbank's Corporate
and International Division Director Derek Muller said Nedbank
could not fully serve Southern African Development Community
(SADC) countries from South Africa and had to involve itself by
establishing branches in the region.
</P>
<P>
Muller said Nedbank had already established branches in
Zimbabwe and Namibia, and had just bought Standard Chartered Bank
in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Nedbank was looking forward to opening branches in other Sadc
countries in the years ahead, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nedbank Maseru's Managing Director is Claude Pearce, who
previously served with Nedbank for more than two years in
Beijing, capital of the People's Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> African Language Policies Need Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- There is need for Africa to
reexamine its language policies with a view to rationalising and
adopting decisive national policies that promote unity, peace and
stability, a Zimbabwean cabinet minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a ministerial inter-governmental conference on
language policies in Africa, Chairman of the conference and
Zimbabwe's Higher Education Minister Ignatius Chombo said in
multi-lingual situations, it was necessary for countries to
clearly spell out those languages that were regarded as official,
those that were national but not official and those that were for
specific use.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly stated policies will enable African governments to
allocate more resources to the development of official languages
and use these languages in official communications," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added there was need for Africans to reexamine the use of
their own languages and accord them due recognition and status.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 50 of the 54 African countries are
attending the two-day conference which ends on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to highlight the use of African
languages as the best way of ensuring participation of Africans in
society as well as in the planning and management of development
projects.

<HEADLINE> Explosion in Afghan City, One of Biggest in World's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Wednesday's explosion in
Jalalabad, an eastern Afghan city, is one of the biggest
accidental munitions explosions ever in the world's history, the
U.N. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations assessment team today reported that the
explosion at a munitions store in Jalalabad, blew open a crater
measuring 50 meters in diameter and 10 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
Munitions and debris are scattered over a four-square-kilometer
residential and agricultural area, it said in a press release
issued by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA) to Afghanistan here today.
</P>
<P>
The team estimated that the volume of explosives that went off
could be as much as 200 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to latest casualty figures, about 30 were killed and
191 others injured in the blast. At least 80 of the injured were
in a serious condition.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth major munitions store explosion in
Afghanistan in recent years. Last year, stores exploded in
Kandahar and Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency is sending six teams of explosive experts to
Jalalabad to clear the area of unexploded munitions and debris.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Calls for World Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- International pressure
needed to be applied on the Israeli government to stop a new
house-building project in disputed East Jerusalem, senior South
African government official said today.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference in Cape Town with visiting United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Deputy Foreign Affairs
Minister Aziz Pahad said the South African government was very
concerned about development in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the present Israeli government's action is
contrary to the expectations of the international community,"
said Pahad.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Pahad said South Africa was "very anxious"
that all presure had to be put on the Israeli government to stop
the housing project of 6500 homes and make a genuine commitment
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Middle East peace process had been the
subject of talks between Annan and the South African government
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the Palestinians called on the UN Security
Council to demand an immediate halt of the controversial
settlement in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Rugby Sevens to Kick Off in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- More than two decades after
hosting the first local seven-a-side rugby tournament, Hong Kong
has its dream come true on Friday when the Second World Cup Rugby
Sevens finals kicks off Friday in the Hong Kong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
It is nothing surprising now when Hong Kong was given high
comments on its efforts to have the game a world-class status and
bring the world's major sevens event to the city.
</P>
<P>
"During the past 21 years, Hong Kong has won a special place in
the lore of rugby football," said Leo Williams, Chairman of the
Rugby World Cup Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"The decision thus to award the second Rugby World Cup Sevens
tournament to Hong Kong was not only an overdue act of justice but
 also a recognition of Hong Kong's role in the elevation of the
Sevens code to international celebrity status," he added.
</P>
<P>
A brilliant field of 24 teams are to vie for the top honor of
the three knock-out championships - the Melrose Cup, the Plate and
the Bowel in the three-day competitions.
</P>
<P>
Among the line-ups are England, Argentina and Japan, the
winners of the Melrose Cup, Plate and Bowel championships at the
inaugural World Cup finals in Edingbourg, Scotland, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
England and Australia, winners and runners-up of the Melrose
Cup in 1993, and hosts Hong Kong are automatic qualifiers for this
year's World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
All the participating teams are split into eight pools of three
for a single round-robin play on the tournament's opening day on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The pool winners will be ranked first to eighth, the
second-placed teams will be ranked ninth to 16th and the
third-placed sides 17th to 24th.
</P>
<P>
The teams are to be split into eight groups of three again, for
another round of single round-robin competitions on the second day
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After the second single round-robin, the teams will be ranked
in the same manner as in the first round, with the pool winners
advancing to the Melrose Cup championship, the second-placed teams
to the Plate and the third-placed sides to the Bowl, all slated
for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Copper Conglomerate Makes 12.46 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's state-owned
conglomerate, the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), made a
net loss of 19,722 million kwacha (about 12.46 million US
dollars) in the quarter ending December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in the ZCCM's report for third quarter
1996/97 financial year to March 31, 1997 available here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the loss made by the ZCCM in the same
quarter of the previous financial year was 2,865 million kwacha
(about 2.97 million US dollars) after taking into account of
exchange losses, interest, taxation charges, and other items.
</P>
<P>
However, the ZCCM report said that copper production for the
quarter at 67,022 tons was 3,692 tons higher than the 63,330 tons
in the same period of the previous year. Copper sales out of the
company's production for the quarter at 76,172 tons were 20,984
tons higher than the 55,188 tons sold during the same quarter of
1995. Sales, including metal bought-in, were 94,008 tons for the
quarter compared with 108,663 tons in the corresponding quarter
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cobalt production, at 1,116 tons for the quarter, was five
percent lower than the 1,175 tons produced in the corresponding
quarter of 1995. Sales of cobalt, at 1,126 tons were 52 percent
higher than the 743 tons sold in the quarter ending December 31,
1995.
</P>
<P>
The total sales revenue for the quarter was 358,512 million
kwacha, an increase of six percent over the 336,722 million kwacha
achieved in the same pf period of 1995. The increased revenue arose
from the improvements in sales tonnages for both copper (excluding
bought-in) and cobalt and the depreciation of the kwacha between the
corresponding period of the previous year and the period under
review -- from one US dollar equalling 965.69 kwacha to one US dollar
equalling 1282.69 kwacha.

HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The export promotion zone
authority of Zimbabwe has so far approved 29 projects and
established four industrial parks in three major centres, general
manager Walter Chidakwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the authority had set up three industrial parks in
Harare and one in Mutare of east Zimbabwe, and was currently
working with the Bulawayo municipality of west Zimbabwe to
establish another park in the city.
</P>
<P>
He added a Zimbabwe company signed an agreement with a German
partner to establish a 60 million U.S. dollars tyre recycling
plant in Zimbabwe at the London investment conference which was
held early this month.
</P>
<P>
Another British company had also agreed to establish "an
efficient telecommunications service" in the export processing
zones.
</P>
<P>
However, Chidakwa said concern was raised at the bureaucracy
encountered in applying for investment, and at customs and
immigration.

<HEADLINE> EC, Ukraine Reach New Steel Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the European
Commission(EC) and Ukraine have reached a new steel agreement that
will allow Ukraine to increase sales to the European Union of
certain iron and steel products up to the year 2001, the EC said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will ensure that Ukraine can enjoy stable growth
for one of its major exports to the European Union while gradually
bringing the competitive conditions of the Ukrainian steel
industry more into line with those of the European Union," the
Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The new deal will cover certain iron and steel products under
the European Coal and Steel Treaty, such as coils, heavy plate or
wire rod.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which still needs approval by EU Ministers
and the Ukrainian authorities and should enter into force on 1
July this year, the quantitative limits for 1997 will be 233,154
tons, 10 percent higher than in 1996, rising by a further five
percent in 1998 and by 2.5 percent annually in 1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement will follow the expiry, on June 30 this year,
of an earlier agreement covering the 1995-96 period, which allowed
Ukraine to increase its exports of products subject to quotas by
35 percent in 1995(140,833 tons) and 15 percent in 1996(161,958
tons). In addition, Ukraine could deliver 50,000 tons annually
to the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission said Ukraine only used about 50 percent of
the limits in both years.
</P>
<P>
Total EU imports of Ukrainian iron and steel products - those
subject to quantitative limits and those where trade has already
been liberalized - rose from 660,000 tons in 1993 to 1.6 million
tons in 1995, according to the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Falls to 2.7 pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's annual rate of headline
inflation fell to 2.7 percent in February from 2.8 percent in the
previous month, giving a much-needed boost to the Conservative
government facing a general election on May 1, official figures
showed today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today that the
government's preferred measure, the underlying annual inflation
rate, excluding mortgage interest payments, also fell last month
to 2.9 percent from 3.1 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The fall brought the underlying rate closer to the government's
target of 2.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Lower food prices last month was the main cause for the fall in
underlying inflation rate, said the ONS. But clothing and footwear
prices in February rose 1.5 percent, and those of household goods
also staged a 0.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke hailed the fall as a
sign that the government is on course to meet its 2.5 inflation
target.
</P>
<P>
The figures were below economists' expectation of headline
inflation holding steady at 2.8 percent and were thought as easing
some of the pressure for an interest rate rise to tackle
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Strong average earnings figures and higher retail sales data
plus another big fall in unemployment total announced Wednesday by
the ONS had triggered fresh worries about higher interest rates in
the country.

<HEADLINE> New Mammography Technique Developed in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada has developed a new
computerized mammography technology, which can make breast cancer
detection easier and at an earlier stage.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Sunnybrook Health Science Center in Toronto have
developed a machine that makes high-quality digital images of the
breast, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The machine can find even the smallest tumor and calcium
deposits without using X-ray film, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the procedure, the breast is compressed between two
plates and subjected to an X-ray beam, much as in conventional
mammograms.
</P>
<P>
But instead of being captured on film, the image is stored for
display on computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to film, the picture can be manipulated to magnify
particular sections that are considered suspicious. The result is
a sharper image that can be enhanced to highlight problem spots.
</P>
<P>
The technique will be especially beneficial for women with
so-called "dense" breasts, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
In addition, digitizing the images will allow them to be
transmitted along telephone lines or by satellite link to faraway
doctors for consultation.
</P>
<P>
The center, which has been working on the technology for the
past 12 years, plans to conduct two different trials over the next
year, which will involve 300 women.
</P>
<P>
It has also joined a North America consortium of universities
and corporations that will conduct a further test of the equipment
starting next year.
</P>
<P>
The first digital-mammography machines are expected to be
installed in Canadian clinics by the end of this year, the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Summit on Zaire Crisis Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The outcome of yesterday's
Nairobi summit on the Zaire crisis has been welcomed and the
United States has expressed its full support to the Nairobi peace
process for Zaire, Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said
today.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka made the remarks at a news conference held at his
ministry here today, dismissing reports alleging that Kenya was
isolated in the peace process for Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, ambassadors of France,
Britain, Belgium and other countries expressed their welcome to
the conclusions of the summit which called for "a negotiated
settlement" to the escalating conflict in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the summit, George Moose, U.S. assistant
secretary of state in charge of African affairs who was an
observer at the meeting assured on behalf of the US government
its full support to the peace efforts initiated by Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi, Musyoka further said.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected some allegations which claimed that certain
countries, namely Uganda and Rwanda, which had attended previous
two Nairobi summits held late last year, were excluded and Kenya
was isolated in the Nairobi peace process for Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka stressed that Kenya, Zimbabwe, Cameroun and South
Africa were mandated by all those countries represented at the
Nairobi Summit II to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he also disclosed that Mohamed
Sahnoun, special envoy of the United Nations and the Organization
of African Unity, will fly tomorrow to eastern Zaire to meet
rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun "will contact with Kabila on behalf of all of us and
President Moi to convey the conclusions of yesterday's summit to
him", the foreign minister added.

He told reporters that the one-day summit, which stressed the
urgent need for the implementation of the UN five-point peace
plan, also decided that the proposed Nairobi Summit III will be
held in Lome, Togo on March 25, just a day before an OAU special
summit on the conflicts in Zaire and other African countries.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that Kengo wa Dondo attended yesterday's
summit properly as prime minister of Zaire, adding that the vote

his position did not meet the constitutional requirements.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian FMs Reject Israeli Final Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian and Syrian foreign
ministers today rejected Israel's offer to speed up the final
talks with the Palestinians and warned Israel not to play tricks
with the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara, after a meeting today, warned that the
Mideast peace march is now passing through "a very dangerous stage
and facing severe crisis because of Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
On a recent Israeli proposal to wrap up talks on a final peace
agreement within six months, Moussa said it is merely a bundle of
"unspecific generalizations."
</P>
<P>
"They (the Israelis) should not consider themselves too smart,"
he told a press conference here. "We will not accept any promises,
generalities or sugar talk."
</P>
<P>
Israel rushed the Palestinians to resolve all the sensitive
issues including the future of Jerusalem and the Palestinian
statehood this year and set aside the 1993 interim autonomy deal
including three planned Israeli redeployment from the West Bank
and other commitments. Palestinians have turned down the offer.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Oslo agreement remained the basis for peace
talks and that Israel could not alter it unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
"Let's maintain the peace process within its sound frame. Don't
try to play with this process and imperil it," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister said at the press conference that
Arabs are disillusioned as Israel sent in bulldozers to Har Homa,
the site of a 6,500-unit new Jewish neighborhood in East
Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want to establish the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Shara said it is obvious that moving the bulldozers toward Har
Homa is "a tangible proof that (Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin)
Netanyahu neither wants peace nor does he seek to realize it."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is working for something else quite contrary to the
peace process which we consider in danger," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak received a message
from his Syrian counterpart Hafez el-Assad on the peace process and
entrusted Shara with a reply message during their meeting today.
</P>
<P>
"We were unanimous that the peace process need to be maintained
according to the Madrid conference principles and the land-for-
peace framework," Moussa affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He said Arab countries will step up their coordinations
prior to the Islamic Conference to be held in Islamabad, the
Jerusalem Committee meeting in Rabat and during Arab League
meetings to confront the grave peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
On prospects for convening an Arab summit, Shara said contacts
are under way between Arab leaders to review the situation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also met Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri at noon
and held talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who
arrived here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's Political Adviser Osama al-Baz is expected to meet
Dore Gold, Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser, this evening.
</P>
<P>
In his predeparture statement in Tel Aviv, Gold said he is
carrying some important "new ideas" to share with Egypt.

<HEADLINE> New York City to Take Stricter Measure on Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK March 20 (Xinhua) -- The New York Board of Education
on Wednesday voted to expel from school system any student 17 or
older who brings a gun to school or attacks someone with any
weapon.
</P>
<P>
The new policy, which is due to take effect in the fall this
year, is considered "the toughest" in the United States where most
other cities punish students by sending them to alternative
schools or by suspending them for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
The measure comes as reports of school violence are rising.
Last year from July through October, the school system reported
5,804 "serious incidents," which included weapons and drug
violations, up from 3,930 incidents in the same period the year
before.
</P>
<P>
The number of older students has risen in recent years as
dropout prevention programs have come more effective. There are
103,000 students 17 and over in New York City, roughly 10 percent
of the student body, according to figures provided by the New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
Growing concern over school violence nationwide has compelled
many school districts to adopt strict new zero-tolerance
policies against gun possession.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Water Shortages Worsening Worldwide By Wang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations official today
said that one-third of the world's population will suffer from
chronic fresh water shortages by the year of 2025.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Executive Director
of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP), stated that the water
shortages had been worsening due to increasing demands by growing
populations, decreased quality of existing water resources and
accelerating requirements of expanding industries and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued here today at a press briefing pointed
out that water shortages already exist in Africa, the Middle East
and parts of North America, Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Eightyeight developing countries where live about half of the
world population already "experience significant water deficits",
stressed the statement commemorating the 1997 World Watedr Day on
March 22.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official noted that UNEP had worked with governments,
its partner U.N. agencies and other organizations in developing
and initiating a number of major programs aimed at alleviating
the looming water crisis.
</P>
<P>
Accolrding to a UNEP report distributed at the press briefing,
the world populations will increase from the present 5.7 billion
to 8.3 billion in 2025, "making water shortage problems worse".
</P>
<P>
And much of this increase will be in the rapidly growing urban
areas of developing countries, many of which are already
experiencing serious water problems, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Another driving force which could make water problems worse
will be increasing consumption of food and industrial goods
produced with water, it said.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation already accounts for 70 percent of the water taken
from lakes, rivers and underground sources, and there will be
pressure to use more water to produce food for the increasing
population.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that some countries had made impressive
reductions in the amount of water needed for irrigation,
industrial and municipal purposes by using more effective water
management systems and better technologies.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, these gains have not reversed either the
general trend toward water shortage, nor the widespread decline
in water quality.
</P>
<P>
The report urged decision makers in the world to start from
now water resources projects to meet the needs of societies and
economies in 2025 because of the lengthy period of planning,
design and construction of large water projects.

<HEADLINE> Computer-banking Bugs Turn off Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- As more Americans sign up for
banking and bill paying on computer, some banks' systems are
becoming overloaded -- causing delays and bounced checks.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today reported Thursday that the industry is
experiencing growing pains and is fixing the problems. But some
customers are losing patience and returning to traditional counter
banking.
</P>
<P>
Since NationsBank launched its personal computer banking
service a year ago, 320,000 customers have signed on. "We were
able to keep up with the growth until recently," said Smita Quinn,
PC banking manager. Customers of the system have repeatedly
encountered connection delays.
</P>
<P>
They sometimes had to wait up to 10 minutes to speak to a bank
representative by phone, according to the report. So NationsBank
curtailed its marketing push and added its call center staff.
</P>
<P>
Chase says it also is increasing its phone staff -- from 50
people to 150 by the end of April. The bank said it tried to
resolve PC banking problems, but many are beyond its control.
</P>
<P>
CheckFree, a large national payment processor, says it now
has ironed out the problems.
</P>
<P>
But it is too late, because some customers could not wait and
gave up PC banking.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the losses of some customers, the bank has
sent some customers flowers.

HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's road haulers have

other countries in the 12-member SADC grouping to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has already expressed its willingness to set up a
similar fund following recent proposals to establish road

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Curb Illegal Production, Transaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Mining and
Energy of Ethiopia today said it has designed a mechanism by
which it could control the illegal production and transaction of
gold and other precious metals.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported that the prevalence of
illicit production and trade of the metal have been a major
constraint for the country to earn hard currency from the sector.
</P>
<P>
Thus a mechanism has now been designed so as to enable
pertinent governmental bodies to work jointly to curb the illegal
activity, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As most of the illegal producers and traders lack
understanding that they could be licensed, experts will be
deployed to sites to teach and organize the miners so that they
could get permits, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed the need to reinforce and train the
police force in the various mining sites with a view to
containing the illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 kilograms of gold is produced illegally and
smuggled out of the country every year.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: No Breakthrough, No Failure Occur in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Though hopes for a breakthrough
in the discussion of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) during the two-day summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the
two leaders would certainly make progress in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin, accompanied by their respective foreign
ministers, arrived here today and are expected to have a full-day
talk, focusing on the alliance's enlargement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in Helsinki, Russian President foresaw a tough
fight over NATO enlargement. "President Clinton and I have
difficult and serious talks."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
that Yeltsin would defend Moscow's interests "like never before"
during the summit.
</P>
<P>
On her arrival in Helsinki, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today reaffirmed that NATO will implement its eastward
expansion plan as scheduled regardless of any opposition from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the two-day summit, Yastrzhembsky said that if
the alliance's expansion becomes true, it will be the "strategic
mistake" and "worst" decision after the end of the Cold War and
the West will pay high price for it.
</P>
<P>
He said through an interpreter that NATO has no reasons at all
to expand since there is no more ideological confrontation
following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"There are none of reasons for NATO to move eastward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions of the NATO expansion has already undermined
the trust between Russia and the West built after the end of the
Cold War," he said, adding that they "have thrown shadows" over
the relations between Russia and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"Russia's approach to NATO expansion will not change regardless
of any summits, bilateral meetings and negotiations,"
Yastrzhembsky told reporters.
</P>
<P>
NATO's move also undermines arms reduction negotiations between
Russia and the U.S.. The implementation of the START II treaty
has stopped while process of starting talks on START III is
slowing down, said Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate solution to the issue is the denial of taking new
members, or postponing acceptance of new members, " he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The firm positions on both sides have indicated that it is
almost impossible for them to make a deal on NATO's expansion.
The row will surely linger on after the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian officials say that progress could be made in
arms control and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival here, Yeltsin said, "Let us not lose
the partnership we have established and developed."
</P>
<P>
Michael McCurry, the White House spokesman, told a news
briefing here today that the U.S. and Russia should proceed the
negotiations "in the spirits of partnership."
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that the summit is important to both sides
since it takes place after the two presidents haven't seen each
other for a long interval, and against the background that they
were both reelected not long ago.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will review bilateral relations since the
end of the Cold War and the summit also offered a chance for them
to "lay down an outline for Russian-U.S. partnership in the 21st
century," Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion will be decisive in building a new security
order in the 21st century. Clinton has made it one of his first
foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the U.S.'s goal is to dominate the European
affairs by enlarging NATO, getting more involved in the alliance
and then achieve its aim to "lead the world" in next the century,
or to build a one-polar world.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin has indicated that Russia's policy is meant to
create new world order of a multi-polar global arrangement. The
world must avoid the domination of one particular center of power.
</P>
<P>
The foreign policy differences will surely cause more troubles
and disputes in the future U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say confrontation between the U.S. and Russia is
impossible. Russia needs the help of the U.S. in the field of
economy while the U.S. needs Russia's cooperation in building
Europe's security.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they analyzed that there will be no breakthrough in
the Helsinki summit, but the two sides will pledge to strengthen
partnership.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Clinton has brought a package of
concessions to Helsinki to woo Russia and spur the ratification of
START II treaty.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns of Increase in U.S. Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan today warned that there was an urgent need for
vigilance against inflation, sending a signal that the central
bank was ready to raise interest rates as a pre-emptive measure
against rising prices.
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the congressional Joint Economic Committee,
Greenspan said the U.S. economy shows a "quite favorable"
performance, but "demand has been growing quite strongly in recent
months." He worried about how long that could continue before
triggering rising prices.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said it was critical for the Fed to act "ideally
pre-emptively" to keep inflation from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market
Committee, will meet next Tuesday to consider raising short-term.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has not changed interest rates for more than a year and
it has not increased the funds rate since early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that at next week's meeting, Fed policy-makers
will try to determine whether a recent acceleration in
productivity gains is enough to keep rising wage pressures from
becoming inflationary.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the central bank would have to raise rates to
slow the economy if it determines that wage pressures are
threatening to outstrip productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
Economists expected the increase will come as early as this
month or in May at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's remarks today unsettled financial markets. The Dow
Jones industrial average, slipping before Greenspan spoke, was
down 54 points by late morning as investors feared that higher
interest rates were on the way.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Reiterates Palestinian Claim to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat warned in Gaza this afternoon that
without Jerusalem, regarded by Palestinians as the capital of
their future state, there will be no peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in East Jerusalem, Arafat issued the warning when addressing
the 88-member legislative Palestinian Council session. He noted in
the speech that Israel must know that it cannot play with the
issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader stated that Jerusalem is a red line
for Arabs, Muslims, Christians throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of trickery
and conspiracy on the peace process, adding that the
irresponsible decision to build the Jewish settlement at Abu
Ghneim (Har Homa) undermines the entire peace process, as well as
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Although Arafat appealed to Palestinians not to use violence
against the construction of the settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem, hundreds of Palestinians launched a protest procession
in Bethlehem. They hurled stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli
soldiers guarding Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish holy site in the
Palestinian self-rule city.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and water
cannons. The confrontation lasted more than three hours, but no
one was injured. Palestinian police succeeded in preventing the
protesters from marching over the municipal boundary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, apparently inspired by the start of construction at
Har Homa, five families of Jewish settlers moved into a home in
the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. However,
officials at the Prime Minister's Office claimed that their
action has nothing to do with the government.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai visited the Har Homa site
this afternoon warning the Palestinians not to use Friday prayers
at mosques to stir violence.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that Israel has received information to this
effect. But he added that the security forces are ready for any
eventuality. It is believed that he was apparently referring to
snipers and paratroops, and such hardware as tanks and
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
At today's Palestinian Council session, Ahmed Qrei' (Abu Ala)
was reelected President of the Palestinian Council. Ibrahim Abu
Al-Naja was elected First Deputy President. Second Deputy
President Mitri Abu Atta and Secretary of the Palestinian Council
Rawhi Fatouh retain their posts.

<HEADLINE> Africa Must Play Role in Peace-keeping: UN Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- African countries,
including South Africa, would have to play their role in
peace-keeping operations on the continent, visiting United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Cape Town, Annan, former
Under-Secretary-General for peace-keeping operations, said he was
delighted that a group of African leaders had come together and
were working very hard to resolve the conflict in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the days when African nations and troops were
excluded and outsiders were brought in were gone. Therefore,
Africans must play their part in peace-keeping missions on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. Security Council decided to set up a monitoring
mechanism in the event of a cease-fire being brokered in Zaire,
"then we would welcome the participation of as many African
countries as possible", said the U.N. Chief.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan also expressed his support to the initiative
of establishment of an African Crisis Intervention Force, which
he said will be helpful for the continent.
</P>
<P>
The proposed African rapid response force was first mooted by
former United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher last
year, but was rejected by South African President Nelson Mandela,
who said the initiative should come form Africa, not outsiders.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan said Mandela and other African leaders should
not be concerned that anyone is trying to sideline them in the
move to createa such a force.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Interim Govt Head Says She Has no </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Liberian interim
government Ruth Perry has said she is not interested in politics
right now but may come into politics in six or seven years if she
is still strong enough.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson of the Liberian Council of State said this
while briefing a group of Nigerian correspondents at the
Executive Mansion in Monrovia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said her major pre-occupation at present is to ensure the
success of the peace process in Liberia, which has come to a
crucial stage as it is now only two months from the May 30
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the Council of State have resigned to contest
for presidency. They are Charles Tayor of the National Patriotic
Front of Liberia, Alhaji Kromah of the United Liberation Movement
and George Boley of the Liberia Peace Council.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the peace process is expected to take a
major step forward today, with the inauguration of an electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson assured that peace process in Liberia remains
on course and appealed to countries still harboring Liberian
refugees to encourage them to return home and take part in
building a better country tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> New Row Among British Parties on Sleaze Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen British members of
parliament(MP) out of 25 investigated on the cash-for-questions
affairs have been cleared by a interim Parliamentary Standards
Committee report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report was out after opposition parties had alleged that
the Government was deliberately winding up Parliament early in
order to prevent the report being made public before the election.
</P>
<P>
But the report said the investigation into allegations that MPs
were paid by Mohammed Al-Fayed, the owner of London's Harrods
store, to ask questions in parliament on his behalf would not be
finished until next week.
</P>
<P>
Since Prime Minister John Major announced this week that
parliament would stop sitting on Friday that means the report on
the remaining 10 MPs cannot be published before the election.
</P>
<P>
The decision to defer a verdict on allegations of 10
Conservative MPs provoked a furious row between the government and
the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Tony Blair said there was no reason why the
report could not be published before the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
Blair was joined by Paddy Ashodown, Liberal Democrat leader,
who accused the government of a cover-up, saying: "The
Conservatives have ended parliament as they started it --
breaking their promises, trying to con people and mired in
sleaze."
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were furious, claiming that the row had been
deliberately staged to take the gloss of yesterday's sharp fall in
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Ministers described as slanderous the suggestion that the
election timing had anything to do with the report, and
Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney accused Labor of
playing dirty politics.
</P>
<P>
"They only created this report scare...when they suddenly saw
the best economic news in terms of the dramatic fall in
unemployment, and they decided they had to have some story to take
it off the headlines," Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine
said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties "look for a smear, look for a diversion
to stop the people of Britain focusing on the good news", he
added.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Retail Trade Increases in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Canada increased
1.4 percent in January after a small decline in December,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Consumers in the province of British Columbia spurred this
growth by returning to stores in January after the harsh weather
in late December.
</P>
<P>
When the province is removed from the total, retail sales in
Canada increased by only 0.1 percent in January, the federal
agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in January extends the pattern of flourishing
sales from September to November 1996, and more than offset the
small decline in December (0.1 percent down)," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The advances in the past five months contrast with the period
of slow growth from late 1994 to mid-1996," it added.
</P>
<P>
After a 5.4 percent decline in December, retailers in British
Columbia saw a 9.6 percent increase in sales in January than in
December. The figure is 9.7 percent higher than that of a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing retail sales in January were broad-based with
increasing sales in six out of seven retail sectors," the agency
noted.
</P>
<P>
Only general merchandise stores saw a decline in sales (0.5
percent down), while other retail stores, food stores and the
automotive sector gained 6.4, 2.0 and 0.3 percent respectively.

JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki will join U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
in Angola on Monday for inauguration of the new Angolan
government.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported today they
would then proceed to Lome, Togo for an Organization of African
Unity (OAU) summit set for March 26 and aimed at brokering a
peace solution to the Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Annan in Cape Town, the legislative capital of
South Africa, Mbeki briefed Annan on the preparatory summit on
Zaire held in Nairobi, Kenya on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told reporters that he was satisfied with the way
African peace initiatives on Zaire were progressing.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila, who has
been excluded from the OAU summit, should be invited to attend
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan and South African President Nelson Mandela held
talks over Zaire's crisis and expressed hope that the Lome summit
would produce a cease-fire in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean rebels, who began to launch offensives against the
government troops last October, have taken over one fifth of land
in the eastern part of Zaire, the third largest country in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover Genetic Pathway to Most Colon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have identified a
genetic pathway that may play a role in the development of as many
as 90 percent of all colon cancers, the Johns Hopkins Oncology
Center announced today.
</P>
<P>
The pathway is associated with a tumor suppressor gene called
APC, identified by the Hopkins team in 1991 and found to be
mutated in 85 percent of all colon cancers, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the new studies, the Hopkins team and scientists in
University Hospital in Utrecht, Netherlands, found that the
mutation of APC results in the overactivation of two other genes
called B-catenin and Tcf.
</P>
<P>
"These three genes are part of a pathway -- an interconnected
series of genes that communicate with one another through the
production of proteins to regulate the growth and death of cells,"
said Kenneth Kinzler, co-researcher of the study.
</P>
<P>
"In colon cancers that do not have APC mutations, we found a
significant number of B-catenin gene mutations, which appear to
result in similar overactivation of the pathway," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinzler and his colleagues believe the malfunctioning pathway
could be corrected with drugs known as "inhibitors" that block
B-catenin and Tcf gene -- the role the APC gene normally plays.
</P>
<P>
"It is much easier to block the function of B-catenin and Tcf
than to try to restore the missing function of APC. This is what
makes the discovery of this pathway so exciting," he said.
</P>
<P>
The findings, will also be reported in the March 21 issue of
the Science journal.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Angola's Peace Process Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The 47th regular meeting of the
Joint Committee on Angola's Peace Process, which should have
opened today, was delayed for the third time due to disputes
between the Angolan government and the opposition UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled for March 14, was put off
due to the absence of members of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) till Wednesday, then Thursday. Now
it was set to be held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest delay was made in accordance with the proposal of
the former rebel UNITA group, said U.N. envoy to Angola Blondin
Beye, who consulted with delegates from both sides in the
committee today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, who consider Angola's peace process as now on a
"sensitive stage", called for all necessary measures to be taken
to remove obstacles to the peace process, said Beye.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the repeated mediation efforts by Beye and
representatives of the three monitoring countries -- the United
States, Russia and Portugal, differences remain great between the
Angolan government and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
They differ on all the key issues for the peace process -- the
political status of UNITA Chairman Jonas Savembi, the
inauguration of UNITA lawmakers and the formation of the
government of national unity and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also expected to discuss how to complete the
reorganization of the national united army and to set up national
administration structures in UNITA-controlled areas, local
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Zhou Nan on 100-day Countdown for HK's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The principle of "One Country,
Two Systems" constitutes one of China's national policies and is
not an expedient measure, said Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters from Xinhua and Hong Kong-based
Wen Wei Po to mark the 100-day countdown of Hong Kong's return to
her motherland, Zhou said the Chinese government is firmly
committed to the implementation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said, "Hong Kong's return to China not only marks the
beginning of a new era for the territory, but also represents an
important step in the process of the reunification of China and a
new phase of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's handover is a major event in modern
Chinese history and world history as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current situation, whether in Hong Kong, on
the Chinese mainland and or in the rest of the world, is all
becoming increasingly favorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"The international community and the Hong Kong people are more
confident than ever before about Hong Kong's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
There may still be some people trying to making an uproar, but
that cannot possibly affect the overall situation where the smooth
transition of Hong Kong is going on, Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou firstly attributed Hong Kong's present favorable situation
to Deng Xiaoping's concept of "One Country, Two Systems", noting
that more and more people in Hong Kong have faith in it.
</P>
<P>
Another fundamental factor in the realization of Hong Kong's
return to her motherland is the strength of today's China, which
is now completely different from what it was like before 1949.
</P>
<P>
And thanks to the economic reforms and opening up begun in the
late 1970s, China has become more powerful and prosperous, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The old China was trampled upon by others, while today's China
is a powerful country which is no longer at the mercy of others,
thus enabling the Chinese government to resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong without firing a shot, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China maintains independence, is becoming ever
more prosperous and enjoys fast economic development toward the
21st century constitutes a fundamental basis for Hong Kong's
smooth transition as well as the territory's long-term prosperity
and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 13 years, the central government of
China has set great store by the Hong Kong affairs. It has
resolutely implemented the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the
Question of Hong Kong and the Basic Law as well as the principle
of "One Country, Two Systems".
</P>
<P>
Zhou spoke highly of the work done by the Preparatory Committee
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the
Selection Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the basic completion of the work in the
preparations for the formation of the HKSAR government, Hong Kong
has brought about a culture of election featured with fairness,
justice and openness, adding that the elections suited to Hong
Kong's reality have received the acclamation from the Hong Kong
people.

HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A seminar marking the 100-day
countdown for Hong Kong's return to her motherland was held here
today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Cheung Wan Fung, chairman and director
of Wen Wei Po, said that thanks to the principle of "One Country,
Two Systems" and the efforts of the broad masses of the Hong Kong

</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's situation is stable and favorable with sustained

proof against all the biased views about Hong Kong.
</P>

Tsang Hin-chi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce of Hong Kong, said that with Hong Kong to return to her

governing Hong Kong" and "a High-degree of Autonomy".

Kong will surely achieve its goal of maintaining its prosperity
and stability.

<HEADLINE> HK's Attorney General, ICAC Welcome Overturning of U.S. Court's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Attorney General
and the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday
 both welcomed the judgment by the United States First Circuit
Court of Appeals which overturned an earlier ruling on former
tobacco company executive Jerry Lui Kin-hong who had been wanted
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Judge in Boston has granted a writ of habeas
corpus to Lui, who was wanted in Hong Kong to face bribery
charges, on the ground that the U.S. extradition treaty with
Britain would expire on July 1, 1997, and that after the date
Britain could not guarantee certain safeguards for Lui upon his
return to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The First Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed the grant and
found that there was sufficient evidence to support the Hong Kong
charges.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Jeremy Mathews noted that this judgment
removes the doubts and concerns arising from the earlier decision
concerning the future of Hong Kong's legal system. The move will
send a powerful message of reassurance of Hong Kong's extradition
arrangements after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ICAC said: "The Commission welcomes
the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals in favor of the
U.S. Attorney's Office, who are seeking Lui's extradition to Hong
Kong on behalf of the Hong Kong government. We hope Lui would be
returned to Hong Kong as soon as possible to face trial."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Two young female designers from
Hong Kong won First and Second Prize in the finals of the 97'
China Jeanswest Casual Wear Design Contest in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The contest, first held in 1993, is sponsored by the China
Garment Association and Jeanswest International Co. It has
attracted 617 fashion designers from 25 cities and provinces in
China's inland areas, and for the first time this year, from Hong
Kong, according to Xu Bobo, director of the judges panel.
</P>
<P>
"Casual wear is claiming a larger part of the Chinese garment
market in recent years, with increases both in production and
sales," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"But Chinese designs, production standards, and market
promotion of these kinds of clothes still leave a lot to be
desired," she added.
</P>
<P>
The contest is intended to cultivate new fashion designers,
introduce casual wear trends in production and sales, and increase
exchanges between fashion and design circles in China's inland
areas and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Six prize winners will be given a one-week-trip to Hong Kong to
attend a garment festival there in July.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic markets have been selling more casual wear as
the quality of life improves, said Yeung Chun Fan, vice-president
of the Glorious Sun Group (Hong Kong), the major shareholder in
Jeanswest.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jeanswest, which has 270 stores already in the
country's inland areas, plans to open 1,000 more in 100 cities
over the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun,
speaking on agriculture today, urged Chinese officials in charge
of agriculture to get a better understanding of the current
agricultural situation to ensure stable and substantial
development.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, China has seen favorable growth in
its agriculture, said Jiang, also a member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many problems still exist. Some parts of the
country have ignored agriculture, reducing investment in
production, stopping preferential policies, reducing local
farmland, and imposing unreasonable charges on farmers.
</P>
<P>
And government sources report that China still has a total of
58 million people who do not have sufficient food or clothing.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture should be given priority in the country's economic
construction, Jiang said, and China will continue to increase
reforms in rural areas, improve the agricultural economy, increase
the use of science and technology, improve productive conditions,
and protect the ecology and environment.
</P>
<P>
Grain production and prevention of disasters are to be given
priority to ensure a good harvest this year, Jiang said, and
provincial governments should pay attention to local democratic
and legal systems that can see to it that rural people enjoy a
stable life.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was sponsored by the Propaganda Department of
the CPC Central Committee, the General Political Department of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), and working committees of the
central organizations.

NEW DELHI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Shankar Dayal
Sharma today expressed hope that the resumption of talks between
India and Pakistan next week would pave the way for strengthening
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while welcoming Pakistan's new
high commissioner to India Ashraf Jehangir Gazi who presented his
credentials to him at the presidential palace here.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the foreign secretary-level talks scheduled to be

wide-ranging and comprehensive discussions on issues of mutual
concern and New Delhi's approach in this regard was positive and
constructive.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary-level talks were suspended in January
1994 due to differences on the Kashmir issue. The two countries
recently decided to resume the talks to improve relations
following exchanges of letters between their leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We earnestly hope that the opportunity provided by the
resumption of talks will be seized to move our bilateral relations
forward," Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
Gazi said Islamabad was committed to joining hands with India
in the common endeavor to further strengthen good neighborly
relations.

<HEADLINE> Mobutu Heads Home, Appealing for Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's ailing president Mobutu
Sese Seko left France today for home after pleading for an
immediate ceasefire and national unity in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
Helped by his wife, the 66-year-old strongman, who underwent
fresh cancer treatment in a Monacan hospital from last Sunday to
Wednesday, boarded his private plane at southern France's Nice
airport and flew off to Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday night, Mobutu called for a
ceasefire between government troops and Tutsi rebels, who have
seized around one-fifth of Zairean territories and were moving
towards the capital.
</P>
<P>
The president also proposed forming a national council,
representing every political party in Zaire, to find a peaceful
settlement of the country's crisis through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu's son, Nzanga, said on Wednesday that his father was the
only person who can make national unity possible.
</P>
<P>
Nzanga said President Mobutu should return home immediately and
find a diplomatic way to bring the country out of the present
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
But rebel leader Laurent Kabila refused Mobutu's call of
ceasefire later today.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, the head of Zaire for the last 30 years, has spent most
of his time in Europe, mainly in his Riviera villa, since having
prostate cancer surgery last August in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Kinshasa last December when he promised to
unleash a huge counter-offensive against the rebels, who had
already captured a large strip of territory in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, government troops failed to stop the rebels seizing
more land, including the key provincial capital of Kisangani on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> International Officials Critical of Mostar Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- International officials on
Friday criticized a court trial in the Bosnian Croat-held part of
Mostar which virtually acquited policemen of attacking Muslim
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Colum Murphy, spokesman for Carl Bildt, quoted the High
Representative of Dayton peace accords as saying that the court
trial was "complete mockery and farce".
</P>
<P>
According to Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for UN International
Task Force (IPTF), the court in Western Mostar held only a
45-minute trial of the five accused policemen, without testimonies
from victims or witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The policemen were only charged with using physical forces and
rubber truncheons, although some of them were identified by IPTF
as using firing weapons against Muslim civilians on February 10,
which resulted in one death and two dozens of wounded.
</P>
<P>
At the end of trial, one officer was given one-year suspended
imprisonment, while two were sentenced to six-month suspended
imprisonment. The verdict said the sentences were suspended
before the policemen "were fighting for their country".
</P>
<P>
"These comments indicate that the court has no understanding of
professional police responsibilities in a peace-time democratic
environment, but is still entrenched in wartime rhetoric," Ivanko
said.
</P>
<P>
He called the verdict "disappointing and deeply troubling,
although not surprising for those who have been following the
latest development in Western Mostar".

This technique allowed a reduction of time in the construction
program as well as causing minimal disruption to marine traffic
during construction. It is also the first bridge in Hong Kong to
use external re-stressing, which will substantially reduce
maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6-kilometer Cheung Ching Tunnel carries the Route 3
Highway from the Rambler Channel Bridge, through Tsing Yi Island
and on to connect with the new Tsing Ma Bridge. The tunnel is the
 widest in Hong Kong and the first to carry three lanes of traffic
 in each of its two tubes.
</P>
<P>
Use of sophisticated "jumbo" drilling machines enabled
tunneling progress of an average of 35 meters per week, so the
excavation of the main tunnel was completed in 18 months, with
final excavation being completed two months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, all the expressways to the new town of Tung
Chung, including the Lantau Link, will be open to traffic and for
the first time people will be able to drive directly from Hong
Kong Island to Lantau Island.
</P>
<P>
The New Airport at Chek Lap Kok is scheduled to be put into
operation in April of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Trade Official Says China And US Should Work Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun Zhenyu said here today that
China hopes to work with the United States to handle the Sino-US
trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on a Sino-US Trade Balance white
paper, Sun said that China has made a great effort at cutting its
trade surplus with the US.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to open its markets, he said, and encourage
its enterprises to increase import from the US and welcome
investment from large US enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In reducing the trade imbalance, Sun pointed out, US companies
should make further efforts to increase their competitive edge in
the Chinese market to acquire a greater market share.
</P>
<P>
US banks should offer favorable terms to American companies to
give them a chance to get involved in bigger projects, he said,
and the US Government needs to decrease limitations on technology
exports to China. Only by doing so, he said, is it possible to
make full use of the potential and advantages of American
companies.
</P>
<P>
China had a surplus with the US in 1996 of 10.5 billion US
dollars. Sun said that an improper handling of the trade issue
will affect the normal growth of Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts, statisticians of the two countries have
reached a consensus on reasons for the trade imbalance, he said,
and China is willing to continue consultations to address the
question of the imbalance and other trade issues.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, which was issued by the Information Office of
the State Council today, elaborates China's stand and views on the
Sino-US trade balance.
</P>
<P>
The paper's five topics are: "Soaring Trade Between China and
the United States"; "Statistical Differences in Sino-US Trade
Balance"; "Statistics Based on Rules of Origin Cannot Accurately
Reflect the Situation of Sino-US Trade Balance"; "US Export
Control Against China"; and "Sino-US Economic and Trade
Co-operation's Vast Vistas".

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Appoints Exco Members to Tackle Livelihood issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa today
announced that he has invited three SAR Executive Council members
to help him in mapping out long-term strategy in the areas
concerning the people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
These members are Leung Chun Ying, who will look into housing;
Leung Kam Chung, who will be looking at education; and Tam Yiu
Chung, who will be considering services for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Tung said the three men
will work together with relevant government officials in
generating ideas through a critical analysis of opportunities and
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"These three members and government officials will put forward
their views in helping me to devise these policies. It is an
informal set-up. With close co-operation between these members and
 government officials, I am sure we will strike the right balance
between continuing our well-tried policies and looking for
constructive and innovative changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the three members to deliver their
respective recommendations by June this year.
</P>
<P>
"There are other areas of our community which I am very
concerned about, such as our future industrial focus and our
economic vitality, and in these areas we are still trying to look
at ways to move forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this is not a move toward a ministerial or
semi-ministerial system of government. "This does not deviate from
 the terms of reference of the Executive Council in providing the
Chief Executive with informed views on various policy matters," he
 said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope close co-operation in these areas will help to realize
our long-term goals in the best interests of Hong Kong," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UN first food shipments arrive in N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of foodstuffs
under the United Nations oil-for-food program has arrived in
northern Iraq Thursday, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
About 16 tonnes of chickpeas and 109 tonnes of vegetable oil,
part of contracts for 2,000 tonnes of chickpeas and 10,000 tonnes
of vegetable oil, were carried by eight trucks and crossed into
Zakhu in northern Iraq from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It is the first consignment to enter Iraq since the imposition
of U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said that distribution of the foodstuffs will
start "as soon as practical arrangements are completed."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Iraq signed the oil-for-food deal,
under which Iraq was allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of
oil for an initial six-month period to buy food and medicine for
its people hard hit by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions committee recently approved three contracts
under which Turkish foodstuff companies were allowed to export
foodstuff to Iraq at a total cost of 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials have complained about delays in food
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Thursday, Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said "the Iraqi people have neither received
one loaf of bread nor a tablet of aspirin." The interview was
carried by the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, which is based
in London.
</P>
<P>
A shipment of rice from Thailand is heading to the southern
Iraqi port of Basra and is expected to arrive Sunday.

<HEADLINE> China's Drive To Develop Marine Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- During its Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), China will concentrate on the major areas of marine
technology and improving it with science and technology, said a
government official here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Liu Yanhua, director of the social
development department of China's State Science and Technology
Commission, said, "In the area of marine technology, we will
concentrate on the fields of marine monitoring technology, marine
biology, and the exploitation and development of marine resources."
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China will try to develop high technology in
such areas as marine surveys, the demarcation of marine special
economic zones, and the exploitation of marine oil and gas
resources, to improve their technological level.
</P>
<P>
China will try to make major breakthroughs in the comprehensive
utilization of seawater resources and the utilization of seashore
environmental resources, and begin evaluating resources at the
south pole and in the continental shelf area.
</P>
<P>
China will improve its marine industry with science and
technology in the fields of marine farming, processing of marine
biological resources, utilization of marine chemical resources,
and direct utilization of seawater.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the country has had some achievements in
offshore natural gas and oil development, marine biological
engineering, deep-water mining, acoustical technology, and
aquiculture, and it has learned how to cultivate kelp, prawns, and
shellfish on a large scale, thanks to developments in genetic
engineering, putting its marine cultivation in the first place in

<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and French entrepreneurs
exchanged views on space technology, industrial automation,
telecommunications management, and investment on public facilities
during a two-day symposium on the economies of China and France in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At today's conclusion, head of the China Council for the

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Bombing Attack in Tel Aviv </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has condemned the suicide bombing
attack in Tel Aviv today, which left at least four people died and
more than 40 wounded, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the condemnation in a telephone conversation with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, shortly after the bombing attack
took place.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred around 13:45 p.m. local time (1045GMT),
at Apropo coffee shop around the corner of Ben Gurion Street and
Adam Hacohen, just one block from Dizengoff, where a suicide
bombing attack took place one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television quoted police sources as saying that
according to an identity card found beside a dead body, the
suicide bomber was from the West Bank village of Tzurif.
</P>
<P>
However, no more details were given.
</P>
<P>
People in the coffee shop at the time of explosion said that
they saw a suspect came to the middle of the shop, before they
heard the sound of explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities imposed a total closure of the
West Bank and Gaza shortly after the explosion amid mounting
tension with the Palestinians, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Internal Minister Avigdor Kahalani blamed
Arafat for giving the green light to the terrorist attacks
against Israeli targets. However, many political analysts doubt
about Arafat's ability to control the situation if tension fails
to be eased.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at a time when tension is rising
between Israel and the Palestinians, after the construction of a
Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The military and intelligence authorities have repeatedly
warned against possible Palestinian violence, but apparently the
warning was not heeded duly.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian youths hurled rocks at soldiers in the
West Bank town of Bethlehem and similar confrontations also took
place in the West Bank town of Hebron this morning.
</P>
<P>
Several people were reportedly injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his condolence over the dead in Tel Aviv
blast, Arafat also mentioned the casualties in the West Bank towns.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the injures, Israelis and Palestinians alike, would
recover soon, according to a CNN report.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Jewelry Show Opens Doors to Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong reinforced its role
as Asia's leading jewelry sourcing center when 12,040
international buyers flocked to the 14th Hong Kong International
Jewelry Show on March 12-15, organizers said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual jewelry extravaganza, featuring 619 exhibitors from
26 countries and regions this year, occupied 18,500 square meters
in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC).
</P>
<P>
The show was jointly organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (HKTDC), the Hong Kong Jewelers' and
Goldsmiths' Association, the Hong Kong Jade and Stone Manufactures
Association, the Hong Kong Jewelry Manufacturers Association and
the Diamond Importers Association.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a significant increase of buyers from Europe and
the United States, the fastest attendance growth was from Asian
countries, said C.S. Lee, HKTDC's assistant executive director for
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms that Hong Kong is the best possible place to
exhibit and gain access to the fast-developing Asia-Pacific
markets," Lee said. "Economic growth in this region is the
world's fastest, creating a spiral in demand for well designed
fine jewelry," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Blames Arafat For Tel Aviv Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has laid the blame for a suicide bombing
attack in Tel Aviv this afternoon on the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and its President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A bomb went off inside a coffee shop in the center of
Tel Aviv, killing at least four people and injuring more
than 40 others, some of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ichilov Hospital, where the wounded have
been treated, Netanyahu said recent statements made by the PNA
had inflamed the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier said that those who charged the Har
Homa building, a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, was
responsible for the attack "were wrong," adding "that was not
the case."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat has condemned the suicide bombing attack,
which he termed as "terrorist incident," in Tel Aviv, saying
he was disturbed by the violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the condemnation in a telephone conversation with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, shortly after the bombing attack
took place.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred around 13:45 p.m. local time
(1045GMT), at Apropo Coffee Shop at the corner of Ben Gurion
Street and Adam Hacohen, just one block from Dizengoff, where
a suicide bombing attack took place one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television quoted police sources as saying that
according to an identity card found beside a dead body, the
suicide bomber was from the West Bank village of Tzurif.
</P>
<P>
An identified man told the Israel Television that a member
of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, carried out the
attack, adding Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's policy was
responsible for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing attack, the Israeli army immediately
imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
barring Palestinians from entering into Israel.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at a time when tension has been rising
between Israel and the Palestinians, after the construction of
a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem started Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Dalai's Taiwan Tour Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama's visit to Taiwan
will not be an ordinary religious pilgrimage, but a political
crusade to split the motherland plotted by forces of "Taiwan
independence" and "Tibet independence."
</P>
<P>
In a symposium held by China Tibetology Research Center today
in Beijing, scholars from the research center, the Central
University of Ethnic Minorities, the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, and so on made their analyses and criticism of Dalai's
splitting activities.
</P>
<P>
Doje Cedain, director general of the China Tibetology Research
Center, said China's reunification is making significant progress
as the return of Hong Kong and Macao approaches.
</P>
<P>
But the Taiwan authorities are also accelerating their pace of
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," he noted, adding
that under such circumstance, the Dalai's visit to Taiwan will
make the forces of "Tibet independence" and of "Taiwan
independence" echo each other, and hinder the reunification.
</P>
<P>
Scholars including Huang Hao, research fellow of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, said the invitation made by the Taiwan
authorities to the Dalai, who has been engaged in splitting the
motherland for a long time, provides him with an opportunity to do
splitting activities in the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the Taiwan authorities are colluding with the
Dalai's group and going farther down the path of splitting the
motherland, they added.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the symposium also pointed out that if the
Dalai Lama wants to get rid of his situation of exile overseas, he
must abandon his concept of "Tibet independence" and stop his
splitting activities.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt between the Dalai Lama and the "Taiwan
independence" forces to split the motherland will be doomed to
failure, they said.

<HEADLINE> China's Marine Economy Maintains Rapid Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is estimated that the output of China's marine industry this
year will reach 310 billion yuan (about 38 billion US dollars),
and will hit 500 billion yuan by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the coastal areas of China, which
accounts for 13 percent of China's total area, have produced grain
to feed 40 percent of China's total population, producing 60
percent of China's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
China's marine industry has been developing rapidly since the
1980s, with traditional trades such as oceanic fishing,
transportation, and salt manufacturing taking the lead, and some
newly-booming industries such as sea water breeding, the off-shore
oil and gas industry, and seashore tourism following suit.
</P>
<P>
China has also begun to make headway in the fields of oceanic
energy development, deep-sea mining, the oceanic information
industry, and comprehensive sea-water use.
</P>
<P>
"The industry, however, still faces disadvantages such as
limited scale, outdated technological equipment, and little
tertiary industry," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, China will attach key importance to the
development of seashore and offshore areas. It will form the
structure of the oceanic industry with transportation, fishing,
oil and gas exploitation, and seashore tourism as its pillar
industries.
</P>
<P>
Close attention will be paid to the development of five coastal
areas, they are around Bohai, along the mouth of the Yangtze River
and the Hangzhou Bay, the southeastern coastal areas of Fujian
Province, the mouth of the Zhujiang River, and the Beibu Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Large Schools of Dophins Cause Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Large schools of dolphins have
fled to the Mediterranean in the wake of mass deaths in the North
Sea, causing trouble for fishermen in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Cypriot fishermen marched on the Presidential
Palace demanding compensation for damage to their nets caused by
dolphins that were caught in them.
</P>
<P>
In a petition to President Glafcos Clerides, the fishermen
said the damage caused by the dolphins ran into hundreds of
thousands of pounds (one pound equals two U.S. dollars) and
called for state money to cover the costs.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen say they find their nets damaged on a daily
basis, but are unable to take measures as dolphins are protected
animals under Cyprus law.
</P>
<P>
While demanding compensation, the fishermen called on the
government to take measures to keep the dolphins away from the
island's fishing areas.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Fisheries Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture has been trying to find a solution to save the nets
and spare the protected dolphins.
</P>
<P>
Emilios Economou, an official at the Fisheries Department,
told Agriculture Committee at the House of Representatives
Thursday that the problem was not unique to Cyprus, but affected
the whole of the Mediterranean. He said large schools of
dolphins, as many as 250 at a time, were detected at the Cyprus
coast.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the authorities had made numerous efforts to help
fishermen, seeking advice from the U.S., Russia and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been little success so far, and one such
effort involving the use of special equipment to scare off the
dolphins actually ended up attracting them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said a new research program on this was now under
way at the University of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
But the fishermen insisted that they respected the fact that
dolphins are a protected species, but they too wanted protection
from the state.

<P>
HELSINKI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin moved closer on NATO's
expansion during their first session of summit here today, a
Russian spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the first round of talks between Clinton and
Yeltsin, both spokesmen from Russia and the U.S. told separate
news briefings that the two presidents have more than two hours of
"intensive" discussion.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
reporters that a joint U.S.-Russian statement on Europe's security
could be issued at the end of the close-up summit meeting. "It is
too early to provide details on the exact contents of the
document," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. White House spokesman Michael McCurry said the two
presidents had a "very lively, very intensive" discussion on
Europe's security issues and arms control.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents spent two-thirds of the two-hour
"substantive conversation" on Europe's security, and one third on
the arms control, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clinton and Yeltsin reiterated their
positions on the issue of the NATO expansion. Neither side has
made any concessions over the issue.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton made it clear to Yeltsin that the
alliance's expansion will not threaten Russia while Yeltsin still
strongly opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will continue their discussion later in the
day on the economic issues.

SEOUL, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in South Korea
rose rapidly in January and February this year.

<HEADLINE> New Claims About Palme's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A report provided by Swedish
lawyer Pelle Svensson claims that Lars Tingstrom -- known as "The
Bomb Man" -- planned the murder of former Swedish Prime Minister
Olof Palme.
</P>
<P>
The press said here today that the report would lead to new
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
The bottom of the Klara sea canal in central Stockholm would be
searched as Svensson claimed, with reference to Tingstrom, that
the weapon used was thrown in there after the murder.
</P>
<P>
Chief District Prosecutor Jan Danielsson said he did not doubt
that Pelle Svensson was truthful, but it was another question how
much credit one should give to Tingstrom's report.
</P>
<P>
Tingstrom, who was serving a lifetime sentence for bomb
attacks, claimed shortly before he died in 1993 that he planned
the murder of Palme, and that Christer Pettersson was involved in
the plans. Pettersson was previously found guilty of the murder
but later acquitted by the Svea Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The Bomb Man" Tingstrom allegedly gave the information to
Pelle Svensson who was not allowed to reveal it within 10 years of
the murder.
</P>
<P>
Jan Danielsson said that at the moment the question of asking
for a reopening of the Pettersson case was not being considered.

<HEADLINE> Total Close Imposed on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Following a suicide bombing
attack in center Tel Aviv this afternoon, the Israeli army
immediately imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, barring Palestinians from entering into Israel, Israel
Television reported.
</P>
<P>
A bomb went off in a crowded coffee shop in downtown Tel Aviv,
killing at least four people and injuring more than 40 others.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred around 13:45 p.m. local time (1045GMT),
at Apropo coffee shop around the corner of Ben Gurion Street and
Adam Hacohen, just one block from Dizengoff, where a suicide
bombing attack took place one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo told Israel Television that it
appeared to be a suicide bombing attack, and the unidentified
suicide bomber himself might also be killed in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
People, in the coffee shop when the bomb exploded, said that
they saw a suspect came into the center of the shop, before they
heard the sound of explosion.
</P>
<P>
All injured people were evacuated to the nearby Ichilov
Hospital and Wofson Hospital, some of the seriously wounded have
already gone under operation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces closed the area, fearing there
were more unexploded bombs.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man told the Israel Television that a member
of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, carried out the
attack, adding Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's policy was
responsible for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Internal Minister Avigdor Kahalani blamed
the Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat for giving the
green light to the terrorist attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said that "If Arafat wanted to stop the terrorist
attack, he was able to do that."
</P>
<P>
However, political analysts here believed that the situation
might go out of everybody's control if no solution can be found to
defuse tension built up by Israel's policy of settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at a time when tension has been rising
between Israel and the Palestinians, after the construction of a
Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
he had been warned of plans for Palestinian violence today in the
Jerusalem area, after several dozen Palestinian youths hurled
rocks at soldiers in the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
There were similar confrontations between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian youths in Hebron this morning. Several people were
reportedly injured.

<HEADLINE> Manila Calls for Resumption of Peace Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
called for the resumption of informal peace talks with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to end hostilities following the
resurgence of conflicts in Buldon, Mindanao, last week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking over radio in Cotabato City, Mindanao, government
negotiator Fortunato Abat suggested that a government-MILF meeting
be held before the third round of peace talks scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
"Our cessation technical committees should meet on March 24-25,
just before the Lenten days. They (really) have to sit down and
instead of blaming each other, they should do something positive
(about it)," Abat said.
</P>
<P>
The March 15-16 mortar shelling between the MILF and government
forces in Buldon killed 11 civilians, wounded three government
soldiers and displaced hundreds of families in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
Abat also suggested that at the next week's meeting, a "joint
investigative committee" should be formed to put an end to the
"trading of accusations" by the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Abat's radio speech, the MILF, which earlier
threatened to withdraw from the peace talks, has reportedly agreed
to the government proposal but singled out a certain condition
before negotiations would resume.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the meeting be held immediately, but we need an
assurance that something official should come out from this
meeting," said Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said that instead of just talking over the telephone on
the problem between him and Abat, the cessation of hostilities
committees should draft "something final".

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian forces were today
placed on standby to help evacuate Australian citizens if the
crisis in Papua New Guinea (PNG) worsened which was sparked by
sacking of the chief of the defense force in the south Pacific
nation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard confirmed that some troops had been
placed on a higher state of readiness. However, he said "it was in
response to a routine determination by the head of defense force
General John Baker."
</P>
<P>
Howard told reporters that he believed the situation in PNG was
unstable but may be improving, "The impression is that things are
domestically a little calmer today than what they were yesterday."
</P>
<P>
The government source said Australian troops were not preparing
help the PNG police restore peace in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Port Moresby, the mercenary force
hired by the PNG government, totaling 61 persons, left the country
tonight on a chartered air jut for Hong Kong.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Julius Chan said "the departure
of the mercenaries was natural consequence, they are no longer
needed so there is no need for them to be here."
</P>

The contract between the PNG government and Sandline
International (a British firm) was released in Port Moresby today,
indicating that 70 mercenaries would be employed in the operation
against the Bougainville secessionists.

the explosion in Tel Aviv today.
</P>
<P>
No more details were made available so far.
</P>
<P>
A bomb went off in a crowded coffee shop in the center of Tel
Aviv this afternoon, killing at least four people and injuring
more than 30 others, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred around 13:45 p.m. local time

a suicide bombing attack took place one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Leading Egyptian Newspaper Critical of US Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A leading Egyptian newspaper voiced
today sharp criticism of the U.S. Mideast policy, urging
Washington to play an impartial role to salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram, the most influential daily in the country and the
Arab world as a whole, said in an editorial that the U.S. Mideast
policy "now faces dangerous challenge in the peace process because
this partial policy cannot be accepted by the Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
"What happened recently in Jerusalem and the Security Council
confirms that Washington did not only monitor and watch the
incident but gave its blessing and encouraged Israel through
protecting it at the Security Council and preventing any
international condemnation," the Arabic daily said.
</P>
<P>
It was referring to the U.S. veto early this month of an
Security Council draft resolution demanding Israel stop its
settlement construction drive in the disputed East Jerusalem. The
U.S. move has angered the Arab world and hurt its credibility in
the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Washington joined European countries last week at a Gaza
conference in a bid to appease the protesting Palestinians. But
Israel rejected all outside pressure and went ahead with its plan
for building 6,500 housing units in Har Homa, or Jabal Abu Ghneim.
</P>
<P>
Since Israeli workers, protected by soldiers and policemen,
broke ground at the construction site Tuesday, Washington has made
no more comment on the sensitive issue, which seems to be
overshadowed by a Helsinki U.S.-Russian summit.
</P>
<P>
"The question now is until when will the American silence
last?" asked the newspaper, adding the silence would encourage
Israel to pursue its policy.
</P>
<P>
"The only way before Washington is to confirm to the world that
it is most serious in practicing the role of mediation and stand
against Israel to compel it to abide by the peace process," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper made the criticism about a week after Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak returned home from an official visit to
Washington, where he tried to secure US support for the Arab
efforts to stop Israel from building more Jewish houses in the
occupied land, especially in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton defended the US veto at the Security
Council but reiterated it did not mean Washington was in favor of
the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with the US explanation, the Arab press came out
with harsher words towards Washington, reflecting growing public
frustration over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak warned Wednesday that the Middle East is
facing a most serious crisis in 20 years and his Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa accused Thursday Israel of killing the Middle East
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Take 30,000 Immigrants Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government hopes
to sustain immigration into the Republic at a rate of 30,000
people a year in order to help meet the country's shortage of
talent, the local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The television report said that Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong revealed this when he spoke to the Singapore media
at the end of his visit to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Sharing with New Zealanders on how Singapore remained
competitive and engaged in Asia despite having a small population
base, Lee said one way was by supplementing talent with qualified
people from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were about 5,000, more than the usual number
of immigrants, being taken in, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increased numbers were from India and overseas Chinese
students who had heard that Singapore was a good place to live and
work in, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister also said that another way to
maximize talent was through education. He said that the recent
University fee changes in Singapore were made to encourage more
students to take up engineering and the sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said there were still more to be done to encourage students
to take up sciences when they were in school and added that the
Government would like to see the percentage of girls in these
courses rise from about 25 percent now to 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, S. Africa Signs Memorandums on Dam, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique and South Africa
signed here Thursday two memorandums of mutual understanding
under which they will cooperate in building a dam and an aluminum
refinery in Mozambique in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 2500-megawatt dam will be built on the Zambeze River, 70
kilometers downstream from the Cahora Bassa hydropower station
with an installed capacity of 2075 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The aluminum refinery with an annual production of
245,000 tons will be constructed near here, the Noticias reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The documents were signed by Mozambican Minister of Mining
John Kachamila, Mozambican Minister of Industry, Commerce and
Tourism Oldemiro Baloi on one hand and South African Minister of
Mining and Energy Phanel Maduna and South African Aluminum
Company (ALUSAF) President Robert Barbour on the other.
</P>
<P>
The signing indicates the willingness of the two sides to
strengthen their cooperation and the regional integration, said
Kachamila.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the aluminum refinery in Mozambique will
promote the industrial development in South Africa and the whole
southern African region as well, Maduna noted.
</P>
<P>
The industrial advance in Mozambique will be meaningful for
other regions in Africa as the economic stride might start from
southern Africa, Maduna said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Western Africa Seeks Police Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Police chiefs of Western African
countries are meeting in Nigeria to seek cooperation on cracking
down on criminal activities, especially cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
A four-day conference to this effect is currently under way in
the Nigerian capital of Abuja, attended by police chiefs from the
16 member nations of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The conference, the first of its kind in the sub-region which
will end on Saturday, is aimed at forging a common mechanism for
combating crimes there, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS members have signed years ago a protocol on the free
movement of persons and goods among them in a bid to boost
economic integration in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Criminals have taken advantage of the protocol to traverse
borders for refuge while committing such crimes as car theft,
armed robbery and illicit trafficking of drugs, art works and
fire-arms.
</P>
<P>
With such crimes quickly gaining ground in the member nations,
no country is now safe from the activities, said General Sani
Abacha, Nigeria's Head of State and Chairman of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the conference on Wednesday, Abacha said a
legal framework is imperative to enhancing sub-regional police
cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in matters
relating to criminal investigation, extradition treaty, judicial
cooperation and joint operations programs.
</P>
<P>
"We must aspire to achieve security integration that is as
unique as our regional economic alliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to finalize regional cooperation
mechanism through which police could fashion an effective policy
for the sub-region, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also help define priority areas for the
day-to-day functions of the West African Bureau of the
International Police Organization.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Sex Hotline Popular Among HK Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Sex Hotline is popular
among Hong Kong youths with more than 60 percent of the callers at
the age of 20 or below, a survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen percent of the callers are even at the age of ten or
below.
</P>
<P>
The around-the-clock hotline, operative via the interactive
voice response system, has been inundated with calls from the
sexually confused since its launch in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people dialed the number as of February 1997,
the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
"We are surprised at the number of calls," Hong Kong Sex
Education Association (HKSEA) President Li Man-chin said.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the AIDS Trust Fund and the Health Care and
Promotion Fund, the hotline is organized by the HKSEA and the
Department of Health to help young people to acquire positive
understanding of and develop proper concepts about sex-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
"They really want to know about sexual acts and behavior --
what sex is -- because they can't get the information from
school," Li said.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the callers were male, while 90 percent
chose to listen to messages in Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
The recorded messages on the hotline cover six areas:
physiological, psychological and behavior aspects of sex, myths
about sex, sexually transmitted diseases, love and marriage,
pregnancy and contraception, and sex and law.
</P>
<P>
The hotline now employs three languages: Cantonese, English and
Putonghua.

<HEADLINE> HK Greets Bright Future: TDC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to her
motherland will ensure the territory more vitality in its
development, said Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Fung said, "As a Chinese, I am
looking forward to Hong Kong's handover with the approaching of
the day of June 30."
</P>
<P>
He said, "My confidence in Hong Kong's future arises from the
smooth transition in Hong Kong's political sector and the momentum
in its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I trust Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), for what he has done in the
past few months proved that he could lead Hong Kong into smooth
transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that with the support of the Chinese central
government, the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong' and 'high degree autonomy' will
be realized in the HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
On economic issue, Fung said, Hong Kong's return will bring it
more opportunities to tap its potentials and enhance its
competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, Hong Kong has benefited greatly from
the economic reforms and opening up in the Chinese inland areas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest overseas investor in the inland areas, the
Hong Kong-funded projects have reached more than 150,000 there
with about 50,000 manufacturing-oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1995, the total contracted investment from Hong
Kong investors in the inland areas reached 233.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hong Kong's investment has turned to
large-sized infrastructural projects including highways, ports and
power stations.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the service trade market in the Chinese
inland areas, Hong Kong expects to increase their investment in the
sectors of finance, retail sale, real estate and
telecommunications, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, Hong Kong and the Chinese inland
areas are also the largest trade partners to each other. In 1996,
the trade value of the two sides reached 134.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"More than half of the cargoes of the Chinese inland areas
shipped overseas passed Hong Kong," he said, adding that Hong
Kong's transshipping role for the inland areas will be
strengthened after 1997.
</P>
<P>
AS for TDC, Fung said, two roles are expected to be enhanced
after Hong Kong returns to China.
</P>
<P>
"In market promotion, TDC has set up 51 representative offices
in 34 countries and regions in the world and it has a worldwide
trade web on computer-linked net, which will be a useful mean for
the enterprises in the mainland to enter the international
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong can also serve as a training center for inland
enterprises to learn international business and community
management involving finance and securities, commercial and
industrial operations, effective administration and service
trade," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Posts, Telecommunications Corp. to Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation is scheduled to be replaced with
four independent institutions, according to the latest issue of
the Kenya Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The gazette said that the Communications Commission of Kenya,
the Telkom Kenya company, the Postal Corporation of Kenya and the
National Communications Secretariat will be established.
</P>
<P>
It stated that two bills published by Kenya's Attorney-General
Wako proposed that the commission would serve as the ultimate
regulatory authorities with powers to supervise and licence the
flow of information systems in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Wako noted that the bills would enable the liberalization and
privatization of the postal sector in order to attract capitals
from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily Nation today reported that the bills
came in the wake of intense lobbying by American
telecommunication giants -- Miscrowave Communications
International and American Telephone and Telegraph Inc.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the two companies are "anxiously waiting
to get a share in the Kenya information network."
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Kenyan government approved the sale of
five parastatal companies to speed up its privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Last year Kenya agreed on a 220 million U.S. Dollars aid plan
under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) soft-loan Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The first disbursement of 37 million Dollars was issued in
1996 and the second one which was due in November last year has
been delayed for three months because of what the IMF sees as a
slow progress on privatization.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an IMF review mission was not completed
because a privatization timetable for the Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation was not presented.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Hope for a Deal Despite Disagreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin met here today, hoping that they
could strike a deal despite their disagreements on the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"We must find constructive approaches and compromises," Yeltsin
said prior to the meeting, which took place at the Finnish
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who emerged from a white van, said the U.S. and Russia
have to approach each other and resolve their differences by
making compromises.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll work something out," Clinton said. "I think he
(Yeltsin) really came here to do business."
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to focus on NATO's expansion,
which is Washington's number one foreign policy priority, but
strongly opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin met "in a spirit that is open and candid
and realistic in dealing with some of the differences that exist,"
according to the White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who arrived here Wednesday, were accompanied
by their respective foreign ministers while they are meeting.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in Helsinki, Russian President promised a tough
fight over NATO enlargement. "President Clinton and I have
difficult and serious talks."
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said
that Yeltsin would defend Moscow's interests "like never before"
during the summit.
</P>
<P>
On her arrival in Helsinki, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright reaffirmed that NATO will implement its eastward
expansion plan as scheduled regardless of any opposition from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the two-day summit, Yastrzhembsky said that if
the alliance's expansion becomes true, it will be the "strategic
mistake" and "worst" decision after the end of the Cold War and
the West will pay a high price for it.
</P>
<P>
The firm positions on both sides have indicated that it is
difficult for them to make a deal on NATO's expansion. However,
Russian officials say that progress could be made in arms control
and the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival here, Yeltsin said, "Let us not lose
the partnership we have established and developed."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Clinton has brought a package of
concessions to Helsinki to woo Russia and spur the ratification of
START II treaty.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Mekong River Delta Gathers Bumper Rice Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 21 (xinhua) -- Farmers in the Mekong River Delta,
Vietnam's largest rice producing area, have a bumper winter-spring
rice harvest, achieving an average yield of six to seven tons per
hectare, and even up to nine tons in some areas, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An Giang Province, the biggest rice producing province in the
delta, harvested about 1.36 million tons of rice, a 100,000-ton
increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
Can Tho Province reached the one-million-ton mark for the first
time, with an average yield of six to 6.1 ton per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The present harvest came one month late because of heavy floods
and slowly receding water at the beginning of the crop season. As
a result, the follow-up summer-autumn rice crop will be one month
later than usual.
</P>
<P>
The flood season in the area lasts for three months beginning
in October.

that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
--Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Thursday that his

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: No Great Change Expected in Greek-Turkish Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite the recent spring
atmosphere in relations, a senior Greek diplomat ruled out major
change in the long-standing tension between the two countries,
local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the English paper, Greek
Ambassador to Turkey Dimitrios Nezeritis said Athens always
supported a Western-oriented Turkey because stability in the
region was important for Greece, but people should not take it
for granted that great change could be expected in Greek-Turkish
relations.
</P>
<P>
Nezeritis' remarks came following the latest positive
statements by Greek leaders on the issue of Ankara's bid for
full European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
In response to an earlier statement by EU Christian
Democrats that Turkey could not be a member of the EU
because of its Muslim culture, Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said Turkey was a part of Europe. And Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos voiced that Europe's reluctance to embrace
Turkey due to its religion identity was tantamount to fascism.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller sent congratulations to Greece and said she hoped
for dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nezeritis told the paper that he understood Ankara was
pleasantly surprised at the recent remarks from the Greek
government, adding that Athens supported Turkey's European
orientation only because of the geographic reason.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a neighbor of our country and no third country
can come between us," said the Greek ambassador, indicating that
security enjoyed priority in the relations between Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
When asked why Greece blocked EU funds for Turkey,
Nezeritis noted that Greece regretted the long-term tension in
bilateral relations and the Turkish position in the last crisis,
which made it impossible for Athens to take a completely
supportive stance.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey are traditionally rival countries because
of the controversial Agean Sea and Cyprus issues. The two
countries came to the brink of war at the beginning of last
year in a dispute over the sovereignty of the uninhabited
small island of Imia (Kardak or Ikizce for Turkey).
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two countries also drew international
focus following the Greek-backed Cyprus government's decision to
buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia early this year, leading
to a visit of Turkish Navy warships to northern Cyprus aimed
at showing Ankara's military support to the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried from the beginning to keep the latest
crisis self-contained so it could be dealt with easily. This
is why we suggested a step by step approach to these
issues," Nezeritis said.
</P>
<P>
As for the press reports that Greece wanted to see Turkey
in the EU because it thought the bilateral problem could be
solved this way, the ambassador said," Once Turkey becomes a
full EU member, the problem would be settled through the
interference of the EU. I don't think we need to make this
issue more complicated."

strongly opposed by Russia.

<HEADLINE> MOU Ties Guangdong And AT&AMP;T Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The US telecom leader AT&AMP;T signed
a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with South China's Guangdong
Province on March 19, to supply the province with technical
support and consultancy, AT&AMP;T representatives announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the MOU clinched by Cui Xun, director of
Guangdong Posts and Telecom Administration, and Art Kobler,
president of AT&AMP;T (China) Inc., the two partners will cooperate on
nine proposed projects, including establishing a provincial-level
electronic data interchange (EDI) network, accelerating broadband
and multi-media applications, optimizing the wireless network,
setting up a call center, and founding an electronic tax-payment
system.
</P>
<P>
Cui told the signing ceremony that Guangdong experienced fast
development in telecommunications industry since China adopted the
reform and opening-up policy in late 1970s, and has launched a
"comparatively advanced telecom network".
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore both necessary and realistic to further
develop applications and offer new services," he said, adding that
the provincial government welcomes such technical cooperation with
AT&AMP;T and other global telecom carriers.
</P>
<P>
John Legere, president of AT&AMP;T Asia/Pacific, said on behalf of
AT&AMP;T that as traditional business partners of Guangdong, "We see
this agreement as an important step in what we expect will be a
long and mutually rewarding relationship with Guangdong."
</P>
<P>
One of the oldest telecom empires founded in 19th century, AT&AMP;T
now operates in 14 countries and territories across Asia and the
Pacific Region, and has joint ventures in China, Australia, India,
Japan and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Currency Reserve Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel's foreign currency
reserves attained an all-time record of 13.974 billion dollars in
February, registering an increase of 1.182 billion dollars during
the month, according to a report of bi-weekly Israel Business
Today.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting figures released by the Bank of Israel
earlier this month, said the reserves had risen by close 2.5
billion dollars, or 22 percent, since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said that the large increase in foreign
currency reserves is a result of the bank's acquisitions of
foreign currency from the private sector, and from the continued
placement of funds by foreign residents in the country. The Bank
of Israel bought around 1 billion dollars of foreign currency
from the private sector in February, following purchases totaling
1.2 billion in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The country's reserves of foreign currency rose by 5.82
billion dollars since the beginning of 1996 -- a rise of 71
percent compared with the level in December 1995. Since the
beginning of 1994, the reserves have increased by 7.2 billion
dollars, or 105 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel's SWAP (shekel-dollar transactions with the
commercial banks) transactions to date amount to 2.2 billion
dollars, which would have brought the foreign currency reserves
up to 16.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The volume of foreign currency transactions with customers
during February reached 6.32 billion dollars, with the mean daily
level rising 8.1 percent to 372 million dollars, compared with
the January daily volume of 344 million dollars. The inter-bank
foreign currency transaction level, however, dropped to 975
million dollars from a January level of 1.65 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Manila Undecided on Claim to Marcos' Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has not
yet agreed on a compromise settlement with the victims of late
former president Ferdinand Marcos on the 450 million US dollar
Marcos' deposits in Swiss banks, President Fidel Ramos said today.
</P>
<P>
"A Cabinet cluster is still working on it," Ramos told
reporters when attending a ceremony marking the 11th anniversary
of the Presidential Security Group.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Silvestre Bello, member of the government
panel holding peace talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF)
in the Netherlands, said earlier that the government is
considering an NDF demand to share the deposits to pave the way
for a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The NDF had earlier questioned the sincerity of the
government's peace efforts after it evaded the question of sharing
the Marcos money with some 10,000 victims during the Marcos
regime.
</P>
<P>
Bello said Thursday in a telephone interview that the
government was "inclined to withdraw its claim to the Swiss
deposits."
</P>
<P>
He said the government "will conclude an agreement for the
indemnification of the victims" under the Marcos regime as "an
addendum to the joint agreement on security and immunity guarantee
forged between the government and the NDF."
</P>
<P>
The more than 10,000 victims had earlier won a damage suit
before the Honolulu District Court in the United States against
the Marcoses for alleged abuses committed on them during the 20
years of Marcos' rule.
</P>
<P>
With the decision, the district court had ordered a freeze on
all deposits of the Marcoses in various Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine government, opposing the victims' claim,
said the Marcos estate must first pay its taxes to the government
and asserted its demand with the filing of a probate proceeding
before a regional trial court.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Sino-US Trade Balance (13) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the year 2000, China will have initially established a
system of socialist market economy and built up a unified and
standard foreign-related economic regime, which will create better
conditions for the world's business communities including those
from the United States to develop economic and trade co-operation
with China. Equality and mutual benefit are the cardinal principle
of international trade. It is normal that countries will seek to
protect their own interests, which may lead to trade frictions and
disputes. The key lies in how to cope with these issues correctly
in a cool and wise way. China has always advocated that parties
involved should adhere to the principle of mutual respect and
settle bilateral or multilateral trade disputes, reasonably,
through friendly discussions. Having experienced a winding course
in their bilateral relations, China and the United States should
cherish the mainstream in the two-way trade development, look to
the future and face the reality with a constructive
attitude. Bullying, forcing unacceptable demands on the other
through constant threats of trade sanctions and even actually
imposing sanctions will not help solve problems but cause damage
to the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
It is China's sincere wish and also to the interest of the
United States to expand bilateral trade and economic
co-operation. Both governments are obliged to provide a sound and
stable climate for the long-term development of the bilateral
trade and economic co-operation. It is their duty to
substantially improve bilateral trade ties and lay a solid
foundation for developing and balancing trade between the two
countries. We welcome the business communities from the United
States to play an active role in fair competition on the Chinese
market. We wish the US Government will take forcible measures to
fuel stronger growth in two-way trade and economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
We are happy to note that, when they met on the sideline of the
summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC)
forum last November in Manila, the Philippines, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton reached a wide range of
consensus on the comprehensive, healthy and stable development in
bilateral ties. Following the summit, three Sino-US joint
committees on commerce and trade, economy and science and
technology were convened in succession. The active and pragmatic
attitude as reflected in the meetings helped promote the
development in bilateral trade ties, reinforce exchange and
co-operation, enhance mutual understanding and inject new vigour
into bilateral ties. Looking to the future, China has confidence
in the development of Sino-US economic and trade
co-operation. China and the United States have every reason and
should strive together to open new and better prospects in their
trade ties. It serves the fundamental interests of both peoples.

<HEADLINE> Arab Intellectuals Petition for Peace in E.Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven Egyptian intellectuals are
traveling to Israel today to team up with Jordanians,
Palestinians and Israelis for a planned demonstration in East
Jerusalem, protesting Israeli actions in the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration is part of a two-day agenda for launching the
International Alliance for Arab-Israeli Peace(IAAIP), a popular
pressure front formed at Copenhagen at the end of January to press
for the continuation of the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Members of Israel's Peace Now movement, Knesset members,
Palestinians from across the political spectrum as well as
Jordanians and Egyptians are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
According to political analyst Lutfi el-Kholi, the Alliance
will initiate a movement opposing Israel's negative policies
towards the peace process, namely the building of Jewish quarter
of Har Homa and the decision to shut down four Palestinian offices
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the East Jerusalem march, the intellectuals and
public figures will also meet with Israeli citizens and talk with
the Palestinian National Authority, in a show of support for the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The trip aims to condemn all actions taken by the Israeli
government which show that it does not respect signed agreements
and the principles of the peace process, as outlined in the
Copenhagen Declaration," said Kholi, who is traveling to Israel
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent opinion poll by Israel Radio, about 47
percent Israelis support the Israeli Har Homa construction while
49 percent oppose it.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if the two-day activities in East Jerusalem
are effective, the credit and legitimacy of the movement will be
greatly boosted.

MACAO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to stage a promotion
campaign to spread knowledge on the prevention of tuberculosis, a
infectious disease that has high incidence in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The government's Health Department said between March 24 and 29
it will hold lectures and education courses for students and
workers as well as local residents to help them catch the correct
information about the disease.
</P>
<P>
A patient with the disease coughs, has fever, becomes thin and
often sweats. He or she can pass on the disease to others through
the air.
</P>
<P>
About three million people die of the disease a year across the
world. In Macao, about 125 people out of every 100,000 catch the
disease annually, and five of them will die, local health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the Health Department established a special
working team, composed of 12 doctors, psychologists and
sociologists, to carry out the promotion campaign.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is making efforts to control the increasing
tuberculosis (TB), the Star local daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has to spend 500 million Rands (113 million U.S.
Dollars) a year on TB control, Olive Shisana, the
Director-General of Health was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
TB, the biggest killer among various epidemics in South
Africa, killed 10,000 people and made 160,000 people sick last year,
an official survey said.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 million new cases were expected by 2005 if current
trends continue, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
To curb the epidemic, the South African government is
implementing the internationally-proven DOTS (directly observed
treatment short course) strategy.
</P>
<P>
However, the TB cure rate in four of the nine provinces in
South Africa has increased by
between nine and 26 percent, according to an investigation by the
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to the DOTS strategy, and to the promise of
curing 85 percent of TB patients by the year 2000," Shisana said.

<HEADLINE> Old Oilfields Still Have Untapped Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The aging oilfields in the
eastern part of China will remain the major oil producers into the
early next century, with the annual oil output forecast at 115
million tons by the year 2000, or 90 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the oilfields in eastern China, the output
of which accounts for over 90 percent of the country's total, have
limited the rate of natural output decline to within 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these oilfields have accelerated prospecting to push
the oil production capacity to 64 million tons, thus maintaining
output.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the year 2000, Daqing, Shengli and
Liaohe , three of the country's leading oilfields, will stabilize
their outputs at 53 million tons, 26.5 million tons and 15.5
million tons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the annual outputs of the North China, Dagang and
Jilin oilfields will reach around five million tons each. The
output of the Jiangsu Oilfield in east China exceeded one million
tons last year, and it is expected to maintain its growth. Other
oilfields such as those of Zhongyuan, Henan and Jianghan, also
report growth in production.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official said that by the year 2000 China's onshore
oil output is expected to hit between 145 million tons and 150
million tons, of which some 29.5 million tons will be pumped out
by the oilfields in the western and central parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> UN Assembly President Proposes Security Council Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly (GA)
President Ismail Razali proposed today that the members of the UN
Security Council should be increased from 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, which was distributed among member states
in the form of GA draft resolution, five new permanent members and
four non-permanent members are going to be added to the 15-member
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In introducing the proposal, Ismail said that three out of five
new permanent members of the Security Council shall be elected
from Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean region. And
the other two will be elected from industrialized states.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the four new non-permanent members, Ismail said
they have to come one each from African states, Asian states,
Eastern European states and Latin American and Caribbean states.
</P>
<P>
"The underpinning of this proposal is based on the need to
enhance the representativeness, the credibility, the legitimacy
and authority of the Security Council," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the objectives of our exercise is to take steps
that will manifest a qualitative change in all aspects of the
Security Council, so that the council becomes more effective in
exercising its primary role to maintain international peace and
security on behalf of all member states of the UN," he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that according to his proposal, all aspirants are
expected to declare their readiness to assume the responsibilities
of permanent membership to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"No one state will become a new permanent member unless another
four in the pattern I have described also obtain the required
majority of at least two-thirds of votes in the General Assembly,"
he said. "The fate of any one is therefore inextricably linked to
the fate of the others, thus preventing a so-called quick fix."
</P>
<P>
The so-called quick fix is advocated by the United States,
which intends to admit Germany and Japan into the Security Council
as permanent members first and then consider the developing
world's candidacies for the permanent seats.
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, Ismail also touched upon questions of veto
powers of the permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the new permanent members of the Security
Council have no provision of the veto power and that the original
permanent members limit the exercise of their veto power to
actions taken to maintain international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Sino-US Trade Balance (10) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US export control policies and lingering sanctions against
China have greatly restricted US exports to China as well as US
investment in high-tech sectors on the territory of the latter. In
short, these measures have bottlenecked Sino-US economic and trade
co-operation. The negative effects of these measures on bilateral
economic and trade co-operation and on US businesses can be seen
in the following examples:
</P>
<P>
-- In early 1980s, China conducted technical and commercial
negotiations with the US Westinghouse and General Electric
companies over the purchase of equipment for the Qinshan nuclear
power plant (300,000 kilowatts) and the Daya Bay nuclear power
plant (900,000 kilowatts). But the talks failed due to US export
control. In 1985, China and the United States signed the
``Agreement for Co-operation Between the Government of the
People's Republic of China and the Government of the United States
of America Concerning the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy.'' It was
immediately approved by China. But the US Congress insisted on
attaching many preconditions thereto. As a result, the protocol
has yet to take effect. At present, China's nuclear power industry
is expanding, prompting substantial import of technologies and
equipment. US nuclear power enterprises, with enormous interests,
have lost their chance of export to China because of the US
Government control over nuclear energy technology.
</P>
<P>
-- In mid-1980s, similar restrictions ripped US exporters of
potential business opportunities worth several billion US dollars
when China planned to import technologies and equipment for
integrated circuits and programme-controlled telephone switching
boards. In recent years, China still hopes to buy electronic
components and related manufacturing and testing equipment from
the United States. But again, the US Government's discriminatory
control policies have prevented US businesses from selling them to
China.
</P>
<P>
-- China needs to import advanced machine tools, thus
providing good trade opportunities for US manufacturers. But the
US Government's strict export control has forestalled normal
business with China.
</P>
<P>
The above examples are but a drop in the sea. Under the US
Government's discriminatory export control policies towards China,
not only a large number of Chinese customers are unable to
co-operate with US exporters, but US exporters themselves stand to
lose trade opportunities. Some analyses have concluded that the
United States has lost an average of several billion dollars of
exports each year to China in the recent past due to such
discriminatory policies. It makes no sense for the United States
to play up trade deficit against China on the one hand, and
continue its export control on the other.
</P>
<P>
While the US Government maintains such discriminatory export
control policies towards China, other industrialized countries
have, one by one, cancelled their discriminatory policies and have
even provided China with governmental financial support for its
import of capital goods. This has definitely enhanced the
competitiveness of their products on the Chinese market. The
European Union member countries are not only free from any trade
deficit, but have enjoyed an average annual trade surplus worth
several billion US dollars with China. This comparison between EU
and the United States speaks aloud on the different effects on
bilateral trade balance brought by different export policies
towards China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government hopes the US Government will, proceeding
from the long-term interest of bilateral trade and economic
co-operation, adopt effective measures to relax or even cancel the
current discriminatory export control policies against China so as
to usher in a healthy and balanced Sino-US trade
relationship. This is a realistic way of resolving the trade
balance issue between China and the United States.

V. Sino-US Economic and Trade Co-operation Shows Vast Vistas
</P>
<P>
Lasting economic and trade co-operation between China and the
United States requires sustainable and balanced growth in
bilateral trade. The Chinese side has always paid great attention
to the need and taken active measures to increase imports from the
United States. China's market is open to US goods and
services. Over the past years, China has purchased a great amount
of US products. Investment sectors in China for US businesses have
widened and the scale of US investment in the country has been
growing continuously. All these have brought US enterprises huge
profits.
</P>
<P>
-- Trade in commodities: Between 1979 and 1996, China bought
69.476 million tons, or 11.62 billion US dollars worth, of wheat
from the United States. Now, China is the largest buyer of US
wheat. In the period, China also bought 46.243 million tons, or
9.56 billion US dollars worth, of chemical fertilizers and 308
aircraft worth 8.72 billion US dollars from the United States.
</P>
<P>
-- US investment in China: US investment in China has been
increasing rapidly. Among the top-500 US enterprises listed by the
Fortune magazine, more than 100 have so far invested in various
fields in China.
</P>
<P>
-- Banking and insurance: Five US banks have altogether set up
eight branches in China. Three out of the six foreign insurers
operating in China are US companies, respectively set up by
American International Assurance Co. and the AIU Insurance Co. --
both subsidiaries of American International Group Inc. (AIG).
</P>
<P>
-- Shipping services: APL (China) and Sealand (China) are the
earliest wholly foreign-owned shipping companies to start
operating in China, where they already have nine subsidiaries at
present.
</P>
<P>
-- Retailing: US retailers, including the renowned Walmart
Co., have also entered the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
In order to open China's market wider, China and the United
States signed the Memorandum of Understanding Between the
Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of
the United States of America Concerning Market Access in October
1992. In the following years, China has made earnest efforts to
fulfill the various obligations as stipulated in the memorandum,
and has taken a series of active measures in line with its reforms
and opening drive. Take sanitary and phyto-sanitary quarantine as
an example: After joint research and analyses by experts from both
countries, China not only abolished its import control over apples
from the Washington State and wheat from California, but has
signed with the United States new quarantine protocols on such
imports as pigs, horses, dogs and genetic materials. In April
1994, China and the United States reached an agreement on hygiene
quarantine provisions on cherry imports from the Washington State
and imports of relevant species of apples grown in Idaho and
Oregon. All these have helped further development of Sino-US
economic and trade ties.

districts with 156 votes in favor, one against and three
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by Bidandi Ssali, the minister of
local government in the name of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggested initially to create seven new
districts, but only six of them were ratified at Thursday's
session of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new districts are Sembabule and Nakasongola in the central
Buganda region, Adjumani in the north, Bukholi, Busia and
Katakwi in the east.
</P>
<P>
The proposed district of Koboko in the north was withdrawn
from the voting due to the dissidence on the name of the district

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Elections To Shift Balance Of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Today's local government
elections in Sri Lanka may see a shift in the balance of power in
the country's local government bodies.
</P>
<P>
In the local government elections in 1991, the present
opposition United National Party (UNP), which was then in power,
swept the polls to win 49.4 percent of the vote and won a total of
193 out of 237 local bodies as against 35 won by the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party (SLFP), the main partner in the ruling Peoples
Alliance (PA) which polled 35.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, the UNP won 9 out of 10 Municipal Councils,
28 out of 33 Urban Councils and 156 out of 194 Village Councils as
against the SLFP's one Municipal Council, two Urban Councils and
33 Village Councils.
</P>
<P>
At the parliamentary elections in 1994, however, the PA won
power and at the Presidential elections that followed, President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, the PA candidate, won a record 63 percent
of the poll.
</P>
<P>
The public believed that the PA is expected to do better and
win more local government Councils at today's elections.
</P>
<P>
However, according to analysts here, the PA will not be able to
retain the 63 percent poll it won at the Presidential elections in
1994 nor will the UNP be able to retain the 193 Councils it won at
the 1991 local government elections.
</P>
<P>
They said that today's elections will witness a change in the
balance of power in the country's local government bodies.

China is now in a period of rapid economic growth, estimated to
average at least 8% a year in the run-up to 2000 and maintain
above 7% in the first decade of the 21st century -- promising
broad market potentials. An example is the market demand for
energy and communications construction. In the next five years,
China will increase its installed power-generating capacity by
80,000 megawatts and build 16,000-kilometres-long new railways
plus another 2,800 kilometres of freeways. It also plans to build
another 150,000 kilometres of optic fibre cables and increase
telephone switching capacity by 70-80 million lines. China will
continue to introduce overseas capital, technologies and equipment
in an active, rational and effective way. China's imports
increased to 138.8 billion US dollars in 1996 from 10.9 billion US
dollars in 1978, representing an annual average growth of
15.2%. Between 1997 and 2000, cumulative imports to China will top
700 billion US dollars. China's economic growth will offer a
massive market for world trade and investment. Back in 1994, the
United States' Department of Commerce put China on the top of
``top-10 emerging markets,'' reflecting its high evaluation on
potentials of the Chinese market. The Chinese market is opening
wider while the competition is also getting tougher. We are
willing to see that US enterprises win more chances to compete on
the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports to the United States are mainly
labour-intensive products. These products pose no threat to the
production of US enterprises. An economist from the US-based
Institute of International Economics was quoted by a Washington
Post story in June 1996 as saying: It is true that the United
States imports more and more toys and shoes from China, but these
industries have almost vanished in the United States. Clyde
Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute of the
United States, pointed out in an article in a December 1996 issue
of the US News &AMP; World Report that China's exports to the United
States are large in industries where the United States does not
make things anymore. Labour-intensive Chinese exports to the
United States will neither affect industrial production and
employment in the United States, nor affect international market
shares for US products. Instead, they are beneficial complements
to the economic structure of the United States and can help the
United States to readjust its economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Paralleling with the gradual deepening of its economic reforms
in recent years, China has increasingly amplified its
foreign-related legal system, steadily improved its trade and
investment environment and enforced the intellectual property
rights protection system. On the issue of trade system
transparency, China has sorted out and publicized all management
documents that used to be deemed confidential and publicly
abolished 744 of them. In 1993, the Bulletin of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation of the People's Republic
of China was launched to exclusively carry laws and regulations on
the management of foreign trade and economic co-operation. Import
restriction was further eased and by the end of 1995, China had
rescinded import licensing and quota control over 826 tariff
lines. Since the past year, China has again taken a series of
important measures to improve its foreign-related economic regime
and policies as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- A massive cut in the import tariffs of more than 4,000
tariff lines was introduced in April 1996, bringing average tariff
from 35.3% down to 23%. It has also pledged to further lower
overall tariff rate to 15% by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
-- China has taken active steps to phase out non-tariff measures.
Only 384 items of imports are subject to the measures today as compared
with 1,247 before. China has also set forth a timetable to further
lift such measures.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1996, the Chinese currency Renminbi became freely convertible
under the current account, enabling foreign-invested companies to
be free in international settlement and transfer under the current
account.
</P>
<P>
-- China has started, on a trial basis, to open its market to
foreign investors in such service sectors as domestic retailing,
finance, insurance and foreign trade. Some foreign companies and
financial institutions have already entered these markets. In the
Pudong New Area of Shanghai, some foreign banks have begun
handling Renminbi business.

<P>
Sino-US trade is marked by two characteristics: the bulk of the
trade is conducted through entrepot trade and processing
trade. Both China's exports to the United States and US exports to
China are largely conducted through a third partner, mainly the
Hong Kong region, while an overwhelming majority of China's
exports to the United States are processed products -- finished
goods made of imported raw materials, auxiliary parts or
primarily-processed items. The domination of entrepot and
processing trade has promoted the fast growth of Sino-US trade
volume, but, at the same time, resulted in a relatively large
deviation between the statistics and reality of trade figures of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trade exchanges, US investment in China has also
witnessed extensive development. By the end of 1996, 22,240
projects with US investment had been launched in China with a
committed investment volume of 35.17 billion US dollars. Paid-up
investment in those projects totalled 14.29 billion US
dollars. Excluding the regions of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the United
States is the second largest investor in China, next only to
Japan. In the mean time, US service exports to China also have
recorded fast development.
</P>
<P>
II. Statistical Difference in Sino-US Trade Balance
</P>
<P>
In recent years, bilateral trade balance, particularly huge US
trade deficit from its trade with China as claimed by the US side,
has roused extensive attention. Statistics and analyses prove it
true that Sino-US trade has been in favour of China in recent
years, but it is obvious that the size of the US deficit has been
largely exaggerated by the US side.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the US side indicate that Sino-US trade had
been in favour of the US side during the 1979-82 period, but the
United States started suffering from deficit in 1983 and the figure
amounted to 39.5 billion US dollars in 1996. Chinese statistics,
however, indicate that China had suffered from deficit in the
bilateral trade during the 14 years between 1979 and 1992. Surplus
first appeared in 1993 and the figure rose to 10.5 billion US
dollars in 1996. Obviously, there exists remarkable difference
between China and the United States in their estimation of
bilateral trade balance situation (see Table 1).

<TEXT>
<P>
To diagnose the large difference in the bilateral trade
statistics by China and the United States and the large US trade
deficit against China under US statistics, the US side agreed to a
proposal made by China in 1994 on establishing a bilateral trade
statistics expert group under the Sino-US Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade to undertake special studies of the subject. US
members in the group were composed of experts from the Census
Bureau of the Department of Commerce of the United States, while
Chinese members in the group were experts from the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation and the General
Administration of Customs. The experts from both sides completed
the work report of the Trade Statistics Subgroup of the Trade and
Investment Working Group of the Sino-US Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade on the basis of abundant facts after they spent
more than one year comparing 1992 and 1993 statistical data from
China, the United States and the Hong Kong region, processing
several hundred thousand records, sorting out several hundred
analysis tables. The report believed that the US statistics had
over-estimated at least the following factors in producing the
large trade deficit against China:
</P>
<P>
First, the US import statistics has ignored entrepot trade and
value added from entrepot trade to over-estimate its imports from
China. A large part of Sino-US trade is conducted through
entrepot trade via a third place. Under Chinese statistics, 60% of
Chinese exports to the United States are conducted through
entrepot trade via a third place, mainly the Hong Kong
region. According to US information, only 20% of Chinese goods are
directly shipped to the United States, while the remaining 80% get
into the United States through a third place. It is obvious that
the added value created at the third place after the goods have
left China shall not be calculated as exports from China. The
conclusion of the Trade Statistics Subgroup of the Trade and
Investment Working Group of the Sino-US Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade was: The average rate of value-adding of
Chinese exports to the United States via the Hong Kong region was
40.7% in the past two years, which was far above the re-export
value-adding rate under general circumstances. The value adding
rate of some of the major re-exported commodities, such as toys
and knitwear, even exceeded 100%. Chinese mainland products
acquired an added value of 5.23 billion US dollars in 1992 and 6.3
billion US dollars in 1993 at Hong Kong before they were
re-exported to the United States. The US side, however,
calculated the added value created in Hong Kong region's entrepot
trade as imports from China, and thus greatly over-calculated its
import value from China.

<TEXT>
<P>
Secondly, the US statistics of its exports to China have been
under-estimated by neglecting re-exports. According to analyses by
experts of the Sino-US Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, the
amount of re-exports to China via the Hong Kong region included in
the US statistics of its exports to China was only about a quarter
of that included in Hong Kong's statistics. In 1992 and 1993
respectively, about 1.8 billion US dollars and 2.3 billion US
dollars worth of US exports to China, through entrepot trade via
Hong Kong, were not included in the US statistics of its exports
to China.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the US method in determining the origin of goods also
leads to the discrepancies in the statistics of the two sides. The
judgment of the origin of ordinary imported goods is usually based
on the declaration by importers. Goods determined as originating
in China are recorded as imports from China, regardless of whether
they are actually exports via a third place or whether the goods
have acquired added value in that third place. Some imports which
have been recorded by the United States as imports from China
should, most probably, be recorded as imports from other third
countries or regions. Experts of both sides acknowledged that
further studies are needed on the issue of determination of origin.
</P>
<P>
Leaving aside the error caused by the rules of origin, the US
statistics over-estimated trade deficit against China by 7 billion
US dollars in 1992 and 8.6 billion US dollars in 1993, or the
published US trade deficits against China in these two years were
exaggerated by more than 60% (see Table 2), merely through
neglecting entrepot trade and value added from entrepot trade
alone.

<P>
In addition, the United States has also under-estimated its
export value to China because of its incomplete export
statistics. On December 5, 1996, officials with the Census Bureau
of the US Department of Commerce pointed out in the Business
Journal that at least 10% of US exports might have been overlooked
in statistics because exports, unlike imports, are not taxed and
do not bring the government any direct revenue. According to such
estimate, at least 1 billion US dollars of US exports to China
might have been left out in the US statistics in 1992 and 1993
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Considering the aforementioned factors, the US trade deficit
against China was over-estimated by 8 billion US dollars in 1992
and 9.6 billion US dollars in 1993, and that represents an average
over-estimation rate of about 70%. The trade statistics expert
group was only in charge of investigating and analyzing the
difference between the trade statistics published by China and the
United States. The trade statistics methods adopted by the two
sides have not been correspondingly adjusted, and the US side's
over-estimation of its trade deficit against China has not since
changed substantially. Calculated by the aforesaid rate, the 1996
US trade deficit against China, as published by the US side, was
over-estimated by an amount of some 16 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The so-called enormous trade deficit against China under the US
statistics in recent years is attributable to a variety of
factors, including flaws in statistical techniques and methods as
well as the US policies to China. Therefore, it is far from being
sufficient to evaluate the two nations' trade balance situation
only on the basis of the trade statistics of the US
side. Fundamentally, the protracted US trade deficit against other
countries is determined by its own deep-rooted economic
factors. It should not shift the blame upon other countries.
</P>
<P>
III. Statistics Based on Rules of Origin Cannot Accurately
</P>
<P>
Reflect the Situation of Sino-US Trade Balance
</P>
<P>
Currently, both China and the United States calculate their external
trade according to the principle of origin of goods. A growing number
of international economists and statisticians believe, however, that
there are irrationalities in this currently widely-used international
statistical principle, especially because big errors might occur
when it is applied to calculating entrepot trade and processing trade.
Here lies the essence of the matter when the United States seriously
exaggerates its trade deficit against China and distorts bilateral
trade balance.

<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics by origin refers to the determination of the source
of the imports as the place where they were grown, manufactured or
processed to make substantial changes. As a tool for countries
to exercise trade management, the rules of origin have been
important in the history of world trade. Today it is still widely
applied to executing multinational trade accords and implementing
foreign trade policy measures by different countries. On how to
judge whether goods concerned have undergone ``substantial
changes,'' however, there lacks a unified and detailed criterion
for its application. The ``International Convention on Customs
Procedures of Simplification and Harmonization'' stipulated by the
Customs Co-operation Council in 1973 contains in its appendix one
annex on the rules of origin, which indicates only principles but
no enforceable provisions. The Uruguay Round negotiations of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) reached the
``Agreement on Rules of Origin,'' aiming at co-ordinating member
countries' rules of origin on non-preferential imports. The job to
formulate the technical standards on the co-ordination principle
was entrusted to the World Customs Organization but has not been
accomplished till today. Due to the lack of internationally
unified rules of origin, countries formulate rules of origin
according to their own needs, resulting in different criteria,
leaving room for discretion.
</P>
<P>
It deserves to be specially noted that the limitations of the
old rules of origin are being increasingly exposed by the
development of the world economy and great changes in the global
economic pattern. In the past when cross-border trade and
investment were scarce and commodity exchange ties among countries
relatively simple, statistics based on the origin of goods could
grossly reflect the division of labour, trade relations and
corresponding pattern of interests among countries. Today,
propelled by fast-growing economic and trade co-operation among
countries in the world and cross-border investment that is
increasing by the day, goods exchanged through international trade
are no longer products made by one country, but ``world products''
whose manufacture involves efforts from several countries. It is
obviously difficult for the current rules of origin, as employed
by trade statistics, to accurately reflect the main changes in
world economic development; these rules could even result in a
distorted picture of trade balance situation.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the
Secretariat and the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau,
met here this morning with Obuchi Keizo, former vice-president of
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan, and his party.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the Japanese visitors, Hu said that this

results, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the establishment and development of a
long-term, healthy and stable good-neighborly friendship between
China and Japan are of great significance for the two countries,
as well as for the peace, stability and development of Asia and
the world at large.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should view and grasp the general trend of the
development of bilateral relations from a long-range and strategic
height," noted Hu.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides should learn from history and remove
interferences to push forward a healthy and steady development of
bilateral relations, on the basis of the Sino-Japanese Joint

Hence it is not difficult to conclude that, 1) While applying
the origin-based statistics, it is imperative to be fully aware of
the method's limitations and discern from the figures the actual
benefits of all trading parties after careful analysis. That is
the only way conducive to removing misunderstanding and properly
settling bilateral trade disputes. 2) It is also a must to note
the trend of increasingly closer international economic links and
ever-growing cross-border investment and service trade that are
growing by the day, and on that ground improve and perfect the
computing of trade figures so that statistics will comply with
reality and better serve the mutually beneficial co-operation
among countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
IV. US Export Control Against China -- a Major Obstacle for
Bilateral Trade Balance
</P>
<P>
The United States has adopted discriminatory export control
policies towards China for many years. These policies have
hindered US exports to China and therefore have become a major
obstacle for bilateral trade balance.
</P>
<P>
It is acknowledged that, since the two countries established
diplomatic relations in 1979, the United States has relaxed
control on exports to China by categorizing the latter into group
``P'' first and group ``V'' later. But China has not fully enjoyed
treatment for ``V'' countries as the United States has retained a
number of discriminatory measures in its policy making and
implementation. It was after 1983 that member states of the former
COMCO, including the United States, began to consider an ease of
export control on China. In September of 1985, resolutions were
adopted to simplify approval procedures concerning exports to
China, which, however, demanded not to change the final use and
end users of ``controlled export items.'' The Chinese Government's
response was positive. For many years, the Chinese Government has
been earnest in carrying out its promise about ``end users'' and
``final use.'' Certain effective measures have been adopted to
honour the promise. The results have been obvious. Other Western
countries have accepted ``Elaboration on End Users and Final Use''
made by the Chinese Government. However, only the United States
has indicated doubts, demanding China to come up with extra
undertakings about US ``controlled export items.'' For example,
end users should accept pre-licensing inspection and double check
after unloading of imported goods; and various unduly strict
conditions are attached to granting of licenses, such as
around-the-clock spot surveillance and free random check. All
these are difficult for China to accept. Upon the disintegration
of COMCO -- a product of the Cold War -- in March 1994, the United
States could not but adjust its export control
policies. Nevertheless, its discriminatory measures towards China
remained largely intact.
</P>
<P>
We have noticed that Sino-US trade relations witnessed certain
progress in the 1980s when the United States relaxed export
control on China. But, since the beginning of the 1990s, the
United States has instituted a series of new sanctions against
China, many of which concern export control. This change has led
to severe consequences and gradually an unfavourable reverse of
trade balance for the United States. It is hard to say that such a
change -- indeed a double-edged sword -- is wise.

<P>
Processing trade that has boomed in some countries and regions
over the last two to three decades had the problem further
complicated. Processing trade means a country importing main raw
materials and auxiliary parts to be processed or assembled and
re-exported. According to current rules, the country is deemed the
place of origin because within it the imported goods have
undergone substantial changes. Due to the fact that main raw
materials and auxiliary parts are imported, however, the
processing country often profits little from the trade. This was
well illustrated in the ``Barbie doll'' example cited in the
``Barbie and the World Economy'' story which was run on the
September 22, 1996 edition of the Los Angles Times. The story said
that in the United States, the retail price of a ``Barbie'' toy
imported from China was 9.99 US dollars compared to an import
price of 2 US dollars. Of the 2 US dollars, China gained 35 US
cents in service fee, another 65 US cents were spent on importing
raw materials and still another 1 US dollar covers costs of
transportation and management. To account the 2 US dollars as the
revenue of Chinese exports to the United States according to rules
of origin is clearly unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
Processing trade expansion is a major factor behind China's
export growth in the 1990s. Total export volume rose to 151.1
billion US dollars in 1996 from 62.1 billion US dollars in 1990,
up 16% per year on average. In the period, processing trade soared
from 25.42 billion US dollars to 84.33 billion US dollars, an
annual rise of 22.1%. In the 1990-96 period, the ratio of
processing trade to overall Chinese exports rose from 41% to
55.8%, and even amounted to 70% in its share of Chinese exports to
the United States in 1996. The bulk of the sector has developed
since the mid-1980s when investors from developed countries
including the United States and Japan as well as Singapore, the
Republic of Korea, and the Hong Kong and Taiwan regions started to
move their labour-intensive industries or production procedures to
China in a bid to cut production cost and enhance international
competitiveness. Dependent on overseas investors' original
marketing channels, processing trade products are primarily sold
to their traditional markets including the United States via
entrepot trade through Hong Kong. To calculate them according to
certain rules of origin, China -- instead of the investors' home
countries or regions and exporters of materials and auxiliary
parts -- became the exporter. According to statistics published by
the US Department of Commerce and reports from the US-China
Business Council, the United States' trade deficit against
Singapore, the Republic of Korea and the Hong Kong and Taiwan
regions fell from 34 billion US dollars to 7.8 billion US dollars
in the 1987-95 period, and in the meantime its trade deficit
against China rocketed from 2.8 billion US dollars to 33.8 billion
US dollars. These figures reflected the aforementioned process of
place-of-origin transfer and showed that the trade balance between
the United States and the countries and regions in Asia as a whole
has not substantially changed over the years. In recent years,
more than two-thirds of US-bound Chinese exports have undergone
entrepot trade in the Hong Kong region. The value added at Hong
Kong has been far greater than that in China's mainland, hence
Hong Kong has benefited far more than the mainland from the
processing trade. If that part of the added value is counted as
Hong Kong exports, China's trade surplus against the United States
will drop accordingly, or even turn into deficit.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Sino-US Trade Balance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
white paper, titled "On the Issue of the Sino-US Trade Balance,"
released by the Information Office of the State Council here today:
</P>
<P>
 Developing Sino-US economic and trade relations serves the
fundamental interests of both peoples. Following the establishment
of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China
and the United States, bilateral economic and trade ties have
grown fast, featuring complement and mutual benefit. Occasionally,
however, frictions and differences took place. At present, the
issue of bilateral trade balance -- much too stressed and even
exaggerated by the United States -- has hindered the healthy
development of economic and trade relations between the two
countries. It has also caused concerns among relevant countries
and regions. In our bid to develop Sino-US relations and promote
bilateral trade, we think it necessary to make clear the position
and viewpoints of the Chinese Government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
I.Soaring Trade Between China and the United States
</P>
<P>
In January 1979, the People's Republic of China and the United
States established formal diplomatic relations. Six months later,
the governments of the two countries signed the ``Agreement on
Trade Relations Between the People's Republic of China and the
United States of America'' granting each other the
most-favoured-nation trading status. Since then, Sino-US trade and
economic relations entered a period of fast growth. According to
Chinese statistics, Sino-US trade volume was 2.45 billion US
dollars in 1979 but rocketed to 42.84 billion US dollars in 1996,
with an accumulative volume of 260.6 billion US dollars over the
past 18 years. The United States became China's third largest
trade partner in 1979, and rose to the second place in
1996. According to US statistics, bilateral trade was 2.37 billion
US dollars in 1979 and topped 63.5 billion US dollars in 1996,
totalling 376 billion US dollars in the past 18 years. Among trade
partners of the United States, China ranked the 24th in 1980 and
claimed the fifth place in 1995. Despite statistical
discrepancies, trade figures of the two sides both suggested an
average annual bilateral trade growth rate of more than 18% over
the last 18 years. This has been the mainstream in the development
of Sino-US economic and trade relations.

<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Sino-US Trade Balance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese statistics indicate that, in 1996, US products
accounted for 11.6% of China's total imports, while US statistics
show 5.42% of its imports last year came from China. The United
States is one of the fastest growing markets for Chinese exports
while China is also one of the fastest growing markets for US
exports. Both countries' statistics suggest that between 1990 and
1996, US exports to China grew by more than 16% a year on average,
far exceeding the overall US export growth in the period. China is
one of its trade partners with which the United States scored the
highest export growth. This is mainly attributable to the marked
differences in the two countries' resources, economic structures,
industrial setup and consumption levels, and to the fact that
their economies can be complementary to each other. China is a
developing country with low labour costs, but suffers from capital
constraint and relatively under-developed scientific and
technological development. The United States is a developed
country with abundant capital and highly advanced technologies,
but suffers from high labour costs. China mainly sells to the
United States labour-intensive products such as textiles,
garments, shoes, toys, electric home appliances and luggage. The
United States mainly sells to China capital- and
technology-intensive products such as aircraft, power generation
equipment, machinery, electronics, telecommunications equipment
and chemical machinery, as well as agricultural products including
grain and cotton. So complementary and mutually beneficial is the
structure of their exchanges of goods that it has greatly pushed
the development of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The sustained growth of Sino-US trade has played an active part
in the economic development and creation of jobs in the two
countries. For the United States, its direct exports to China
alone have created 300,000 jobs while bilateral trade development
has created at least 1 million jobs for the US industry and
service sectors, and such a trend is marked by a continuous growth
from year to year. China's relatively low labour costs have cut
the prices of daily necessities such as shoes, garments and toys
on the US market, and have helped easing inflation in the United
States, bringing practical benefits to US consumers. A 1994 World
Bank report noted that US consumers would have had to spend an
extra 14 billion US dollars per year if the United States had had
to import similar products from other countries instead of
China. For China, millions of workers are involved in the
processing and assembling business for exports to the United
States. This has promoted the economic development of China's
coastal areas. China's imports of some relatively advanced
technological products from the United States also help its
modernization.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Wins Gold in Men's Event at Figure Skating Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, March 20 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Canadian
skater Elvis Stojko, the gold medalist in the Men's competition
said here today that he won the championship through a tough
competition and by his confidence.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the end of the Men's competition,
Stojko said that the gold medal is a present for his birthday when
he turns 25 on March 22. "I'm happy and excited about the whole
thing. It's a tough competition and we're all in the same boat. I
have confidence and a set plan. I'm going out with all I've got
and push myself to my limits and challenge myself."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the last-minute withdrawal from the free
program by Russia's Alexei Urmanov, Stojko said, "I didn't know
Alexei had pulled out. I didn't realise his injury was so
severe. I went out thinking everyone was going to put everything
in. It doesn't matter who is there competing. Anything can
happen. Even if I skate clean I have no control over the rest."
</P>
<P>
Talking about his own setbacks, Stojko, of Slovenian origin,
said, "I've pulled myself up from the rough short program I skated
in Edmonton last year, to come back from that, all the doubts and
the negative comments. I'm glad to come back and push all that
aside and focus on what I have to do."
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Todd Eldredge from the United
States, the silver medalist, said, "Elvis obviously skated great
and so I can't argue with it. Of course, I'm disappointed I didn't
win but I'm not disappointed with my performance."
</P>
<P>
Eldredge, 25 years old, hoped to compete against Stojko in the
1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. "I'll give Elvis a run
for his money!" he said.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Yagudin from Russia, the 17-year-old bronze medalist,
said, "Yesterday I was dreaming of being 5th or 6th. My skating
was a big present for me as my birthday was two days ago."
</P>
<P>
On Urmanov's pullout, Yagudin said, "Yesterday, when Urmanov
did his program, he was sore; this morning he said maybe he
wouldn't skate tonight. He's still the leader of the Russian
team."
</P>
<P>
23-year-old Urmanov was the first after the short program
yesterday. He withdrew from the free program competition because
of a groin injury.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Vows no Bowing to Spanish Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina today accused as "arrogant, false and meddling" a
statement by the Spanish foreign minister about a Spanish tourist
involved in a traffic accident in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"In the worst style of Yankee overbearing, but now with a
Spanish touch, (Spanish Foreign Minister Alberto) Matutes said he
was studying to recommend Spaniards not to travel to Cuba,"
Robaina told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Matutes threatened to warn Spaniards to stay away
from Cuba, a popular holiday destination, and to mobilize all the
European Union members to demand the release of a tourist who,
Robaina said, was actually in liberty.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, Spanish tourist Jesus Martin rammed and upturned a
motorcycle of a young woman, who suffered serious damage to
her spine, said Robaina.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Martin was once at a police unit to make a
statement, and was now waiting the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
While Matutes said the tourist was jailed and was still in
custody, the Spanish consul in Havana said Martin was held for
only one night but was prevented by police from leaving Cuba
pending trial.
</P>
<P>
Robaina dismissed the idea that Martin's case had anything to
do with an exchange for a young Cuban man arrested
in Spain for allegedly possessing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"For more than four decades, Cuba has demonstrated that it does
not bend to any pressure or blackmail. If it has not given up
before the biggest power of the world, much less will it do before
the candidates to haughtiness," he said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Ex-president Launches New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's former president
Carlos Andres Perez today launched a new political party and vowed
to lead the country to a political renewal.
</P>
<P>
The party, known as the "Opening and National Participation
Movement," would break the current political structure and obtain
"a free Venezuela for Venezuelans," said Perez.
</P>
<P>
Perez was elected Venezuelan president in 1988 for a five-year
term as the Democratic Action (DA) candidate, but was ousted in
1993 on charges of embezzling 17 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
His new party, explained the former president, would be of
"coordination, without president or general secretary," and would
probably participate in the general elections next year.
</P>
<P>
"I want to present an electoral agenda that means the real
start of a rescue of the Venezuelan state toward the road to
modernization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the launching of the new party, Perez still considered
himself a DA leader, saying that his forced exclusion from the
party ranks did not follow the procedures in the DA statutes.
</P>
<P>
On an earlier occasion, he said the new party, mainly backed by
former ministers of his cabinet and former DA leaders, would be
financed through "known" and "unknown" contributions, dismissing
those from economic groups that wanted to impose their control.
</P>
<P>
Perez was put under house arrest in 1993, and then spent more
than two years at his residence in Caracas until September 1996.

building and the ruling party's headquarters in this capital.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, many from the economically hard-bitten
Gdansk city and the Silesia mining region, stormed the office
building of the Democratic Left Alliance with pots of red paint.
</P>
<P>
They then threw Molotov cocktails at the nameplate of the
party, a partner in the coalition government, over the entrance to
the building, leaving it in flames.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration started just hours after Prime Minister
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz held out the hope that 2,000 of the 3,700
jobs being shed at the state-owned shipyards could be saved.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz suggested to the Sejm, the house of
representatives, that the more successful Szczecin shipyard in the
northwest could create a new company that would use part of the
Gdansk shipyard to complete an order from the Polish defense
contractor Polska Zegluga Morska.
</P>
<P>
Solidarity Union spokesman Piotr Zak said on Wednesday that
they would listen carefully to Cimoszewicz before today's protest
started.
</P>
<P>
"If Cimoszewicz says anything we consider untrue, we will also
be protesting," said Zak.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, militants from Solidarity clashed with police who
forcibly evicted them from the treasury ministry they had occupied
in protest at the closing down of the Gdansk shipyard.
</P>
<P>
The union accused the government of being motivated by
political spite in letting the yard to go under.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz said the government cannot waste more taxpayers'
money or press banks to bail out the the Gdansk shipyard, which
was in debts of around 154 million U.S. dollars when it was
declared bankrupt in August.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to parliament earlier, Cimoszewicz accused
leaders of the shipyard of endorsing "irresponsible contracts
that each led to losses ranging from 1 to 7 million dollars."
</P>
<P>
Observers said the conflict over the shipyard has taken on a
political dimension with legislative elections due around
September this year.
</P>
<P>
They held that the Solidarity has seized on the issue to launch
protests against wider government industry policy and to mobilize
its supporters before the polls.

<HEADLINE> Museum To Conserve and Display Bamboo, Wooden Slips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A museum, endowed with 35
million yuan, will be built in central China's Hunan province to
conserve and display 170,000 bamboo and wooden slips unearthed
from a 1,700-year-old well last year.
</P>
<P>
The slips, bearing 200,000 characters, are detailed records of
the political, economic, military, cultural, and geographic
situation of Changsha prefecture under the Wu State (222-280)
during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
The well, three meters in diameter, was actually a cellar which
served as an archive of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the slips are one of the most
significant archaeological finds in China this century.
</P>
<P>
The museum, covering an area of 10,000 sq m, will consist of
three parts, a conservation center to store and treat the slips by
a special process, a research center to input the information on
the slips into a computer for further study, and an exhibition
hall to display some of the slips, their historical background and
the excavation of the slips.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Demands Release of Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) today condemned the arrest of four top BNP
leaders and demanded their immediate unconditional release.
</P>
<P>
BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia said in a statement that the
arrests were made as the government got frightened by the planned
strike on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Four BNP leaders were arrested on Thursday and placed under
30-day detention a day after the party called a nationwide strike
against the government, the first such program since the Awami
(People's) League took power last June.
</P>
<P>
The arrest triggered a violent street protest during which at
least 15 vehicles were damaged and eleven people were picked up.
</P>
<P>
The arrested leaders, including two members of parliament, are
Dr. Khandaker Hossain, Abdul Mannan, Mirza Abbas and Goyeswar
Chandra Roy. All the four were ministers in the previous BNP
government.
</P>
<P>
A press release from Dhaka Metropolitan Police Thursday night
acknowledged the arrest of the four BNP leaders under the
controversial Special Powers Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
"The arrested have been given one month's detention to restrain
them from activities affecting law and order and other harmful
acts," the release added.

LANZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu province, will host a trade fair from August 18 to
24 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Lanzhou has succeeded in hosting four trade fairs,
which have become northwest China's windows on the outside
world. To extend the influence and attract more overseas
investment, approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, the provincial government and Lanzhou city will
co-sponsor the 1997 Lanzhou trade fair, which will be the largest
of its kind.
</P>
<P>
An official of the organizing committee says that, this trade
fair will focus on trade talks, inviting overseas investment,
commodity exhibition and technology exchange. The committee will
also hold an exhibition presenting achievements of Gansu's
economic and social development since 1949.
</P>
<P>
As the hometown of Dunhuang art, Gansu will also feature
activities like travelling and cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 13 regions and counties in Gansu, the organizing
committee has invited overseas investors and companies from other
provinces. The two exhibition halls will provide 1,800 exhibition
stalls for the investors.
</P>
<P>
Cui Zhenghua, deputy governor of Gansu, says that, the 1997
Lanzhou trade fair is an important activity for presenting Gansu
to the outside world. In August, Lanzhou will welcome guest
businessmen to its abundant natural resources, stable investment
environment, and promising projects.

<HEADLINE> Italy Rules Out Unilateral Intervention in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta today denied Italy was planning military intervention in
neighbouring Albania to help restore order in the crisis-hit
country.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with Albanian Foreign Minister Arian Starova,
Andreatta quashed growing speculation that Italy would act
unilaterally to send in troops and said any action would be taken
within a European framework.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said, "At this time, no Italian intervention -- let
alone unilateral Italian intervention -- is in any way planned."
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides agreed that economic, humanitarian and
military aid to the Balkan country would take place through the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
But Italy has agreed to reactivate agreements between its navy
and Albania to allow Italian ships to patrol Albanian territorial
waters to control the chaotic exodus of boats from Albania.
</P>
<P>
Starova also asked for humanitarian aid from Italy, but
confirmed that at present there are no serious food shortages
apart from in isolated areas in the south which has seen most of
the violence and unrest that has gripped the country over the last
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The European Union last Sunday turned down a request from
Albania for military intervention, but sent an assessment team to
the country to report on how the bloc could help restore order to
the country. They have also agreed to send military and police
advisers to the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand has called for cooperation from all political
parties and the ordinary people in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by the state-run Radio Nepal Thursday
evening, Chand said that his coalition government, which came to
office last week, will create an atmosphere where every individual
can find right opportunities and realize potentials for his own
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nepal faces problems like the increasing number of
people living in poverty and the worsening employment situation,
the prime minister said the government's prime concern is how to
relieve the country of hunger, disease and poverty.
</P>
<P>
While stating that the country's future hinges on the planned
development of manpower and water resources, Chand stressed the
importance of political stability, which he said the newly formed
three-party government will help ensure.
</P>
<P>
The new government will take effective measures to bring the
rampant corruption, financial irregularities and smuggling under
control, he said, adding that administrative expenditure and
facilities for ministers will be cut down under the principle of
austerity.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the government will encourage the private
sector to play a role in areas like industry, tourism, commerce
and communications.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chand concluded that the country lacks
cooperation, understanding and honest effort for development, and
he appealed to all of the nation to cooperate with his government
in its pursuit of the nation's interests and prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Armenia Appoints Breakaway Karabakh Leader New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Armenian President Levon
Ter-Petrosyan on Thursday appointed Robert Kocharyan, leader of
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, as new prime minister,
according to reports from Armenian capital Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Armen Sarkisyan resigned on March 7 for health
reasons after just four months in the job, Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The move has angered neighboring Azerbaijan which has been
engaged in a bitter conflict with Armenia over the mountainous
territory since 1988, although rivalry between the two South
Caucusus republics over the territory stretches back decades.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh, populated mainly by ethnic Armenians, lies
inside Azerbaijan but separatist troops have fought Azeri forces
and driven them out of the enclave.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh declared itself an independent republic in
1991 and Kocharyan, 42, was elected its president in December
1994, although the election was declared illegal by Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet
republics, was agreed in 1994, ending the six-year inter-ethnic
fighting which left an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
But peace talks have stalled, with both parties refusing to
compromise despite international mediation.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan described Kocharyan's appointment as a
"provocation," the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"If Robert Kocharyan has been appointed prime minister as the
leader of the Armenian community of the Nogorno-Karabakh region of
Azerbaijan, this cannot be viewed as anything other than a
provocation, not just to Azerbaijan but also to the norms of
international law," Azeri Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov was
quoted by the AP as saying in Azeri capital Baku.

<HEADLINE> Local Government Elections Held in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Under tight security strengthened
by police and army troops, Sri Lanka's local government elections
are being held throughout the country except in the north and east
due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Polling started at 7:00 a.m. (local time) today at 8,248
polling stations to elect 238 local bodies.
</P>
<P>
The elections are regarded as a test for the People's Alliance
(PA) government which assumed office in 1994. Twelve political
parties and 136 independent groups are contesting the elections,
but the main battle is between the ruling PA and the main
opposition United National Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
The PA's main plank during the election campaign has been
allegations of 17 years of misrule by the previous UNP government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, on the other hand, is using its campaign to
highlight a string of broken promises by the PA government to
bring relief to the poor, to bring down the cost of living, to
ensure media freedom and to abolish the executive presidency.
</P>
<P>
Since early last month when nominations for the elections were
handed in, incidents of election-related violence, including
murder, shooting, assault and arson, have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The most serious one occurred on February 11 when government
parliamentarian Nalanda Ellawala was killed in a clash between
government supporters and their opposition rivals.
</P>
<P>
From February 5 to March 19, there have been a total of 1,840
complaints of election-related violence from the seven provinces
where the local elections are being held.
</P>
<P>
The PA has made 751 complaints while the UNP has reported 818
 incidents. Complaints were also made by other political parties.
</P>
<P>
To ensure peace on election day, the government has adopted
many security measures. Over 30,000 policemen have taken up
positions to ensure that today's elections are not marred by
violence.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga appealed to all citizens to
help the government conduct today's local elections peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever political party you might belong to it is the sacred
mission of all of us to ensure peace and the rule of law and to
create for ourselves and our children a civilized society," she
said in a message to the nation last night.
</P>
<P>
A police officer said that the Inspector General of Police has
given strict instructions to all his men to take into custody
anyone who tries to disrupt the election process or those
attempting to sabotage the vote by provoking voters.
</P>
<P>
Every police station has a riot squad at its command, said the
officer, adding that in major towns like Colombo and Kandy riot
squad manpower is greater, compared to those in remote towns.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government will
provide emergency relief aid worth a total of 360,000 U.S. dollars
to victims of the turmoils in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Canada's relief effort in Albania is in response to an appeal
by the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), said a news release from the government.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 adults and children in hospitals and
orphanages around the tiny Balkan nation will receive food and
medical assistance from Canada.
</P>
<P>
The emergency relief effort is amid a crisis brought on by
widespread individual financial losses prompted by the collapse of
nationwide fraudulent pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there has been a general breakdown of law and order
in Albania, with cities in the south under the control of rebel
groups.

<HEADLINE> More Japanese Veterans Included in U.S. "Watch List" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
today put a second group of Japanese army veterans on the "watch
list" and bar them from entering the country for their suspected
medical experimentation during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The department's spokesman John Russell said "more than 16, but
less than 20" Japanese veterans had been placed on the "watch
list" for their roles in Unit 731 of the war-time Japanese army or
other medical experimentation cases.
</P>
<P>
Russell declined to identify the Japanese veterans or provide
the exact number, but another Justice Department official said the
second group included 17 men.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the department took its first action against
Japanese veterans suspected of medically experimenting on
prisoners or operating forced sex camps during World War II.
Sixteen Japanese veterans were put on the "watch list."
</P>
<P>
The "watch list" was originally established in 1979 to keep out
people who were engaged in persecution on behalf of Nazi Germany
or its allies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Makes Quads at Figure Skating Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese skater Guo
Zhengxin did two quads in the men's free program Thursday night,
the first ever in the history of the world figure skating, his
coach Liu Hongyun told Xinhua after the competition at the World
Figure Skating Championships in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Guo did one quadruple toeloop and one quadruple toeloop/double
toeloop. "He is the first skater who have ever succeeded in doing
two quads in any competition in the world," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Despite his historical quads, Guo finished 19th in the men's
competition after placing 22nd in the short program on Wednesday
and 15th in the free program Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Guo is now among the 24 skaters who have qualified for the 1998
Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Olympics, Liu said he would help Guo
strengthen endurance and physical power, in which the Chinese
skater is now somewhat weaker than his opponents.
</P>
<P>
Guo's success has been confirmed by the Figure Skating
Technical Committee of the International Skating Union (ISU) after
the end of the men's free program, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
ISU has announced only three skaters made successful quadruple
jumps in the free program. Elvis Stojko from Canada, the
gold-medal winner, also did one quadruple toeloop/triple toeloop.
The third skater succeeding in the quadruple toeloop is Konstantin
Kostin from Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Airport at Albanian Capital Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Albania reopened today the Rinas
International Airport here after nearly a week of suspension amid
armed unrest throughout the tiny Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
However, only an Albanian Airlines plane carrying 30 passengers
took off for the Bulgarian capital of Sofia from the facility,
which serves as the country's main gateway to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled flights from this Albanian capital to other countries
will be resumed on Friday, Kapllan Xhabzholli, an official in
charge of the security of the airport, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the reopening of the airport, now patrolled by
security forces and guarded by armored vehicles, will help the
shipping of foreign assistance into Albania.
</P>
<P>
The country's main seaport of Durres will also be reopened
within days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The airport and seaport were shut down by the authorities on
March 14 as popular protests over the collapse of so-called
pyramid investment schemes turned violent.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Sali Berisha was blamed for
allowing the shady schemes to deprive thousands of families
especially in the more prosperous south of their life savings.
</P>
<P>
A leader of the anti-government insurgents said today that a
50-man commando had been sent to Tirana to "kill" Berisha if he
refused to step down, AFP quoted an Albanian journalist as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, political leaders who are now part of the all-party
government taking the country up to elections by June have come
out against using force to remove Berisha, saying the democratic
process will have the say.

<P>
HAVANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today blasted Nicaragua for
including an exiled Cuban in the Nicaraguan delegation to a
meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba will give the right answer to this maneuver at a proper
moment, in a proper place, and in a proper way," Foreign Relations
Ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government has appointed Luis Zuniga, from
Miami, of the United States, to the Nicaraguan delegation that
will attend the U.N. Human Rights forum.
</P>
<P>
Describing Zuniga as "a two-bit member of the Miami Cuban
counterrevolution," Ferriol said the exiled Cuban was "an admitted
terrorist, chosen from among the gangster fauna of Miami."
</P>
<P>
"Until now it has been the U.S. government as the one
which is accustomed to this kind of show, ... with the only
purpose of attacking us," the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Ferriol alleged that the United States in the similar conducts
has "appointed poets who have never made a verse, disabled people
who are actually not, cosmonauts and singers."
</P>
<P>
Now, as an assignment, the Nicaraguan government has been
ordered to include Zuniga in its delegation, representing the
Cuban counter revolutionaries, she said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Treasury Reserves Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's treasury reserves
dropped by 63 billion baht (2.5 billion US dollars) in the first
five months of fiscal 1997 starting October 1996 as expenses
outstripped revenue, Thai Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of fiscal 1996, treasury reserves after allowing for
all obligations stood at 127 billion baht (5.08 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the economic slowdown has caused revenue to fall below
target while expenses have grown, forcing the Thai government to
tap treasury reserves to cover the cash deficit, Amnuay was quoted
today by the local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, treasury reserves for the first five months of
fiscal 1997 stood at 64 billion baht (2.56 billion us dollars).
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the first five months of fiscal 1997 totaled 305.02
billion baht (12.2 billion US dollars). Expenditure during the
first five months totaled 364 billion baht (14.5 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of fiscal 1997, the Thai government ran a
budget deficit of 53.76 billion baht (2.15 billion US dollars).
For the second quarter, a deficit of 16.7 billion baht (668
million US dollars) is expected.
</P>
<P>
But Amnuay maintained that revenue in the second half of fiscal
1997 should increase.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Finance Ministry is predicting a budget surplus of
57.2 billion baht (2.28 billion US dollars) for the third quarter
and 15.3 billion baht (608 million US dollars) for the fourth
quarter. If targets are met, the fiscal 1997 budget would run a
surplus of 2.03 billion baht (81 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Fast Growth of Sino-US Trade Benefit to Both Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The sustained growth of Sino-US
trade, which is the mainstream of the the bilateral trade ties,
has played a positive part in the economic development and
creation of jobs in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in a white paper on Sino-US trade
balance, which was released by the Information Office of the State
Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that despite statistical discrepancies,
trade figures of the two sides both suggested the rapid
development of the Sino-US trade since 1979, when the two
countries established diplomatic relations, signed the ``Agreement
on Trade Relations Between the People's Republic of China and the
United States of America'' and granted each other the
most-favored-nation trading status.
</P>
<P>
The past 18 years since then have witnessed an average annual
bilateral trade growth rate of more than 18 percent, the document
added.
</P>
<P>
The white paper indicated that such rapid advancement of the
bilateral trade was mainly attributable to the marked differences
in the two countries' resources, economic structures, industrial
setup and consumption levels, and to the fact that their economies
can be complementary to each other.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trade exchanges, it said, US investment in China has
also witnessed extensive development. By the end of 1996, 22,240
projects with US investment had been launched in China with a
committed investment volume of 35.17 billion US dollars. Paid-up
investment in those projects totalled 14.29 billion US
dollars. Excluding the regions of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the United
States is the second largest investor in China, next only to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The sustained growth of Sino-US trade has played an active
part in the economic development and creation of jobs in the two
countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the document continued, its direct
exports to China alone have created 300,000 jobs while bilateral
trade development has created at least one million jobs for the US
industry and service sectors, and such a trend is marked by a
continuous growth from year to year.
</P>
<P>
China's relatively low labour costs have cut the prices of
daily necessities such as shoes, garments and toys on the US
market, and have helped easing inflation in the United States,
bringing practical benefits to US consumers, the white papaer
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that a 1994 World Bank report noted that US consumers
would have had to spend an extra 14 billion US dollars per year if
the United States had had to import similar products from other
countries instead of China.
</P>
<P>
For China, the document noted, millions of workers are involved
in the processing and assembling business for exports to the
United States. This has promoted the economic development of
China's coastal areas. China's imports of some relatively advanced
technological products from the United States also help its
modernization.
</P>
<P>
The domination of entrepot and processing trade in the
bilateral trade has promoted the fast growth of Sino-US trade
volume, but, at the same time, resulted in a relatively large
deviation between the statistics and reality of trade figures of
the two countries, the white paper said.

<HEADLINE> US Exaggerates Trade Deficit with China, Says White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The analysis of statistics has
shown that the size of the US trade deficit with China has been
largely exaggerated by the US side, according to a Chinese
government document released here today.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is far from being sufficient to evaluate the two
nations' trade balance situation only on the basis of the trade
statistics of the US side," said the white paper on Sino-US trade
balance, which was released by the Information Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The white paper noted that the so-called enormous trade deficit
against China under the US statistics in recent years is
attributable to a variety of factors, including flaws in
statistical techniques and methods as well as the US policies
toward China.
</P>
<P>
"It should not shift the blame upon other countries," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the US side indicate that Sino-US trade had
been in favour of the US side during the 1979-1982 period, but the
United States started suffering from deficit in 1983 and the figure
amounted to 39.5 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chinese statistics, however, indicate that China had suffered
from deficit in the bilateral trade during the 14 years between
1979 and 1992. Surplus first appeared in 1993 and the figure rose
to 10.5 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The document quoted a report released in 1994 by a Sino-US
bilateral trade statistics expert group as saying that the US
import statistics has ignored entrepot trade and value added from
entrepot trade to over-estimate its imports from China, and the US
statistics of its exports to China has been under-estimated by
neglecting re-exports.
</P>
<P>
The group was set up under the Sino-US Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade for diagnosing the large difference in the
bilateral trade statistics by China and the United States and the
large US trade deficit against China under US statistics.
</P>
<P>
According to analyses of the group, the white paper said, the
US method in determining the origin of goods also leads to the
discrepancies in the statistics of the two sides, and the United
States has under-estimated its export value to China because of
its incomplete export statistics.
</P>
<P>
On December 5, 1996, officials with the Census Bureau of the US
Department of Commerce pointed out that at least 10 percent of US
exports might have been overlooked in statistics because exports,
unlike imports, are not taxed and do not bring the government any
direct revenue.
</P>
<P>
Since the trade statistics expert group was only in charge of
investigating and analyzing the difference between the trade
statistics published by China and the United States, the trade
statistics methods adopted by the two sides have not been
correspondingly adjusted, and the US side's over-estimation of its
trade deficit against China has not since changed substantially,
the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
It was calculated that the 1996 US trade deficit against China,
as published by the US side, was over-estimated by an amount of
some 16 billion US dollars, the document noted.

<HEADLINE> Statistics on Origin Cannot Reflect Real Sino-US Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China said here today that
irrationalities in the trade statistical principle of origin of
goods made the US side seriously exaggerate its trade deficit
against China and distorted Sino-US trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of internationally unified rules of origin,
countries formulate rules of origin according to their own needs,
resulting in different criteria, leaving room for discretion,
according to a white paper on Sino-US trade balance released by
the Information Office of the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, both China and the United States calculate their
external trade according to the principle of origin of goods.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that propelled by fast-growing economic
and trade co-operation among countries in the world today and
increasing cross-border investment, goods exchanged through
international trade are no longer products made by one country,
but ``world products'' whose manufacture involves efforts from
several countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is obviously difficult for the current rules of origin, as
employed by trade statistics, to accurately reflect the main
changes in world economic development," the white paper said,
"These rules could even result in a distorted picture of the trade
balance situation."
</P>
<P>
Processing trade that has boomed in some countries and regions
over the last two to three decades had the problem further
complicated, the document said, adding that processing trade
expansion is a major factor behind China's export growth in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
China's processing trade has developed since the mid-1980s
when investors from developed countries including the United
States and Japan as well as Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and
the Hong Kong and Taiwan regions started to move their
labour-intensive industries or production procedures to China in a
bid to cut production costs and enhance their international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Dependent on overseas investors' original marketing channels,
processing trade products are primarily sold to their traditional
markets including the United States via entrepot trade through
Hong Kong, and to calculate them according to certain rules of
origin, China -- instead of the investors' home countries or
regions and exporters of materials and auxiliary parts -- became
the exporter, the document said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the document said, more than two-thirds of
US-bound Chinese exports have undergone entrepot trade in the Hong
Kong region. The value added at Hong Kong has been far greater
than that in China's mainland, hence Hong Kong has benefited far
more than the mainland from the processing trade.
</P>
<P>
"If that part of the added value is counted as Hong Kong's
exports, China's trade surplus against the United States will drop
accordingly, or even turn into deficit," the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The document concluded that while applying the origin-based
statistics, it is imperative to be fully aware of the method's
limitations and discern from the figures the actual benefits of
all trading partners after careful analysis.
</P>
<P>
"That is the only way conducive to removing misunderstanding
and properly settling bilateral trade disputes," it said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper also said that it is a must to note the trend
of increasingly closer international economic links and
ever-growing cross-border investment and service trade that are
growing by the day, and on that ground, improve and perfect the
computing of trade figures so that statistics will comply with
reality and better serve the mutually beneficial co-operation
among countries in the world, and sound economic and trade
development across the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Give Up Claim on Marcos' Swiss Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
give up its claim to the 450 million US dollars in Swiss deposits
of the late former president Ferdinand Marcos in favor of the
10,000 victims during the martial law era, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Silvestre Bello, member of the government
panel holding peace talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF)
in the Netherlands, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview
that the government was "inclined to withdraw its claim to the
Swiss deposits."
</P>
<P>
He said the government "will conclude tonight an agreement for
the indemnification of the victims" under the Marcos regime as "an
addendum to the joint agreement on security and immunity guarantee
forged between the government and the NDF."
</P>
<P>
The more than 10,000 victims had earlier won a damage suit
before the Honolulu District Court in the United States against
the Marcoses for alleged abuses committed on them during the 20
years of Marcos' rule.
</P>
<P>
With the decision, the district court ordered a freeze on all
deposits of the Marcoses in various Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine government, opposing the victims' claim,
said the Marcos estate must first pay its taxes to the government

<HEADLINE> US Export Control against China: Major Trade Balance Obstacle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China said here today that the US
discriminatory export control policies towards China have hindered
US exports to China and therefore have become a major obstacle for
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government hopes the US Government will,
proceeding from the long-term interest of bilateral trade and
economic co-operation, adopt effective measures to relax or even
cancel the current discriminatory export control policies against
China so as to usher in a healthy and balanced Sino-US trade
relationship," said a white paper on Sino-US trade balance,
released by the Information Office of the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a realistic way of resolving the trade balance issue
between China and the United States," it continued.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that Sino-US trade relations witnessed
certain progress in the 1980s when the United States relaxed
export control over China. But, since the beginning of the 1990s,
the United States has instituted a series of new sanctions against
China, many of which involve export control.
</P>
<P>
"This change has led to severe consequences and gradually an
unfavourable reverse of trade balance for the United States," the
document noted, adding " it is hard to say that such a change --
indeed a double-edged sword -- is wise."
</P>
<P>
The US export control policies and lingering sanctions against
China have greatly restricted US exports to China as well as US
investment in high-tech sectors on the territory of the latter,
the white paper continued.
</P>
<P>
The document cited the US export control policies as reason of
failure of negotiation between China and US Westinghouse and
General Electric companies over purchase of equipment for China's
Qinshan Nuclear power Plant (300,000 kilowatts) and the Daya Bay
Nuclear Power Plant (900,000 kilowatts).
</P>
<P>
As a result, US nuclear power enterprises, with enormous
interests, have lost their chance of export to China because of
the US Government control over nuclear energy technology.
</P>
<P>
Such a policy of the US has also ripped US businesses of
potential business opportunities worth several billion US dollars
when China planned to import technologies and equipment for
integrated circuits and programme-controlled telephone
switchboards, according to the white paper.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has lost an average of several billion
dollars of exports each year to China in the recent past due to
such discriminatory policies," the document said. "It makes no
sense for the United States to play up trade deficit against China
on the one hand, and continue its export control on the other."

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Trade Enjoys Broad Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The broad prospects of economic
and trade cooperation between China and the United States lie in
"sustainable and balanced" growth of bilateral trade, according to
a white paper.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, titled "On Sino-US Trade Balance," released by
the Information Office of China's State Council here today, said
the Chinese side has always paid great attention to the growth of
the bilateral trade and taken effective measures to increase
imports from the US.
</P>
<P>
The white paper described China's market as "open to US goods
and services," which was demonstrated by the large amount of US
products China has purchased and the continuous expansion of US
investment in China over the past years.
</P>
<P>
"All these have brought US enterprises huge profits." the white
paper said.
</P>
<P>
In commodity trade, according to the paper, China bought 69.476
million tons, or 11.62 billion US dollars worth, of wheat from the
US between 1979 and 1996. China now is the largest buyer of US
wheat.
</P>
<P>
During that period, China also purchased 46.243 million tons,
or 9.56 billion US dollars worth, of chemical fertilizers and 308
aircrafts worth 8.72 billion US dollars from the US.
</P>
<P>
In regards to US investment in China, over 100 of the top-500
US enterprises listed by the "Fortune" magazine have so far
invested in various fields in China.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted the business of US enterprises has been
building up in banking and insurance, shipping services, and
retailing as well.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding Between
the Government of the People's Republic of China and the
Government of the United States of America Concerning Market
Access in October 1992, China abolished import control over apples
from the Washington State and wheat from California.
</P>
<P>
China also signed with the US new quarantine protocols on such
imports as pigs, horses, dogs and genetic materials.
</P>
<P>
In April 1994, the two countries reached an agreement on
hygiene quarantine provisions on cherry imports from the
Washington State and imports of relevant species of apples grown
in Idaho and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts, the white paper said, have contributed a
great deal to the development of Sino-US economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
After examining the prospects of the Chinese market in the
coming five years, the paper pointed out, "China's economic growth
will offer a vast market for world trade and investment."
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the white paper,
China's imports increased to 138.8 billion US dollars in 1996 from
10.9 billion US dollars in 1978. Its cumulative imports from 1997
to 2000 will topped 700 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The white paper also listed China major steps in cutting
tariffs, phasing out non-tariff measures, realizing the free
convertibility of the Chinese currency Renminbi under the current
account and opening the market of service sectors to foreign
investors, which have been helped to improve China's economic
regime involving foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
Take tariffs for example, according to the paper, a massive cut
in the import tariffs of more than 4,000 tariff lines was
introduced in April 1996, bringing average tariff from 35.3
percent down to 23 percent. China has also pledged to further
lower its overall tariff rate to 15 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said by the year 2000, China will have
initially established a socialist market economic structure and
built up a unified and standard economic regime involving foreign
interests.
</P>
<P>
These achievements, the paper stressed, will "create better
conditions for the world's business communities including those
from the United States to develop economic and trade co-operation
with China.

<HEADLINE> China to Issue New Standards of Health Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China is to issue new state
standards for the production, marketing and administration of
health food from May 1, aiming to guide the fast-growing industry
in a sound direction.
</P>
<P>
The standards define the concept of health food, product
classification, general principles, technical requirements and
requirements on tags, said a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The standards were drafted last year by the National Technical
Committee of Standardization for the Health Food Industry and were
approved by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision last month.
</P>
<P>
They classify health food products into 13 categories according
to their effect on influencing human functions, while stressing
that health food is a special food not developed to cure diseases.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed a rapid growth of health food production in the
1990s, and the number of producers has reached about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
However, "they produced 3,000 different kinds of health food in
accordance with standards set by the enterprises themselves," the
newspaper quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the health foods produce good effects on people's
health, but some have been found fake or inferior, and even
harmful to consumers," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said compulsory state standards will play an important role
in standardizing the health food market, improving supervision and
administration, safeguarding consumer interests and guiding
industry development in a sound direction.

<HEADLINE> NZ Milk Production to Set New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will handle an
extra 200,000 tons of milk in the current season ending June,
bringing total production to a record 1.2 million tons, the Dairy
Board estimates.
</P>
<P>
As a result, in the year to June, New Zealand will supply
nearly 30 percent of the international trade in dairy produce, up
from 22 percent in previous years, a local press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The board expects to be able to sell virtually all the
additional milk this season, in contrast to last season when a
late surge in production left a carry-over stocks which had to be
disposed of by this year's sales.
</P>
<P>
However, the board noted that the huge and unexpected
production increase has meant that much of the extra milk has had
to be sold in the lower-price world commodity market, the report
said.

TIRANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Albania is warning the United
States, Europe and neighboring states to be on the alert for
Albanians trying to enter their countries with forged diplomatic
passports.
</P>
<P>
The government issued the warning after a number of blank
Albanian diplomatic and service passports were stolen by rebels
from a storeroom in the Interior Ministry, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
The passports have been declared invalid and the government is
asking other countries to cooperate by detaining those using them.
</P>
<P>
Albania has also decided to temporarily suspend the issuing of
diplomatic and service passports.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Albanians have fled the country over the past two
weeks to escape the violence and chaos caused by an armed uprising
which has swept the nation over the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The unrest erupted after the collapse of popular pyramid
investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost their life

<HEADLINE> Russia Disappointed at Israel's Building of New Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian foreign ministry spokesman
Vladimir Andreyev said today Russia was disappointed at Israel's
construction of new settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Andreyev warned, at a press briefing, that the move by the
Israeli authorities could lead to a halt of the Middle East peace
talks and the worsening of situation in the entire region.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, the Israeli government approved a proposal of
building about 6,500 residences for a new Jewish settlement in Har
Homa of East Jerusalem, which is claimed by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Although the international community had called on it to
reconsider the plan, Israel began implementing the construction
work on March 18 amid a new wave of strong Palestinian protests.
</P>
<P>
Andreyev said that Russia, as one of the initiators of the
Middle East peace process, hoped that all sides concerned would
give up actions that were harmful to other countries.
</P>
<P>
They should try to solve all their disputes through
constructive negotiations in line with the existing peace accords
and the norms of the international law, the spokesman said.

KIEV, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 Israeli companies will
gather in the Ukrainian capital Kiev on April 14 for a three-day
trade exhibition on Israeli telecommunications, agricultural and
medical technology.
</P>
<P>
Hana Kapitolink, managing director of Anzata International, the
Israeli company organizing the exhibition, Israel Only '97, said
70 percent of the exhibitors are entirely new to the Ukrainian
market.
</P>
<P>
She said no exhibitors would come from Israel's military
industrial sectors, though some of them supply parts to larger
companies involved in military production.
</P>
<P>
Two days before the exhibition starts, Nathan Sharanski,
Israel's Ukrainian-born Minister of Trade and Industry, will start
a four-day official visit to Russia. He will attend a meeting of
the Joint Committee on Ukrainian-Israel Trade on April 14.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Israeli Embassy indicated that more
than 100 Israeli joint ventures are now operating in Ukraine. The
total volume of Ukrainian-Israeli trade was 107 million
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Embassy First Secretary Edward Chapira said that about
300,000 Ukrainian immigrants living in Israel should act as a
bridge between the two countries.

<P>
LAUSANNE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Elvis Stojko of Canada, using a
quadruple-triple combination, rallied from fourth place to regain
the men's title at the World Figure Skating Championship here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stojko's task was made easier when Alexei Urmanov of Russia,
who led after Wednesday's short program, withdrew after warming up
due to a groin injury he suffered in practice.
</P>
<P>
Todd Eldredge of the United States, the defending champion,
came in second after faltering on two jumps late in his program.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Yagudin of Russia, 17, finished third.
</P>
<P>
Stojko completed the quad-triple combination and added seven
more triple jumps in a routine that earned him a perfect 6.0 from
one judge.
</P>
<P>
The rest of his marks were either 5.9 or 5.8 as Stojko gained
back the title he won in 1994 and 1995.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Rallies on Greenspan's Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged today
after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly hinted the
central bank will raise interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
In an appearance at the U.S. congress, Greenspan's repeated
references to the need for preventive efforts to thwart
inflationary pressure in the economy were viewed by currency
traders as the most strong evidence that the Fed's policymakers
will increase rates at its meeting on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at its high point of the day in New York at
1.6935 marks and 123.75 yen, up from 1.6816 marks and 122.82 yen
Wednesday. The pound weakened to 1.5881 U.S. dollars from 1.5982
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many traders said they now expect the Fed to raise the federal
funds short-term lending rate next Tuesday by a least a
quarter-percentage point to 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market first saw some sell-off incited by a Commerce
Department report in the morning that showed the U.S. trade
deficit rose 21.1 percent in January to a record 12.7 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4525 Swiss francs, up from 1.4432; 5.7100 French
francs, up from 5.6700; 1,692.00 Italian lire, up from 1,685.00;
1.3788 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3764.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street moved
mostly lower today after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
again hinted a need to raise interest rate as a preemptive measure
to combat inflation.
</P>
<P>
The battered technology sector, however, recovered to some
extent after losing for about 5 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the third straight
session, with a loss of 57.40 points to 6,820.28.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 5-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching
496.86 million shares, down from 535.56 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 3.12 to 782.65, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 1.81 to 411.78.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.97 to 1,259.26, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.24 to 591.55.
</P>
<P>
Bonds initially fell after a morning appearance by Alan
Greenspan at the congress.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
rose as high as 7.02 percent, up from late Wednesday's 6.98
percent. As bonds recovered later, the yield edged down to 6.95
percent.
</P>
<P>
In another example of the economic vigor, the Labor Department
reported that the number of Americans' new claims for unemployment
benefits rose by 3,000 last week to 312,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Seeing central and eastern Europe as
a market of strategic importance, German government and leading
business figures today agreed to further develop economic
relations with countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
After a strategy discussion with leading figures from the
business community today, German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said that politically, economically and technologically
speaking, the central and eastern European countries with a total
population of about 400 million is an important market for
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The trade volume with these countries runs up to about 120
billion German marks (about 71 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, and
could be doubled in a few years," Rexrodt said.
</P>
<P>
Economic involvement in central and eastern European countries
has ensured more than 150,000 jobs for Germany, according to the
account of a German economic institute.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that the new government in Russia will carry on the
reforms," Rexrodt said, adding that German "enterprises and the
federal government should make use of this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The German economics minister also announced today that he will
pay a visit to central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan in the second half of August.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said today that the German economy could still expect a
2.5 percent real growth this year after a disappointing 1.4
percent rise in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The general tendency of economic development in Germany points
to a further upswing," said Rexrodt in a government economic
report published today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, positive factors which would
contribute to a stronger growth include record-low interest rates,
stable prices, favorable dollar-mark exchange rates, growing
industry orders and production, declining labor costs, as well as
a generally dynamic world economy.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Ends Effort to Decertify Mexico in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today approved
a resolution that ends any chance for Congress to reject President
Bill Clinton's approval of Mexico's anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed by a 94-5 vote after the Senate had
held intense negotiations with the Clinton administration. The
measure, as a compromise, attacks both U.S. and Mexican failures
in combating drug smuggling and demands more cooperation while
avoiding harsher steps opposed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requires President Clinton to make another
assessment after five months, but it focuses on joint progress
against drug traffickers without the stigma of formally
decertifying Mexico's efforts.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced on February 28 a certification of
Mexico as fully cooperative with the United States in fighting
illegal drugs, but it triggered the showdown with Congress.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted last week to overturn
Clinton's decision but suspended the step for 90 days to give
Mexico time to make specific reforms. Its action has no effect
unless the Senate goes along.
</P>
<P>
The Senate's decision precluded any move to overturn the
decision to certify.
</P>
<P>
The bill, worked out by senators from both parties in
negotiations, sets up intense monitoring with a new assessment
required from Clinton on September 1.

UNITED NATIONS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. General Assembly (GA)
President Ismail Razali proposed today that the membership of the
Security Council should be increased from 15 to 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, which was distributed among member states
in the form of GA draft resolution, five new permanent members and
four non-permanent members are going to be added to the 15-member
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In introducing the proposal, Ismail said that three out of five
new permanent members of the Security Council shall be elected
from Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean region. And
the other two will be elected from industrialized states.
</P>
<P>
With regards to the four new non-permanent members, Ismail said
all of them will all come from developing countries in Africa,
Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America and Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also touched upon questions of veto powers of
the permanent members of the Security Council. It suggested that
the new permanent members of the Security Council have no
provision of the veto power and that the original permanent
members limit the exercise of their veto power to actions taken
under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter.

</P>
<P>
With regards to the four new non-permanent members, Ismail said
they have to come one each from African states, Asian states,
Eastern European states and Latin American and Caribbean states.
</P>
<P>
"The underpinning of this proposal is based on the need to
enhance the representativeness, the credibility, the legitimacy
and authority of the Security Council," Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the objectives of our exercise is to take steps
that will manifest a qualitative change in all aspects of the
Security Council, so that the council becomes more effective in
exercising its primary role to maintain international peace and
security on behalf of all member states of the UN," he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that according to his proposal, all aspirants are
expected to declare their readiness to assume the responsibilities
of permanent membership to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"No one state will become a new permanent member unless another
four in the pattern I have described also obtain the required
majority of at least two-thirds of votes in the General Assembly,"
he said. "The fate of any one is therefore inextricably linked to
the fate of the others, thus preventing a so-called quick fix."
</P>
<P>
The so-called quick fix is advocated by the United States,
which intends to admit Germany and Japan into the Security Council
as permanent members first and then consider the developing
world's candidacies for the permanent seats.
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, Ismail also touched upon questions of veto
powers of the permanent members of the Security Council.

<HEADLINE> British Steel to Cut Thousands of Jobs in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- British Steel (BS) confirmed today
that it plans "significantly more" than 5,000 job cuts over the
next five years because of the impact of the strong pound and
overseas competition on its finances.
</P>
<P>
The steel giant said that it has to make cuts "as a matter of
urgency" because sales have been hit by the strength of the pound.
</P>
<P>
A BS spokesman blamed the relentless rise of sterling against
the German mark as some 80 percent of BS revenues are related to
the German mark, which has fallen by more than 20 percent against
sterling in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The strong pound is making BS exports more expensive while
allowing foreign competitors to sell more cheaply into the UK
market.
</P>
<P>
But the company is refusing to confirm the exact number of jobs
to go. It will meet trade unions Friday to discuss the
cost-cutting program.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the job cuts, out of a UK workforce of
43,000, will be imposed on management as well as the shopfloor and
will affect several regions with high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Other measures are likely to include sweeping changes to
working practices, a flatter management structure and team working
in plants.
</P>
<P>
The firm has already reduced its workforce considerably, from
nearly 200,000 in the early 1980s to 53,000 worldwide at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Policemen of Bosnia's two
entities have recently cooperated in cracking down an armed
robbery, the UN reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the UN International Police
Task Force, said that on February 20, three masked men in military
uniforms broke into a residence near Bijeljina, which is situated
in the Serb republic, stealing over 100,000 German marks (59,600
U.S. dollars) and critically shooting one family member.
</P>
<P>
Serb police believed that the suspects might have fled to the
Bosnian Federation-controlled town of Tulza and requested, through
the IPTF, assistance from the federation police.
</P>
<P>
The Tuzla police later arrested the suspects and on Tuesday
night handed them and a substantial amount of money to the Serb
side, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an excellent example of cooperation between the police
forces of the two entities, a very high level of professionalism,
and we will hope that this will become more the tradition rather
than just an isolated incident," the UN spokesman said.

<P>
YAOUNDE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Camerounian Premier Peter Mafany
Musonge warned today that the resolutions of Wednesday's Nairobi
summit on the Great Lakes region will be meaningless if the
concerned parties have no will to implement them.
</P>
<P>
However, the discussions at the summit were fruitful, Musonge
said at the Yaounde International Airport after attending the
summit along with leaders from Zimbabwe, Congo, South Africa
and the host country.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi summit was the third in a series of efforts by
African leaders to seek the last solutions to the Zairean
conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit stressed that Zaire's territorial integrity and
boundary should be respected, calling for a corridor in the
region for delivering humanitarian aid to the displaced
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Musonge expressed the hope that African leaders will
continue to look for ways to stop the disintegration and
destruction of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the summit in Nairobi, two other summits were held
respectively on November 5 and December 16 with aims to end the
Zairean conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi led rebels took up arms last October and captured
Kisangany, the third largest city in Zaire recently. They now
have occupied one fifth of the land of the country, vowed to
topple President Sese Seko Mobuto and refuse to cease fire.
