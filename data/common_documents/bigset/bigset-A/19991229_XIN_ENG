JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel released 26
Palestinian prisoners Wednesday as part of an interim agreement and
a goodwill gesture to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
After being freed from prisons near two southwestern Israeli
towns, the Palestinians were transported by buses to military
checkpoints near the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where they were
greeted by family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
The release went ahead after Israel's High Court of Justice
Wednesday rejected a petition filed by the Terror Victims
Association, which opposed the release of prisoners and especially
the inclusion of two Palestinians involved in the killings of an
Israeli taxi-driver and two tourists from Italy.
</P>
<P>
This was the third and the last group of Palestinian prisoners
to be released under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed in
September. Israel has freed 350 Palestinians held for anti-Israel
activities in the first two batches as called upon by the
agreement.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel freed 26 Palestinian
prisoners Wednesday in the long-delayed third release under an
interim agreement signed by the two sides in September
</P>
<P>
The release of third batch of Palestinian prisoners had
originally been set before the start of Muslim holy fasting month
of Ramadan three weeks ago, but was postponed because of a dispute
between the two sides. Israel had released 350 Palestinian
prisoners in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
After being set free from prisons near two southwestern Israeli
towns, the Palestinians were transported by buses to military
checkpoints near the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where they were
greeted by family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
The release went ahead after Israel's High Court of Justice
Wednesday rejected a petition filed by the Terror Victims
Association, which opposed the release of prisoners and especially
the inclusion of two Palestinians involved in the killings of an
Israeli taxi-driver and two tourists from Italy.
</P>
<P>
This was the third and the last group of Palestinian prisoners
to be released under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed in
September. Israel has freed 350 Palestinians held for anti-Israel
activities in the first two batches as called upon by the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel would aim to release an
unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners early December in honor
of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
But the release was delayed by three weeks because of a dispute
between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) over
the number and the type of the prisoners to be released.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security cabinet decided on the list of the 26
prisoners Sunday. Nine of them are Hamas members and four connected
to the Islamic Jihad. Most of the rest are members of PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials have complained that Israel did not consult them
over the release. They said the number was too small and many of
the prisoners released have only a few weeks left to serve in the
prison.
</P>
<P>
Another group of prisoners, residents of the traditionally Arab
East Jerusalem, are expected to be released by the end of the week,
local media quoted security officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are scheduled to meet
Thursday to continue their talks over an overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank, which should have been
carried out on November 15 under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iran Unearths Giant Historical Establishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian archaeologists have
unearthed remnants of a giant establishment dating back to the
first half of the third millennium B.C., the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The giant establishment was discovered in the third phase of the
excavations on the grounds of the historical "Burnt City," in the
southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan province.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 400 square meters of the building have been
unearthed, but it is estimated to have occupied an area of 1,000
square meters, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment, which comprises a grand central hall and
several corridors with walls having a width of 1.2-1.4 meters and a
height of 4 meters, is the largest monument unearthed in the sites
so far.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the recent excavations, the archaeological team
for the first time discovered a giant staircase with a set of 8
stairs, each 3.2 meters long, 40 centimeters wide and 20
centimeters high.
</P>
<P>
Head of the team Mansour Sajjadi said the staircase bore
resemblance with those in the Persepolis, the palace of the ancient
Persian empire in the sixth century B.C..
</P>
<P>
The resemblance suggested that the recently discovered staircase
had served as a pattern in the building of the world famous
historic monument in Persepolis, he said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of metal pieces, seals, clay works, rope and clay
statues of human beings and animals are among other objects
unearthed in the course of the third phase of excavations.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the statue of cow is an indication to the fact
that people of that time were worshipping the animal, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The Burnt City, the largest ancient ground so far unearthed at
the Iranian plateau, had an estimated population of over 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Hails Bahraini-Qatari Accord on Boosting Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Wednesday
acclaimed the joint Qatari-Bahraini statement in which the two Gulf
states agreed to enhance bilateral ties and promote cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency monitored here quoted a Saudi official as
saying that the statement reflected the keenness of the two
countries' leaders to protect the interests of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued Tuesday after Bahraini Emir Sheikh
Hamad Bin Issa Al-Khalifa held talks with his Qatari counterpart
Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani, who was in Manama on a one-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
The two Gulf Arab states agreed in the statement to exchange
ambassadors and to form a higher committee, which will be co-
chaired by their crown princes, to probe ways of settling their
border dispute "through brotherly means."
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have been locked in a long-running border
dispute over some small but potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf
islands, including the Hawar islands controlled by Bahrain since
the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The matter has been registered with the International Court of
Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands. But according to the
statement, the case will be withdrawn if an acceptable solution is
reached before the court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Their joint committee will study the construction of a bridge
linking the two states, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jamil
Al-Hujailan also hailed the outcome of the Qatari-Bahraini summit.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh-based political and economic alliance, which
comprises Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain and Qatar, had exerted successful mediation efforts in
persuading the two member states to solve their territorial
disputes through consultations.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Blames PNA for Arrest of Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Qatar blamed on Wednesday
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for arresting a Qatari
envoy sent to Gaza to solve an embezzlement case involving a Qatari
businessman.
</P>
<P>
Qatar regretted the failure to solve a legal case against Essam
Abdul Salam Abu Essa, board chairman of the Palestinian
International Bank (PIB), who had allegedly squandered 15 million
U.S. dollars of the bank, said Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman
Ali Bin Abdul Aziz al-Kawari in Doha.
</P>
<P>
Up to 65 percent of the shares of the PIB are owned by investors
from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kawari said that Qatar sent Abu Essa's brother to solve the
issue, but he was arrested by Palestinian security forces,
according to reports reaching here from Doha, capital of Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Palestinian security forces and intelligence
staff surrounded the Qatari diplomatic representation office in
Gaza where Abu Essa lives.
</P>
<P>
"The provocative measures of the Palestinian bodies are a
violation to the diplomatic and international laws," the spokesman
told official Qatari News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kawari said Doha had summoned head of the representation
office in Gaza, Abdullah al-Motawwa, to re-evaluate the Qatari-
Palestinian ties.
</P>
<P>
However, Nabil Saath, who is in charge of planning and
international cooperation in the PNA, said the Qatari-Palestinian
ties "are solid and strong and cannot by tarnished."
</P>
<P>
He said that Abu Essa case "is a problem in a private
institution and we hope it will be solved soon."

DAMASCUS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa met European Union (EU) Special Envoy to the Middle East
Angle Mauratinus here on Wednesday on the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks and the EU's role in the process.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mauratinus told reporters that al-Sharaa
briefed him on the results of the first round of the newly-resumed
Syrian-Israeli talks held early this month in Washington and the
preparations for the second round, scheduled for January in the U.
S..
</P>
<P>
The EU official pointed out that there was cautious optimism
about the talks and a strong will to achieve satisfactory results
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He hailed his talks with al-Sharaa as "very good," adding that
they discussed extensively the role that the EU could play in
process.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the EU demanded to take part in the Syrian-Israeli
talks, Mauratinus said "we did not only ask for participation but
also to be partners in the talks. All the concerned parties
including the United States and Israel showed interest in the
offer."
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem in this respect as we contributed a lot to
the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mauratinus arrived here Wednesday morning for a short visit to
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Child's Remains of 8300 B.C. Oldest in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A child's Remains unearthed in
1994, dating back to about 8300 B.C., proved the oldest traces of
human inhabitation in Cyprus, a statement by Cyprus' Antiquities
Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the earliest human remains" were
uncovered in a deep well in Kissonerga-Mylouthkia, western coastal
Paphos district of the island.
</P>
<P>
The well is now regarded as one of the oldest in the world, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the remains found in an archaeological site in the
Paphos district were identified after an independent research by
laboratories in Arizona, Oxford and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antiquities Department, the well also contained
seeds of domesticated crops and the bones of sheep, goats, pigs and
deer.
</P>
<P>
"Such evidence indicates that the child belonged to one of the
first human groups of farmers to successfully colonize rather than
temporarily utilize the island," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that detached skulls of more humans were found in
another well, not as old as the first, which were carefully
deposited together with whole carcases of animals.
</P>
<P>
"These special burial customs are typical of certain pre-pottery
neolithic cultures of the levantine mainland and South Anatolia,"
the statement said, adding that "they provide valuable evidence
concerning the origin of the island's first colonizers."

<P>
BEIRUT, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded Wednesday in guerrillas'
attack in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The SLA man was moderately wounded when their post at Rihane in
the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied border zone was hit by
mortar bombs fired by Hezbollah, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came shortly after Israeli warplanes fired two
rockets at the Jbaa area in Iqlim Toufah, a Hezbollah stronghold
north of the zone.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading a
guerrilla war trying to drive Israeli occupation troops and their
SLA ally out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Rapist of Former Miss World Sentenced in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli travel agent was
sentenced 16 years in prison on Wednesday morning for kidnapping
and raping former Miss World Linor Abargil in Italy last year, said
sources in Tel Aviv District Court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prosecutor Hadassa Naor asked the court to give Uri
Shlomo, who had been convicted on the charges last October, a
maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment for his "repulsive"
crime.
</P>
<P>
Shlomo, who immigrated to Israel from Egypt in the 1970s, denied
the charges. His lawyers said they may appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Abargil, 20, was working on a short-term modeling job in Milan
in October 1998. She went to Shlomo, a 43-year-old Jerusalem
resident who operated a travel agency there, for help to buy a
ticket for returning to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Then, Shlomo offered to drive her to Rome, saying there were no
flights from Milan to Israel. During the ride, Shlomo pulled off
the highway and raped her in his car, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Abargil was Miss Israel at that time and went on to win the Miss
World title in the Seychelles in December 1998. She lodged bravely
her complaint against Shlomo after becoming Miss World in order to
set a "no-afraid" example to other abused women.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Daily Slams Latest U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper has slammed
a latest U.N. resolution on Iraq as an attempt to dictate new
reading of the U.N. Security Council Resolution (SCR) 687 which led
to the ceasefire of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The ath-Thawra Daily of the ruling Baath Party said in its
Wednesday editorial that U.N. Resolution 1284 on Iraq which was
approved on December 17 dropped SCR 687's paragraph 14 which called
for making the Middle East region free of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
It said paragraph 14 of SCR 687 also covers the Zionist entity
which possesses deadly massive nuclear and chemical arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on December 17 adopted a new comprehensive
policy on Iraq with 11 votes for and four abstentions. China,
Russia, France and Malaysia abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1284 stipulates the establishment of a new arms
control body -- the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (UNMOVIC) -- in Iraq to replace the U.N. Special
Commission or UNSCOM in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It also offered Iraq with ambiguous terms the chance to have the
trade sanctions suspended if it cooperates with arms inspectors in
all aspects and makes progress on key disarmament tasks to be
defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The daily stressed that despite the fact that Iraq had fulfilled
all its commitments under SCR 687 under supervision of the "ill-
famed" UNSCOM, the Security Council failed to meet its reciprocal
obligations toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that the U.S. and its allies are behind ignoring
this paragraph 14 in favor of the Zionist entity to keep its
military superiority in the region," said the daily.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. and its western allies tried to twist facts by
depicting Iraq as a source of threat to security and stability in
the region, it added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial warned that Arab and Islamic governments have
encouraged the U.S. and its allies to go ahead with their dubious
moves by keeping silence on the U.S. behaviour.

NICOSIA -- The parliament of Cyprus has approved a bill on
lifting a maximum nine percent ceiling on interest rates, local
newspapers reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by a vote of 30-17.
</P>
<P>
The new law, which is to come into effect as from January 1,

<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's automotive industry increased its export rate
to 38 percent with 96,000 cars exported in 1999, said Head of the
Turkish Automotive Association Ali Ibsan Ilkbahar.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the industry will continue to develop despite
of more than 50 percent high taxes on the industry, Turkish Daily
News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ilkbahar said the car industry is expected to fetch 4 billion U.
S. dollars to the state treasury by 2002 and the sector will be
well-positioned in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chicago-based World Automotive News information
center announced that Turkey ranked 20th in world automotive
production by producing 381,324 road vehicles in 1998. The U.S.
ranked the No.1 producer with 12,042,163 units. The other 9 major
producers are Japan, Germany, France, Spain, Canada, South Korea,
Britain, Italy and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank has agreed to extend a loan of 300
million
U.S. dollars to the Egyptian Development and Agricultural Credit
Bank to finance the mega land reclamation Toshka project in Upper
Egypt.  A World Bank delegation is due in Cairo in March to sign
the
final loan agreement.

The new city, to be linked with the capital city by a bridge,
will be built in three stages over a period of about 20 years. It
will be located in Al Sobeih, a peninsula close to the Iraqi
borders.
</P>
<P>
The city, designed to house 250,000 residents, is about 130
kilometers from the capital city by land route, but the
bridge will cut the distance to 21 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Might Share Jerusalem as Capitals: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on Wednesday hinted at the prospect that a future
independent Palestinian state may share Jerusalem with Israel as
their capitals.
</P>
<P>
"Some ideas covering Jerusalem have already been raised and they
might be a start for tackling the situation of the holy city," he
said, hinting Jerusalem can have an Arab part and an Israeli part.
</P>
<P>
"But such visions are still in the beginning (of any
discussions) and can not be commented on," Moussa told reporters
after a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the traditional Arab East Jerusalem as
capital of their future state. But Israel claims that Jerusalem is
its "undivided and eternal" capital.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are seeking a settlement for the holy city as well
as other thorny issues, such as refugees and water, in their
negotiations for a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who ended a two-day visit to Egypt on Wednesday, briefed
Mubarak on the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, especially the long-overdue Israeli withdrawal from another
5 percent of the West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous matter," Moussa said, referring to the
withdrawal maps presented by Israel. "This is not considered either
a withdrawal or a settlement but reflects the way of thinking of
Ariel Sharon and the Likud," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is the leader of Likud, Israel's largest opposition
party, which takes a hard line toward negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected Israel's withdrawal maps because the
areas included in the maps were not as densely populated and
contiguous as Palestinians deemed appropriate.

<HEADLINE> Progress of Syrian-Israeli Talks Helpful to Other Tracks: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Welcoming the resumption of
Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said on Wednesday that there is no clash and contradiction between
the Palestinian and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Any progress on the Syrian track will help promote the peace
talks on other tracks, Arafat said before leaving Cairo after a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians welcome any progress on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks in order to reach an overall and permanent solution to the
Arab-Israeli conflict, he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed peace talks two weeks ago in Washington
after a freeze of nearly four years. They have agreed to continue
the negotiations next Monday on Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and other
related issues.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Israel are also expected to resume talks on Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon after Syria and Israel make progress
in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Terming as "good and positive" his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat said he briefed Mubarak on the
present situation in the Palestinian-Israeli talks, especially the
implementation of the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
He said he listened to views of Mubarak, who promised to
continue exerting efforts to help push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum signed in September in Egypt, Israel would
have handed over another 5 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected Israel's withdrawal maps because the
areas included in the maps were not as densely populated and
contiguous as Palestinians deemed appropriate.

demands raised by coalition partner Shas.

JERUSALEM -- Israel freed 26 Palestinian prisoners Wednesday in
the long-delayed third release under an interim agreement signed by
the two sides in September.
</P>
<P>
The release of third batch of Palestinian prisoners had
originally been set before the start of Muslim holy fasting month
of Ramadan three weeks ago, but was postponed because of a dispute
between the two sides. Israel had released 350 Palestinian
prisoners in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
After being set free from prisons near two southwestern Israeli
towns, the Palestinians were transported by buses to military
checkpoints near the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where they were
greeted by family members and friends. (Israel-Palestinian

into two after running aground in the Marmara Sea off Istanbul on
Wednesday, emptying 800 tons of fuel into the sea, reported the
Anatolia News Agency.

<P>
ANKARA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-flagged fuel tanker,
Volganeft 248, split into two after running aground in the Marmara
Sea off Istanbul on Wednesday, emptying 800 tons of fuel into the
sea, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The disaster was wreaked by the Lodos (southwestern) wind which
began two days ago and disrupted maritime traffic in the Bosporus
straits.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, the tanker was carrying 3,463 gross tons
of fuel oil from Bulgaria to Ambarh of India when it ran aground
Wednesday morning about 1.6 kilometers off-shore.
</P>
<P>
The jolt resulting from the ship running aground led to the
front cargo hold breaking away from the body of the ship. The fuel
oil in the cargo hold leaked into the sea, and the front section of
the tanker later sank.
</P>
<P>
The tanker's oil was quickly spread by choppy waves. Barriers
could not be placed around the oil to stop it from spreading
because the wind remained high. Officials said that the only
possibility was to use boats that would try to skim the oil from
the surface, but the wind would have to die down before attempting
such an operation.
</P>
<P>
Fears of further oil spill were growing.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers fought with rough seas and strong winds to save crew
members stranded on the grounded ship in the Bosporus straits.

GAZA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Another seven Palestinian

release of 26 Palestinians on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by Israel Radio Wednesday night as the 26
freed Palestinian prisoners, as the third batch Israel was obliged

</P>
<P>
Wednesday's release had been delayed for three weeks as the two

</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of State of Prisoners Affairs Hisham Abdul
Raziq said the released included 12 members of the militant Hamas
and Islamic Jihad factions, 12 of the Fatah movement - the mainstay
of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
It also included one from the People's Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, and one of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Terming the move a "positive step," however, Raziq expressed
dissatisfaction with the delay and the small number of inmates
released this time.
</P>
<P>
"It can not be said that this is the last release of Palestinian
detainees under the Sharm el Sheikh memo," he said, noting that the
joint Palestinian-Israeli committee on prisoners affairs would meet
on releasing more detainees.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian minister insisted that Israel set free all 1,650
Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli jails. The number
includes the 26 Palestinians released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had promised to
set free all of them if the two side reach a framework final-status
agreement in mid-February, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Na'im Hassona, one of the released, said he was forced before
his release to sign a document promising not to carry out any
attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
A Hamas activist who was given a 10-year jail term, he described
the situation in the Israeli jail as "very difficult," and was
joyful for returning to his family after spending nine years and a
half in jail.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the rest of the Palestinian prisoners would
be released as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Indian Plane Hijackers Drop Two Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hijackers of an Indian
airliner have dropped their demands for 200 million dollars and
the return of the body of a Kashmiri militant leader, news
reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers holding more than 150 hostages on board the plane,
which has been stranded in southern Afghan city of Kandahar since
last Saturday, were persuaded by the Taliban to give up their two
demands, but the demand for the release of 35 kishmiri militants
from Indian jails still stands.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they raised the demands to an team of Indian
negotiators asking for money and the release of the jailed
militants. They also asked for the body of Sajjad Afghani, a
leader of the militant group Harkat-ul-Ansar.
</P>
<P>
The Indian team has been in negotiations with the hijackers
since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taliban authorities at the Kandahar airport said the
hijackers allowed staff to board the aircraft and clean it.
</P>
<P>
They were the first group of people to see the hostages since
the ordeal began five days ago. The passengers were said to be
relaxed, playing cards and listening to music.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers, who seized the Airbus-300 jet six days ago,
refused a request by Indian negotiators that they release children
and their mothers.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven people, most women and children, were set free at
a Dubai airbase last Friday night and another ailing man was
released at the Kandahar airport last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As the hijacking drama entered its sixth day, there were signs
that conditions on board the aircraft may be improving slightly.
</P>
<P>
The pilot had described the situation for passengers and crew
as "terrible". Food and water are being supplied to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
A medical team consisting of an International Committee of Red
Cross (ICRC) official, two nurses and an anesthetist as well as an
ambulance were standing by a surgical post set at the airport in
case they were needed, said ICRC spokesman Roland Sidler.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the passengers aboard the aircraft, a doctor,
had handed out medicine to his fellow hostages, a concession made
by the hijackers.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Ferry Runs Aground in Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A passenger ferry with 206
passengers on board ran aground early Wednesday in the central
Philippines but no casualty was reported, the government said.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said the
ship, M/V Our Lady of Banneux, ran aground at about 1:50 Wednesday
morning (17:50 GMT Tuesday) near Canigao Island of Leyte province.
</P>
<P>
According to the PCG, no casualty was reported and all
passengers were transferred to M/V Our Lady of Manaog, which was
dispatched by Cebu Ferries to respond to its sister ship.
</P>
<P>
All the passengers were brought back to Nasipit, Butuan
province to board M/V Super Ferry I which departed for Manila
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The PCG said the ill-fated ship, which departed Tuesday from
Nasipit for Manila, is awaiting to be pulled out when high tide
comes.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Rivera, secretary of the transportation and
communication department, has ordered the Maritime Industry
Authority (Marina) and the PCG to thoroughly investigate the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Rivera also instructed the Marina and PCG to coordinate with
shipping lines with a view to filling up the void in shipping
services, which will be created by the temporary suspension of the
operation of Trans-Asia Shipping Lines.
</P>
<P>
A ferry of the Trans-Asia Shipping Lines sank last Thursday in
the central Philippines, claiming 46 lives with nearly 200
passengers still missing.

<HEADLINE> Hijackers Drop Two Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Hijackers of the Indian
Airlines aircraft Wednesday dropped their demands for the ransom
of 200 million U.S. dollars and the return of the body of a
militant Sajjad Afghani.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by senior Indian diplomat at Kandahar,
Afghanistan who took part in the talks with the hijackers,
according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
However, the hijackers continued to press for the release of 36
hard-core militants jailed in India, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Things are moving inch by inch but it is good. We are trying
our best," a senior Indian official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers dropped their two demands apparently after the
Indian government conveyed its "appropriate response" to them on
the stiff conditions they had imposed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
They demanded release of 35 other hard-core jailed militants
besides Maulana Masood Azhar and 200 million U.S. dollars for the
release of 154 hostages.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that the body of Harkat-ul Ansar chief in
Jammu and Kashmir Sajjad Afghani be exhumed and the coffin be
handed over to them.
</P>
<P>
Afghani, who was arrested along with Azhar in February 1994,
was killed when Pakistani mercenaries made an abortive bid to
escape from Kot Balwal jail in Jammu.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee reviewed the situation for about an hour.

<HEADLINE> Manila Files Criminal Raps vs Officers of Sunk Ferry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Coast Guards (
PCG) has filed a criminal complaint against the officers and crew
of M\V Asia South Korea which sank last Thursday and claimed more
than 40 lives.
</P>
<P>
The PCG said Wednesday in a statement that it charged the
officers and crew of the ferry for "reckless imprudence resulting
in multiple homicide and serious physical injuries."
</P>
<P>
The criminal complaint, came at the heels of the announcement
by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) that
it will deal severely with serious infractions against maritime
safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, DOTC Secretary Vicente Rivera directed the Maritime
Industry Authority (Marina) to consider imposing appropriate
administrative sanctions, including the possible suspension of
operations, against Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, the owner of the
ill-fated ferry.
</P>
<P>
Ferry M\V Asia South Korea sank last Thursday near Cebu in the
central Philippines, claiming 46 lives with nearly 200 passengers
still missing.
</P>
<P>
This developed as initial findings of the PCG investigators on
the incident showed that Trans-Asia deliberately overloaded the
vessels and misled the PCG inspection team into allowing its
departure.
</P>
<P>
The investigating further indicated human error as the apparent
cause of the vessel's veering into dangerously shallow waters
where it eventually sank after hitting a hard object.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the maritime disasters, Rivera instructed the
Marina to ensure the safety of passengers and goods along the
country's shipping routes by strictly implementing its rules and
regulations.

ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Wednesday called on the Indian government not to cause any further
delay in ending the prolonged hijacking drama of an Indian
airliner to avoid any more human loss.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the Indian government not to cause further delay
and settle it as early as possible," Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic

Motmain said the Taliban had also asked New Delhi to take
immediate steps "to avoid any loss of life in view of the bad and
difficult condition of the passengers" of the hijacked plane.
</P>

The spokesman confirmed that the hijackers had dropped their
demands for 200 million U.S. dollars and for the body of a slain
Kashmiri militant Sajjad Afghani "on Taliban's request".

ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The technical problems of
the hijacked Indian plane have been removed and electricity system
restored on Wednesday, Afghan Taliban sources said.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers had allowed the technicians to enter the plane
for repair work, the Taliban sources said.
</P>

fifth day.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban sources said that food was served to the passengers
on the hijacked plane Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There have been difficulties in the supply of food due to
sanctions by the United Nations against the Afghan airlines of
Aryana.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indian negotiators in Kandahar said Wednesday
afternoon the hijackers who have been holding 160 hostages on
board the hijacked plane have dropped two of their demands.
</P>
<P>
They say the hijackers are no longer asking for 200 million
dollars or for the handing over of body of a "freedom fighter" who
was killed in India early this year.

The hijackers Tuesday had demanded that India release 35
persons jailed in India and hand over 200 million dollars besides
the body of a freedom fighter.

Meanwhile, the Indian negotiators in Kandahar began their
fourth round of talks with the hijackers as the hostages endured

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Revival of Russian Aircraft Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin Wednesday called for "tough, effective and resolute" efforts
to revive the country's aircraft making and shipbuilding
industries.
</P>
<P>
"The country was proud of the industries for decades but today
they are in a critical state," Putin told a conference on boosting
investment in the sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 1991 Russian aircraft production has dropped
93 percent. The country only purchased only 32 Russian-made and 41
foreign-made aircraft between 1993 and 1998, while 2,700 were
decommissioned during the period.
</P>
<P>
The average age of the current air fleet is 24-30 years and 70
percent of the aircraft will have to be put out of commission in
the near future, he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin also noted the dire situation of the shipbuilding, saying
the country's civilian fleet slumped by 50 percent in eight years,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no catastrophe yet, and there is every chance
to revive the two industries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporting progress in the political situation in Guinea-Bissau,
Annan called last month's elections in the country "an important
step forward in the ongoing transition to democracy and the
restoration of peace and normalcy."
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, issued here
Monday, Annan said, "It is my hope that the results of the
legislative elections signal the emergence of an era of
pluralistic democracy."
</P>
<P>
Annan's report was mainly on developments in the West African
country and the activities of the U.N. Peace-Building Force Office
in Guinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS).
</P>
<P>
Annan said that since no clear winner emerged from the November
28 presidential elections, the formation of a new government was
not expected before February 2000, following the second round of
voting schedule for January 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief called on Member States and interested
organizations to provide assistance in the conduct of the runoff
elections.
</P>
<P>
As for the activities of the UNOGBIS, Annan said that following
consultations with Guinea-Bissau's interim government and Security
Council members, it had been recently agreed to extend the mission
's mandate for a three-month period until March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the continued success and effectiveness of the
U.N. office in Guinea-Bissau depended, in part, on the
availability of adequate resources. He stressed the "unwavering
support" of the international community was crucial for meeting
the challenges of ensuring sustainable peace and progress in the
country.
</P>
<P>
While pointing to "rather positive background" of latest
developments, Annan, however, said he was compelled to reiterate
his concern about the continued detention of military and
personnel prisoners in appalling conditions.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to "all concerned" in Guinea-Bissau to speed up the
judicial process and to take action to improve the detainees'
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The second-round runoff in Guinea-Bissau's presidential
elections is scheduled for January 16.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan asked the Security Council to consider expanding the U.N.
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone from 6,000 to about 10,000 soldiers
because the Nigerian-led West African force is pulling out and a
cease-fire remains fragile, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference that Annan last week wrote to
the president of the Security Council for the month of December,
Jeremy Greenstock who is the British ambassador to the United
Nations, recommending that the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, known
as the UNAMSIL, be expanded to "close to 10,000 military personnel,
" Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said in the letter that Nigeria, Ghana
and Guinea were all preparing to withdraw their troops from the
Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG)
force in Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Sierra Leone continues to pose a threat to
peace and security in the region," Annan said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much concerned that the repatriation of ECOMOG
troops in the immediate future, without adequate security
protection provided by other peacekeepers, would create a
dangerous security gap in key areas," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan was recommending that the Security Council authorize the
addition of up to four infantry battalions and support personnel
to the UNAMSIL as soon as possible, and that the force be mandated
to provide security at Lungi airport in the capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
More details of Annan's concept of an expanded UNAMSIL will be
provided in a report to the 15-nation Security Council on January
20, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, also in the letter, said that he had appealed to
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo to review his decision to
withdraw Nigerian troops from the West African peacekeeping force,
but Obasanjo confirmed on December 21 that this troops would start
leaving in January and complete their pullout in February.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG helped end Sierra Leone's civil war and
pave the way for the July 7 cease-fire signed by the government
and rebels who terrorized the country for some eight years.
</P>
<P>
To back the cease-fire, the Security Council on October 22
authorized the deployment of a 6,000-strong peacekeeping force to
monitor its implementation and disarm fighters.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. force has been very slow in arriving, with only
several hundred Kenyan and Indian peacekeepers in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Rise In November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a survey that based on revised
data, this index increased 0.1 percent at 108.0 in October. During
the six-month span through November, the leading index rose 0.8
percent, and eight of the 10 components that make up the index
advanced, with one component holding steady.
</P>
<P>
"The current readings, when considered along with the upward
revision for October, show that the flat readings for August and
September were caused by the severe hurricane seasons," said
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. "The October and
November readings are more in line with the nine months of
increases recorded between October 1998 and July 1999. The latest
readings suggest there has been no fundamental change in the
underlying conditions of the economy over the second half of 1999.
"
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said, "Without more evidence of some underlying
weakening in economic fundamentals, this expansion will continue
well into 2000, setting a record in February."
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 indicators, six rose in November, and the most
significant increases are stock prices, manufacturers' new orders
of consumer goods and materials, and money supply, according to
the survey. The most significant negative contributor to the
composite leading index in November is interest rate spread.
</P>
<P>
The index is a barometer for the U.S. economic activity in the
next three to six months.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Policemen Urged to be Punished in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Police Officers (
PENAA) in Greece Wednesday called for the immediate and exemplary
punishment of guilty officers.
</P>
<P>
The PENAA deplored the phenomena of corruption in the country's
police force and urged all police officers and citizens to be on
alert for effectively combating incidents of corruption, the semi-
official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Greet government's efforts to crack down on the
police's corruption, 14 Greek law enforcement officials at the
Menidi precinct have been charged with a variety of crimes
including blackmail and accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-month-long investigation by the police's
Internal Affairs Department, set up in October this year, 10 of
the policemen face felony charges while the other four have been
charged with misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
Charges include illegally issuing or forging work permits for
foreign women employed as dancers in bars, extorting protection
money from clubs operating banned gambling machines and accepting
bribes not to prosecute illegal construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Mortgage lending in Britain is
set to reach a record high next year, according to one of the UK's
biggest commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Barclays predicted that gross mortgage lending will increase to
about 110 billion pounds for 2000 as a whole, surpassing this year
's record 104 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The bank argued that the rise in lending will be underpinned by
increasing confidence among consumers about the direction of house
prices.
</P>
<P>
In its survey, Barclays found that 58 percent of home owners
expect the value of their properties to rise, compared with 42
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
John King, the bank's deputy managing director, cautioned,
however, that "with interest rates likely to rise further and some
slowdown in the economy, moderation in house prices and turnover
in 2000 can be expected."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Central Elections
Commission (CEC) Wednesday announced the final results of the
December 10 elections for the State Duma or lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party finished at the top with 24.29 percent of
the votes. The pro-government Unity movement was second with 23.32
percent, followed by the center-left Fatherland-All Russia
movement with 13.33 percent, and the right-wing Union of Right
Forces 8.52 percent. The bloc of ultra-nationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky and the liberal Yabloko party got 5.98 percent and 5.
93 percent of the votes respectively.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 450 Duma seats will be divided among these six
victorious blocs -- 67 for the Communists, 64 for Union, 37 for
Fatherland-All Russia, 24 for the Union of Right Forces, 17 for
Zhirinovsky Bloc and 16 for Yabloko.
</P>
<P>
Only 216 of the other 225 seats were elected in single-seat
constituencies, as results in eight electoral districts were
declared invalid because over half of the voters in those areas
voted against all candidates listed on the ballots. Elections in
Chechnya were postponed because federal troops were conducting an
offensive there against Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to CEC Secretary Olga Zastrozhnaya, 61.85 percent of
Russia's 108 million registered voters cast their ballots, far
exceeding the required turnout of 25 percent.

MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkmen President Saparmurad
Niyazov ordered Wednesday that the Central Asian republic would
change over to the Latin alphabet as of January 1, 2000, to
replace the Cyrillic currently in use.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov issued the decree at a session of the People's Council,

</P>
<P>
A commission has been appointed to introduce the new alphabet.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the former Soviet republic are Turkmen, who
speak West Turkic, a language closely related to Turkish.
</P>
<P>
At the People's Council session, deputies also decided to
rename eight towns. The southernmost town of Kushka, near the
Afghan border, has been renamed Serkhetabad, or Secure Border. The
eastern Turkmen town of Kerki has been renamed Atamurad after
Niyazov's father.

<HEADLINE> France to Reconsider Military Cooperation With Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- France will probably scale down
its military cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire, after the country had
a coup d'etat last week which overthrew President Henri Konan
Bedie, said French Minister of Cooperation Charles Josselin
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of evaluating what will become of the
cooperation: probably modification in the military field, but by
preserving military cooperation in the field of health, and by
preserving also the regional center for training police," he said
in an interview with the TV5 television.
</P>
<P>
As for the civil cooperation, he said that France does not wish
to see a suspension of implementation of cooperation agreements
which could hurt the Ivorian society.
</P>
<P>
France has not suspended its cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire
after the coup took place, but has called on the country's new
strongman, General Robert Guei, to promise a quick return of
constitutional rule through a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Josselin again criticized President Bedie for doing a bad job
at his post.
</P>
<P>
"The people seem to receive positively the on-going change,
which shows well that the house of Bedie was in reality profoundly
undermined," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the social situation in Cote d'Ivoire as "very
saddening" mainly because of the fall of the price of cocoa in the
international market and corruption of some government officials,
who have been accused of embezzling international aid.
</P>
<P>
France is Cote d'Ivoire's biggest credit provider and has close
political and military relations with the country with 550
soldiers permanently stationed there.

MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A St. Petersburg court
Wednesday handed down a non-guilty verdict to retired Captain 1st
Rank Alexander Nikitin, who had been charged with espionage and
state treason for disclosing problems with handling radioactive
waste in the Russian Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The court also canceled travel restrictions imposed earlier on
Nikitin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>

Judge Sergei Golets said that investigators had violated
procedural norms. Furthermore, the prosecution had built its case
on laws passed after charges were brought against Nikitin.

<P>
Nikitin was acquitted due to "absence of a crime."
</P>
<P>
The St. Petersburg Federal Security Service (FSB) Department

crimes in preparation for his contributing articles for a report
compiled by Bellona, a Norwegian environmental watchdog report.

<P>
Two chapters by Nikitin, "Catastrophes and Accidents in Nuclear
Submarines" and "Nuclear Energy Units," were included in the

UNITED NATIONS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Erick de Mul, the
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, will
return tomorrow to Kandahar, Afghanistan, from Islamabad, Pakistan,
U.N. said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said that in Islamabad, de Mul
contracted with a local firm to supply food to the passengers of
the hijacked Indian Airlines plane, as well to the Indian
negotiators, diplomats, relief workers and journalists at Kandahar
airport.
</P>
<P>
Food supplies in Kandahar were running low yesterday, forcing
de Mul to assist the Taleban authorities in making alternative
arrangements, and the World Food Programme and other relief
agencies are involved, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
De Mul has also been coordinating with the International
Committee of the Red Cross, which has established a medical
facility at the airport, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Indian Government, and with the support
of the Taleban, de Mul has been assisting with the humanitarian
aspects of the hostage crisis, and he has had no role in the
negotiations between the Indian Government team and the hijackers,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The hijack took place last Friday. The plane was carrying 178
passengers and 11 crew members.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers on Sunday released a diabetic passenger. They
earlier freed 27 passengers, mostly women and children, and handed
over the body of an Indian passenger who was stabbed to death,
when the plane touched down at a military base in the United Arab
Emirates

<HEADLINE> Niyazov Designated Turkmen President for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of Turkmenistan
on Wednesday designated Saparmurad Niyazov as president of the
Central Asian republic for life, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Popular Council handed him a gold chain with a diamond-
decorated star, a white robe and an olive pole, Muslim symbols of
sainthood and moral purity, Interfax said in a dispatch from
Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen parliament last Tuesday granted Niyazov an
exclusive right to retain the presidential post during his entire
life.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov swore to honestly serve the fatherland and the people
and to promote his counterparts' well-being, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Born in Ashgabat in 1940, Niyazov became president of the
Republic of Turkmenistan after its independence from the former
Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He received 99.5 percent of the votes in the presidential
elections of 1992. In 1994, 99.9 percent of the voters endorsed
Niyazov's leadership, allowing him to extend his presidency until
2002.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Police Officer Deaths Decline in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 130 police officers have been killed so far in 1999,
down from 156 in 1998, the National Law Enforcement Officers
Memorial Fund and the Concerns of Police Survivors said.
</P>
<P>
The annual average in the 1990s was 153, compared with 187
during the 1980s and 222 during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The decline in police officer deaths was attributed to better
training, the increased use of bullet-resistant vests and the
overall drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
Officers shot to death fell from 63 last year to 45 so far this
year, the lowest figure since 1962. Another 47 died in automobile
accidents, 15 from job-related illnesses, eight were struck by
vehicles, seven died in motorcycle accidents, two were stabbed,
one died in a fall and one was struck and killed by a train.

<HEADLINE> German State Prosecutors to Launch Probe Against Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 29 (Xinhua)--The Bonn-based German federal
prosecutor office Wednesday announced to begin next Monday a
thorough investigation into the secret funds of former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
The office has informed German parliamentary president Wolfgang
Thierse its planned procedure against Kohl, said the chief
prosecutor Bernd Koenig.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, still a legislator, is immune to juridical proceedings
before the parliament agrees on them.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will begin in 48 hours after the lower
parliamentary chamber, the Bundestag, gives green light, said
Koenig.
</P>
<P>
Thierse has indicated he would not oppose the judicial probe.
</P>
<P>
"Kohl's years-long intentional violation to laws and the
constitution has made up an abominable precedent," he told the
Deutschland Radio in Berlin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"He brings our democracy into a problematic situation," said
the parliamentary president.
</P>
<P>
Though the prosecutor's office stressed that the investigation
did not mean any criminal charge against Kohl, there were "strong
initial suspicions" that Kohl was guilty of breach of trust, said
Koenig.
</P>
<P>
It was the second probe in this month against Kohl, who
reportedly had received millions of marks as undeclared donations
to his party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
</P>
<P>
The Bundestag agreed to set up a special committee to
investigate Kohl's scandal on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Kohl himself admitted earlier this month that he had taken 2
million marks in cash as party fund and had managed secret bank
accounts. But the media said the total sum of Kohl's "black
accounts" could be up to 10 million marks.
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's Party Funding Law, any political party should
publicize donations over 20 thousand marks with the name and
address of the donors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kohl said the former chancellor "regretted" the
decision of probe, but Kohl would "support it with all his
available means."
</P>
<P>
But Kohl has yet refused to say for what he had spent the money,
how much secret accounts he had run, or from whom he had received
the money.
</P>
<P>
If he is found guilty of breach of trust, Kohl, who served as
German Chancellor from 1982 to 1998, will face a fine or up to 5
years in jail.

<HEADLINE> Russia Threatens Fiercer Air Attacks on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Russian air
force on Wednesday threatened to unleash even fiercer air attacks
against the rebels retreating to the mountains in the breakaway
Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
The air force might use more powerful weapons in the mountains
than it has on the Chechen plains, but those banned by
international conventions would not be fired, the Interfax news
agency quoted Colonel-General Anatoly Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We possess means of destruction that are more effective than
those being used at the moment. We may use them to annihilate (
rebels in the mountains," Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels hiding in the mountains "are out-and-out
cutthroats who will not surrender."
</P>
<P>
"They will either try to fight their way to the border
territory of other states or offer open battle as suicide fighters.
They must simply be annihilated. There is no other way,"Kornukov
said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has accused neighboring Georgia of assisting the rebels,
a charge vehemently denied by Tbilisi. The two countries share a
border of 85 kilometers across Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian air force has not used and will not use any (
weapons banned by international conventions," he said. "We are
perfectly aware of the consequences of such actions. The situation
is such that there is no need for this."
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Russian Defense Ministry
said Wednesday that rebels blew up a storage tank in the Chechen
capital of Grozny suspected to have contained chlorine and ammonia.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops in the northeast of Grozny, where the reported
blast occurred, were ordered to take chemical defense measures,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
A special operation is underway to flush rebels, estimated at 1,
500, out of Grozny. Fierce battles have been reportedly going on
for over three days.
</P>
<P>
Despite stiff resistance from the rebels, federal troops,
supported by artillery and helicopter gunships, were approaching
the city on all sides Wednesday, Interfax said, citing military
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military has predicted that the rebels' operations
in Grozny will decrease considerably in a few days as a result of
shortage of personnel, ammunition and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The current campaign was launched in September following armed
Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series of
terrorist bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants, that left
over 300 people dead in Moscow and two other Russian cities.

<HEADLINE> Blair Calls for Change and Progress in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Wednesday called on the UK to embrace change and look to the
future.
</P>
<P>
His New Year message also called on Britain to counter a lack
of self-belief.
</P>
<P>
Blair made his speech at the Trimdon Colliery Community Center
in his Sedgefield constituency in County Durham.
</P>
<P>
The address covered many areas of government policy, including
the need to fight social exclusion, as well as highlighting the
country's strong economy and rising employment levels.
</P>
<P>
He said: "in two-and-a-half years in office, we have laid the
foundations of a new and better Britain. In time, given the chance,
I believe we will transform Britain.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized the strong economy before
underlining the importance of education to the strength of the
nation's finances.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the government's performance, the prime minister
said: "What is the single biggest lesson we can learn as a
government and a party from our first two-and-a-half years of
government? That the key to all change and progress is reform; to
be radical.
</P>
<P>
"Our achievements have not been accidental. They have not come
about by luck or chance. They derive directly from reforms we have
made, changes which in turn derive directly from the values and
ideas of New Labor."
</P>
<P>
On the future, Blair said: "The 20th Century was a century in
which for all our extraordinary achievements - most notably in
World War II- Britain's power declined.
</P>
<P>
"But it can be rebuilt in a new way for a different age. Some
of the changes in the 80s were necessary to do this in removing
obstacles to enterprise."
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was clear the UK could meet the challenges it
faced in the next century.
</P>
<P>
It was a lack of self-belief and a failure to embrace change
that was the real danger Britain faced in the next century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the next century, We have every reason to be
confident- confident of our place in the world, confident of the
talents of the British people, confident that we can be a model
21st Century nation," Blair said.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches Internet Y2K Bug Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government launched
an Internet site on Wednesday designed to keep people up to date
in case the millennium bug strikes anywhere around the world.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the millennium weekend, the Millennium Center will
offer live news and information from more than 76 countries.
</P>
<P>
The website will be run by the Cabinet Office, relying on
updates from Foreign Office consular staff, television and
internet news feeds.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from Fiji and New Zealand are expected to
arrive shortly after 1200 GMT on December 31, when they experience
the year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
Reports from other countries - including the UK - will follow
as the date change happens.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister John Battle said the site would be
useful to anyone living or travelling abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The millennium bug is a global problem and we are trying to
ensure we co-ordinate information about its effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's so that we can pass on travel advice to people wishing
to go abroad during the millennium. We will also be able to tell
people what the situation is like for any of their relatives
living overseas," he added.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a computer glitch which results from
dates being stored in two-digit form on older computers.
</P>
<P>
It means some computers could interpret '00' as 1900 instead of
2000, causing system failure or unpredictable behavior.
</P>
<P>
This has led to fears of disruption on a massive scale, with
predictions of aeroplanes falling out of the sky, nuclear bombs
going off or people's bank accounts being cleared of funds.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said tackling the bug has been the biggest single
project since World War II, involving every government department
and business.

LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Millennium Flame arrived in
London on Wednesday for the New Year's Eve celebrations after
completing a 448-kilometer journey from northeastern Britain.
</P>
<P>
Burning in a red and gold glass torch, the flame was carried by
rail from Sunderland, where it was lit in May.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Queen Elizabeth II will use the torch to light a
fuse which will fire a laser beam across the river as a highlight
of the night's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The laser will then ignite a beacon as high as two double
decker buses.
</P>
<P>
The 25-tonne beacon will be the centerpiece of a chain of 4,000
beacons lit across the country as the sun goes down on the second
millennium.
</P>
<P>
It will send flames into the night sky as part of the "River of

<HEADLINE> Britain to Launch Inquiry Into "Nazi" Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw Wednesday ordered an inquiry into the circumstances
surrounding the entry of an alleged Nazi war criminal into Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said Straw had asked for a "full report" into
how Konrad Kalejs, who is under investigation by the police, came
to be given permission to enter Britain.
</P>
<P>
Kalejs, who is living in a Leicestershire residential home, is
said to have been joint second-in-command in a Latvian unit which
worked with the Nazis in murdering 30,000 Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Nazi war criminal hunters have alleged that Kalejs, who
emigrated to Australia after the war, had been deported from the U.
S. and had fled Canada after details about his past emerged.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokesman said: "The home secretary has asked for
a full report into the circumstances of how the individual was
given permission to be in the country and has asked the
immigration service to keep in close contact with the police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The home secretary will make any decision necessary in the
light of the police investigation," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry came as pressure mounted from politicians and
Jewish groups for Kalejs, 86, to be either deported or prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Labor MP David Winnick, a member of the Commons Home Affairs
Select Committee, said he had been informed by the Home Office
that Kalejs had entered the UK on an Australian passport and his
six-month tourist visa runs out on January 6.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug Hits UK Retailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The millennium bug has struck
early in Britain, with many retailers' card machines refusing to
process credit and debit card transactions.
</P>
<P>
But HSBC, which has issued 10,000 card swipe machines to
retailers, said the machines will be working by January 1, the BBC
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many people think the millennium bug will strike as soon as the
clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve. The truth is that it
could happen any time a computer uses the date 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
A software problem has meant that since Tuesday many credit
card terminals have not accepted transactions from credit and
debit cards, such as Switch, Mastercard and Visa.
</P>
<P>
Credit card transactions are stored on a central computer which
covers a four day period. Hence any transactions which took place
since Tuesday have covered the date of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Since the problem emerged, many retailers have resorted to pen
and paper to complete credit and debit transactions.
</P>
<P>
But many shops and restaurants, who are having one of their
busiest periods, are furious at the software problems and wonder
why they were not anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Action 2000, the government body set up to warn about
millennium computer problems, said: "Many people think the
millennium bug will strike as soon as the clock strikes midnight
on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that it could happen any time a computer uses the
date 2000," it said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called millennium bug may strike computers which
recognize the year by just two digits.
</P>
<P>
The fear is that when 1999 becomes 2000, the computer will read
the switch from '99 to '00 and think it is 1900 rather than 2000.
</P>
<P>
The fault will renew worries that the Y2K bug will bring the UK
grinding to a halt, despite persistent claims by business and
government that key computer systems are compliant.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Close Some Foreign Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan Foreign Minister
Wednesday confirmed that his country will close some of its
missions abroad because of economic pressure, but assured that it
would not affect its ties with other countries.
</P>
<P>
The prevailing black-out on this important decision which is
likely to change Rwanda's outlook on the international arena need
time to prepare the opinion, Rwanda News Agency quoted Rwandan
Foreign Minister Augustin Iyamuremye as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is to close down a number of its foreign missions to cut
 down growing expenditures, said the minister, noting that
Rwanda's foreign missions are run on a total budget of 2.3 billion
RWF (about 6.1 million U. S. dollars), which is still inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot close an embassy all of a sudden, " he said. "There
are some people who cannot believe it is really because of
financial problems that such a move was taken."
</P>
<P>
According to official sources from the Ministry of Finance,
the move to shut down some of these missions is a result of
increasing pressure from the donor community.
</P>
<P>
"The decision followed mounting pressure by the donor community
on Rwanda to cut down unnecessary expenditures," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Iyamuremye said some of the countries in the Great Lakes region
will be closed, leaving only one or two in operation according to
Rwanda's economical and political interest.
</P>
<P>
He said other African missions that will face closure include
those located in Tripoli, Libya and Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But those important embassies to Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and
South Africa will remain operational.
</P>
<P>
The representation to Japan will also be shut down for its high
cost of living.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the Rwandan embassy in Paris and the diplomatic
representation in Geneva will also be closed.
</P>
<P>
The war-torn African country will continue to operate its
missions in Brussels, Rome, Luxembourg and Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In America, the missions to the United Nations, the United
States and Ottawa will not be affected.

d'Ivore would not enjoy any support from Ghana or any other West

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Condemns Coup in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Tuesday condemned the military take-over
in Cote d'Ivoire, describing it as a threat to peace, stability
and democracy, according to a report by Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to end his one day visit to the country,
Malian president and current Chairman of ECOWAS Alfa Omar Konare
said "we do not agree to the coup and we condemn it."
</P>
<P>
Konare was in the country to discuss issues of common concern
to the two countries and ECOWAS with Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to Ghana was also to tap ideas from Rawlings
"whose personal commitment and support for peace, unity and
democracy in Africa during his tenure as ECOWAS Chairman is a
great lesson to us all."
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS is closely monitoring the current situation in Cote
d'Ivoire and will respond appropriately after the foreign
ministers of the Community conclude a meeting in the Malian
capital Bamako on Thursday, Konare said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Guei, former Defense Minister of Cote d'Ivoire last
Thursday led a military coup that toppled the government of Henri
Konan Bedie who ruled the country after the death of President
Felix Boigny.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that President Bedie's attempt to prevent his
main political rival, Alhassane Ouattara, from contesting in next
year's presidential elections, might have sparked the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Abidjan is of great concern to the stability
of the region," Konare said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Chairman said the events leading to the coup in Cote
d'Ivoire must be a lesson to all in the region, stressing that
good working methods must be introduced in government.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings noted that the situation in Cote d'Ivoire is not
surprising. " We picked up information from sources in that
country which suggested an uncertain situation".
</P>
<P>
"We therefore made efforts at the last ECOWAS Summit in Lome
to prevent the potential danger by advising President Bedie, but
he assured us that those issues were purely legal and not
political which could be solved internally," he said.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the military take-over, saying "we should do well
to handle the situation in such a way that it would not
degenerate."
</P>
<P>
He welcome the new military leaders of Cote d'Ivoire to any
discussion, noting that "if we want a peaceful solution to the
problem, we must strive not to avoid them completely."

<HEADLINE> Somali Regions Ban Outwards Coal Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The administration of
Somalia's Bay and Bakol regions has issued a ban on transporting
coal out of the regions, effective from the New Year's Day of
2000.
</P>
<P>
The decree signed by the chairman of the Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA), Colonel Hassan Mohamed Nur Shargudud, said Tuesday
that the vehicles and the heavy duty trucks transporting coal to
capital Mogadishu or elsewhere will be confiscated by the RRA
authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Nur Aden Nur, secretary of the RRA in Baidoa town,
the decree also prohibits the cutting of the firewood exported as
coal to the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
The RRA official said that any one who is caught for cutting
firewood or transporting coal out of Bay and Bakol will be
arrested and tried before a court.
</P>
<P>
Bay and Bakol are the main coa-producing regions of the Horn of
Africa country. Most Somali families use coal to cook their
meals.
</P>
<P>
The coal loaded on large trucks is being exported in the
natural port of El-Ma'an to the Gulf countries, making the price
of the coal 100 percent more expensive than before.
</P>
<P>
Each sack of the coal used to be sold at about 20,000 Somali
shillings (one U.S. dollar equalsery long coastal lines of
Somalia accompanied by the lack of central authority since 1991,
it is extremely difficult to control the exportation or
importation of all kinds of contrabands.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Economy to Face Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- An international commercial
bank has warned that Zimbabwe's economy could be slipping into a
recession unless critical measures are implemented.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic bulletin released here on Wednesday,
Barclays Bank said the country's economy stumbled badly in the
last quarter of this year, eroding substantial progress made
during the past six months beginning from March.
</P>
<P>
"GDP growth has fallen to around zero this year, and may turn
negative next year, depending on how the response to this crisis
is managed," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the elapsing year has seen Zimbabwe's
economy characterized by high inflation, high budget deficit,
serious foreign currency shortage and punitive interest rates, all
militating against meaningful growth.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates are now peaked at more than 60 percent while
the inflation stands at 61.2 percent for the country, the bank
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the country's prospects for access to
foreign capital next year have deteriorated as a result of the
present stand-off between the government and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"What is critical now, if the economy is to avoid falling
further into the grip of stagflation, is to achieve a unified
approach to foreign exchange, monetary and fiscal management, "
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation address recently, President Robert
Mugabe also acknowledged that the country's poor economic
performance had posed a major challenge to the government.

<P>
LUANDA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government troops have
expelled the rebels out of the city of Catabola in the central
Uige Province, consolidating the guarded areas in the central

</P>
<P>
It is the second city seized by the government troops in the "

local analysts.
</P>
<P>
According to a military source, the rebels were smashed by the

Catabola, 45 kilometers northeast of Kuito, capital of the Uige
Province.

ADDIS ABABA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 994,000 people
in Somali State, Ethiopia, are in need of emergency food aid
following months of drought in the region, local authorities said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The worsening drought has forced the residents of Gode, Denane,
Adedele and Imi to flee their homes, officials of the state's
Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Committee said.
</P>
<P>
The drought has triggered an acute shortage of drinking water
in some regions of the state, the committee said, noting that the
local people were exposed to water-borne diseases as they were
compelled to drink polluted water.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the drought has turned worse because of armyworm and
quella-quella infestation, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chief of the State Administration Mohammed Mealin
Ali, some 70,000 quintals of relief food from the central
government have been distributed to disaster victims.

LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A four-member Nigerian
delegation has left Abuja to join their Ghanaian counterparts for
a five-nation visit to seek support for a new initiative to
accelerate the regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The joint delegation is scheduled to visit Sierra Leone, Guinea,

</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Nigerian Minister of Co-operation and
Integration in Africa Jerry Gana would brief officials of these
countries on the "Nigeria/Ghana strategic alliance," which was

<P>
Under the alliance, both countries agreed to adopt the "fast
track approach", which was proposed by Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo to the 22nd summit of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) in Togo.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Obasanjo suggested the adoption of a dual
approach to the implementation of ECOWAS programs, which had
lagged behind because of slow ratification and bureaucracy in
member states.
</P>
<P>
He said the "fast track" and a slower approach would enable
member states of the 16-member organization to implement their
programs at their own pace.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Nigeria and Ghana have reached an agreement on the
creation of a single monetary and economic zone, and the joint
delegation will solicit the participation of these countries in

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- After 20 years as general
manager, coach and then president of the NBA's Utah Jazz, Frank
Layden is retiring.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to know when to pack it in," Layden, 67, said
Tuesday. "When you get to my age, time is precious."
</P>
<P>
Layden was 277-294 in six-plus seasons with Utah, turning the
Jazz into a playoff contender. Layden's retirement is Utah's third
front-office departure this year, following son Scott's move to
become the New York Knicks' General Manager and Tim Howells'
resignation last week to run a restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the passion I used to have," Layden said. "So I
must be doing this at the right time."
</P>
<P>
Layden plans to write a book and spend more time with his
family and wife.

<HEADLINE> South Passage of Second Euro-Asia Continental Bridge Expected to Open (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
URUMQI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's experts in railway
construction said here today that after the Nanjiang Railway in
northwest China was put into operation, the south passage of the
second Euro-Asia continental bridge is expected to open soon.
</P>
<P>
The passage starts from east China's Lianyungang port, and
goes west to Kashi, a key city in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, then extends to Uzbekistan and joins the
railway network in central and southern Europe, said Xiong Chunfan,
chief engineer of the First Survey and Design Institute of the
Ministry of Railways, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Xiong said that the new railway, which passes through China's
11 provinces and autonomous region, as well as Turkey, Greece and
Italy, will become a shortcut connecting east Asia, the near East
and south Europe, and should help improve their trading.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have pointed out that opening the south passage is in
line with the Chinese government's strategy to develop the west;
it will also speed the opening up of the inland and deepen the
political and economic relationship between China and its
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Grows 7.1 Percent This Year (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBS figures show that total added value registered by SOEs and
large-scale non-government-run industrial enterprises reached 2,
020 billion yuan this year, nine percent more than last year. The
added value of the country's industry totaled 3,485 billion yuan,
up 8.8 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the policies the Chinese government adopted to
encourage export and to the recovery of southeast Asian economies,
China's exports are expected to grow by six percent over last year
to 195 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though the growth is a far cry from the double-digit growth in
the early 1990s, it is much higher than the expected zero-growth
at the beginning of the year. The growth came from the second half
of the year only.
</P>
<P>
Imports are expected to be 165 billion US dollars for the year,
increasing 16 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the year, government investment has remained a major force
propelling economic growth in spite of negatives such as
inadequate investment and consumption demand, growing employment
pressure, diminishing increase of income for rural residents and
irrational structure of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has issued 160 billion yuan-worth of
additional treasury bonds to fund infrastructure construction and
technological upgrading over the past two years. The move helped
to drive total investment in fixed assets to over 2,200 billion
yuan this year, 7.8 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, prices continued to fall while income of residents
kept on rising. The NBS says that the retail price index (RPI)
fell 2.9 percent from last year and the consumer price index (CPI)
dropped 1.3 percent. Per capita income of urban residents is
expected to rise to 5,859 yuan, 9.3 percent higher than last year.
Per capita income of rural residents is expected to reach 2,205
yuan, four percent higher than last year.

<HEADLINE> China's GDP Grows 7.1 Percent This Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 7.1 percent this year, higher than the 7 percent target
set at the beginning of the year, official sources announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said this morning
that the GDP reached 8,319 billion yuan (about 1,002 billion U.S.
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
According to NBS figures, the primary industry grew by 2.8
percent over last year, with total added value of 1,440.5 billion
yuan. The secondary industry jumped 8.5 percent, with total added
value of 4,076.3 billion yuan. The tertiary industry grew by 6.9
percent, with total added value of 2,802.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Progress in reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), increase
in exports and investment in fixed assets have all contributed to
the steady growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the Chinese government has
taken a series of determined steps to turn around money-losing
SOEs, including swapping debts of the enterprises for shares of
banks. These measures promoted a 61 percent jump in net profits of
the SOEs as a whole and helped reduce the losses of the slumping
enterprises by 12.8 percent for the first 11 months of the year.
Net profits of all SOEs soared to 182.6 billion yuan in the period.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, which the Chinese government has picked
as the spot to make breakthroughs in reversing the losses of SOEs,
achieved the goal a year ahead of schedule. From January to
November, the industry as a whole turned out net profits of 116
million yuan, ending a five-year profit-losing streak.
</P>
<P>
Other industries such as building materials and nonferrous
metallurgy also made remarkable progress in reducing losses and
increasing profits.

<HEADLINE> South Passage of Second Euro-Asia Continental Bridge Expected to Open (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
According to Xiong, there is still a gap along the passage --
the planned China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan international railway --
and the three countries have signed an agreement to build it.
</P>
<P>
The 577-km railway, begins from China's Kashi and runs through
Kyrgyzstan and ends in Uzbekistan, a length of about 485
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Asia continental bridge, which is in fact a railway
transport system across Europe and Asia, connects the Atlantic and
the Pacific and significantly shortens the transportation distance.
</P>
<P>
The first continental bridge between Russia's port in the Far
East and north Europe in England opened in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The north passage of the second bridge, the longest
continental bridge in the world, connecting the Lianyungang port
and the Netherlands's city of Rotterdam, was put into use in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, a speedy detour is still needed for cargo transport
between China and south Europe, which can't meet the fast-
developing demand of international trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, which are not satisfied
with the current inefficient transportation system that links them
with China, are urging that a new international railway be built,
said Xiong.

countries and peoples for a world of peace and prosperity,
cooperation and development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remarks this evening at
a New Year's reception in honor of diplomatic envoys,
representatives of international organizations and their families
living in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will continue to follow the reform and

peace, further strengthen unity and cooperation with developing
countries, and promote good-neighborly relations with its
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
China is eager to develop friendship and cooperation with all
other countries based on the five principles of peaceful co-
existence, and will work harder to establish an equitable and
rational world order in the political and economic arenas, he

Tang called 1999 historically significant for China, saying
that China has scored remarkable achievements in wide-ranging
areas under the collective leadership of the third generation with
President Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
He said that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the People
's Republic of China, and the Chinese government resumed the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, marking another
milestone on the road toward the complete reunification of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> Leading Scholar Predicts Prospects of Next Century's Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A revolution in medical
treatment and agricultural production will take place in the 21st
century, and man may start searching for more viable solutions to
the increasing demand for energy, says a leading Chinese scholar.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
, said major scientific achievements in the 21st century will be
concentrated in sectors of information, life science, new
materials, manufacturing technology and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"Since the large-scale human genome (genetic code) project is
likely to be completed at the beginning of the next century,
revolutionary breakthroughs will be made in medical treatment and
new drug development," Lu said at a meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The international collaboration to decode the 3 billion code
letters that make up the whole human genetic code will finally
provide new insights into the way genes are arranged along a
strand of DNA and how they might be controlled, paving the way for
profound advances in medical diagnosis and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Lu believes the research of the brain and nervous system may
gradually uncover the mystery of the human mind, which in turn
means breakthroughs in development of human intelligence and
computer science.
</P>
<P>
Using high-efficiency coal-burning technology and safer nuclear
power technology, human beings can solve the energy problem more
properly, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"For China, one key challenge in the next century is to foster
more scientists while improving the overall quality of its
population," he said, affirming that the CAS would play a leading
role in these fields.

BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Guo Dongpo, director of the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, issued a
New Year's message for overseas Chinese today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the year 1999 has been significant for China
because it was the year the country celebrated its 50th
anniversary and embraced Macao's return -- two events which
greatly inspired overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The director highly praised the contributions from overseas
Chinese to China's economic and social development. They have
helped to promote the friendship, cooperation and exchange between
China and the countries where they live.
</P>
<P>
They have also played an important role in promoting China's
reunification, denouncing the U.S.-led NATO bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia, refuting Lee Tenghui's "two states"
statement and criticizing the Falun Gong cult organization.
</P>
<P>
Guo said the plan for his office in the next year is to promote
education on Chinese among overseas Chinese and further support
enterprises run by them.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the new millennium will bring both
challenges and opportunities, and that the Chinese people together
with the overseas Chinese will build a more prosperous country.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks, credit
cooperatives and post offices will suspend their banking and
savings business on December 31, the People's Bank of China (PBOC)
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The move is in conjunction with the New Year's Day arrangement

<HEADLINE> Trial of Quack Doctor Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A local court in central
China today held the first hearing on a highly-publicized case of
unauthorized medical treatment, in which three people died after
taking home-made remedies dosed out by a self-proclaimed healer.
</P>
<P>
Hu Wanlin was accused of conducting illegal medical practice in
two hospitals in 1997 and 1998. Three of his patients died after
their conditions worsened as a result of taking Hu's prescription,
which was mixed with the mineral salt "mirabilite," according to
the prosecutors with the People's Procuratorate of Shangqiu City,
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Hu's case has attracted nationwide attention because in the
past he was regarded as a miracle-worker by some of his patients,
who claimed that he had cured their chronic ailments.
</P>
<P>
His "medical miracles" were lavishly praised by well-known
novelist Ke Yunlu, but were widely denounced by many leading
scientists and the mass media.
</P>
<P>
But the miracles ended after the 56-year-old Hu, who has a
primary school education, was arrested in January of this year. He
was charged with illegal medical practice, which caused the deaths
of the three people.
</P>
<P>
The hearing at the Intermediate People's Court of Shangqiu is
scheduled to continue.
</P>
<P>
China has long been familiar with unauthorized medical practice,
even though the country has established and improved medical and
legal systems in the past decades that have helped fight against
quacks.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb the illegal practice, the nation is setting up
a medical licensing system under which only licensed doctors are
allowed to treat patients.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Chinese who passed a national medical examination
this year are expected to become China's first group of licensed
doctors.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Chairs Meeting on Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
chaired the fifth meeting of the country's leading group for
scientific and technological education today.
</P>
<P>
Science and Technology Minister Zhu Lilan and Chen Jia'er,
chairman of the council of the National Natural Science Foundation,
briefed the group on the work of their departments.
</P>
<P>
The group discussed and approved a framework for reforms on
research institutions of science and technology which are
affiliated with the central government and other departments.
</P>
<P>
It also talked over the work of the National Natural Science
Foundation in the promotion of basic scientific research and
pushing forward scientific and technological breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed that more should be done to deepen reforms
of management of the science and technology research institutes.
</P>
<P>
Those institutes engaged in applied science and technology
research should be partly or wholly transformed into enterprises
or agencies; doing so would make the most of these resources and
speed up the commercialization of scientific achievements, the
meeting noted.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to build up systems that are conducive to
the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Trade Anticipates Further Pick-up in 2000 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's merchandise
exports in 2000 will show significant improvement from the
sluggish performance in 1999 with an estimated rise by around six
percent in both nominal and real terms, a senior trade and
development official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the prospect of decent global growth, Hong Kong's
recovery is expected to gather further momentum in 2000," Michael
C. C. Sze, executive director of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
With domestic exports projected to moderate from the declines
in 1999 to pose a fall of three percent, the outlook for re-
exports will be more optimistic in anticipation of further pick-up
in export processing activities on the Chinese mainland amid the
continued recuperation in intra-regional trade, and persistent
demand from industrial countries, Sze said.
</P>
<P>
Mirroring largely an expected resurgence in re-export
activities and a recovery in domestic demand, Sze said, the value
of imports is also projected to surge by eight percent with import
volume to increase by seven percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, the marked stabilization of macro-economic
fundamentals and restoration of financial and trade activities in
the once crisis-hit Asian economies is perhaps the most eye-
catching development in this region in 1999," Sze said.
</P>
<P>
Figures recently released by the Census and Statistics
Department showed that Hong Kong's total exports continued to
accelerate in growth in November, for five months in a row since
July this year, with a 10.3 percent increase in the value of total
exports in November over the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Sze attributed the steady increase in Hong Kong's trade to the
encouraging external economic environment, such as U.S. soft
landing with continually healthy consumer spending, EU 's stronger
non-inflationary economic upturn and Asian economic recovery. (

<P>
Along with the brightening global trade environment, another
positive development is the constructive trade and investment
sentiment engendered by the China-U.S. accord sought in November
1999 with respect to China's accession to the WTO, Sze said.
</P>
<P>
"These developments will have positive impact on the
merchandise and service exports from Hong Kong next year, though
major benefits emanating from China's liberalization of its trade
regime will likely materialize in years further ahead," Sze noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Sze pointed out that the trade environment next year
will remain formidable amid intensifying competition from various
fronts, leaving little ground for complacency.
</P>
<P>
According to Sze, competition in the U.S. and EU markets and in
the market of the rest of Asia will be more intense, and
competition, along with the increased direct sourcing in the
mainland by foreign companies will pose further challenges to Hong
Kong traders.
</P>
<P>
A number of measures will be taken by his department to cope
with new changes and challenges in world's market, Sze said.
</P>
<P>
Included are freezing the charge of services, setting up a
special trade web-site on Internet, establishing special clients
departments, expansion of the market share and services for Hong
Kong products in Japan and China's mainland, and organizing more
relevant exhibitions and seminars.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite optimistic about the future of Hong Kong's trade
and our current recovery trend will continue next year since we
have seen a very good sign showing a continuing economic growth in
the United States, and a steady recovery in Japan, South Korea and
Southeast Asia," Sze concluded.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wen
Jiabao has stressed that the construction industry should seize
current opportunities, deepen reforms and strive for better work
performance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a recent national meeting on construction, Wen said
that the country's policy of expanding domestic demand and
speeding up infrastructure construction creates opportunities for
the whole industry.
</P>
<P>
Wen noted that first of all, the industry should ably manage
the housing construction projects in urban areas and contribute to
housing reform.
</P>
<P>
Second, the industry should put more emphasis on construction
quality, which is of paramount significance since it relates
directly to people's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Third, it is essential to continue the reforms, and thereby
straighten out the construction market. More efforts must be made
to waylay corruption and embezzlement in the construction sector,
Wen said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also asked the construction industry to
strengthen internal reforms and management and constantly improve
their building quality, economic performance and competitiveness.

Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Tuesday handed over the remains of two Hezbollah
fighters who were killed in a battle with South Lebanon Army forces

<HEADLINE> Turkey Draws up Tourism Plan for New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has drawn up an ambitious
project to boost the country's tourism industry for the first 10
years of the 21st century, Turkish Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Turkish Tourism Project for 2010", prepared by the Turkish
Tourism Investors Association (TYD), is targeted at increasing
guest capacity to one million beds and the number of visitors to 25
million by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to bring 20 billion U.S. dollars of
tourism revenue to the state treasury, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the private sector is expected to provide 8
million dollars of the 9 million dollars needed to initiate the
project and the state will undertake the rest.
</P>
<P>
The project has now been presented to the President's Office,
the Grand National Assembly (parliament)and the government.
</P>
<P>
Once the program takes effect, Turkey's share in the world
tourism market may grow from the current 1.9 percent to 2.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The project also outlined measures to rejuvenate certain tourism
facilities which hold the Tourism Ministry's certifications for 9
to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are to be made to draw investments in sports and
entertainment facilities, aimed at alluring tourists and
stimulating additional tourist spending.
</P>
<P>
Investments in tourism promotion, marketing and in other crucial
infrastructure will also receive attention.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's tourism industry, a major foreign currency earner of
the country, has been hit hard in 1999 due to disastrous
earthquakes in August and November which claimed the lives of more
than 18,000 people.
</P>
<P>
However, tourism experts here expressed confidence that the
coming new year will see improvement in Turkey's tourism sector
performance thanks to Turkey's candidacy status in the European
Union, a booming economy and increased political stability.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the years after 2001 will be the golden age of
tourism in Turkey. This will come true on the condition that
everything goes according to the plan," said Unal Oger, deputy CEO
of the Oger Tours, one of Turkey's most successful tour operators.

<HEADLINE> Barak Settles Coalition Crisis With Shas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 29 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak secured a safe majority for the 2000 state budget Tuesday
night, after he and the Finance Ministry agreed to meet a
substantial portion of financial demands raised by coalition
partner Shas.
</P>
<P>
Shas, which has 17 seats of the 120-member Knesset (parliament),
retracted Tuesday night its resignation from the coalition after
the Treasury agreed to cover the majority of the debt built up by
the party's educational system.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shas also succeeded in obtaining a few hundred million
more shekels for welfare-related expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Shas threatened to resign from Barak's coalition on Monday when
the Knesset started its debate on the state budget, saying Shas
will leave the government unless its budget demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who had asked Shas to have a 24-hour delay for submitting
its resignation, held several urgent meetings with Shas leaders
since Monday and ordered the Finance Ministry to settle Shas's
budget demands.
</P>
<P>
Shas Knesset members joined the coalition Tuesday night in
backing the budgetary arrangement bill, which accompanies the next
year's national spending package.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary arrangement bill was voted on clause by clause.
The voting, which lasted till small hours Wednesday, went mainly
along the expected lines. Coalition partners Meretz, the Center
Party, and the National Religious Party backed the bill along with
Shas.
</P>
<P>
But, another coalition partner, the Yisrael Ba'aliya which has
six Knesset members, refused to give a full backing of the bill.
Its leader Interior Minister Natan Sharansky and three other
members did not cast their votes in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The party is fighting against Barak's plan to remove powers
from the Interior Ministry to establish a new national planning
body in the prime minister's Office, while demanding for 0.3
billion U.S.dollars for public housing, immigrant absorption and
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset debate on the state budget is still going on and a
final voting is schedueled Thursday night. With Shas's support, the
budget will have no problem in getting approval of the Knesset.

NICOSIA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of Cyprus has
approved new regulations on levying tax on profits from investments
in the Cyprus Stock Exchange, local reports said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After one-day-long discussions behind closed doors, deputies on

Gains over this amount will be taxed with five percent for
natural persons and between 20 and 25 percent for legal persons.

that market profits will be tax-free and a tax of 0.6 percent will
be imposed on transactions of natural persons and one percent on
those of legal persons.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will also discuss what was described as a very
complicated issue of capital gains taxation at a later date.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Make More Efforts for Afghan Peace, FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran plans to dedicate more
efforts to the strained peace process in Afghanistan following the
recent contacts with Tehran by rival Afghan groups, Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement quoted by the Islamic Republic News
Agency on Wednesday, Kharrazi said Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has instructed the foreign ministry to come up with
necessary plans in order to solve the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry plans to take action in line with
Khatami's instructions by contacting the belligerent parties in
Afghanistan, its neighboring countries, the United Nations, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and other interested
countries, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tehran made the decision in line with the proposals
raised by Pakistani and Afghan officials, OIC Secretary General
Ezeddine Laraki.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Chief Executive visited Tehran earlier this month,
assuring cooperation with Iran in the Afghan peace process.
Musharraf was followed by Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
whose government was ousted by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban
militia.

the situation in Afghanistan and underlined the necessity to see
into the unpleasant situation of the people!!in Afghanistan and to
cure some of the pains and sufferings experienced by the Afghan

<HEADLINE> TB:hke122903 -- Yearender: 1999, Year of Dramatic Change in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- 1999 is a year of dramatic
change in the Indian political arena.
</P>
<P>
The year witnessed the fall of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-
led coalition government by a single vote in Lok Sabha (the lower
house of the parliament) in April as the BJP's major ally AIADMK
withdrew support to it.
</P>
<P>
However, the year also saw the BJP bounce back to power in
October at the head of the 24-party National Democratic Alliance (
NDA) in the 13th Lok Sabha polls.
</P>
<P>
The Lok Sabha polls, held in September and October after the
two-month Kargil conflict, which broke out in late May between
India and Pakistan, changed the political map of India.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, which bagged 182 seats in Lok Sabha, the same as in
the 1998 elections, has emerged as the single largest political
party in the country, thus enabling it to expand its political and
geographical base.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party, which obtained only 113 seats in Lok Sabha
as against 141 in 1998, suffered the most serious defeat in its
history and is unlikely to recover in the near future.
</P>
<P>
But, to some political observers, the real winner of the polls
was some local political parties, which gained more seats in Lok
Sabha and will play a positive role in the national and regional
political stage in the future.
</P>
<P>
With a comfortable majority of 306 seats in the 543-member Lok
Sabha, the NDA government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee could stay in power longer than the previous government,
which survived for just 13 months.
</P>
<P>
Since it came to power on October 13, the new government
initiated India's second generation of economic reform in a bid to
boost the country's annual growth rate to between 7 and 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of economic reform, which started in 1991,
lifted the country's growth rate to over 7 percent in the 1994-95,
1995-96 and 1996-97 fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the financial crisis in Asia and political
instability in the country, economic growth slowed down to 5
percent and 6 percent in 1997 and 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
To make up for the lost time, the new government cleared the
long-pending insurance liberalization, Patents Act and Companies
Act amendments and new laws on money laundering and foreign
exchange management, all in the space of only a few weeks in
December.
</P>
<P>
It has also introduced the first-ever law to regulate the cyber
sector and set up the Ministry of Information Technology (IT) in
an effort to build India into an IT superpower in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with clear signs of recovery in industrial
production and exports, India's economy is picking up and showing
a sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) increased by 5.5 percent in the first
quarter (April-July) of the 1999-2000 fiscal year.

...the country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 5.5
percent in the first quarter (April-July) of the 1999-2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
India's industry grew by an impressive 6.9 percent in the first
seven months (April-October) of the current fiscal year, as
against 3.4 percent during the same period of the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports stood at 20.75 billion U.S. dollars
during the same period, up 10.2 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Since October 13, the government has cleared 131 proposals of
foreign direct investment, involving 80.23 billion rupees (1.87
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In one year, the Sensex Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange shot
up by over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
And more good news was in store for the country. On December 8,
its 21 stock exchanges registered a record turnover of 3.5 billion
dollars with 300 million shares changing hands, which was an
excellent performance, considering the fact that the New York
Stock Exchange, the mecca of the financial world, transacts 150
million shares worth 5 billion dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said India's economy is already
showing signs of a revival, with all macroeconomic indicators
pointing toward a rebound.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the country will witness a growth rate of
between 6.5 and 7 percent by the end of the current fiscal year as
against 6 percent recorded during the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinha said that the fiscal situation continues to
remain tight with the huge burden of defense payments, police
establishments and food and fertilizer subsidies and that the
government is making every effort to control expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit for the first half of the current fiscal
year was 60 billion rupees (1.4 billion dollars), less than the
corresponding period last year. But it covered 66 percent of the
budget estimate as against 64 percent recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international rating agency Moody's Investor Service
expressed confidence in the new Indian government, which it said
has a fresh opportunity to undertake market-oriented adjustments
at the start of an apparently longer term in office.
</P>
<P>
More and more foreign investors now hold a positive outlook on
India as they perceive a return to political stability in the
country and a commitment on the part of the government to continue
with and expand on the reform process.
</P>
<P>
As the year 1999 is drawing to its end, Indians, buoyed by
political stability and sustained economic growth, will usher in
the new millennium on a note of optimism.

ongoing crisis which has been adversely affecting their businesses
and life over the past two years.

and a new dream will come," a young woman said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transportation Agum Gumelar hoped Indonesia would
overcome the deepest economic crisis and start developing again in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"I want Indonesia to be freed from the protracted monetary and
political crisis so that we can start development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gumelar, who is also chief of the Y2K task force, hoped that
Indonesia could roll over smoothly into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in the business sector, many hoped that in the next
millennium, the economy will recover so that unemployment could be
eased.
</P>
<P>
"This year, business is still gloomy. I hope that in the next
millennium, the prospect (of business) will be brighter. I am
ready to work hard in the next millennium," a businessman said.
</P>
<P>
The new millennium is however expected to bring new hope and
new dreams as well as new challenges for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
And the nation seems ready to take the challenges.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Investment Expected to Recover in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Investment in Indonesia, both
domestic and foreign, is predicted to recover in 2000, the
National Investment Board (BKPM) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 2000 will be determined as Indonesia's Investment
Year," Deputy Chairman of BKPM Andung Nitimihardjo told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said investment in the country in 2000 will keep rising. "
But we don't know how much the number (of the increasing) will be.
But I think it (value of investment) will be greater than the
current year, may be two-fold compared with the value of 1999
investment," Nitimihardjo added.
</P>
<P>
He said he was optimistic over the target. "In addition
President Abdurrahman Wahid will visit foreign countries in the
near future. This move will be good to boost investment in the
country."
</P>
<P>
Nitimihardjo added that the government of Indonesia had been
reviewing all the regulations particularly those governing foreign
direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"We will ease any constraints in the regulation systems, so
that foreign investors will easily come and invest in Indonesia,"
he said, adding that investment is a backbone of the country's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Based on a BKPM report, the value of foreign investment in 1999
was 10.6 billion U.S. dollars, down 22.1 percent from the previous
year, when foreign investment was worth 13.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This was caused by the political situation in Indonesia which
is not stable yet," He said.

JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku province, entered its fourth day Wednesday,
with the death toll climbing to 63 and the wounded to more than
150,according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Offices, shops and markets stayed closed as smoke rose in
several parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Sangaji Street became a "war zone." Warring parties, carrying
crude homemade weapons, set up barricades in their areas, Antara
said,adding that military personnel met difficulties in containing
the riot.

Sunday's clash erupted after a young Muslim teenager was hit by
a Christian driver. The incident sparked another round of bloody
clashes as the Silo church -- the largest in the city -- was
burned down later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has been the site of bloody communal violence since the
beginning of the year, and more than 800 people have died so far.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Condemns Hijacking of Indian Airplane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh on Wednesday strongly
condemned the hijacking of an aircraft of the Indian Airlines and
hoped that the ordeal of the passengers would soon be over without
further loss of life, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Indian counterpart, Jaswant Singh,
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad said Bangladesh was
"shocked and gravely concerned by the hijacking of the Indian
Airlines flight that has already caused the death of an innocent
passenger."
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh unequivocally condemns all such acts of terrorism
and hopes that the continuing ordeal of the passengers will come
to an end quickly without any further loss of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the Bangladeshi people "share the anguish" of the
Indian people and reiterated the country's "assurance of full
cooperation in combating terrorism so that this sinister threat to
civil society is eradicated."
</P>
<P>
An A-300 aircraft with 160 passengers of the Indian Airlines
was hijacked last Friday during a flight from the Nepalese capital
Kathmandu to India's capital New Delhi. The plane is now staying
in Afghanistan and negotiations to end the crisis have started
between the hijackers and the Indian authorities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sustains 4.1b U.S. Dollars Losses in Reforestation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Based on the report issued by the Ernest and Young auditor,
there is an indication that the country missed a chance to get
reforestation fund amounting to 4.1 billion U.S. dollars. It means
we sustained a loss of 4.1 billion U.S. dollars for inefficiency
in the collecting of the reforestation fund," Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance, and Industry Kwik Kian Gie told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Ernest and Young is an international auditor which had been
conducting an 'efficiency audit' into the country's reforestation
fund.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the country's reforestation fund as of
December 1999 reached 4.1 trillion rupiah (0.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The calculation of the loss was based on the assumption that
during April 1, 1993 to March 31, 1998, the crop of Indonesia's
wood production reached 60 cubic meters a hectare, with recovery
rate of 70 percent, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"That figure (crop of wood production) is different with the
benchmark used by Department of Forestry of Indonesia which said
that wood production reached (only) 35 cubic meters a hectare with
recovery rate of 56 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the auditor would launch an investigative
audit, if there were indication of corruption.
</P>
<P>
There are three kinds of audit namely, efficiency audit,
financial audit and investigative audit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kwik Kian Gie also said that PT PLN (a state-run
electric power company) suffered a financial loss of 5.3 trillion
rupiah (0.7 billion dollars) for its inefficiency.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Appreciates Taliban Role in Handling Hijacking Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Coordinator for
Afghanistan Eric de Mul Wednesday appreciated the role of the
Afgha Taliban in handling the situation caused by the hijacking of
an Indian Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media here at the U.N. office, De Mul said that "
the Taliban have been dealing with the situation in a wise manner.
"
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the on-going talks between the hijackers and the
Indian team would lead to "a successful end."
</P>
<P>
De Mul that the Taliban authorities were very cooperative and
wanted to see a quick end to the hijacking as they have already
taken the stance not to allow any untoward incident on their
territory.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said the hijackers speak English and Urdu and
their identification could only be ascertained by those who have
been in direct dialogue with them.
</P>
<P>
"I would not speculate on their identity," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian team continues its negotiation with the hijackers
and is hopeful of its early success," the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he cannot speculate about the time frame as
the dialogue is continuing.
</P>
<P>
To another query, he said, the talks between the Indian team
and the hijackers were being conducted through walkie talkie.
</P>
<P>
They have had three to four rounds of talks with the hijackers
by now, he added.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about the demands by the hijackers, De
Mul said their demands have been conveyed to the Indian
authorities through different channels.
</P>
<P>
Asked if India was ready to accept their demands, he said, it
was not for him to say something on it.
</P>
<P>
He said," although one could not exclude possibility of some
untoward incident but the good news was that the hijackers Tuesday
morning had allowed the supply of water and food in the plane
which they had refused earlier.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of storming of the plane and
whether the Taliban had troops, he said in his view the Taliban
have troops and weapons for storming the plane if warranted by the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines plane, Airbus-300, was hijacked last Friday
afternoon during a flight from Kathmandu, Nepal to New Delhi. It
had already landed at the Lahore airport, Pakistan and a military
base in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane still with more than 150 people on board
landed at the Kandahar airport, southern Afghanistan, last
Saturday morning and has been there for the fifth day. The
hijackers had already released 28 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The facilities at the Kandahar airport are limited and only a
group of the Taliban are involved to handle the situation, De Mul
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had even made arrangements for
shelter because if there was some breakthrough there must be
arrangements to provide passengers with initial assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) -- About 7.9 million people in
Thailand are living below the poverty line, accounting for 13
percent of the country's total population, the National Economic
and Social Development Board (NESDB) said in a news letter,
obtained by Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million people were dragged into poverty after the
financial crisis broke out in mid-1997, NESDB, a government
planning body, said in the news letter.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 percent of those living in the Northeast are below the
poverty line, making the region the poorest in Thailand, the news
letter said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila to Build First Sanitary Landfill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
set the bidding for the country's first sanitary landfill for
Metro Manila's garbage in January 2000, a top official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Aventajado, chairman of the presidential committee on
flagship programs and projects, said in a statement that the
landfill will replace a poorly-built and technically unsound
dumpsite which will be closed before the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado pointed out that the eight-year old San Mateo
dumpsite in Rizal province has limited disposal capacity to
accommodate thousands of tons of waste from Metro Manila, capital
of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The first landfill project must be ready to accept garbage by
December 2000. We will guarantee the delivery of at least 2,000
tons of garbage a day to the first landfill project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, who also chairs the Greater Metropolitan Manila
Solid Waste Management Committee (GMMSWMC), said the sanitary
landfill must have a capacity of 50 million cubic meters to
accommodate garbage from Metro Manila and adjoining provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to Aventajado, the GMMSWMC has already identified
sites in the provinces of Zambales, Bataan, Laguna and Cavite as
possible sanitary landfills.
</P>
<P>
The San Mateo dumpsite was build in 1989 and became operational
in 1991. In July this year, local officials and residents of Rizal
province opposed the continued use of the facility.
</P>
<P>
But later they agreed to allow further disposal of garbage in
the site until December 31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Logistics Industry Urged to Advance Competencies for E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior trade officer of
Singapore has urged his country's logistics companies to advance
their competencies through application of IT and leverage on
opportunities offered by e-commerce in a bid to position Singapore
as a general logistics hub with leading edge capability.
</P>
<P>
Commenting at a press conference Wednesday on the next frontier
for Singapore's logistics, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) David Chin said as e-
commerce is the latest buzzword in the global logistics industry,
Singapore should not adopt its traditional approach of providing
logistics services while TDB will ensure that Singapore Logistics
companies leverage on the opportunities offered by e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Given the increasing important role that e-commerce will play
in the business world, he said, TDB recognizes that e-commerce is
the key for Singapore to become a premiere integrated transport
and logistics hub and will place its main emphasis on ensuring the
adoption of e-commerce as the critical enabling tool for the
logistics industry in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Citing a prediction made by the Gartner Group, Chin said
business-to-business e-commerce within the Asia-Pacific will soar
from 18 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 272 billion dollars in
2003, accounting 20 percent of the world's e-commerce market, and
Singapore will witness annual growth of 110 percent for indirect
business-to-business e-commerce and 70 percent for direct business-
to-business e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Underlining logistics will be a key supporting infrastructure
for the successful development of e-commerce in Singapore as well
as the region, Chin said TDB will be gearing up its efforts to
encourage local logistics players to harness the use of IT to
enhance their logistics competencies.
</P>
<P>
Singapore aims to position itself at the forefront of the
industry in the world and become a premiere integrated transport
and logistics hub.
</P>
<P>
A multi-agency Steering Committee on Logistics, chaired by TDB,
has completed a Logistics Masterplan which focuses on six key
strategic thrusts to advance Singapore's logistics industry in the
new millennium and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The six strategic thrusts contained in the Masterplan include
development of an integrated and globally connected infrastructure,
development of a conducive IT-based operating environment &AMP;
competent IT capabilities, enhancement of integrated logistics
operation and promotion of international logistics hub activities
and solutions, enhancement of market access to facilitate
expansion of international network and development of world-class
expertise and skills.
</P>
<P>
TDB plans to use various schemes to attract a critical mass of
key players in shipping &AMP; logistics to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
It targets to launch another 24 logistics hub projects for the
next three to five years following the introduction of six
projects last year under the Logistics Enhancement and
Applications Program first launched in 1997 and to move Singapore'
s ranking for the most important maritime nations from the current
11th place to 10th place.

<HEADLINE> Filipino General Promoted for East Timor Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Estrada
has approved the temporary promotion of Major General Jaime de los
Santos to lieutenant general as commander of the newly-organized
United Nations Transnational Administration on East Timor (Untaet).
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado in a press release following the appointment of de los
Santos as head of the U.N. peacekeeping force to be deployed to
East Timor early next year.
</P>
<P>
"The president has just approved the recommendation of the
defense department and the Armed Forces to give Major General
Jimmy de los Santos an additional star on a temporary basis while
he is on duty in East Timor," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The temporary promotion of the Filipino general was relayed by
the Department of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had asked the
Philippine government to promote de los Santos to three-star rank
when he commands the U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Mercado explained that under existing law, only six lieutenant
generals or three-star generals are allowed at one time in the
present set-up of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
</P>
<P>
"The star of Jimmy de los Santos will be on a temporary basis.
When he comes back to the Philippines, he will revert to major
general," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
De los Santos was in Dili, the capital of East Timor when
Mercado and AFP chief of staff General Angelo Reyes visited the
620-man Filipino troops there over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
De los Santos is presently the superintendent of the Philippine
Military Academy.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian negotiators Wednesday
held a fresh round of talks with the hijackers of the Indian
Airlines aircraft at Kandahar, Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh told reporters: "You
will appreciate this is a sensitive issue... and it is scarcely
possible for me to conduct negotiations through the media."
</P>
<P>
He said the demands of the hijackers were made available to the
government formally and for the first time in writing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Till then, the government had no basis with which to engage
them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the government has been in constant touch with the
negotiating team which has held "three rounds of extensive talks
with the Taliban as also the hijackers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers Tuesday demanded the release of 36 hard-core
militants and 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that there had been wide spread international
support and solidarity for the manner in which India was handling
the Hijacking crisis. The United Nations has cooperated with India
and "we are satisfied with it".

<HEADLINE> Philippine Supreme Court Urged to Junk VFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Three Philippine Senators asked
the Supreme Court on Wednesday to junk the Philippines-U.S.
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and declare it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The three, Minority Floor Leader Teofisto Gungona, and Senators
Sergio Osmena III and Raul Roco, claimed the VFA is
unconstitutional and violates the constitutional standard of equal
protection of the laws.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Senate in May approved the VFA despite vigorous
opposition from the Catholic church and leftist groups, who see
the accord as an infringement on Philippine sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The agreement opens the way for a resumption of U.S. military
exercises and port visits by U.S. Navy ships.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers said in a 47-page memorandum that the
agreement violates the fundamental principle that legislative
power cannot be delegated, adding that it also violates the
constitutional provision against nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Gungona, Osmena Roco insisted that the mere concurrence of the
majority of the Senate was not enough to ratify the VFA which
implements the general provisions of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines
Mutual Defense Treaty.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated that the Senate must follow the constitution
which allows the presence of foreign military bases, troops or
facilities" only after the people ratified the accord in a
national referendum."

<HEADLINE> Yearender: West Can't Shrug off Obligation to African Debts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- It is sad that even African
new-borns will each have to assume a debt of some 500 U.S. dollars
when the new millennium begins. Certainly they won't know what
this means and where it has come from.
</P>
<P>
The poor African nations are spending 23 billion dollars, or
30.9 percent of their exports, to service the 350-billion-dollar
debts every year. While their average economic growth rate stands
at about three percent, their debts are mounting at a rate of 23
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
It is this "can't pay" debt that has handicapped the African
economy by deterring public investment, scaring away foreign
investors, and denying African countries many opportunities for
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The most direct cause for the African indebtedness is that
investment has not brought about economic growth.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the 1970s the World Bank sought to repeat the
successful seed-water-fertilizer "green revolution" in Asia,
channeling billions of dollars for grandiose projects in African
countries, without taking their actual conditions into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
These projects made little improvement to agricultural
production but increased government indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also instructed the
cash-strapped African countries to promote commodity exports at
the same time. The collapsing world price of commodities and
vandalized environment dealt a hard blow to the poor indebted
countries.
</P>
<P>
The debt crisis in turn led to the introduction of structural
adjustment policies (SAP) by the IMF and the World Bank since
1980, which were mainly designed to "liberalize" the country in
question: devalue its currency, open it up to world markets,
reduce government intervention and flog off as many of its assets
as possible at bargain basement prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAP did not save the continent from the debt trap,
but pushed it further into economic crisis in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
As pre-requisite for debt relief and debt rescheduling, the
Western countries are, also without considering the conditions of
the poor continent, demanding the African countries to adopt their
policies according to their will. Otherwise, loans would be
withheld.
</P>
<P>
The conditionality of structural adjustment meanwhile diverted
government revenues away from things like education and health
care, toward debt repayment and the promotion of exports.
</P>
<P>
The West rhetorically champions human rights in Africa.
However, truly dreadful things are being done in the name of debt
repayment which would otherwise have to be recognized for what
they are: the grossest abuse of even the most elementary
requirements of human dignity.
</P>
<P>
From the whole of Africa, where half of the 700 million
population are living in poverty and one in every two children of
primary-school age is not in school, governments transfer four
times more to Western creditors in debt payments than they spend
on the health and education of their citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Western powers also set rough political and economic
conditions on almost all investment projects.  Some investments
are set aside for specially appointed projects which they believed
to be safe for their money.
</P>
<P>
When these projects prove to be misconceived and unproductive,
the debt burden will unreasonably be on the poor African
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
About one-third of the debts were lent by the Western powers to
African countries to import weapons in their brutal wars.
</P>
<P>
This debt has brought nothing but blood shedding in the
continent. Providing war loans for African countries, the West
has found market for their bloody weapons, backed pro-West forces
and therefore protected their interest in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Whether the war loans should be repaid or not is a big question
both morally and according to the international law.
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know where the debt crisis will end, though
everyone knows that it cannot continue.
</P>
<P>
Finally in 1996 the IMF and World Bank conceded what they had
never been prepared to concede before: that perhaps some of the
debts owed to them by the very poorest and most indebted countries
in the world might eventually have to be written off.
</P>
<P>
The Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative was born
and a list of some 40 countries thought to fall into this category
was drawn up.
</P>
<P>
The intended purpose of the HIPC Initiative is to reduce debt
to a "sustainable" level that a country can afford to pay.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank pointed out that even if all the
proposed debt forgiveness plans were implemented, the total debt
would be reduced by less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say that some Western countries actually
prefer debt bondage to remain in place, precisely because of the
control it gives them over debtor countries.
</P>
<P>
Trying to shrug off their responsibilities, Western countries
are repeatedly blaming African countries' poor governance and
corruption for their indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
No irresponsible governments can be allowed to misuse tax money
and get away with it to pay the debt, and no unhuman lenders can
ask them to do so.
</P>
<P>
Even the lenders have to recognize that African countries are
in debt trap which they will remain forever entangled if no
substantial measures were taken to reduce or eliminate the debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
The debtors and creditors do not simply get into crisis without
knowing what they are doing.
</P>
<P>
While the Africans should exert their efforts, the Western
powers are obliged to help Africa get out of the debt morass.
</P>
<P>
But the Western powers have taken joint action in pressing
African countries to repay the debts or forcing them to yield to
their demands.
</P>
<P>
African countries have been spending a huge sum of time,
resources and sovereignty to please the global financial watchdogs
like the IMF.
</P>
<P>
It is urgent that African countries should be united and speak
with one voice in negotiating with the West and the international
financial institutions over the debt issue.

<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Most public utilities in
Kenya, namely airports, power, telephone among others are free of
millennium bug, the Kenya National Y2K Steering Committee has
said.
</P>
<P>
The members of the steering committee who Tuesday toured the
telecommunication center in the capital Nairobi were confirmed

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shilling Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya shilling has
continued to gain against major currencies due to a decision made
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to begin talks soon on a
resumption of aid to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The shilling went up to 72.99 per U.S. dollar in the week to
December 28 from 74.69 per dollar in the previous week. The
shilling stood at around 60 per dollar in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said the optimism about the IMF aid
resumption had made the shilling to enjoy some positive perception
which has caused speculators to start off loading their dollar
holdings, the East African Standard daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the IMF announced that it would restart the 205
million dollar loan negotiations with Kenya next January. The loan
was suspended in July 1997, which triggered an economic downturn
since then.

CARACAS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government has
offered a reward for the "black boxes" belonging to the Cubana de
Aviacion airliner that crashed Saturday in the Venezuelan state of
Carabobo, Civil Aeronautics Director Juan Salazar said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying the reward, the official said the black
boxes may have been taken by someone living nearby.

<P>
The airliner, a Russian-made Yak-42 flying en route from Havana

mountain in the El Auguacatal rural area, some 145 kilometers east
of Caracas on Saturday, killing a crew of 12 and ten passengers.
</P>

The plane, which has 105 seats, detoured to the Arturo
Michelena Airport in the capital of the Carabobo state, instead of
the Maiquetia Airport in the Vargas state following a normal
flight, because the latter was reportedly in a state of emergency.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Rules out War With Nicaragua Over Sea Limits Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Honduras dismissed any
possibility of a military escalation occurring with Nicaragua over
a sea limits treaty negotiated with Colombia in November, Foreign
Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Flores reiterated the country's position Tuesday when he said
impending talks with Nicaraguan counterpart Eduardo Montealegre
would seek a favorable solution to their differences regarding the
ratification of the treaty on maritime sea limits with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government filed a lawsuit against Honduras at
the Hague on December 8. Nicaragua claims the accord will deprive
it of 130,000 square kilometers of "maritime platform" in the
Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Honduras-Nicaragua foreign ministers' talks will be
mediated by the Organization of American States in Miami, Florida,
U.S., on December 29.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Miami meeting is to ensure that the
International Court of Justice, The Hague, in Holland, would be
the perfect forum for solving the territorial dispute between the
two countries, said the Honduran foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he explained that the Miami meeting would not be the
last one in the agenda between the two countries.  Relations
between Honduras and Nicaragua soured after the Honduran Congress
ratified the treaty on maritime limits with Colombia last November
30.

<P>
KAMPALA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has pledged his government's full support to the ongoing
peace process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the pledge while meeting here with Burundi
Special Envoy Alfred Nkurunziza on Tuesday, said a press release
from the president's office.
</P>
<P>
Museveni stressed that if Burundi works closely with the region,
it should be possible to attain peace, adding that the region is
ready to support the people of Burundi once they work out and
agree on an equitable plan for peace, security and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was temporarily directing the negotiations between the
rival factions in Burundi before former South African President
Nelson Mandela was named facilitator of the peace process in early
December, following the death of Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, also defense minister of the land-locked
African country, briefed Museveni about the current security and
political situation in his country and the steps the government is
taking to secure the lives of the population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government of Burundi is determined to push
the peace process forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ghana is prepared to consult
with ousted President Henri Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire in effort
to help restore democratic rule in that country, said Ghanaian
Foreign Minister Victor James Gbeho Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bedie was toppled in a bloodless coup Friday and has been
traveling to put the case before his former counterparts in the
West African region.
</P>
<P>
Bedie went to Nigeria on Monday to have brief talks with
President Olusegun Obasanjo. He also had talks with Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema on the situation in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Gbeho said foreign ministers of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) were scheduled to have an emergency
meeting Wednesday in Bamako, capital of Mali, to make a "
collective response" to the Friday coup in Cote d'Ivoire, reports
reaching here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that General Robert Guei, former chief of general
staff of Cote d'Ivoire who took over the government in the coup,
would not enjoy any support from Ghana or any West African state.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is concerned about the situation with its western
neighbor since it has a bearing on the security of Ghana and other
West African states as well, said Gbeho.

<HEADLINE> Director of European Central Bank Says Euro Is Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Director of the European
Central Bank (ECB) Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa said the euro proved to
be a success for the past year.
</P>
<P>
 If without the euro currency alliance or a stable exchange
rate, "the internal market inside Europe would have collapsed,"
Padoa-Schioppa told the latest issue of German weekly "Die Zeit."
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Padoa-Schioppa said, the introduction of the euro was
definitely a vital step forward. He also refuted the early
criticism that the currency had a premature birth, adding "The
development of the currency alliance in various periods has been
completely successful."
</P>
<P>
Padoa-Schioppa, who is also an economist, said the present
weakened state of the euro in price relations with the U.S. dollar
is not the problem of the euro itself.
</P>
<P>
He said that the success of a currency depends on its stability
instead of its foreign exchange rate. He believed that because of
the stability of different currencies in the euro zone, the euro's
price relations with the U.S. dollar will soon rise.
</P>
<P>
Padoa-Schioppa urged the countries within the euro zone to
hasten the structural reform, especially to make efforts to solve
the high unemployment issue.
</P>
<P>
He said worsening unemployment is harmful to the running of the
ECB. It may break the common understanding by countries within
the euro zone about the independence of the EBC and the stability
of prices in each country, and thus may threaten the firmness of
the euro.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen the euro's position, Padoa-Schioppa also
advocated the European Union's promotion of political alliance,
because, as he said, "a strong euro depends on a strong political
system."

<HEADLINE> Seattle Outdoor Millennium Celebration Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Seattle Mayor Paul Schell
Tuesday canceled plans for a New Year's Eve party amid fears of an
extremist plot to target the outdoor millennium celebration, which
was expected to draw 50,000 people, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
"That is the advice we have received from the FBI," the mayor
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The decision to cancel the gala event based around the city's
famed Space Needle tower came two weeks after Algerian-born
terrorist Ahmed Ressam was arrested near Seattle for allegedly
attempting to smuggle bomb-making materials into the United States
from Canada.
</P>
<P>
Schell said Ressam's arrest "heightened" safety concerns among
officials already worried about having such a large gathering in
Seattle less than a month after violent protests against the World
Trade Organization (WTO) meeting here.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 people were expected to gather near the Space
Needle to watch a fireworks display. Officials said the fireworks
will go ahead, but the public would be barred from around the site
near the city's downtown.
</P>
<P>
Seattle was one of many large U.S. cities planning public New
Year's celebrations, but the first to cancel its event for fear of
potential extremist plots.

Authorities said the area affected is estimated to contain 260
homes, while the rest of the people stayed to fight against the
fires.
</P>

Fires had burned an area of about four square kilometers in the
steep San Gabriel Mountains by noon, and there were no estimates
on when they would be contained. About 1,000 firefighters were at
work on the blazes.
</P>
<P>
Fingers of fire burned into the back yards of some homes at the
edge of the Los Angeles National Forest and huge plumes of reddish-
brown smoke could be seen and smelled 30 kilometers to the
southwest in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"Right now the fire is a sleeping giant and we just hope the
winds don't wake it up," said Mark Whaling, spokesman for the Los
Angeles County Fire Department. "As long as it remains calm, we
are confident that we will be able to stop it in the back yards."
</P>
<P>
Fire crews were aided by 50 fire trucks, four helicopters and
four airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The fires broke out Monday afternoon in rugged terrain a few
kilometers north of Los Angeles. The cause wasn't known.
</P>
<P>
last week, a wildfire erupted in Ventura County, which
neighbors northern part of Los Angeles Country. That blaze has
charred over an area of 16 square kilometers and destroyed one
home. About 100 firefighters are still battling the blaze. So far,
firefighting costs have topped 5 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Tanzanian Minister Faces Corruption Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian
Minister for Works Nalaila Kiula and three other officials in his
ministry Tuesday appeared before a district court in Dar es Salaam
on 3.3 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 4.13 million U.S.
dollars) corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
They have been found with property worth over 200 million
shillings (about 250,000 dollars) suspected to have been obtained
corruptly and are also facing charges of negligently causing a
loss of over three billion shillings to the government between
1992-1995.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor from the Prevention of Corruption Bureau
of Tanzania read six counts directly against Kiula, saying that
his was found in possession of three houses and a car all valued
at 67 million shillings (about 83,750 dollars).
</P>
<P>
He was also found in possession of a total of about 34 million
shillings (about 42,500 dollars) in cash deposited in various bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The property was reasonably suspected to have been corruptly
obtained, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Kiula was in custody because the district court has
no power to grant a bail in such case involving property exceeding
10 million shillings.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Relieve Tanzania's External Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Disbursements of interim
relief on Tanzania's external debts are likely to start in the
fourth quarter of this fiscal year, the media here reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam-based Financial Times quoted the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) resident representative in
Tanzania Tsidi Tsikata as saying last week that this possibility
is part of new arrangements for debt relief and monitoring of
performance benchmarks agreed by the boards of the IMF and the
World Bank at their annual meetings held last September.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board approved a new three-year arrangement for
Tanzania at that time. The responsible IMF departments are
expected to present the board next February with a new three-year
program on Tanzania, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The presentation will be accompanied by the government's
request for relief under the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries)
initiative, he said, noting that there were good chances that
disbursements could start with the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Under the new HIPC framework, disbursements can start soon
after the decision is made, while in the old framework a country
had to demonstrate good performance over another three years after
the decision point, Tsikata added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanzanian central bank's latest report, the
country's total foreign debt commitment at the end of last
September stood at 7,802.6 million U.S. dollars, just 3.2 percent
lower than a year earlier.

The managers of the Iron Gates said the production of this year
will rise 1.1 million MWh over the initially planned amount under
the condition of a normal annual flow of the Danube river.
</P>
<P>
The plant, built on a narrow section of the Danube on the
Romanian-Yugoslav border, was jointly operated by the two
countries with six Soviet Kaplan turbines each.
</P>
<P>
Since it started operation, the Iron Gates has produced more
than 1.76-billion-KWh hydropower and built about 45,000 sluices.
</P>
<P>
The re-engineering of the hydropower plant started in August
this year under the coordination of the Swiss firm Schulzer Hydro.
The operation, which needs an investment of more than 150 million
U.S. dollars, will add a 20-MW generation capacity to each turbine
upon its completion in ten months.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the funds for the re-construction program
will come from the export of the hydropower produced by the Iron
Gates.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's LRA Rebels Split Into Two Groups: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lord's Resistance Army (
LRA), which consisted of more than 200 rebels and entered northern
Uganda from their bases in southern Sudan last week, has divided
into two groups heading for districts of Kitgum and Gulu
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government troops had briefly engaged the LRA rebels at
Palel Kalitusi where some government soldiers were injured, the
Fourth Division Commander Samuel Kawaggwa was quoted by Radio
Uganda as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kawaggwa said that the rebels were wearing deep green uniforms,
calling on the local people to keep vigilant and report any
stranger to the security authorities.
</P>
<P>
Four LRA rebels were killed in the fighting with the government
forces and another two captured alive.
</P>
<P>
Since January when the LRA escaped to Sudan, all attempts to
enter Uganda have been blocked and the LRA had to stay in its
bases of Nesitu and Jabellin in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Sudan, which severed diplomatic relations in April
1995, signed a peace agreement in Nairobi, Kenya, on December 8,
pledging not to back rebels from each other's territories. This
agreement is widely expected to end the 13-year-long violence in
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Till now, more than 1,000 hostages, mainly teenagers, are still
kept in captivity by the LRA rebels.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Holidaymakers to Leave Japan This Year in Fear of Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- In fear of the Y2K computer bug,
fewer year-end holidaymakers are expected to leave Japan this year,
according to a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
The annual year-end holiday season exodus of travelers peaked
Wednesday at Japan's two major international airports, but the
departure lobbies were less crowded than usual, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Narita Airport officials said an estimated 37,800 people are
expected to leave Japan from the airport Wednesday, some 1,500
fewer than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The number of passengers leaving Japan from Narita on New
Year's Eve and New Year's Day will decrease 17,000 from 60,991
last year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
At Kansai Airport in western Japan, officials estimate the
number of passengers to travel abroad over the holiday period will
fall 30,000, or 8 percent, over the same period of last year, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Government Troops Pursuing Rebels: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) have been pursuing rebels in the northern and western parts
of the country and recorded a great success.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Steven Kavuma made the remarks at a press
conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma said, "The UPDF launched an offensive in mid-November in
the Rwenzori mountains to dislodge the Allied Democratic Forces (
ADF) from its bases both in Uganda and in eastern Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC)."
</P>
<P>
"Due to UPDF pressure, by the end of November, the ADF
relocated a big part of their force including their families and
hostages of the DRC after crossing River Semiliki," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma regarded the ongoing UPDF operation as a great success,
citing that the government troops have disrupted the organization,
coordination and supply lines of the ADF rebels in the western
part of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 86 rebels have been killed in recent actions while a
large quantity of weapons and ammunition including 64 AK-47 rifles
and full SMG magazines were captured.
</P>
<P>
On the recent revival of the rebels' activities in the north,
Kavuma said that the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)
recently entered Uganda fearing that they might be arrested by
Sudanese troops following the Nairobi peace agreement signed by
President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-
Bashir on December 8.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels reportedly clashed with UPDF soldiers and looted
properties of civilians.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to both the LRA and ADF rebels to take advantage of
the recently-passed Amnesty Bill and surrender to the government.
</P>
<P>
The LRA and ADF have been fighting the government since 1986
and 1996 respectively. They allegedly used bases in eastern DRC or
southern Sudan to infiltrate into Uganda to maim and abduct
civilians. More than 15,000 children have been held hostage by the
rebel groups.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Resolves to Improve National Road Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is joining hands
with foreign investors and international financial organizations
to improve conditions of roads that lead to major cities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation said early
this week that it had allocated 1.1 billion birr (132 million U.S.
dollars) for the construction of the 567 km roads.
</P>
<P>
The program is to be funded by the government and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Ten foreign contractors who are to undertake the constructions
of four major roads with a fund provided by the World Bank were
reportedly busy constructing camps as part of the project.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the World Bank, Spain and China started road
construction in Addis Ababa two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under a general plan of the road construction authority, the
roads that are being built or to be built are stretching to east,
north and southwest outside the capital of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, which stretches some 1.1 million square kilometers,
has so far built only 24,000 kilometers of road, of which asphalt
road accounts for 15 percent only.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Grandmaster Prepares For Online Chess Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- After his shock exit from the
World Championship in Las Vegas, Indonesian Grandmaster Utut
Adianto admits he is not being overly cautious in his preparations
for the inaugural online chess tournament next month.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will now be staged from February 9 to 20. It was
previously scheduled for December 19 to January 1.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen world-class grandmasters from five contingents,
including world number one Gary Kasparov, and a computer called
Deep Junior, are on the list of competitors. Apart from Utut, Asia
is represented by Dibyendu Barua of India.
</P>
<P>
Utut (world elo rating of 2,605) is pitted against Nigel Short
of Britain (world elo rating of 2,675).
</P>
<P>
"Just play him out. I'm still traumatized over my elimination
from the world championship. We'd better be relaxed. (I will) not
be too long preparing for the game," he was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Utut was upset by Daniel Freedman in the second round of the
World Championship last July.
</P>
<P>
In his nine encounter with Nigel Short, Utut held him to a draw
five times with the rest ending in the Briton's favour. Their last
meeting, which ended in a draw, was in Estonia last year.
</P>
<P>
In the online tournament, the contestants will play their game
from their base camps. They don't have to worry about playing
across the world. Spectators can just log in to see the games.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, which adopts a KO system, offers prizes
totalling 48,000 U.S. dollars. But a player who is knocked out in
the first stage will still earn 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the online tournament are: GM Garry
Kasparov (Russia), GM Alexander Morozevich (Russia), GM Michael
Adams (England), GM Peter Svidler (Russia), GM Nigel Short (
England), GMIvan Sokolov (Bosnia), GM Yasser Seirawan (USA), GM
Jeroen Piket (Netherlands), GM Loek van Wely (Netherlands), GM
Utut Adianto (Indonesia), GM Illescas Cordoba (Spain), GM Nick
deFirmian (USA), GMEtienne Barcot (France), GM Gilberto Milos (
Brazil), GM Dibyendu Barua(India), Deep Junior (Israel).

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Chess Body to Recruit Young Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Chess
Association (Percasi) aims to boost its dream team performances in
the future by staging more tournaments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Newly installed Chairman of the Percasi Bambang N. Rachmadi
said he wanted more players to join the team of four junior
players, comprising Susanto Megaranto, Taufik Halay, Andrian and
Tirta Chandra.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a grand master, Utut Adianto, and the dream team.
But the gap between the two generations is really wide. We want to
narrow the gap and recruit more young players to join the team,"
Bambang was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, Percasi will stage three competitions
next year, which also aim to promote chess and boost national
chess player performances.
</P>
<P>
One of the competitions is the Bank IFI championship held in
Percasi's 23 provincial chapters. Winners of the competition will
join the McDonald's Chess Master Circuit, which is staged every
three months. Another tournament is the Enerpac tournament, which
will take place between both of the competitions mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
Percasi also plans to stage competitions by inviting overseas
grand masters.
</P>
<P>
Bambang, who also manages a chain of fast-food restaurants
throughout the country, said 10 of the 23 chapters had the
potential to set up chess schools in their respective chapters.

<HEADLINE> Kewell Voted Oceania Soccer Player of the Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian soccer midfielder
Harry Kewell has been named the Oceania player of the year.
</P>
<P>
Kewell, at the age of 21 and an influential member of the Leeds
United team in the English Premier League, came out an
overwhelming winner in the poll by regional football writers.
</P>
<P>
Kewell was involved this year in a club versus country battle
between Australia and Leeds for his services in Leeds. His
abscence in the two-match home series against the Brazilian
Olympic team in November led to Soccer Australia seeking and
obtaining a FIFA ban on him to play for Leeds in a Premiership
match.
</P>
<P>
Thought to be an integral part of Australia's campaign for
qualification for the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan and South
Korea, Kewell received 115 votes to beat Glasgow Celtic striker
Mark Viduka (69) and Munich 1860 midfielder Ned Zelic (37) for the
honor.
</P>
<P>
Among those lost to him in the poll were past award winners
Mark Bosnich and Christian Karembeu.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- With a record of swimming
across the English Channel 19 times, former Australian marathon
swimmer Des Renford was in critical condition Wednesday after
suffering a heart attack during his daily swim at a Sydney pool.
</P>
<P>
Renford, 72, crossed the Channel between 1970 and 1980,
including three crossings within 10 days in 1980. After being
dragged from the pool, he was clinically dead before being revived
twice by pool staff.
</P>
<P>
He swims at least two kilometers at the pool each morning.
</P>
<P>
Australian swimmer Susie Maroney, who was in limelight after
completing marathon swims in Jamaica and Cuba, said Renford had
inspired her and influenced her swimming career.
</P>
<P>
Maroney plans another swim in Cuba next June. She said Renford
had helped her during her first English Channel crossing at the
age of 15.
</P>
<P>
Renford, a fitness enthusiast, has also inspired many older
people to get fit and he runs a school for mature-aged swimmers up
to 87 years of age.
</P>
<P>
He has suffered three heart attacks and a stroke previously.
</P>
<P>
His parents and brother all died when they were all in their
40s, reportedly because of heart disease.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Prepares To Accelerate Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang is making all efforts
to develop its infrastructure and formulate its strategy for
economic reform, a local top leader said in a recent interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Construction of water conservation projects will be a priority
in alleviating the drought of the region, and large projects will
be built on three major river valleys in north and south Xinjiang,
said Wang Lequan, secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Regional Committee of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
At present, the more than 2,500 kilometers of railway tracks,
34,000 kilometers of roads and some 50 air routes in Xinjiang
cannot meet the region's needs.
</P>
<P>
The present economic structure needs to undergo thorough
restructuring, especially in agriculture. Water conservation,
ecological and environmental protection, local farm produce, petro-
chemistry and tourism are among ten key projects taken by the
local government.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang accounts for nearly 17 percent of China's total area
and is the home to people of some 47 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
After years of hard work, Xinjiang's GDP has jumped from 27.4
billion yuan (over 3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1990 to 111.6
billion yuan (nearly 13 billion U.S dollars) in 1998. Financial
revenue and foreign trade have also achieved remarkable growth.
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang is well prepared to make great economic contributions
in the dedvelopment of China's west in the new millennium," said
Wang.

<HEADLINE> Village Restored in Central-South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Called "Living Fossil", the village, located near the Dongting
Lake in Hunan Province and built by Zhang Guying and his family
during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), has drawn the attention of
experts from both at home and overseas, and some experts from the
Japan and the United States have made special trips to study it.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a retired feudal lord from neighboring Jiangsi Province
under the rein of Emperor Hongwu during the Ming Dynasty (1368-
1644) decided to turn his back on society and built the village
complex so as to live a somewhat hermetic existence.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,600 descendants of the clan who occupy 1,
732 rooms in the village. Each room is connected by a corridor so
that the village head can visit each family without going out of
the house.
</P>
<P>
The village has been claimed by archeologists and architects
as a museum of folk culture of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-
1911).
</P>
<P>
The wooden structures and stone carvings gave a vivid
expression to the lives of clan members then, said Wang Shaozhou,
an architect from Tongji University in Shanghai. Fireproof and
water drainage systems have been carefully built and are highly
advanced for their time.
</P>
<P>
Unique ventilation and fire bricks provides an excellent fire-
proof system. Yuan Mei, a villager in her 60s, said she has not
seen a fire for half a century. Despite torrential rains and
occasional flooding, the village has withstood serious flooding
because of sophisticated water drainage systems.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one third of the villagers have now moved out of their
dilapidated houses into new homes nearby. And many are ready to
purchase modern household appliances such as color TV sets and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these changes, many traditional customs have been
retained. These traditions are amply seen in celebrations,
marriage ceremonies and even funerals.
</P>
<P>
The local government has set aside a lot of money to protect
and refurbish houses in the village complex and to promote and
develop tourism in the area. The village now draws some 10,000
tourists a year.

private, or jointly organized by laid-off workers, community
committees and large enterprises. They cover almost all sectors of
production, distribution and services.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of those small enterprises has alleviated the
pressure of unemployment for many and helps to maintain social
stability, said an industry expert.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is granting loans to small enterprises.
More than four million yuan (about 460,000 U.S. dollars) has been
earmarked for several hundred enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, industry, taxation, hygiene and disease control
departments will also provide information for these enterprises.
Large and medium-sized firms will allow concessions when dealing
with these small enterprises.

<HEADLINE> North China Port City to Upgrade Transport System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a major industrial
and port city in north China, about 120 km from the Chinese
capital of Beijing, plans to upgrade its transport system in the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
According to a newly completed blueprint entitled "Overall
Planning for Urban Tianjin", the city will develop sea, air, road
and railway infrastructure. By the year 2010, the port is expected
to handle more than 100 million tons of cargo and become a major
commercial, industrial and fishing port.
</P>
<P>
To improve air transport, Tianjin will build a second runway at
the Binhai International Airport. When completed, the airport will
be capable of handling eight million arrivals and departures
annually.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin will accelerate construction of its railways to become
more fully integrated with the nation's railway network. Tianjin
will also make efforts to connect with railway networks in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The port city plans to build four more highways and a "new zone
" along its coastal area.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Tianjin Design and Planning Administration
said that Tianjin will take measures to attract more investment.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts to Reduce Debt in Metallurgy Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of debt-ridden
enterprises in China's metallurgical sector will be reduced to
less than 20 percent from the current 26 percent next year through
mergers, acquisitions and reduction of costs.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the total loss of the sector dropped by 33
percent from last year's figure with six large iron and steel
companies reversing money-losing records. The sector's profit hit
2.5 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
By improving management, major iron and steel enterprises
slashed costs by an average of 6.2 percent this year -- the most
impressive improvement in decades.
</P>
<P>
The metallurgical industry aims to reduce costs by another 2
percent next year, ensuring that 46 key state enterprises in the
sector report no loss.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that a further 2-percent reduction in cost is
likely to be achieved with the support of the government.
</P>
<P>
As 45 enterprises in the sector are eligible for debt-to-equity
swap next year, which would involve 90 billion yuan, nearly 6-
billion-yuan in bank interest will be saved at an interest rate of
around 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government will also introduce favorable policies to
encourage mergers and acquisitions, and close down a large number
of small iron and steel plants.
</P>
<P>
As for those profit-earning enterprises, China will work to
help 80 percent of them establish modern enterprise systems by the
end of next year.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Young Chinese Sturgeons Released into River (2)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wei Qiwei, an expert with the Yangtze River Fishery Research
Institute under the Chinese Academy of Fishery Science, said that
the most effective way to increase the rare fish is to breed and
release more young sturgeons measuring above 10 cm in length.
</P>
<P>
As to the success of the release this time, Wei added that
there should be about 1,000 adult Chinese sturgeons migrating back
to the Yangtze in 15 years even according to the lowest
international standard.
</P>
<P>
Some of the minnows released Tuesday were labeled with various
marks, including the coded wire tags imported from the U.S. so as
to make it easier to tell artificially-bred sturgeons from
naturally-bred ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a safe return for the young sturgeons to the sea, the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has issued a notice, banning all
kinds of fishing in the whole Yichang section of the Yangtze River
between December 25 of this year and April 15 of next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fishery departments along the river have intensified
their crackdown on illegal fishing, especially the use of
explosives, electric shocking devices and poisons.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hecheng, deputy director of the Fishery Bureau of the
ministry, said that relevant departments will trace the young fish
's migration all the way to the mouth of the Yangtze, and
publicity will be launched to enhance the awareness of the public
to protect the rare endangered fish and other wild marine species.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenhuai, vice-chairman of the Agricultural and Rural
Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, and Lu Ming,
vice-minister of Agriculture attended today's releasing activities.

BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Young Chinese Sturgeons Released into River (1)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese fish experts Tuesday
released 100,000 artificially-bred young Chinese sturgeons into
the Yangtze River near central China's Hubei Province .
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China put into the river such a large
number of young Chinese sturgeons measuring above 10 centimeters,
in an effort to this rare endangered migratory fish species.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is known as a living fossil as it is one
of the oldest vertebrates in the world. The rare fish migrates to
the Jinshajiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze, from the sea
and spawns there, and when the minnows grow to about 10 cm, they
migrate back to the sea some 3,000 km away. As adults, they
migrate back to the upstream to their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
But the fish now faces worsening living conditions due to the
environmental pollution and illegal and rampant catching.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the number of Chinese sturgeons that swim back
to the Yangtze River every year has dropped to less than 1,000,
with only some 500 of them able to spawn. They warned that the
fish may become extinct in 50 years if no effective measures are
taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
To save the endangered species, China has set up two large
bases in Hubei to breed the fish, and from 1983 to 1998, nearly 6
million Chinese sturgeon minnows were released into the Yangtze.
However, their survival rate is very low, as the minnows are
mostly far less than 10 cm in length and they usually fall prey to
other species of fish in the river.

<P>
At the invitation of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of
Hong Kong, Edmund Ho and some 50 officials and business people
from Macao left for Hong Kong Wednesday morning to attend an on-
going international exhibition of industrial products.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive noted that he had held informal talks with
his counterpart of the Hong Kong SAR and they had lunch together,
but they did not dwell on concrete government affairs.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, officials of both SAR governments shared the common
view that they would enhance contacts, Edmund Ho said. The two SAR
governments would also encourage non-governmental bodies,
particularly those in the business sector, to have better
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Strive for First-Class Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing vows to create a first-
class investment environment to attract more overseas funding, the
city's mayor has said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi made the remarks Tuesday at a conference on improving
the city's investment climate, saying the task will face two
challenges once China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
First, the emphasis will be shifted from tax reductions to
establishing a fair and normal market environment. Second,
preferential policies will be switched to general favorable ones,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the polices of attracting capital will become more
transparent and consistent.
</P>
<P>
The mayor listed four areas of focus for attracting investment:
setting sound policy, maintaining a steady market, improving all-
round service and building a better hard-ware or infrastructure
environment.
</P>
<P>
He explained that sound policy requires a complete set of
regulations which can protect the interests of both China and
overseas investors; a steady market needs to set channels for
overseas capital in compliance with international norms; and a
better hard-ware environment is to speed up the construction of
high-tech infrastructure for information industry and other
sectors and to rebuild Zhongguancun, China's "Silicon Valley", in
particular.

<HEADLINE> Better-educated Farmers Key to Development: Jiang (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has encouraged millions of farmers in China to improve production -
- and in turn their standard of living -- through more education.
</P>
<P>
He said improvement of farmers' overall quality through
education and vocational training is the foundation of economic
and social development in rural areas, and is also vital to
socialist construction of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
"For China, which has 900 million of its 1.2 billion people
living in rural areas, issues concerning the agricultural industry
and farmers are key issues," Jiang commented in a preface to a
series of textbooks of basic knowledge for Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
The content of the four-volume textbooks varies from practical
techniques for planting, cultivating, and processing of farming
products, to marketing and management skills. The books also
include chapters on health care, family planning, environmental
protection, laws, and the knowledge for farmers to do away with
superstitions.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's comments were echoed by Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing, who wrote a letter of congratulations for a book
publication ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that lots of problems in rural areas are closely
associated with the quality of farmers and grassroots officials,
and that education is the main solution.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to present three sets of the books,
published by the China Agriculture Publishing House, to every
township in the country.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Airport to Be Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The airport in China's
northwest city of Dunhuang started its expansion project today,
which is expected to greatly boost its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Located at the juncture of Gansu and Qinghai provinces and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Dunhuang was a hub of western
and oriental cultures on the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
A famous ancient city, Dunhuang boasts many famous cultural
spots, including some named on the World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has received more and more tourists
from Asia and other parts of the world, averaging 500,000 visitors
a year.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing airport has hindered development of the
city's tourism.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 340 million yuan (41 million U.S. dollars)
, the expanded project is expected to be finished in 2002. By then,
the airport will be able to handle jets such as the Boeing 737 and
Airbus 320, and to accommodate 300,000 passengers and 3,400 tons
of goods and mail yearly.

<HEADLINE> Gold Rush in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Gold bars went on sale in
Shanghai today for the first time since the founding of New China
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The media reported yesterday afternoon that the bars would go
on sale at a popular gold store early this morning. Almost
immediately, a long queue formed outside the shop. Sales started
at about one o'clock in the early morning and within 3 hours,
nearly all of the 1,000 bars were gone.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by the People's Bank of China, the bars are issued
to mark the new millennium and produced by China Gold Coin Parent
Company. They came in four weights, 500, 200, 100 and 50 grams,
selling for 120 yuan (14 U.S. dollars) per gram.
</P>
<P>
Lei Jianrong bought the first bar, a 500-gram piece, and said
excitedly, "I did not expect I would be the first in new China to
buy a gold bar." He waited in line for 10 hours for his purchase.
</P>
<P>
Most of the buyers were middle-aged. Some said they bought the
bars for commemoration, others said they would pass their gold
bars down through their families. Some families sent all members
to stand in line to buy bars separately because of the one-bar-per-
person limit.
</P>
<P>
At 4 a.m., nearly all the 1,000 bars were sold, but a number of
people still waited outside the store, hoping more bars will be
available.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 55 in Communal Clashes in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The death toll rose to 55 in
communal clashes in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku Province,
this week, according to reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Now into its third day, fighting between Muslim and Christian
groups continued to rage as the city remains under siege.
Shootings and explosions could be heard on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Schools, offices and markets were closed while many women and
children have been evacuated by relatives to safer places.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post reported that no official confirmation of the
death toll could be obtained but information collected from
hospitals showed that at least 55 persons have died in the last
three days and more than 140 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
After a peaceful Christmas, Ambon was again rocked by violence
following a street accident in which a young Muslim teenager was
hit by a Christian driver on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked another round of bloody clashes as the
Silo church -- the largest in the city -- was burned down later in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
Even the heavy rain on Tuesday afternoon could not quell the
boiling rage, the Jakarta Post said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Military (TNI) Commander Admiral Widodo A.
S. Tuesday called for restraint.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the local community to exercise self-restraint. They
have to realize the importance of solving their own problems with
a clear mind, otherwise, no one from the outside will be able to
solve the problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said the TNI has found difficulties in dealing with the
communal clashes.
</P>
<P>
"The area is too broad while the hot spots are uncertain," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the TNI on Monday sent 435 soldiers from
Kalimantan to help end the bloodshed in Ambon, 2,400 kilometers
east of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has been the site of bloody communal violence since the
beginning of this year and more than 800 people have died as a
result. Hundreds of shops, offices, homes and other buildings,
including churches and mosques, have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri visited Ambon on December 12, pleading for an end to
the bloodshed and calling for religious tolerance.

cause of the fatal accident. But eye witnesses said that the gate
at the railroad crossing jammed before the accident took place,"

YANGON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar surgeons Tuesday
successfully carried out a kidney transplant operation on a
patient at the New Yangon General Hospital here, official

Both the patient and the donor are in good health after the
operation, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, Myanmar specialists successfully transplanted for
the first time a kidney into a 41-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>

specialists successfully carried out joint surgical operations
such as cardiac, orthopedic and heart operations and a total knee

<HEADLINE> Opposition MPs to Join Sri Lankan Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen members of parliament
(MPs) from Sri Lanka's main opposition United National Party (UNP)
are expected to join the ruling coalition to form a national
government, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Secret discussions were already on with the 16 MPs who have
lost faith in the UNP leadership, the official Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
In early December the UNP Alternative Group (dissidents) of
five MPs crossed over to the People's Alliance (PA) government in
a bid to form a national government to resolve the ethnic
conflicts which have plagued the island country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
After her reelection at the December 21 presidential polls,
President Chandrika Kumaratunga called on all forces to join her
in resolving the ethnic issue and forming a national government to
solve other national issues as well.
</P>
<P>
The UNP Executive Committee and the Parliamentary Group on
Monday jointly decided to support the government for the
resolution of the ethnic issue but were totally against the
proposal for a national government.
</P>
<P>
One of the main problems that Kumaratunga has faced during her
past five-year rule was that she could not muster a two-third
majority in the parliament to introduce a new constitution and her
political package for the devolution of power to resolve the
ethnic issue.
</P>
<P>
The People's Alliance has 105 seats in the 225-seat parliament
while the UNP has 84. The rest of the seats are held by minor
parties which have mostly supported the PA but the government is
still short of the two-third majority by 14 votes which the UNP
has refused to provide.
</P>
<P>
The crossover of an adequate number of UNP MPs to the
government side will enable the government to sail through with
any legislation it desires to pave the way for the resolution of
the long-running ethnic conflicts.

breakthrough in improving photosynthesis in rice results from more
than three years of collaboration among the scientists involved.
</P>
<P>
Photosynthesis is the process by which chlorophyll (the green
pigment in leaves) captures light energy from the sun which the
plant uses to manufacture proteins, carbohydrates and fats needed
for grain production.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the photosynthetic rate allows a plant to grow
faster and potentially produce more grain, said Maurice Ku, one of
the leading scientists involved in the effort.
</P>
<P>
Ku explained that the gains in photosynthetic capacity in his
rice plants were due mainly to a wider opening of the stomata (
breathing pores in the skin of a leaf) that allowed more carbon
dioxide to be available for fixation inside the chloroplast.
</P>
<P>
According to Ku, tropical species such as maize, sorghum and
sugarcane, which are known as C4 plants, have evolved in a million
years a more efficient photosynthetic mechanism than the so-called
C3 plants such as rice, barley and wheat.
</P>
<P>
He said rice already contains all of the genes responsible for
C4 photosynthesis. "The problem is that they are not switched on
and regulated as they are in maize. We are therefore trying to
introduce this photosynthetic mechanism into rice," he said.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that it might take 10 to 20 years to find out
and complete his ongoing experiment, Ku reported an increase in
grain yield of up to 20 percent in preliminary field trials.
</P>
<P>
The IRRI, with its headquarters in the Philippines and offices
in 11 other countries, is the world's leading international rice
research and training center.

BANGKOK, December 29 (Xinhua) - At least 10 elephants in the
northern region have died as a result of unusually cold weather in
the past week, The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were reported in the northern provinces of Chiang
Mai, Phrae and Lampang, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Temperature in some mountainous northern provinces dropped to
as low as minus 4 centigrade in the past week.
</P>
<P>
"If temperatures drop further, it could get worse because
elephants can't adjust to the cold weather," the newspaper quoted
Krisada Langka, a vet at the Wild Animals Fund in Lampang, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The vet suggested mahouts and owners light fires to keep the
elephants warm.
