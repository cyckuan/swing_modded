<HEADLINE> Saudi King Satisfied With Results of GCC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz expressed content on Monday on the results of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) summit, which was held on November 27-29
in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Fahd, who chaired the three-day meeting, hailed the efforts
exerted by the GCC leaders aimed at boosting the role of the
regional political and economic bloc to confront common challenges.
</P>
<P>
The king of the GCC heavyweight expressed his satisfaction at
the Saudi cabinet weekly session in the Yamama Palace in Riyadh,
according to reports of the Saudi Press Agency monitored here.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, GCC leaders agreed to form a long-awaited
customs union by March 1, 2005, with common external tariffs
between 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The compromised pact is crucial to the GCC's 18-year ambition
to establish a regional common market and for a free trade zone
with one of its key trading partners, the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders of the oil-rich Gulf states - Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
- which control some 45 percent of the world's oil reserves, also
pledged joint efforts to stabilize the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
After more than one-year lackluster and thanks to the output
curb by the oil producing states, the world oil market has picked
up recently, with the oil price per barrel hit a nine-year high
of over 25 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Praised for Local Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been ranked among
the countries which have represented the best political and
economic conditions through the local government system, Radio
Uganda reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Research in Africa has proven that Uganda has made a lot of
progress in governance, Bart Halffen, director of studies in the
Institute of Social Studies in the Hague of the Netherlands, said
in a speech presented at a regional seminar on decentralization in
Jinja, 80 km east of the capital city Kampala Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Halffen warned decentralized organs against relying on
the central government for funding.
</P>
<P>
The scholar also advocated the need for the non-governmental
organizations and the private sector to participate in the making
of decentralization policies.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar has drawn scholars from eastern and
southern African countries.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sets Condition on Pull-out From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government would
withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) if the issue of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a main
rebel group active in western Uganda, has been properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
Once the rebels surrender, the Ugandan government would pull
out its troops deployed in the third largest African country,
Minister for Security Muruli Mukasa said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda sent troops into the DRC in August 1998, saying that the
troops, now headquartered in DRC's northern town of Kisangani, are
used to ensure the security of the borders.
</P>
<P>
However, the Congolese government has accused Kampala of
backing the rebels fighting to topple President Laurent Kabila, a
charge Uganda has denied.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels began operations in western Uganda in January of
1996. They maim, abduct and rob. They are said to often sneak
into Uganda from eastern parts of the DRC to carry out abductions.
</P>
<P>
There is an outcry among some members of Parliament (MPs) for
making peace with the rebel groups within the countries and an
amnesty bill is soon to be passed by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government fully supports the efforts made by the
MPs in western Uganda to persuade ADF rebels to come out and
surrender to the central government, Radio Uganda quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels would be pardoned if they come out peacefully,
Mukasa added.

KAMPALA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
114- million-U.S. dollar fund for the local government development
program and the second economic and financial management project
in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 million dollars would be used to support the government
 development strategies contained in the country's Poverty
Eradication Action Plan 1997, Radio Uganda reported on Monday
evening.
</P>

The second economic and financial project is aimed to improve
the effectiveness of public expenditure management including
government planning, financial management, monitoring and
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Both projects were jointly funded by the Ugandan government,
Kampala City Council and local governments, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
the key multilateral financial institutions which provide colossal
amount of money for the east African country's economic

<HEADLINE> Israeli Officials Urge Palestinians to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government officials
urged on Monday the Palestinians to return to the negotiating
table and to proceed with the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, national security advisor to Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, told the Israel Radio that the settlement issue could not
be an obstacle hindering the peace talks and this issue can be
settled through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo told reporters
in Ramallah Monday after the inconclusive eighth session of the
final-status talks that the Palestinian side will no longer
negotiate with Israel until it stops Jewish settlements expansion
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Monday talks were scheduled to discuss the Palestinian
refugee issue, but the settlement issue has become the hot topic
for the session.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side was angered by Israeli Housing Ministry's
new tenders for building 500 houses in one settlement in the West
Bank, saying such steps taken by the Israeli government were aimed
at destroying the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Yatom tried to defend the tenders, saying that the current
government was implementing the decision made by former government
led by Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Foreign Minister Nawaf Massalha expressed his
regret over the deadlocked peace talks, urging the Palestinian
side to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Nawaf urged Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton to hold a three-way summit to help
break the impasse in the talks, which are expected to result in a
permanent peace deal by next September.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
visit Israel and Palestinian territories on Tuesday for talks with
Barak and Arafat to give the peace process a push.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli side has lowered its expectation for Albright's
visit.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Army to Outfit Laser Tag for Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian army is set to
outfit troops for training in the country's largest and most
sophisticated game of laser tag, said local media reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
The army hopes to buy enough laser systems to outfit about 1,
000 soldiers and 270 vehicles for the purpose, with a specialized
training center of 180 square kilometers being planned at Canadian
Forces Base Wainwright in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
A computer system would show soldiers what they did wrong and
why they ended up getting "killed" in simulation wars, in which
they were allowed to zap each other or "enemy" vehicles with
lasers attached to their rifles.
</P>
<P>
The so-called weapons effects simulation system will give the
Canadian army the ability for the first time to measure training
effectiveness, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the Canadian Treasury Board, the first combat
team of about 250 soldiers and 60 vehicles could be in the field
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British armies operate similar laser training
systems.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Militia Leader Jailed for Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A former Rwandan militia
leader was given a life sentence Monday by the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
An ICTR press release said that Georges Rutaganda, the second
vice- president of Rwanda's notorious Interahamwe militia, was
sentenced to imprisonment for life following his conviction on one
count of genocide and of two counts of crimes against humanity by
the U.N. tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Judges in Trial Chamber One unanimously found that Rutaganda
incurred individual criminal responsibility in particular for
having ordered, incited and carried out murders and for causing
serious bodily or mental harm to members of the Tutsi ethnic group
during the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rutaganda had held a high position in the Interahamwe at the
time the crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
He had knowingly and consciously participated in those crimes
and had shown no remorse for what he had inflicted upon the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Rutaganda, now aged 41, was a member of an influential family
and a prosperous businessman.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in Zambia in October 1995 and transferred to
the U.N. Detention Facilities in Arusha on May 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Defense counsel for Rutaganda, Tiphaine Dickson of the Montreal
Bar announced that she would appeal against the verdict and the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
This judgment is the fifth by the ICTR and brings the number of
 convicted persons to six.

NICOSIA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Airways (CY), the
country's national carrier, said Monday that it is completely Y2K
compliant and ready both in air and on the ground to handle the
computer bug, a statement of the airline said.
</P>
<P>
The airways has successfully conducted a simulation flight in
Y2K conditions. Thirty minutes into the flight, when the clock of
a no-passenger Airbus A-320 struck the millennium switchover, its
computer systems were adjusted in tandem.
</P>
<P>
The three pilots flew the aircraft for further two hours, with
all systems responding without any problems. The plane returned
safely to airport around midday, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"With today's flight, Cyprus Airways has confirmed assurances
by manufacturer Airbus Industries of the Y2K compatibility of its
aircraft."
</P>
<P>
Around 700 electronic systems on the ground have been tested,
some were replaced and others repaired and are now completely Y2K
compatible.
</P>
<P>
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has placed
Cyprus Airways in the list of airlines which are not expected to
face any problems during the switchover to the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russians Press Advance on Grozny, Surround Urus-Martan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian units Monday narrowed
the noose around Grozny, capital of the rebelling Chechen republic,
and completely surrounded another key town of Urus-Martan, 20
kilometers southwest of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
During the day the Russian troops in Chechnya fought against
militants mainly in the area of the district capital of Urus-
Martan, said the Russian Defense Ministry press service.
</P>
<P>
Fierce artillery and air strikes were conducted on
concentrations of militants in Grozny, Urus-Martan and other
places around the capital, while federal interior troops completed
their mopping-up operations in Tsentoroi and Alleroi.
</P>
<P>
The press service said that the troops surrounding Grozny still
have a safety corridor left for civilians to escape. However, the
militants are trying everything they can to prevent civilians from
leaving and are using them as living shields.
</P>
<P>
"They are acting just the same in Urus-Martan. They have set up
posts along the roads around the town to stop and force back any
civilians leaving town," the press service said.
</P>
<P>
Self-defense unit led by former mayor of Grozny Bislan
Gantamirov had "ousted militants from the village of Gekhi and
several other communities in the Urus-Martan district," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian troops are preparing for liberating Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Federal units in Chechnya plan to start the final phase of
liberating Grozny from criminal gangs in coming days, said an
official in the Russian North Caucasus command, cited by the
Interfax news agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The method used in taking over the towns of Gudermes and Argun
will not be used for this time, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to destroy the large gangs positioned in Grozny
rather than just seize the city," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Chechen field commander Khatab is believed to head the 3,000 to
5,000 militants staying in the city.
</P>
<P>
Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov still remains in Grozny but is
likely to retreat toward the unliberated south mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
Russians gave the militants December 11 as the deadline for
leaving Grozny and surrendering to federal units.
</P>
<P>
"Your are surrounded. All roads from Grozny have been closed.
Resistance would make no sense. Those staying in the city will be
regarded as terrorists and gangsters and be destroyed by artillery
and the air force," said Russian federal command leaflets dropping
over the city.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more talks," the command warned.
</P>
<P>
"No frontal attack on Grozny is planned, but first the town of
Urus-Martan has to be seized," said Colonel General Valery Manilov,
deputy chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed force,
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This (the liberation of Urus-Martan) will bring to an end the
first phase of the third stage of the anti-terrorist operation in
Chechnya," Manilov said. At this phase militants will be ousted
from the populated areas of Chechnya into the mountains, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"At the second phase of the third stage gangsters and
terrorists will be destroyed in the foothills and mountains, where
they have set up bases, camps and stores of ammunition and
foodstuffs," Manilov stated.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Chechnya is developing as our units dictated,
" he noted.
</P>
<P>
While suffering grave losses under the air raids by the federal
force, Chechen bandit formations are preparing for a long partisan
war and sabotage, the Interfax quoted the Russian military
headquarters in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab are planning to
retreat into Georgia and to deploy up to 1,000 fighters along its
border with Chechnya if federal troops capture Grozny, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Tu-22M3 "Backfire" medium-range bombers might start carrying
out missions in Chechnya. This aircraft is capable of carrying
powerful high-tech bombs, said the Russian headquarters.
</P>
<P>
An Mi-28 sample helicopter was transported to Mozdok. The Mi-28
carries the latest navigation and focusing equipment. It will help
with the targeting of Mi-24 helicopters at night time and in
unfavorable weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Russians also plan to use K-50 Black Shark helicopters in mid-
December, which are parked in the Mozdok airbase. They are said to
be effective in the mountains and capable of hitting various
targets.
</P>
<P>
Now over 5,000 militants are concentrated in the Grozny
fortified district. Militants set up strong resistance facilities
in the towns of Urus-Martan, Shali and Vedeno. Separate militant
groups are active in the district of Kurchaloyevsky, said the
Russian front-line military.

UNITED NATIONS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A new initiative
launched by the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) will help 31
African countries fight desertification and promote local land
management and poverty alleviation initiatives, UNDP officials
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the program, which will focus on capacity-
building in the African countries, was announced by Eimi Watanabe,
director of the UNDP's Bureau for Development Policy, during the
Third Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Convention to Combat
Desertification, which was held in Recife, Brazil, on November 15-
26, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said that the initiative is being launched following
urgent requests from African countries for assistance in fighting
desertification.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP Office to Combat Desertification and Drought (UNSO),
is providing 500,000 U.S. dollars in seed funding. Donor
contributions are presently being sought. The program will operate
out of two UNSO centers in East and West Africa.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1965, the UNDP is the world's largest
multilateral source of grants for sustainable human development.

<HEADLINE> New Borns Mixed Three Times in Two Months: Canadian Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian hospital in Winnipeg
has been accused of mixing new born babies "for the third time in
two months," said a press report Monday from the central Canadian
city.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident happened last Monday when a mother was
given the wrong infant to breastfeed.
</P>
<P>
"Ours was a tiny baby with dark skin and black hair but they
brought her a white, chubby, blond-haired baby to feed,"
complained an agitated father Ryan Punton.
</P>
<P>
Punton's son was taken by a nurse for tests Monday morning. The
parents then were returned with a different baby for feeding,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Punton said the nurse later apologized.
</P>
<P>
The incident came one day after another couple accused the
hospital of the same problem.
</P>
<P>
In September, a woman in the same maternity ward breastfed a
baby for an hour before discovering the boy wasn't her son, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is asking for a full report of the incidents,
saying, "Certainly it's troubling. It's below the standard of care
we want to provide."
</P>
<P>
The hospital also attributed the problem more or less to a
shortage of nurses, the report added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Coca-Cola Chairman Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- M. Douglas Ivester, chairman
of Coca-Cola Co., will retire in April after only two years in the
job, the Atlanta-based company announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected move comes as the world's biggest soft drink
maker struggles to recover from a period in which its stock price
sagged, a group of current and former black employees sued
alleging discrimination, and a product-contamination scare cut
into sales across Europe.
</P>
<P>
"After extensive reflection and thought, I have concluded that
it is time for me to move on to the next stage of my life and,
therefore to put into place an orderly transition for this great
company," Ivester was quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Sunday, Coke's board elected 56-year-old
Douglas N. Daft as president and chief operating officer,
effective immediately. The board also said it plans to elect Daft
as Ivester's successor after its April shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ivester, 52, had been Coke's chairman and chief executive
officer since October 1997, when he was chosen to succeed Roberto
C. Goizueta, who had died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Daft oversees Coke's Middle and Far East Group. Last month, he
was given responsibility for Africa and the company's new
Schweppes Beverages Division.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, while generally optimistic about the company's long-
term prospects, have been disappointed repeatedly by a string of
poor earnings reports that have befallen Coke. Those began in 1997,
when its profits dropped sharply because of economic troubles in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In June, more than 250 people in Belgium and France reported
becoming sick after drinking Coke products. That led to a brief
sales ban, further hurting profits. Ivester traveled to Europe to
try to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Coke is also facing a lawsuit brought in April by four current
and former employees, alleging that Coca-Cola pays black employees
less, offers them fewer promotions and gives them lower
performance evaluation scores than whites.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Fight Against Female Genital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has urged African countries to work together in addressing
the continental problem of female genital mutilation, which has
long existed on the continent.
</P>
<P>
A lot of girls on the continent are constantly at risk of
undergoing this deeply rooted traditional and cultural practice,
WHO representative to Zambia, Edward Maganu, said at a workshop on
female genital mutilation in Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
Female genital mutilation is known to be prevalent in 27
African countries, and is predominant in the eastern and western
parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are over 120 million girls and women
who have undergone some form of genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
Maganu noted that while it is important to initiate girls into
womanhood, female genital mutilation has adverse effects on their
health and therefore is not the right way to initiate the girls.
</P>
<P>
He said that elimination of the practice would enhance women's
health, child survival and reduce the risk of contracting sexually
transmitted disease and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambian Deputy Minister of Health, Ernest Mwansa,
has cautioned African countries to approach the issue of female
genital mutilation with care.
</P>
<P>
Although harmful in some societies, female genital mutilation
is a way of life, an identity of the people which would not be
done away with overnight, the deputy minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He called for extensive research in female genital mutilation
if long- lasting and effective country measures are to be
developed and employed in the fight against the practice.

<HEADLINE> Officials to Take Further Measures to Curb Toxic Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Officials from over 100
countries began a week-long meeting Monday in the northern Swiss
city of Basel to discuss further measures aimed at protecting
people around the world from the dangers of hazardous and toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
A key target for the participants to the conference is to
approve a new protocol to the Basel Convention which has been
adopted by more than 130 countries. The new protocol will define
liability and compensation in cases where waste disposal damages
people's health or the environment.
</P>
<P>
They will also decide whether to improve the transfer of waste
management know-how to developing nations and establish a fund
that would assist those countries should they be faced with
hazardous waste accidents.
</P>
<P>
"Adopting the protocol would be a major breakthrough for
environmental protection," said Klaus Topfer, the executive
director of the U.N. Environment Program, ahead of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Greater efforts to minimize the generation of hazardous waste
and its transport across borders, and the introduction of a
liability and compensation regime would provide an additional

<HEADLINE> Third Chernobyl Reactor Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The third power unit of the
Chernobyl nuclear power station using an RMBK-1000 reactor was
switched on again to the Ukrainian power grid Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The unit was turned on after a piping defect was removed, the
Interfax news agency quoted the nuclear plant's press service as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, both turbo generators of the reactor started
to operate. The capacity of the unit was raised to 75 percent of
the nominal level that stands at 1,000 megawatts, and continues to
increase.
</P>
<P>
The reactor was shut down due to a failure of piping and cut
off from the power circuit, which was discovered during a routine
examination of equipment on the evening of December 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the press center of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
asserted that the radiation background in the territory of the
reactor was below normal level and no safety regulations were
broken.
</P>
<P>
The third reactor of the Chernobyl station was switched on on
November 26 after a prolonged planned repair that began on July 1
this year.

<HEADLINE> France to Host Conference on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- France will host a conference on
Africa from Tuesday in Paris, which will draw foreign ministers
from all African countries except Somalia, said French Foreign
Ministry officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been deprived of a national government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be a follow-up of the 20th French-African
summit held here one year ago, during which French President
Jacques Chirac, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and African
leaders called on all countries and forces involved in the war in
the Democratic Republic of Congo to stop fighting.
</P>
<P>
But one year after the appeal was made, actions of hostility
are still going on there despite a peace agreement signed in July
in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, the current president of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), will send its foreign minister, Ahmed Attaf, to the
conference for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Libya and Sudan, the two African countries which were not
invited to the summit last year, will send their foreign minister
or representative this time.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and Minister of
Cooperation Charles Josselin will discuss with their African
counterparts the situation in Africa over the past one year.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also decide the hosting country for the
next French-African summit, which is held every two years.
</P>
<P>
Mali and Cameroon have applied for hosting the next summit.

<HEADLINE> Relaxation of Regulations Important to Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Relaxation of trade regulations
is of great importance to global trade, a senior technical officer
of the World Customs Organization (WCO) said in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening up economies is expected to facilitate cooperation
among countries, Kameswari Subramanian told an international
senior customs officials seminar on free flow of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
"As countries strive for competency in terms of international
trade, it has been of significance to implement policies envisaged
on the accumulation of high revenue margins due to free flow of
goods and services among nations," the WCO official said.
</P>
<P>
She said there are efforts to facilitate the removal of
barriers to trade by simplifying and harmonizing customs
procedures throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said at the seminar
that the changing economic environment has been characterized by
globalization and regional integration, and reduction of both
tariff and non tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
He said revenue collection has to be done in a way that does
not disadvantage other nations.
</P>
<P>
Senior customs officials from Botswana, Cuba, Egypt, the
Gambia, Lesotho,

Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Uganda,
Zambia and Zimbabwe are attending the five-day seminar opened here
Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Block 25 Contracts: Iraqi Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British envoys at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee recently blocked 25 contracts Iraq signed
under the oil-for-food program, said an Iraqi Trade Ministry
spokesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sanctions Committee put on hold 19 Iraqi contracts during
its sessions held on December 1-3, the spokesman said, quoted by
Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were signed in the fifth and sixth phases of the
oil-for-food deal with companies from Italy, Belarus, Turkey,
Spain, India, China and France for the purchases of oil and
electricity spare parts, medicine and medical appliances, printing
materials, teaching labs and engineering equipment.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat
Mubarak said on Monday that U.S. and British envoys at the
Sanctions Committee recently suspended six contracts his ministry
concluded with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He said those contracts were for the purchases of children's
vaccines, insecticide, vaccines for measles and rabies and lab
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. humanitarian oil-for-food program, Iraq is
allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in oil over six months to
buy food, medicine and infrastructure-related materials for its
people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused U.S. and Britain of manipulating
the Sanctions Committee to deliberately hamper the endorsement of
its contracts signed with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq argues that the oil-for-food deal has failed to alleviate
the sufferings of the Iraqi people, and demands a lifting of the
nine-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Carter Describes Mozambique's Elections as "Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter who is leading 50 observers in Mozambique, said here Monday
that the Mozambican electoral process has been "overwhelmingly
free and fair".
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center set up by Carter had an observation mission
during the second multi-party general elections in the southern
African country at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The observers from 16 different countries visited about 650
polling stations in all 11 of the country's provincial
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the 1994 elections had been largely organized by the
United Nations, "this time it's a successful product of the people
of this country, " Carter said.
</P>
<P>
He regarded as "highly successful" the conduct both of the
voter registration in the July-September period and now the
elections themselves.
</P>
<P>
Carter said that Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the main opposition
 Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo), did not repeat his
Sunday's allegation that "electoral fraud" is being prepared.
</P>
<P>
The correct behavior of an opposition party that suspected
fraud would be "to file an official complaint with the evidence,"
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the observers have so far not come across any
evidence of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Counting took place at the polling stations on Sunday night.
Provincial results should be announced by December 12, and a week
later the National Elections Commission must announce the final
results.
</P>
<P>
Carter said that some of the observers would stay on to watch
the provincial count and the final tabulation of the results.
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center estimated voter turnout at over 70 percent,
with rates of 80 percent in some polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Carter also said the observers were impressed by "the large
number of women polling staff, and of women voters", noting that
"quite often the polling station chairperson was a woman."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma and his Southwest African People's Organization (SWAPO)
have won the presidential and parliamentary elections with more
than 75 percent of votes counted.
</P>
<P>
By early Monday afternoon, with counts outstanding from only two
of Namibia's 103 constituencies, Nujoma had taken 77 percent of
the vote in the presidential election and his SWAPO taken 76
percent in the parliamentary elections, South African Press
Association quoted Namibian Independent Electoral Commission as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, 70, who has led Namibia since independence in 1990, was
due to make an acceptance speech at 7:00 p.m. local time (1700
GMT) on Monday after the official announcement of the final
results from last week's vote, said Peter Mietzner, spokesman of
the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that the 10-month old Congress of Democrats
(COD), which took ten percent of the votes, had managed to depose
the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), which took nine percent,
as the official opposition.
</P>
<P>
Mietzner said the COD and the DTA combined were likely to get 15
seats in the 72-seat national assembly -- the same number the DTA
held by itself before the election.

<HEADLINE> No More Final-Status Talks Until Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians will not
proceed with further final-status talks with Israel until Israeli
government stops expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, said Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the 8th session of final-status talks with his
Israeli counterpart Oded Eran in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
Rabbo said the meeting failed to address the Palestinian refugee
issue as scheduled because of the latest development of Jewish
settlement activities, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the tenders issued Sunday by Israeli Housing
Ministry for constructing 500 new units in settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, adding that the final-status talks and
settlements expanding are totally incompatible things.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel's Peace Now organization had
said that since Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power five
months ago, his government has published building tenders for
3,196 homes in settlements, which had surpassed the former
government's annual average number.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, U.S. Middle East Special Coordinator Dennis
Ross failed to break the deadlock in the interim and
permanent-status talks when he met with Israeli and Palestinian
negotiation teams.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Sunday to prepare for the scheduled visit of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Israel on Tuesday
night. He also held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Barak earlier.
</P>
<P>
Israelis and the Palestinians hope that Albright could resolve
the impasse between them, although the two initial objectives of
her visit are to revive the Israeli-Syrian peace moves and to
advance Israeli-Palestinian talks on the final-status
issues.

<HEADLINE> WHO Signs Agreement to Fight Against Sleeping Disease in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) and a pharmaceutical company signed here Monday a license
agreement to expand production of a life-saving drug called
eflornithine to treat human African trypanosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 55 million people in 36 African countries
south of Sahara are exposed to the risk of contracting human
African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping disease. According
to health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the
number of deaths due to human trypanosomiasis at least equals to
the number of deaths due to AIDS in two provinces of the largest
central African country.
</P>
<P>
WHO and Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc have been collaborating for
20 years in the development of eflornithine to treat human African
trypanosomiasis. The agreement signed Monday will allow other WHO
partners to produce and distribute the drug.
</P>
<P>
Technology transfer from Hoechst Marion Roussel will take place
once WHO has found a new partner in the private sector capable of
producing eflornithine.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Meet Clinton Over Middle East Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 6 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to bring together
the different strands of his Middle East peace initiative, former
South African President Nelson Mandela is to fly to Seattle
Tuesday to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The US is a key player in any peace settlement in the region,
Mandela said at a press conference in Cape Town Monday.
</P>
<P>
Once leaders like Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
had become fully involved, the load on him would lessen and he
would be able to give more attention to peace efforts in a country
like Burundi, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela stressed that any settlement in the Middle East has to
be a joint responsibility and collective action of all parties
involved.
</P>
<P>
All initiatives should now be harmonized "so we speak with one
voice", he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Middle East peace initiatives over the past 25
years had been unsuccessful because countries had been pushing
their own interests, Mandela noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the three key elements of his peace proposals:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has to make an undertaking to withdraw from all the
territories it had conquered in the 1967 seven-day war;
</P>
<P>
-- Arab states have to realize Israel could not withdraw from
all the territories until they stated they recognized the Jewish
state's right to exist within secure boundaries; and
</P>
<P>
-- An international commission has to be set up comprising the
main Arab states, Israel and the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Kuchma Discuss Chechnya, Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kuchma, discussed here
Monday the problems of Chechnya, bilateral relations, European
security and cooperation at the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, who
arrived here for a brief working visit earlier Monday, told
reporters that he discussed with President Boris Yeltsin the
entire spectrum of questions related to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma expressed his support to Yeltsin on the Russian anti-
terrorist operations in the rebelling republic of Chechnya,
Yeltsin's senior aide Sergei Prikhodko told reporters after the
Yeltsin-Kuchma meeting.
</P>
<P>
The presidents stressed that Kuchma was the first foreign
leader with whom Yeltsin met after his recovery from the latest
pneumonia, as well as the fact that Kuchma's first official trip
abroad after his re-election on the post of Ukrainian state head
was to Russia, said Prikhodko.
</P>
<P>
This is evidence of the importance attached by both countries
to the development of bilateral ties, Kuchma noted.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also discussed the settlement of Ukraine's debts
to Russia for fuel supplies. The possibility of debt restructuring
and steps that have to be taken were raised by the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kuchma agreed in principle on restructuring Ukraine
's debts to Russia, said Prikhodko.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma told the press the talks on debt restructuring will
begin soon.
</P>
<P>
He noted that retail trade between the two countries has been
steadily declining and "there are economic and political reasons
for that."
</P>
<P>
He called the fall in bilateral trade impermissible. "Economy
is politics. Therefore this (a sharp fall in trade turnover)
should by no means be permitted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also said the sides confirmed cooperation plans in the
production of AN-70, TU-334 and AN-140 planes. "This is a priority
of all our plans: current and in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his impression of Yeltsin's health condition, he
said the Russian president "looks well, energetic and cheerful."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Committee Finds About 54,000 Holocaust-Era Unclaimed Accounts in Swiss                  Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- An international committee
investigating Swiss banks have found about 54,000 unclaimed
accounts that may be linked to Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53,886 such accounts, about 10 times as much as the
Swiss banks themselves had said they had discovered, were found as
a result of three-year search of 59 Swiss banks for accounts
opened while the Nazis held power in neighboring Germany from 1933
to 1945, according to a report published Monday by the Independent
Committee of Eminent Persons.
</P>
<P>
The probe also included about 30,000 closed accounts. The
committee, established in 1996 by Swiss bankers and Jewish groups
and chaired by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A.
Volcker, recommended that the names of the 25,000 dormant accounts
should be made public so that relatives can file claims. Two years
ago, Swiss banks published 5,559 names on missing account holders
who lived outside Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
While auditors found no evidence of systematic destruction of
dormant account information, some banks were criticized for
stonewalling by the committee in its final report.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee praised the Swiss banks' cooperation in
uncovering the truth about the dormant accounts and said attitudes
had clearly changed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Swiss Bankers Association said it considered the
report fair, and said it regretted cases of improper behavior
listed by the report.

<HEADLINE> British Companies Lag In Capital Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- British companies are continuing
to invest at levels well below their international competitors,
underpinning Britain's poor productivity record, according to an
official survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the 1999 Capex Scoreboard, a survey of capital
spending by 500 British and 300 international companies, Lord
Sainsbury, science minister, warned several sectors needed to wake
up to the challenge posed by big foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Across all the 33 industrial sectors, British companies last
year spent 75 billion pounds on plant and equipment. That amounted
to 10,000 pounds for each of their employees, compared with 15,200
pounds for international businesses.
</P>
<P>
Six companies alone -- Shell, BP Amoco, BT, Cable &AMP; Wireless,
British Airways and Railtrack -- account for a quarter of the 75
billion pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
The UK spends just 9.2 percent of its total capital expenditure
on physics-based companies, compared with a 23.2 percent share for
international companies. In telecoms, it spends 9.7 percent,
compared with 17 percent internationally.
</P>
<P>
Norman Price, an industrialist in the Department of Trade and
Industry, said: "Capital spending is material wrapped around
knowledge. Without it and other knowledge investment, companies
will struggle to innovate and remain competitive in the global
market."

BRUSSELS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
foreign ministers expressed "deep concern" over the current
situation in Chechnya when they met here to prepare for this week'
s EU summit in Helsinki, urging the Russian government to refrain
from using excessive force in Chechnya and to respect the
principles of international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
In a conclusion about today's meeting, the ministers said the
present campaign and "the unacceptable threat to the people of
Grozny can only perpetuate, not break, the cycle of violence in
the Northern Caucasus".
</P>
<P>
They said the EU is deeply worried by the news that civilians
in Grozny have been given an ultimatum to leave by December 11 or
face annihilation. The ministers hold the Russian government
responsible for the humanitarian situation in the region and urge
it to fulfill its commitments under international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
They said the EU Council of ministers "considers it of the
utmost importance that the international humanitarian aid agencies
are able to assist the victims of the Chechen war".
</P>
<P>
They also urged the Chechen authorities to respect the rules
and principles of humanitarian law, to condemn terrorism and to
aim at the renewal of a political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, all the 15 ministers of the EU member
states also reiterated the EU's position on the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation and its resolute condemnation
of terrorism in all its forms.

Kofi Annan on Monday opened a private meeting at U.N. Headquarters
to form an international partnership against HIV\AIDS in Africa by
calling for response to the epidemic which he said would make
humanity live up to its name.
</P>
<P>
He urged Governments to "break the conspiracy of silence at

and make effective treatments available and affordable and to
speed up work on developing a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that over the next two days, the participants in
this private meeting should join together to develop a plan of
action no later than next May that could be used to cut the rate
of HIV infections among the young by 25 percent by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Our response so far has failed Africa," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting includes representatives from African and

<HEADLINE> Canadian Nurses Warn of Shortage of 100,000 by 2021 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Nurses Association(
CNA) are warning of a shortfall of 100,000 nurses by 2021, while a
group of doctors said the country needs a yearly 540 to 600
additional doctors, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its recent letter to the country's federal and provincial
health ministers, CNA said the average age of a nurse is now 47
and there are fewer entering the profession than those retiring.
</P>
<P>
Only 5 percent of nurses are under the age of 30, CNA said,
warning" such a lack of registered nursing staff in the health-
care system will pose a serious threat to public safety."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a task force of Canadian doctors said in their
documents that they believe about 3.5 percent of the now 56,000
Canadian doctors will retire, die, emigrate or leave practice each
year.
</P>
<P>
In the backdrop of a yearly increase of 350,000 in the country'
s population, Canada requires 540 to 600 additional doctors
annually, they said.
</P>
<P>
The documents indicate the current shortage of doctors and
nurses will only grow worse in the next decade as the aging
population requires more health care.

ADDIS ABABA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said here Monday that his country will not accept the
technical arrangement for an end to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict
unless the document was prepared to guarantee its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The technical arrangement was drafted by some parties who were
not part of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) framework
agreement from the start, Meles told Ethiopian TV, noting the
document has failed to ensure the sovereignty of Ethiopia.

Saying the technical arrangement has distorted and revised the
peace proposals, Meles stressed that only the African heads of
state and government have the mandate to change the peace
proposals endorsed at the consecutive OAU summits in Ouagadougou
and Algiers.

<P>
Ethiopia could say the technical arrangement has become in line
with the OAU peace package if only it ensured the return of the
previous Ethiopian civilian administration with all its

ADDIS ABABA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- There is no scarcity of
basic medicines and medical equipment at present in Ethiopia, an
official with the Ethiopian Drug Administration and Control said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are reliable basic medicines for malaria, tuberculosis,
mother and child care, family planning and vaccines, said
Mengestab Wolde-Aregai.
</P>
<P>
Medicines and medical equipment are imported through donation,
credit, as well as importers and wholesale enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mengestab noted that there could be artificial
shortage of basic medicines due to lack of coordinated efforts and
delay of supply.
</P>

According to the official, Ethiopia imported medicines and
medical equipment worth 700 million birr (about 85 million U.S.
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, medicines and medical equipment worth some 250 million
birr (31 million dollars) were also secured from donors and
distributed to states to implement regular and pressing programs
of the Ministry of Health, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are five pharmaceutical and medical equipment
factories, 70 wholesale distributors, 2,300 drug stores, as well

<HEADLINE> IATA: High Level of Y2K Readiness in All Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of airports, including
the major international hubs, have reported that their Y2K
programs are complete and ready for the Millennium rollover,
according to a press release here Monday by the International Air
Transport Association(IATA).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of IATA Board of Governors, Director
General Pierre Jeanniot said, "Data received by IATA shows a high
level of readiness in all regions. Critical systems and equipment
have been reviewed. ATS compliance progress is good. Regional and
global air traffic contingency plans are complete and ready for
deployment. The number of entities reporting completion of their
Y2K programs and business backup plans rises each day."
</P>
<P>
For the past 18 months, IATA has spearheaded an initiative with
industry infrastructure partners to obtain up-to-date Y2K
readiness information. Airports, air traffic service providers,
key industry suppliers, and customs authorities have submitted
data to IATA concerning their Year 2000 preparations and
contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
The international carriers are able to monitor the Y2K
readiness for over 1600 airports, representing 97 percent of
international traffic, and 200 air traffic centers, covering all
major international routes, that have participated in this project.
This data is regularly updated by participating entities to
provide the airlines with an accurate picture.
</P>
<P>
As a further precaution in this safety-conscious industry, IATA
will join the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in
manning eight world-wide centers to monitor the situation,
tracking eventual developments and keeping the airlines informed.
</P>
<P>
Qantas CEO James Strong, and Chairman of the IATA Board of
Governors, said: "Responding to the potential problems associated
with Year 2000 has stimulated an unprecedented level of energy,
time and
financial commitments within the airline industry. We have
demonstrated our determination to beat the so-called Millennium
Bug, and we believe we will be ready to satisfy customer travel
and cargo needs."

<HEADLINE> Panama Denies US Prepared Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 6 (Xinhua)-- The Panamanian government
denied Monday the United States supervised the elaboration of the
Strategic Plan of National Security after taking out of American
forces from the canal.
</P>
<P>
Panama's Head of the Public Security Council and National
Defense Pablo Quinetero Luna said, "Panamanian authorities no
longer are kinder children needing to have their teacher at one
side."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Miguel Bush said last Friday that Washington
prepared the document regarding Panama's national security made
known recently by Panama's Interior and Justice Minister Winston
Spadafora.
</P>
<P>
United States only guided and backed Panama's government
indicating to it where more care should be taken and indicating
sensitive points in the area of the interoceanioc Canal, said the
Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
According to Quintero Luna, it's time to leave "the Pentagon
umbrella", referring to the strong tutorship that for nearly one
century successive American governments held upon this Central
American country.
</P>
<P>
The Strategic Plan of National Security, presented by
Panamanian government, views as risk factors the exit of U.S.
forces from Panama, drug traffic, corruption and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
According to this plan, with the exit of American soldiers, a
dissuading factor favorable for the Canal's safety will stop. The
Canal will be handed back by United States to Panama on December
31.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop risk factors, the Strategic Plan anticipated
establishing a network of international accords for structuring a
national security system based on bilateral agreements, set to
guarantee a sure and neutral transit of the Canal.
</P>
<P>
Although an accord between United States and Panama isn't
mentioned, Panamanian political analysts consider that with this
Strategic Plan doors are opened for a novel agreement guaranteeing
U.S. military influence after year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) - London is a leading center for
international legal services, according to a report launched
Monday by British Invisibles (BI).
</P>
<P>
Out of the largest 50 firms in the world there are more based
in London than any other center - 10, compared with 9 in New York,
5 in Chicago and 4 in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
While a core expertise in English law has been pivotal to the
success of City law firms some have also developed a capability in
New York state law to enable firms to offer a broader service to
their clients, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing business in financial markets has helped to
drive growth in fee income, with law firms' overseas earnings
rising to 790 million pounds in 1998, an increase of more than 50
percent from 511 million pounds in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of the report, Jeremy Seddon, chief
executive of BI said: "The leading position of City law firms
reflects the dominant position of London as an international
financial center and, in particular, the growth of business
generated by investment banks."
</P>
<P>
"City law firms have applied a wide range of business
management disciplines to the conduct of their practice, for
example embracing technology to a much greater extent than is
typical in law firms elsewhere," he added.

LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The UK's manufacturing sector is
continuing to recover from the past year's lows, according to the
latest figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production rose 0.2 percent in October, but was up
by a more robust 1.5 percent on the year, the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing saw a 1.3 percent improvement on the year, the
strongest rise for two years. The three-monthly figures pointed to
a rise of 1 percent for the sector and for industrial production
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Economists said despite the persistent strength of the pound
this was the best performance for nearly 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is due to
announce its decision on interest rates this week, with a majority
of economists expecting no change in the current level of 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here believe that the latest figures put
some pressure on the MPC to raise interest rates this month and
take some of the heat out of the economy.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Condemns Assault in Medeliin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Minister
of Mines and Energy Luis Carlos Valenzuela condemned Monday the
attack against state energy firm ISAGEN in Medellin.
</P>
<P>
It is a completely barbarous thing. This isn't an attack
against one company, it's an attack against the entire economic
welfare of the civilian population, said Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
Medellin Police said that a white car loaded with 25 kilos of
dynamite exploded earlier this morning, causing at least one
wounded in the six storey building of ISAGEN's main site.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government has planned to sell 75 percent of
ISAGEN's state share package. ISAGEN is one of the country's
largest energy generators with an installed capacity of 1,636
megavolts.
</P>
<P>
The sale had been anticipated for the start of this month, but
there has been delay due to debate between congressmen, the
government and syndicates regarding the price and the company that
would acquire the share package.

<HEADLINE> Three People Killed in Assault on Armored Cash-carrying Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, the local police on the
scene said the lead armored car of two traveling in convoy was
violently rammed by a truck on a provincial highway near Lecce, on
the heel of the Italian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
One of the armed guards killed may have died in the collision,
they said.
</P>
<P>
At that point, the driver of the second armored car attempted
to make a U-turn but was blocked by a Nissan Patrol 4-wheel drive
vehicle and gunmen who stepped out firing.
</P>
<P>
The assailants then used explosives to open up the armored car
in blasts which killed two of the occupants instantly.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six armed guards, none of whom had time to draw
their weapons, were injured by shots fired by the assailants
during the robbery.
</P>
<P>
Police said the robbers than made their getaway aboard the
Nissan Patrol and another automobile with the contents of both
armored cars, estimated at about three billion lire (about 1.58
million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
They also recalled a similar assault in the vicinity on
November 2 on a lone armored car operated by the same company, the
Velialpol Security Agency, which netted the robbers more than one
billion lire(about 526,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the cash was intended for distribution to post
offices for the payment of pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, on the other side of the Gulf of Taranto, gunmen
firing Kalashnikovs and pistols overwhelmed the driver of an
armored car and an armed guard on a state highway near southern
city of Cosenza, in central Calabria region, and made off with 600
million lire (about 316,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both occupants of the armored car were hospitalized in Cosenza
with injuries which were reportedly not serious.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Plans to Join WTO in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan plans to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in the nearest two years, said
Kazakh Economy Minister Zhaksybek Kulekeyev Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Kulekeyev told a press
conference in the Kazakh capital of Astana that Kazakhstan
announced its application for the WTO membership in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to name any concrete date, he said, adding that
"this will depend not only on Kazakhstan, but also on WTO member
states with which Kazakhstan will have to hold bilateral talks and
sign appropriate agreements."
</P>
<P>
The WTO demands low customs tariffs on goods and services from
its members. Kazakhstan has already submitted its proposals on
shaping customs tariffs to the WTO, said Kulekeyev.
</P>
<P>
Now the country has a real chance of becoming a WTO member
within the next two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
After joining the WTO, Kazakhstan will gain real access to the
world's markets by exporting textiles, fabrics, food stuffs and
other items to the West, although today the nation mostly exports
raw and other materials, Kulekeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Kazakhstan's future WTO membership would not
affect the trading ties among the CIS (the Commonwealth of
Independent States) Customs Union countries, which includes
Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Advisor Terms Settlement Expansion Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official has
termed the continued settlement activities cause of the crisis
that has deadlocked the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, media advisor to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat made the remarks Tuesday in
response to Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran's claim that the
PNA was trying to create a crisis on the eve of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's visit to Israel on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Abu Rudeineh said Albright will convey the message to Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak that Israel's settlement policy will
hinder the final-status talks and settlements expansion is illegal
according to international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the international community supports the
Palestinian demands for a cessation of settlement activities, and
warned that continued settlement activities will lead to the
collapse of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side boycotted the eighth session of the
final-status negotiations Monday, saying no more talks if Israel
does not stop settlements building.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ministry of Housing issued tenders for building 500 new
housing units in two settlements in the West Bank, which angered
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a meeting between Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat and Eran scheduled for Tuesday in Jerusalem for the
transition-phase negotiations has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
During her stay in Israel, Albright will hold talks with Barak,
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on the peace process,
particularly the final-status and interim phase negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a
bid to defuse the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Monday that
Albright would tell Israeli officials that settlement activities
stood in the way to a final peace agreement expected next
September.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has softened its stance on the settlement
issue, with on Monday evening reaffirming that no new tenders were
issued for settlements building, saying that such buildings would
harm the prestige of Israel worldwide and would damage
negotiations with the Palestinians.

NEW DELHI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia Tuesday
inked two agreements to jointly develop application software based
on Indian PARAM-10000 supercomputer and to forge a joint venture
for manufacturing silicon wafers and devices used by the
semiconductor and electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed here at the concluding session of

India will share hardware costs of the center.
</P>
<P>
He said that India planned to procure silicon crystals from the
Center for Advanced Materials and Machines in Siberia and
manufacture silicon wafers and devices at the Central Electronics
Ltd at Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh, which would be marketed in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in
Pune, west India's Maharashtra state, which built PARAM-10000,

<HEADLINE> Thai Refinery Ordered to Shut Down for Three Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Industry Ministry of
Thailand Tuesday ordered Thai Oil Co. to shut down its refinery,
which was badly damaged in the fire over the weekend, for three
months.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman told reporters that the three-month
closure period will start from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that if the refinery can be repaired earlier,
the ministry will consider shortening the closure period.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's decision came after an inspection to the
refinery, which is located in an industrial zone some 90
kilometers southeast of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
An explosion occurred in the refinery at late Thursday night
and the fire afterwards raged on for 35 hours before being put out
on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The fire killed seven people and destroyed some 40 million
liters of gasoline in four storage tanks, causing the company 500
to 800 million baht (12.9 to 20.7 million U.S. dollars) in losses.
</P>
<P>
In wake of the disaster, the Industry Ministry decided to
inspect over 100 plants which carry risks of explosion and are
located in community areas.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of the inspection will be placed on industrial
plants with petrochemical, oil and explosive materials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand played down
speculations that suspension of the operation of Thai Oil's plant,
one of the country's largest oil refineries, will affect local
gasoline supplies.
</P>
<P>
Five other refineries, which had been running below their
capacities, are able to substitute the supply.

officials, has accumulated a lot of valuable experience and set a
good example for the People's Liberation Army, Chi said.
</P>
<P>

training of foreign military officials should be expanded as an
important way of international military co-operation and a way to
improve the unity and co-operation with other countries.

HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The official foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong amounted to 92.1 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of November 1999, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Including unsettled forward contracts, the foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong at the end of November 1999 stood at 92.6
billion U.S. dollars, compared with 90.4 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of October.
</P>
<P>
According to an HKMA spokesperson, the 1.7-billion-U.S.-dollar
increase in settled foreign currency assets during the month
reflects mainly the conversion into U.S. dollars as part of the
proceeds from the sale of Hong Kong equities through the Tracker
Fund.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong is the
world's fifth largest holder of foreign currency reserves after
Japan, the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign currency assets of 92.1 billion U.S. dollars
represent over seven times the currency in circulation or about 38
percent of Hong Kong dollar M3, one of the highest ratios in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Universities Encouraged to Implement AIDS-Free Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Universities in Malaysia
are encouraged to set up clubs with the government financial and
other assistance to promote AIDS-free life style among
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is actively encouraging tertiary
institutions to set up such clubs to help in the government's anti-
aids programs and the ministry will provide these clubs with
advisory service, expertise and also financial aid, Health
Services Department Deputy Director-General Abdul Aziz Mahmood
said Tuesday in Kuala Terengganu, some 450 kilometers northeast
from here, according to Bernama News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages tertiary institutions to take part in
the anti-aids programs as adults in the 20-39 age group formed the
largest segment of the country's HIV/AIDS sufferers, he said,
adding that of the 32,297 HIV/AIDS cases detected in Malaysia from
1986 to September last year, 28,816 involved those in the age
group.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's other efforts in enhancing public awareness
about the Aids scourge include screening expectant mothers for HIV,
the virus that causes Aids since 1986, the official told reporters
after launching the national-level World Aids Day celebration
there.
</P>
<P>
Of the 250,000 expectant mothers screened since then, only 100
were HIV-infected and given treatment, following which only five
of the babies delivered inherited the disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the World Health Organization (WHO) had
forecast significant increase in the number of HIV/Aids sufferers
in the first three years of the new century especially among
teenagers world-wide.

</P>
<P>
The Saudis, who reached the second round of USA '94 and also
qualified for France '98, has been paired with Vietnam, Bangladesh
and Mongolia, all which are hard to cause problems to Saudi Arabia,
currently ranked by FIFA the top team in Asia.
</P>
<P>
China also have a kinder group although they need to clear the
hurdle set by Indonesia, the strongest of the second-ranked Asian
teams. The other members of Group nine are Maldives and Cambodia,
which was recently brushed out of the Asian Cup by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Asian Games champions Iran face a tougher task in group two,
which includes former Soviet republic Tajikstan, as well as
minnows Myanmar and Guam.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also has a hard job as they are obliged to battle another
former Soviet republic, Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's prospects of reaching the second qualifying round
were given a boost when they were drawn in group five with Lebanon,
Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>

divided into two groups of five teams. The two winners of the
final round groups qualify for the finals in Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>

European group runner-up in a further play-off. The winner of this
play-off qualifies for the finals.

vs Gambia, South Africa vs Lesotho and Tunisia vs Mauritania with
the minnows having home advantage first.
</P>

Tanzania drew 0-0 at home and lost 2-1 away in their previous
clash and a recent Olympic Games qualifier between the countries
also produced two tight matches before Ghana advanced.

<P>
DAMASCUS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived here from Saudi Arabia Tuesday
afternoon for a one-day visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
She was welcomed at the Damascus International Airport by her
Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
The visit was aimed at reviving the Syrian-Israeli peace talks
which have been stalled since February 1996 and making further
progress in the implementation of the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum
signed in September by the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright is to hold talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and Sharaa on the Middle East peace process soon after her arrival.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Albright's ongoing multi-leg regional
tour which has taken her to Saudi Arabia, highlighted anew the
crucial U.S. role in the peace process in the Middle East with
special attention attached to the Syrian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Albright's Middle East tour, which will also take
her to Israel, Palestinian territories and Egypt, Washington
renewed its commitment to a comprehensive peace in the region and
pledged full cooperation with the parties concerned towards that
goal.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria have expressed willingness to resume peace
negotiations but differ on where to begin with. Assad insisted
that Israel keep its verbal promise to return the Golan Heights it
captured in 1967 from Syria, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
rejected such a precondition.
</P>
<P>
Barak had vowed to try to put an end to the Israeli-Arab
conflicts. Efforts were being made to conclude a final peace
agreement with the Palestinians while seeking a resumption of
peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Engineer Syndicate Assembly in
Syria on Monday, Assistant Secretary General of the ruling Ba'ath
party Solieman Kadah expressed welcome to all international
efforts and initiatives to revive the peace talks on the
Syrian-Israeli track.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa, also Chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Party of
Tanzania (CCM), insists that serious issues, such as the
constitutional reform, must get the approval of the party, local
media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a gathering of thousands of CCM members and
supporters here on Monday to commend the government for its
handling of the illness, death and burial of former president
Julius Nyerere, Mkapa said recommendations of the Presidential
Committee on proposed constitutional reform must be approved by
CCM before they are sent to the parliament for any changes.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper quoted him as saying the report on
constitutional reform, the White Paper Report, was made public
last Saturday and had been discussed by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"However, before it is sent to Parliament, the report and the
views of the Cabinet must pass the test of the CCM Central
Committee and the National Executive Committee (NEC) to ensure
that it is in agreement with party policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that in handling the report, the government would
respect the public views as well as the party policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said, nobody could push the government
on how to treat the recommendations contained in the report, even
the opposition could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
CCM stands for a two-government structure (the Union government
and the Zanzibar government) in the country. It is reported that
the majority of the interviewees favored the status quo, but the
constitutional reform committee recommended a three-government
union (the Union government, the mainland government and the
Zanzibar government) on grounds that the interviewees' opinions
were conditional and did not meet current demands.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa formed the constitutional reform committee last year to
seek public opinions on constitutional reforms and the committee
handed him a report in June this year, which was made public by
the State House last Saturday.

<P>
LAGOS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States congressmen
have pledged debt relief for Nigeria and the recovery of stolen
money in American banks to facilitate the growth of democracy in
the country.
</P>
<P>
When a group of U.S. congressmen visited Nigeria's National
Assembly in Abuja on Monday, some of them said that they believed
in debt relief rather than debt rescheduling, Daily Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the visiting American congress delegation led
by House Minority Leader Richard Gephart have initiated a lobby
group to seek for the remittance of billions of Dollars illegally
stashed away in American banks by unscrupulous Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Maxine Waters, member of the delegation which arrived here last
Sunday, said that American congress was aware of the heavy debt
Nigeria owed international communities and would rather see some
of such cancelled than rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
On recovery of Nigeria's stole wealth abroad, she said that
American congress was willing to help Nigeria recover any of her
stolen money in American banks.
</P>
<P>
During a recent state visit to Washington, President Olusegun
Obasanjo appealed to President Bill Clinton to write off the debt
owed the United States as the West african country is being
weighed down by huge foreign debts totalling about 30 billion
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The American lawmakers who are on a ten-day visit to three
African countries are scheduled to meet President Obasanjo,
Foreign Minister Sule Lamido and other officials before leaving
for Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>

Highlights of the trip will include the dedication of a
U.S.-funded HIV/ AIDS counselling and testing center in Hwange,
Zimbabwe, and the signing of an Overseas Private Investment
Corporation agreement in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, according to
an official of the American embassy to Nigeria.

BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, chairman of China's
National People's Congress Standing Committee, met today with a
Japanese delegation from the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun led by
Editor-in-Chief Oikawa Shoichi.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Japan are neighboring countries and they
should continue their friendship for generations. He called for
governmental and non-governmental efforts in both countries,
including efforts from the press, to help achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
As one of the largest newspapers in Japan that has
international influence, Yomiuri Shimbun should strive to promote
mutual understanding between the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated the hope that Japan would abide by the principles
set in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, the bilateral treaty of
peace and friendship and the bilateral joint declaration, and
strengthen bilateral cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
"It not only acts for the interest of both peoples, but
benefits regional and world peace and stability as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also answered questions on Japan's relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Shoichi said that now that the elder generation who first built
the friendship between Japan and China have passed away, the
younger generation should carry on their will to promote the
friendship. He promised that Yomiuri Shimbun will use its
advantage to contribute to the relationship.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Ruling Party Denies Claims by Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's ruling Frelimo
(Frente de Libertacao de Mocambique) Monday denied claims made by
Renamo (Resistencia Nacional de Mocambique), the former rebel
movement, on provoking violence during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Renamo earlier accused Frelimo of harassing its members and
preventing them from carrying out election campaign activities in
the districts of Changara, Cahora Bassa and Magoe, all in the
western province of Tete, according to Mozambican News Agency
report.
</P>
<P>
Mariano Matsinha, head of the Frelimo election office, told a
Maputo press conference that there had indeed been violence in
these three districts, but he blamed Renamo for having started it.
</P>
<P>
The worst incident was in Changara, where a gang of about 40
Renamo supporters from outside the area "invaded" the district
capital Luenha, Matsinha said.
</P>
<P>
"They beat up people, including an old man. The local people
were revolted at this and turned on them," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Matsinha, the Renamo supporters then fled and took
refuge in the police station. The police then evacuated them to
Tete city.
</P>
<P>
He said the incident had nothing to do with Sergio Vieira,
rapporteur of the current Frelimo parliamentary group, who was
coordinating much of the Frelimo campaign in Tete. Renamo claimed
that Vieira had "orchestrated" the Changara events.
</P>
<P>
Matsinha said he regretted that Renamo has not escaped from its
normal behaviour of denigrating all the processes and institutions
that are fighting for the real democratization of the country, and
for the normalization of the life of Mozambican citizens.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis
during 1997-1998 has changed the environment quite significantly
for the banking and financial sector in the region, a financer
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis brought forward and compressed the
timeframe that banks in every countries have to change their
business models or change the way they are doing things, Nazif
Mohammed, general manager for Oracle Corporation South Asia region
financial services industry, said at a press conference here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a period beyond five to 10 years from now, only
the big banks will survive while the smaller ones would have to
merge with larger players to be able to attract customers and make
the investment required.
</P>
<P>
He saw the need for the banks to understand their customers,
what products and services the customers buy from the banks and
the profit the customers contribute to the bank.
</P>
<P>
"Before the crisis, banks in Malaysia were looking at year 2000-
2010 for the deregulations but now with the crisis, the banks are
internally forced to consolidate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that as long as the Malaysian environment is
protected, the banks here are relatively safe.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright left Riyadh for Syria Tuesday after
wrapping up her two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, during which she
discussed with Saudi leaders the Iraq issue and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is on a Middle East tour which also includes
Syria, Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, held
talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz after arriving in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh late Monday.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told a
news conference in Riyadh Monday night that Albright and Saudi
leaders reviewed the efforts at the U.N. Security Council aimed at
forging a mechanism on dealing with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who is accompanying Albright, said the two sides agreed
on the importance of the Security Council's endorsement of a
decision to set up an appropriate mechanism on suspension of
international sanctions on Iraq if it agrees to the return of the
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has been debating on a draft
resolution which calls for the return of arms inspectors to Iraq
in exchange for a suspension of sanctions which have been in place
since Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A body of mostly Western nations at the United Nations is set
to vote this week in the Security Council on the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
Washington strongly advocates a resumption of the U.N. arms
inspection mission in Iraq, which was aborted after the
U.S.-British air-strikes against Iraqi targets last December.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq is demanding the sanctions lifted unconditionally,
insisting that its banned weapons of mass destruction have already
been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
According to Rubin, the U.S. top diplomat also briefed her
Saudi hosts on Washington's efforts to push forward the Middle
East peace process, mainly on the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
A new round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians on an
overdue Israeli withdrawal from 5 percent of the West Bank
stumbled into deadlock after the government of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak issued more tenders Sunday for construction of
Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
But diplomatic sources in Riyadh said Albright would like to
see the two sides work out their difference over the planned
Israeli pullback on the table on their own, according to the
Kuwait News Agency.

BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Jordanian King
Abdullah II Bin Al-Hussein said today he hoped that Chinese
entrepreneurs will take advantage of the many commercial
opportunities in Jordan and invest there.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the China-Jordan Economic and Trade
Seminar sponsored by China's Council for Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT), Abdullah II said that Jordan boasts a
high-quality workforce, and offers preferential policies in
taxation to foreign companies in its industrial zone. Moreover,
Jordan's bilateral trade agreements with the European Union and
other countries make Jordan an ideal spot for Chinese enterprises
to expand their markets.
</P>
<P>
The King also vowed to ensure the success of bilateral trade
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, president of the CCPIT, said that China's economic
and trade ties with Jordan remain at a low level, with bilateral
trade volume only hitting 160 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yu suggested that both countries take up various forms of
cooperation in such areas as capital, technology and personnel
exchange. "We have technologies and products that suit Jordan, and
we would like to help Jordan in its economic construction," he
said.

<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Crops Research
 Institute Tuesday called on the sub-Saharan countries to grow
drought resistant crops in order to alleviate perennial food
shortages in the region.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Leslie Swindale, Interim Director of the
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics,
at a three-day workshop looking into the revival of agricultural
village level studies in Africa and Asia held in Matopos of west
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in Africa do not encourage their farmers to grow
drought resistant crops such as sorghum and millet but put more
emphasis on maize which suited areas with good rains, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is too much government pressure on farmers to grow maize
instead of sorghum and millet because maize is considered to be
more profitable. However, this has resulted in food shortages as
maize tends not to do well when there is little rainfall," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a general shortage of sorghum and millet seeds
which he blamed on government policies.
</P>
<P>
The director told the workshop that his research institute has
done a lot of research and come up with different crop varieties
that are drought resistant.

concerning payment, labor security, hygienic conditions, insurance
and welfare of employees should be discussed equally among
employees and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that all the enterprises should introduce the
collective contract system, which can play an important role in
protecting employees' benefits.
</P>
<P>
Experience from the Beijing Jeep Co. Ltd and other companies in
Beijing has proved that the system is beneficial for promoting the
reform, development and stability of enterprises, Wei concluded.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Employment Continue to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that employment in the Philippines is expected to rise
between 3.31 percent to 3.57 percent annually from 1999 and reach
33.94 million to 34.44 million by 2004.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Department of Labor and
Employment(DOLE) said that the government's efforts to make skills
and training even more effective and relevant to boot the
employability and competitiveness of marginalized, vulnerable and
disadvantaged workers, will propel the nation's employment growth
beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate, on the other hand, is projected at 7.8
percent by 2004, it said.
</P>
<P>
The DOLE said that the key employment generators would include
infrastructure building, trade and investment, small and medium
enterprise development, tourism as well as agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said employment
gains were registered in many areas nationwide in 1999, boosting
the nation's efforts to overcome the effects of last year's
debilitating drought and a regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The positive employment trend in the first three quarters of
1999 has enabled the nation to offset and surmount the negative
declines in jobs last year, Laguesma said.
</P>
<P>
Labor and employment statistics showed that the total number of
employed persons rose by 2.4 percent, 5.9 percent and 4.3 percent
in January, April and July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The labor chief said the recent employment gains would pave the
way for greater progress in the year 2000 and beyond.

<HEADLINE> England to Meet Germany in 2002 World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Arch rivals England and Germany
will have to battle each other for the one automatic qualifying
spot from the same group as the draw was made on Tuesday for the
qualifying competition of the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Ironically the two nationals are also the rivals to win the bid
to stage the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
England, which failed to be listed among the top seeds for the
nine European groups, was dramatically drew with Germany in group
nine, which also featured Greece, Finland and Albania.
</P>
<P>
Germany, a three-time champion, and England, which beat Germany
for its only title when it hosted the 1966 World Cup, have had a
long history at major championships.
</P>
<P>
In their last championship match, Germany beat England in the
semi-finals of the 1996 European Championships, before going on to
win the title.
</P>
<P>
Italy, another traditional powerhouse which failed to obtain
top seeding, also faced a daunting task as they were paired with
Romania, Lithuania, Hungary and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, a perennial World Cup favorite but never a
champion, also got a tough draw after they are placed in a six-
team group with Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus, Andorra
and Estonia.
</P>
<P>
In aother tough European group Euro 2000 finalists Yugoslavia
and Slovenia were drawn with Russia and Switzerland in group one.
</P>
<P>
Only groups winners qualify directly for the finals to be
played June 1-30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Eight runners-up will go into playoff to determine four more
finalists, while another runner-up will face an Asian team for the
last place that could go to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The draw in a modernistic, ship-shaped Tokyo exhibition hall
started the countdown to the first World Cup to be shared by two
hosts, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
A record 195 nations and regions took part in the draw, while
defending champions France and the two hosts Japan and South Korea
qualify directly.
</P>
<P>
The qualifying process, which begins in March and involves
hundreds of matches, will eventually produce 29 other finalists.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Heads to U.S. For Medical Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah left here Tuesday
for the United States to receive further medical check-ups and
treatment, state-run Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, who spent more than two months in Britain this
summer receiving medical check-ups and treatment, cut short his
stay and returned to Kuwait late October to attend the inaugural
session of the second term of the 9th parliament.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, who usually receives medical services in London,
told editors-in-chief of local newspapers on Sunday that "despite
the advice of my doctors who asked me not to return, I insisted on
coming back because my country needed me and my services."
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers and official media actually began on Monday a
respectful but somber send-off for the heir to the throne by
praising his deeds and hoped for his quick recovery and return.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, born in 1930, suffered bleeding in the colon two
years ago, which Kuwaiti officials said did not call for much
concern.
</P>
<P>
Saad, educated in Kuwait and at Britain's Hendon Police
Training School, started his career with Kuwait's police in
1945. He held the defense and interior portfolios from mid 1960s
to late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He has been Crown Prince and Prime Minister since 1978. His
father, late Emir Sheikh Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah who was in
office in 1950-1965, oversaw the 1961 independence from Britain.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 traffic
offenders have been charged in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South
Africa since the national launch of the Arrive Alive Campaign in
November, provincial road traffic inspectorate spokesman Vijen
Murugan said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
No mercy would be shown to those who violate traffic
regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Murugan, the traffic flow to KwaZulu-Natal, one of
South Africa's prime holiday spots, is expected to increase around
December 15 when most businesses would close for the Christmas and
New Year events.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned motorists not to be fooled by an apparent
lack of visible patrols in some areas because unmarked cars fitted
with sophisticated equipment would be out in full force.
</P>
<P>
Some vehicles were equipped with video recorders and speed
detectors which could spot traffic offenders, he said, adding
recordings of these offences could be used as evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
He said the so-called booze buses would be deployed to test for
drunk drivers and roadblocks would be conducted frequently.

<HEADLINE> Official Removed from Post in Southwest China for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has been
dismissed from all his positions within the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in southwest China's Yunnan Province on corruption
charges, sources from the CPC Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection (CCDI) and the Ministry of Supervision said today.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the CPC Central Committee, the CCDI also
suggested Yunnan's Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee
remove Sun Xiaohong, president of the Higher People's Court in
Yunnan, from his post as president and as a deputy to the 9th
provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Sun has been convicted of smuggling two Audi limousines into
China, one of which he used for his own purposes, in 1997 and 1998
respectively. Customs estimate indicates an evasion of 637,000
yuan in duty in the two smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992-1997 period, while acting as president of the
Intermediate People's Court of Kunming City, Sun allowed the court
to conceal more than 77 million yuan of income, and in the 1992-
1995 period, he approved the distribution of over 1.5 million yuan
of procedural fees as bonuses.
</P>
<P>
A notice issued by the CCDI called on the younger generation of
officials to learn from Sun's case, and to stay clear-headed so as
to better serve the public.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement Greenhouse Gas Reducing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will implement a
project aimed at reducing greenhouse gases emissions by 10 percent,
the Malaysian Energy Center said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, called the Malaysian Industrial Energy Efficiency
Improvement Project, at a cost of about 80 million ringgit (21.052
million U.S. dollars) will be implemented over a four-year period
beginning next month, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is co-funded by the United Nations Development Program, the
Malaysian government and private organizations, according to the
center.
</P>
<P>
One of the project's immediate objectives is to remove barriers
for energy efficiency measures in eight sectors -- food, iron and
steel, rubber, cement, ceramic, glass, paper and wood -- by 2004
within the stipulated budget.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at enabling Malaysia to have a strong
institutional and technical foundation for efforts to capture
energy efficiency potentials in the industrial sector, and also at
creating a sustainable institutional capacity to provide energy
efficiency technical assistance and a conducive policy, planning
and research framework.
</P>
<P>
The center said that improving energy efficiency in Malaysian
industries would contribute towards competitiveness of the
Malaysian economy, which would lead to increased income for its
citizens.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Government Agencies Secured Against Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's government ministries and
agencies and the public sector have been secured against the Y2K
bug, the country's Middle East News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Communications and Information Ahmad Nazef told the
People's Assembly (Parliament) on Monday that the computer systems
in the essential state sectors, including oil, communications,
health care, banks, aviation and the Suez Canal have been ready
for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will experience no chaos in its computer systems when
the calendar rolls over to double zero with the advent of the year
2000," he was quoted by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most older computers, computerized equipment and software
programs were programmed to recognize only the last two digits of
a year. These computers may misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing
technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
This confusion can affect the computer systems for electricity,
water, payrolls, elevators and gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
Egypt formed a technical committee as part of its 1998
government program toward fending off the chaos that is expected
to occur around the world because of the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The government worked out a six-phase plan to define the
problem in older computer systems, adjust the systems to confront
any technical faults and chart emergency plans for any
eventualities, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is lucky as most of its systems were installed in the
1990s and are relatively new and safe," he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Education in Accordance with Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to
promote education in accordance with law, and provide a strong
legal guarantee for maintaining priority status for education, a
top education official said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, chairman of the Education, Science, Culture and
Public Health Committee of the National People Congress, was
speaking at the national conference on the legal work in education,
which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-sponsored by the NPC Education, Science,
Culture and Public Health Committee and the Ministry of Education,
is the first of its kind held since the People's Republic of China
was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Chinese government has paid great attention
to the legal construction in education. Since 1980, the NPC and
the NPC standing committee have issued 16 education regulations
and laws including the Education Law, the Compulsory Education Law,
and the Higher Education Law, all of which have largely promoted
China's education reform and development.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still much work to do, said Zhu, such as
supplementing and amending the present educational law system and
promoting educational law.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Chen Zhili said that the CPC central
committee and the State Council have taken a series of steps to
deepen education reform and development this year. Education
departments should promote and guarantee education reform through
legal channels, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed out that education departments at all levels
should protect youth and students' legal rights, cooperate with
other departments to establish a comprehensive enforcement system,
and provide legal direction and assistance to middle and primary
schools.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Steps into Wembley Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch stepped into the
row over the future of London's Wembley stadium on Tuesday when he
said that an arena holding 65,000 spectators would be big enough
to host the Summer Games, according to a report from Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
Last week the British government, with its eyes on a possible
2012 Olympic bid as well as on its campaign to host the 2006
soccer World Cup, gave Wembley chiefs 14 days to find a better way
of rebuilding the stadium so it could stage track and field as
well as soccer.
</P>
<P>
The demand came after Sports Minister Kate Hoey commissioned a
special architectural report as plans showed it would only be able
to accommodate around 65,000 for athletics events.
</P>
<P>
But in an interview with Reuters, the IOC president said: "I
think 65,000 is enough. I think Barcelona (which hosted the 1992
Summer Olympic Games) was less than 60,000. Why not? For me, it is
enough.
</P>
<P>
"In the Olympic Games and the World Cup, the number of
spectators, 60,000 to 65,000 is enough. The importance is the
billions of people watching on television. We have no rules there
must be 65,000, 80,000 or 90,000."
</P>
<P>
The IOC president added that the Stade de France arena, the
venue of last year's World Cup final which can be switched easily
into a venue for athletics, was the perfect solution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at IOC headquarters, Samaranch said: "I will never
advise building two stadiums. One is enough. For me, the best
solution is the Paris solution."
</P>
<P>
The new $773 million Wembley stadium is due to open in 2003 --
just two years before the venue for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games
is decided by the IOC.

BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Military Museum has
received a piece of gold foil which was carried into space by the
spacecraft Shenzhou and will put it on display in an exhibition
hall designed for the return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
As another milestone in China's astronomical history, the
successful launching and retrieval of the spaceship in November
marks the country's newest breakthrough in manned space flight
technology.
</P>
<P>
As one of the 1,001 pieces of gold foil from Shenzhou, which
means "magic vessel," the piece that will be on view in the museum
is 15cm long, 10cm wide and weighs six grams. This piece is
specially numbered 1999.
</P>
<P>
The design etched on the foil is of the launching and flight of
Shenzhou, and on its upper left corner are the Chinese characters
of Shenzhou written by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
China will present 500 pieces of the gold foil to state
organizations and people that made outstanding contributions to
the space launch, and the other 500 will be sold by the China
Space Flight Foundation, and a website (www.kaishi.com.cn) has
been established to provide detailed information about the gold
foil to potential buyers.

<HEADLINE> China to Push Forward Army Logistics Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The spread of army logistics
work to other departments will be further improved, a Chinese
general said today at the national working conference on army
logistics reform.
</P>
<P>
General Wang Ke, a member of the Central Military Commission
and head of the General Department of Logistics of the People's
Liberation Army, said the Chinese army has experimented with
redistribution of logistics tasks in 850 units this year, with 7,
600 military logistics forces reduced and over 80 million yuan
saved.
</P>
<P>
All the changes have improved the management and quality of the
logistics work, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
General Wang pointed out that re-assigning logistics
responsibilities is an efficient way of modernizing China's army,
as well as strengthening its quality.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the work should be targeted to social forces
by fully utilizing market resources, so as to form a new logistics
system that will meet the demands of army quality construction and
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang asked logistics departments to make breakthroughs in
catering, barracks, and commercial services within two to three
years.
</P>
<P>
He also asked military departments at all levels to take great
pains to ensure the smooth operation of the logistics work.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Denies Report on Attempt to Foster Ties with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday denied a
report that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has asked Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid "to help foster closer Malaysian ties
with Israel."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has never asked for assistance from the
Indonesian president or anybody else on the issue, Foreign
Minister Syed Hamid Albar told reporters here, referring to a
report in Far Eastern Economic Review's intelligence column of its
December 9 issue which said the prime minister had asked
Abdurrahman "to mediate" and "help foster closer Malaysian ties
with Israel,"according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed the issue of Malaysia establishing relations with
Israel was never raised by the prime minister of Malaysia with
President Abdurrahman Wahid during the latter's visit to Malaysia
from November 6 to 7.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia takes strong objection to the remarks made by the
president if the report is true," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said if indeed Abdurrahman had made the statement, then
Malaysia took strong objection to it because Malaysia had never at
any time said anything to that effect.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry had called the Indonesian Charge d'
affaires and expressed regret over the report and the Malaysian
ambassador in Jakarta had been told to call upon the Indonesian
foreign minister to convey Malaysia's stand.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated that Malaysia's position
towards Israel remained firm and the question of a third party
intervention did not arise.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia will not establish diplomatic or informal relations
with Israel until and unless a comprehensive solution to the
Middle East problem is achieved," he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian-born pole vaulter
Tatiana Grigorieva has cleared a major obstacle in her bid to
compete for Australia at next year's Sydney Olympic Games,
according to reports from Adelaide, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Grigorieva had her Australian citizenship confirmed late Monday
after encountering problems meeting requirements that she complete
two uninterrupted years as a resident.
</P>
<P>
She won an appeal on the basis that husband and fellow Olympic
pole vaulting medal prospect Viktor Chistiakov was granted
citizenship earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia cleared the former unior hurdler to compete for
Australia but the clearance enabled her to represent Australia
only at certain events, such as this year's Seville world titles,
where she won a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
The clearance did not allow her to represent Australia at the
Commonwealth or Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Chistiakov was granted citizenship earlier this year but
illness prevented him from competing at the world championships in
August.
</P>
<P>
Grigorieva and Chistiakov began training with Vitali Petrov,
former coach of the great Sergey Bubka, in Adelaide last month and
their manager Rick Carter said Petrov had agreed to coach them
through next year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Attract More Asian Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to
attract more tourists from Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK)
next year, the East African newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Tourism Philemon Luhanjo was quoted as saying that the latest
marketing drive was expected to bring some 100,000 Japanese
tourists to Tanzania every year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 10,000 Japanese and less than 5,000 people from the
ROK visit the country annually.
</P>
<P>
Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa and located in
the north of Tanzania, is the leading attraction for Japanese
tourists visiting East Africa, followed by wild life and nature
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Japan also funds the protected chimpanzee parks of Mahale and
Gombe in western Tanzania. Some 3,000 Japanese tourists visit the
two neighboring parks each year.
</P>
<P>
After President Benjamin Mkapa's visit to Japan and the ROK
last year, television crews from both countries visited Tanzania
and made documentaries about this country's tourism potential.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tanzania played host to 482,331 tourists, who
brought in 501 million U.S. dollars in revenue. It is anticipated
that earnings from tourism could increase to 638 million dollars
this year.

<HEADLINE> Maldivian President Meets China's Top Consultant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE (Maldives), December 7 (Xinhua) -- China highly values the
Maldivian president's outstanding contribution to the continuous
development of the friendly ties between the two countries and the
continuous deepening of their traditional friendship and mutually
beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks
Tuesday morning when he met with Maldivian President Maumoon Abdul
Gayoom.
</P>
<P>
Li is on an official visit here at the invitation of the
Maldivian government.
</P>
<P>
China thanked President Gayoom and his government for their
consistent pursuance of the "one China" policy and their support
without any reserve of China on such important issues as human
rights and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
President Gayoom welcomed Li to the Maldives, saying Li is one
of China's top leaders and his current visit is clearly a
demonstration that China gives great importance to advancing its
relations with the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
When briefing the President on China's domestic political and
economic situation, Li recalled the president's China trip 15
years ago. During that trip, Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of
China's reform and opening up to the outside world, met with
President Gayoom and told him that seeking truth from facts is why
China has scored globally acknowledged achievements. Facts in the
past have shown that the principle of "seeking truth from facts is
our treasure to get over all difficulties and score victories as
well as our orientation of efforts and an important subject China
still needs to tackle," Li noted. He stressed that "whenever the
principle is adhered to, we'll make progress but suffer setbacks
when it is not followed."
</P>
<P>
What Deng Xiaoping said during that meeting and the name of
President Gayoom were included in the "Selected Works of Deng
Xiaoping" and became popular among almost all the Chinese people.
President Gayoom felt proud about that and said Deng Xiaoping's
remarks provided him with great enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
President Gayoom thanked the Chinese government for its
selfless aid and help to the Maldives in all fields and hoped that
the bilateral relations will continue to advance.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Hosts Regional Seminar on International Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Asia Pacific
regional seminar on the application of the International Labor
Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and
Rights at Work opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of representatives of governments, employers and
workers' organizations from more than 20 countries and regions are
participating in the seminar which was inaugurated by Prime
Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Regional Office for Asia and the
Pacific of the International Labor Organization (ILO), will focus
on implementation of the principles contained in the ILO's
fundamental conventions, including the right to collective
bargaining, the elimination of forced labor and child labor and
anti-discrimination in employment.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will also discuss the ILO's latest convention, the
Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention, 1999, passed at the
International Labor Conference in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The new convention targets such practices as child slavery,
forced labor, trafficking, prostitution and various forms of
hazardous and exploitative work.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has ratified all seven fundamental ILO conventions so
far this year, becoming the second in the region and the 48th
country in the world to do so. The Indonesian government last year
became the first in the region to do so.
</P>
<P>
The ILO estimated that, around the world, some 250 million
children between the ages of five and 14 work for a living. Almost
half, some 120 million, work full time, every day, all year round.
Of the 250 million, some 50 million to 60 million are between five
and 11 years old and work, by definition, in hazardous
circumstances considering their age and vulnerability.

</P>
<P>
The dip, which occurred one day after the index soared to 16,
168.62 points, the first close above 16,000 since August 15, 1997,

the slide and the index will hover around 16,000 for a while.

billion U.S. dollars), 2 billion HK dollars (256 million U.S.
dollars) down from Monday's 14.89 billion HK dollars (1.91 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> WWF Malaysia Calls for Curbing Deforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund For
Nature (WWF) Malaysia Tuesday called on the authorities to curb
deforestation in the highlands and large-scale land clearing for
urban and agricultural development along the course of rivers.
</P>
<P>
WWF Malaysia Program Director K. Ramadasan Tuesday described
the deforestation as the main cause of flash floods that crippled
major roads in the Klang Valley (Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding
areas) and also triggered the landslide along the Tapah-Cameron
Highlands road in the northeast Monday.
</P>
<P>
The haphazard and the indiscriminate destruction of highlands
and wetlands in economic exploitation is an important element in
the aggravation of floods, he said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
"Highland forests, which act as water sponges, have the ability
to slow down the flow of rain water down the slopes. It also
retains some of this water, regulating a more stable supply of
flow into the rivers," Ramadasan said.
</P>
<P>
He said wetlands also play an important role as they are able
to take up access water from a river during times of heavy
rainfall and act as a natural flood control mechanism.
</P>
<P>
He said once all these were destroyed, fast-flowing torrents of
water which are laden with eroded soil from slope surfaces will
find their way into streams and rivers contributing to floods,
especially in low-lying downstream areas.

<HEADLINE> Key Telecom Players Spearhead Internet Telephony Market in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Three key developers of
Internet Protocol-based telephony held a forum today in Hong Kong
to demonstrate the depth of and support for IP-based
communications in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Clarent, a premier provider of IP telephony products in the
world, announced the opening of its offices in Hong Kong and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Internet telephony has definitely hit prime time and more than
one billion minutes of IP telephony traffic is estimated to
transmit through Clarent IP gateways worldwide this year, said
Heidi Bersin, Clarent Corporation's senior vice president for
corporate communications and marketing.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, we are handling over 20 million minutes each month
and traffic is growing by double digits month over month," said
Lea King, product director of AT&AMP;T Global Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
"The next wave will be in IP-based value-added applications and
AT&AMP;T Global Clearinghouse will be leading the development effort
to bring value to our members and this industry," King said.
</P>
<P>
With the commercial launch of its managed IP backbone network,
oCen Communications, a leading Internet services provider focused
on North American and Asian markets, is well-positioned to respond
to Asia's strong demand for IP-based communications, said Steven
Eng, chief executive officer of oCen.
</P>
<P>
"Our new network is capable of supporting up to 50 million
minutes per month of carrier-grade voice and fax transmissions and
other real-time and enhanced IP communications services," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Frost and Sullivan, an internationally
recognized research firm in Silicon Valley, the market for IP
telephony is expected to grow to 630 billion minutes and deliver
91 billion U.S. dollars revenues in 2006. Of this more than 20
percent will involve the Asia Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Crash Delays Poll Results in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The crash of a helicopter
carrying election materials in the central province of Zambezia
will delay the province's election results, warned an election
official.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter crashed Monday morning on take-off at Luabo
when one of its rotor blades hit a branch of a tree, according to
Radio Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Carrasco, general director of the Electoral
Administration Technical Secretariat (STAE) told a press
conference here that an inquiry into the accident would be
launched on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four people were injured, said Carrasco, but they were promptly
rescued, "and are now safe and sound in Beira".
</P>
<P>
The company that owns the helicopter must, under its contract
with STAE, supply a replacement within 72 hours, but even so there
will certainly be a delay in collecting materials from other
remote parts of Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
Carrasco stressed that the Luabo election materials were
recovered from the crash.
</P>
<P>
Carrasco did not have exact figures of how many people had
voted in Mozambique's second presidential and parliamentary polls
which ended on Sunday, but said "preliminary indications are that
the turnout is similar to, or higher than, the turnout in 1994".
</P>
<P>
He said that political party monitors had been present in most
polling stations, thus guaranteeing transparency.
</P>
<P>
The final official results are not expected until December 19.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Unveils Blueprint for Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
announced a blueprint for industrial development to stimulate the
country's productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry Iyorchia Ayu told a press briefing in
capital Abuja that the blueprint had set out the strategies for
action and time frame in the next four years for industrial
development, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that the blueprint "will refocus the
policies of the government towards removing the problems and
constraints affecting the performance of the manufacturing
sub-sector and the productive sectors."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the present high level of import had remained the
bane of rapid industrialization in the country, describing as
"unfortunate and unacceptable" the current alarming rate of
import.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the unhealthy situation must be reversed
urgently in view of its dire consequences on employment
generation, domestic resource utilization, foreign exchange
resources and down stream industrial activities.
</P>
<P>
As a part of government efforts to stimulate domestic
production, Ayu said, the government has approved a tariff
structure that would favor import of machinery and raw materials
over finished goods with effect from the new year.
</P>
<P>
At the press briefing held on Monday, he stated that the
government had banned import of such goods as cement, sugar, pulp
and paper, plastics, petrochemicals, fish, cereals, chemicals and
rubber.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that conscious efforts were also being made to
resuscitate and rehabilitate some of ailing public companies like
the National Fertilizer Company, the Nigerian Sugar Company
Limited and the Federal Superphosphate Fertilizer Company.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the government had approved the
establishment of a Cement Technology Institute with a view to
improving cement production in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has directed the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation to make low pour fuel oil available to
cement companies at a cheaper rate and reduced the duties payable
by cement companies on their machinery and spare parts, he added.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: New Century Calls for New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The approaching of the
21st century has added heat to the worldwide debate on how to
establish new world political and economic order. The most
frequently asked question is whether peace and stability will
prevail and the people, regardless of their race and nationality,
will be better off.
</P>
<P>
The answers are varied as hopes and worries mixed. The passing
century witnessed two world wars followed by the cold war. The
bitter experiences have made it reasonable to hope and seek for
the better. However, growing hegemony and power politics in the
post-cold war era have cautioned people against over-optimism. To
date, a new world order, eagerly hoped for by all, still seems to
remain on paper only.
</P>
<P>
With regard to a new world order, different countries have
different versions. When former U.S. President George Bush dished
out the U.S. idea in 1990, the U.S. lead was stressed. President
Bill Clinton underlined the same point as he outlined three
pillars of U.S. foreign strategy -- economy, security and
democracy. Pushing hard NATO's eastward expansion and cementing
ties with its Asian allies, the United States is in an obvious bid
to prevent potential adversaries from emerging and to maintain its
status as the only superpower in the world.
</P>
<P>
The endless bombing of Iraq and the U.S.-led NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia without a mandate from the U.N. Security
Council have fueled doubts about what is really behind the U.S.
clamor about a new international order. Many countries believe
that the United States is pursuing a unipolar system, which goes
against their wish for a multipolar world. The new interventionism
advocated by the United States has been labeled by many developing
countries as "new hegemonism."
</P>
<P>
Desiring to be treated equally at the international arena,
developing countries share concerns with some European countries.
French President Jacques Chirac said early this year that no
single power should be allowed to monopolize world affairs. South
African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has recently
called on developing countries to work together to build an all-
equally-involved world order.
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to challenge the U.S. status as superpower, and
in the meantime, no one wants to bow to the U.S. command," said
Professor Stephen M. Walt of John E. Kennedy School of Government,
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
Now, the debate has focused on how to nurture a new
international order, another divisive issue. Developed countries
led by the United States believe that the human rights issue
precedes sovereignty and that humanitarian intervention should not
be hindered by national borders. But developing nations fear that
the human rights situation in a country may be used by big powers
as a pretext to intervene in their internal affairs. Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said at the September U.N. General
Assembly debate that "sovereignty is our final defense against the
rules of an unequal world."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said during the debate
that a just and reasonable new international order "should be
based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the purposes
and principles of the U.N. Charter and other universally-
recognized principles governing international relations." Russia
shared the stand, while some NATO members admitted that the 78-day
Kosovo military operation should not set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
All countries, big or small, rich or poor, have reached
consensus that the role of the U.N. should be enhanced in the next
century. President Clinton said at the U.N. General Assembly
debate that the role of the United Nations is "indispensable,"
urging Congress to pay more than 1 billion U.S. dollar dues to the
United Nations to save the U.S. prestige and the voting right at
the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its intention to peddle western policies and values
through the U.N., the United States needs the world body to deal
with international problems such as nuclear proliferation, drug
trafficking, organized crimes and environmental protection.
However, developing countries, for fear of missing the bandwagon
of globalization, want to have more say in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Countries have failed to speak in one voice as to how to make
the U.N. function better. Complaints are getting louder about the
low efficiency of the U.N. Security Council and demands are
growing for further reform of the most powerful U.N. organ.
</P>
<P>
While Germany and Japan are striving for permanent seats at the
council, developing countries are calling for expanded
representation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should serve not only the big, but all
countries alike, said representatives from many countries at the
recent regional discussions on the agenda of the millennium summit,
scheduled for September 2000 in New York.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have pinned their hope on the United
Nations for a larger share of tremendous benefit brought about by
globalization. Heavily indebted and with decreasing capital inflow,
they urge the United Nations to formulate fair and reasonable game
rules and elbowed developed countries to honor their aid
commitments and open their markets to commodities from developing
countries, in which 90 percent of the poor on the earth live.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the existing world order must be
restructured, despite the process might be time-consuming. The
realization of the aspirations after peace, security and common
prosperity needs unrelenting efforts by people of several
generations and closer cooperation among nations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Military Urged to Conduct Joint Warfare Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian military has
been directed to place greater importance on conducting joint
warfare exercises involving the three services to upgrade the
joint capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Issuing the directive here Tuesday, Defense Minister Abang Abu
Bakar Abang Mustapha said such emphasis would serve as a good
gauge on the capabilities of the army, air force and the navy in
deploying and optimizing their resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that while preparations towards this end were already
in place, the new generation of officers of the tri-services would
have to keep themselves abreast with this requirement and trend.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century would see more complex military challenges
which require rearranging and redirecting the development of the
defense forces in safeguarding national interests, he said at a
function to present diploma to 152 graduates of the Armed Forces
Staff College here including 24 foreign military officers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that plans to equip the Armed Forces Staff
College with new infrastructures would not be shelved despite the
lingering effects of the mid-1997 economic crisis on Malaysia's
defense modernization programs.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The official foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong amounted to 92.1 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of November 1999, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Including unsettled forward contracts, the foreign currency
assets of Hong Kong at the end of November 1999 stood at 92.6
billion U.S. dollars, compared with 90.4 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of October.
</P>
<P>
According to an HKMA spokesperson, the 1.7-billion-U.S.-dollar
increase in settled foreign currency assets during the month
reflects mainly the conversion into U.S. dollars as part of the
proceeds from the sale of Hong Kong equities through the Tracker
Fund.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong is the
world's fifth largest holder of foreign currency reserves after
Japan, the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign currency assets of 92.1 billion U.S. dollars
represent over seven times the currency in circulation or about 38
percent of Hong Kong dollar M3, one of the highest ratios in the
world.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets King of Jordan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, said today that
China is willing to cooperate with Jordan in the Middle East peace
process for achieving lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks this afternoon in a meeting with visiting
Jordanian King Abdullah II, one day after he returned from a trip
from six Asian and African countries including Israel and
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Li told King Abdullah II that he had further understanding of
latest developments in the Middle East through talks and
discussions with top leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing conflict between Arab countries and Israel
has brought untold sufferings and losses to peoples in the region,
and the Arab people in particular. It has also hampered economic
development in countries in the Middle East and posed a threat to
world peace and stability, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China supports the peace process in the region, Li said, adding
that China has always believed that the solution to the problem
should be in line with relevant UN resolutions and the principle
of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
Li described Jordan as an important and influential nation in
the region who advocates to resolve disputes through peace talks.
He also highly spoke of King Abdullah II's efforts in promoting
peace talks since he became King of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Organizations Accused of Launching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Majority leader of the Angolan
National Assembly Bornito de Sousa accused here on Tuesday some
foreign organizations of launching campaign against the Angolan
government, an official source has said.
</P>
<P>
Sousa criticized Global Witness, a British organization, for
having published a report accusing the Angolan government of its
bad management of public funds and demanding for "transparency" in
utilization of the money earned by the petroleum department.
</P>
<P>
The report, which has been rapidly diffused by the Portuguese
and the U. S. press, is an anti-government campaign, Sousa said,
stressing that Angola is a recognized country that should and
could use its resources for defending itself from any attack.
</P>
<P>
"Money for defense, health, education and other social areas is
part of the general budget of the country," said the lawmaker,
observing that the revenue in the petroleum industry is
significant for Angola's national income.
</P>
<P>
Sousa said the United States, Britain and Portugal also got
money from their national budget for supporting the war in the
Balkan area.
</P>
<P>
Revenue of the oil industry has been the top secret in Angola.
The second largest oil-producing country in Africa refused to
reveal the amount of the revenue even when negotiating with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for financial
assistance.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Per-capita Financial Assets Up 27-Fold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's per-capita holdings
of financial assets showed a 27.3-fold rise over the past 19 years
due to price stability, diverse financial instruments and rising
incomes.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of June this year, per-capita financial assets
stood at 15.2 million won (13,200 U.S. dollars), compared with 556,
000 won in 1980, according to a report issued by the Bank of Korea
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the household sector's financial assets
registered an average year-on-year growth rate of 20.1 percent
while the sector's financial assets totaled 704.4 trillion won, or
1.6 times the nation's nominal gross national income and a 33.2-
fold jump from 21.2 trillion won in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of households' financial assets to aggregate
disposable income rose to 1.99 times in 1997 from 0.76 times in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with household spending rising faster than the
savings rate, the growth of the accumulation level has been
slowing down since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, financial assets accounted for 34.4 percent of
South Korean households' total wealth at the end of 1997 and
deposits at financial institutions accounted for 52.9 percent of
the sector's financial assets in June this year, up from 43.3
percent in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Coal City Removes Its Chimneys to Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The coal city of Taiyuan in
north China's Shanxi Province has removed 212 chimneys over the
past five months in a major move to control heavy air pollution,
said mayor Cao Zhonghou.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of boilers have been targeted as the main culprits of
pollution in Taiyuan, one of the most polluted cities in the
country, and maybe even in the world.
</P>
<P>
Environment agencies said that boilers in the city emit more
than 13 million tons of dust, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants
every year.
</P>
<P>
The pollution caused by coking plants using outdated technology,
resulting in estimated economic losses of about 700 million yuan (
about 84 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Pollution from Taiyuan, Linfen and other major cities in the
province have formed a massive pollution belt 200 kilometers long
and dozens of kilometers wide.
</P>
<P>
Various government departments in the city have introduced
environmentally-friendly furnaces and state-of-the-art technology
as well as using clean coal, gas, petroleum, electricity, solar
energy, and other new forms of energy. The government's goal is to
demolish 300 chimneys by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the province, seeking cooperation in
pollution control, has contacted Germany, Austria, Norway, Canada,
the Netherlands, the United States, France, Japan and Britain, as
well as the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
Shanxi began to introduce foreign fund to start a waste water
treatment project in Yangquan City in 1994. Other cities like
Taiyuan and Changzhi have also cooperated with foreign countries
in environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations environmental program supported by the World
Bank was launched in Taiyuan in March this year. By 2010 Taiyuan
hopes to comply with international standards of clean air.

<HEADLINE> Musharraf Pleads Pak-Iran Joint Efforts for Afghan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf Tuesday advocated for joint strategy by
Pakistan and Iran to achieve "strategic objective" of peace in the
war-battered Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Strategic aims of the two countries are same "which is bringing
about peace in the region, bringing about peace in Afghanistan,"
the chief executive said in an interview with Iranian official
news agency IRNA in Rawalpindi, twin city of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf is to embark on a two-day visit to Iran and
Bahrain on Wednesday for talks on international, regional and
bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
Since he assumed the power after a bloodless coup on October 12,
General Musharraf, repeatedly in his policy statements, attached
much importance to promoting the bilateral relations with Iran,
which has kept lukewarm since the two neighbors chose to support
different warring factions in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is among the three countries which recognize Taliban
as the legal ruler of Afghanistan, however, Iran don't like
Taliban and is believed to be lending help to the anti-Taliban
opposition.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iran, General Musharraf is scheduled to meet
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and spiritual leader Seyed Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
"Pak-Iran common grounds are strategic. The modalities of
achieving that strategic objective of peace can be discussed and
we can have a common strategy," General Musharraf said, adding
that differences between Pakistan and Iran are monor.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a major difference because we have agreements in the
major areas. So the minor issues, the technical issues, as how to
bring about peace should be discussed like between two brothers
and we must agree to methodology to peace," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan and Iran had excellent relations during the
Afghan Mujahiden (holy warrior) struggle against the erstwhile
Soviet invasion. "Therefore the relations should based on total
understanding," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he is sure that he will have "very detailed and heart-
to-heart talks" with Iranian leaders and they will "iron out
difference of opinion and have brotherly relations".
</P>
<P>
Besides renewing and establishing personal contacts with
Iranian leaders, General Musharraf said he will seek their support
for whatever happened in Pakistan. "That is the basis purpose," he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
Since the military takeover General Musharraf has visited a
number of Islamic countries to seek support for his new government.

BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua)-- China today strongly opposed
the U.S. government decision to impose sanctions against China in
accordance with its International Religious Freedom Act.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue told reporters at
today's press conference that the Chinese government and people
express their strong indignation over this (decision).

According to Zhang, the Chinese side has consistently opposed
interference into internal affairs of other countries in the name

In disregard of the solemn representations and strong

has "distorted facts, made unjustifiable attacks upon the Chinese
government, and even gone so far as to impose sanctions against
the Chinese side".
</P>
<P>
It constitutes a serious violation of the basic norms governing
international relations and a gross interference in China's
internal affairs, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side demands that the U.S. side correct its
mistake immediately, and reverse its decision on the sanctions and
remove the adverse impact that the decision has made upon
bilateral relations with concrete actions," Zhang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Three key developers of
Internet Protocol-based telephony held a forum Tuesday in Hong
Kong to demonstrate the depth of and support for IP-based
communications in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Clarent, a premier provider of IP telephony products in the
world, announced the opening of its offices in Hong Kong and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Internet telephony has definitely hit prime time and more than
1 billion minutes of IP telephony traffic is estimated to transmit
through Clarent IP gateways worldwide this year, said Heidi Bersin,
Clarent Corporation's senior vice president for corporate
communications and marketing.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, we are handling over 20 million minutes each month
and traffic is growing by double digits month over month," said
Lea King, product director of AT&AMP;T Global Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
"The next wave will be in IP-based value-added applications and
AT&AMP;T Global Clearinghouse will be leading the development effort
to bring value to our members and this industry," King said.
</P>
<P>
With the commercial launch of its managed IP backbone network,
oCen Communications, a leading Internet services provider focused
on North American and Asian markets, is well-positioned to respond
to Asia's strong demand for IP-based communications, said Steven
Eng, chief executive officer of oCen.
</P>
<P>
"Our new network is capable of supporting up to 50 million
minutes per month of carrier-grade voice and fax transmissions and
other real-time and enhanced IP communications services," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Frost and Sullivan, an internationally
recognized research firm in Silicon Valley, the market for IP
telephony is expected to grow to 630 billion minutes and deliver
91 billion U.S. dollars revenues in 2006. Of this more than 20
percent will involve the Asia Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Food Policy Fails to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's national food policy
adopted in 1994 has failed to achieve its objectives, Kenya's
Agriculture Minister Chris Obure was quoted by Tuesday's Daily
Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Obure said that the policy including the abolishment of price
fixing, the removal of the monopoly and the freeing up of grain
movement was meant to boost food production in a liberalized
market.
</P>
<P>
Although the government had effected a duty waiver for
fertilizers to encourage food production, the commodity was still
expensive, he told a seminar.
</P>
<P>
Obure said the food policy should be reviewed to ensure food
security, citing that the output of major staple foods had been
overtaken by consumption.
</P>
<P>
Maize production is 30 million bags against a consumption of 33
million bags and wheat three million bags against seven million,
according to Obure.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the country had an irrigation potential of more than
400,000 hectares, only 30,000 are under irrigation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Promote Irrigation in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada pledged Tuesday to continue to address farmers' irrigation
needs in Mindanao in a bid to transform the southern area into the
country's major food provider.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks during an ongoing visit to the
southern Philippine island.
</P>
<P>
He added that the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) will
continue to meet the needs in most parts of the area.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the total
food trade of the country, is terribly short of irrigation and
more than half of the farm areas on the island lack it.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, the government will take care of the
irrigation need of this region and try to improve the service of
regional offices maintained there by the NIA.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture earlier reported to the president
the completion of 8,495 irrigation projects in various regions of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It added that the newly-completed projects are now servicing
some 200,000 national and communal irrigation systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said the bumper rice and
corn harvests this year could be credited in part to the effective
irrigation program.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is expected to grow 6 percent this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A literary prize named after
the renowned Chinese writer Lao She (1898-1966) has been
established to encourage more literary works.
</P>
<P>
The first group of prize winners, which may include novelists,
dramatists and their works, will be announced at Lao She's home
city of Beijing in May next year.
</P>
<P>
The biannial Lao She Prize in Literature, set up by the Lao She
Art and Culture Foundation early this year should be presented to
eminent literary works which have "in-depth and meaningful text
with a distinct local flavor", according to a committee in charge
of judging writers' works.
</P>
<P>
"Most of Lao She's works reflected the real life of ordinary
residents in Beijing. His pure, simple and expressive language
came from the working class and shines with the glory of realism,"
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said at a commemorative meeting to honor
Lao She's 100th birthday anniversary early this year.
</P>
<P>
His works include "Rickshaw Boy", "Camel Xiangzi" and a number
of plays including the famous "Teahouse" which was recently
performed again at the Capital Theater to packed houses.
</P>
<P>
The committee members expressed the wish that the prize will
become a major event on the literary calendar in China. Other
literary prizes in the country named after famous 20th century
writers include Lu Xun (1881-1936), Mao Dun (1896-1981) and Bing
Xin (1900-1999).

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Recovering from an economic
recession, companies from the Republic of Korea (ROK) are making a
comeback on the Chinese market amply illustrated at a Product and
Technology Expo in the northern port city of Tianjin during
December 1-4. Eighty four companies from ROK attended the expo.
</P>
<P>
The companies deal in electronics information, environmental
protection, machinery, automatic control, appliances and meters,
household electric appliances, light industry, as well as textiles,
bio-medicine and food processing.
</P>
<P>
An official at ROK's Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corp.
Cho Jung Kun, said he was surprised to see so many companies,
considering the fact that ROK has been through an economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
Cho, who is in charge of the company's Beijing branch, said the
overwhelming presence of ROK companies at the expo is an obvious
sign of a growing interest in the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The ROK government set up the Small and Medium Industry
Promotion Corporation in 1993 to promote ROK's medium-sized and
small enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Before the expo, China and ROK signed an agreement promoting
such enterprises. Under the agreement, agencies set up by the ROK
government in China will provide consulting services, technical
support and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
The Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation plans to
set up a second branch in China's largest industrial and
commercial center, Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the ROK embassy in China said that the ROK
government will set up an agency to help ROK firms evaluate
investment risks and find business opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, ROK has set up 1,015 companies with contractual
investment valued at 1.9 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China and ROK signed 4,500 agreements on developing medium-
sized and small companies in March this year.

<HEADLINE> WTO Talks Failure Seen as Victory for Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has regarded the
abortive ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in Seattle, the United States, last week as a victory for
developing countries, The Herald newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarirai, who led
the Zimbabwean delegation to the conference, said Monday that the
collapse of the trade talks was also a warning that Africa should
be taken seriously at next year's negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries, particularly those in Africa and
the Caribbean, had taken a strong position against the approach
employed by the developed countries and refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
The minister said developed countries wanted the WTO to waive
preferential trade arrangements for developing countries while the
latter were advocating for "special and differential treatment as
a fundamental principle of the multi-lateral trading system".
</P>
<P>
When the debate opened there were immediate differences between
 delegates from developed and developing countries on a wide range
of issues especially on agriculture, labour, dumping and market
access, he said.

<HEADLINE> One Lebanese Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was killed
and two Syrian workers were wounded Tuesday morning during a
shelling on south Lebanon, the country's security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Daoud, 50, was killed instantly, and Salman Awad and Ali
Khalaf were moderately injured by shells when they were irrigating
an orchard near Mansouri village north of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the attack,
which raised the number of Lebanese civilians killed in south
Lebanon since the start of this year to 23. Another 150 were
wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israelis out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Rowdyism Case Against Sharif Adjourned in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
Tuesday adjourned the hearing of a rowdyism case against the
deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others till January 12,
2000.
</P>
<P>
A 12-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Saeed-uz-Zaman
Siddiqui, directed the respondents to file objections against the
petitions till January 11, 2000.
</P>
<P>
From January 12, the court will take up the case on a day-to-
day basis.
</P>
<P>
The case had been admitted on a petition of freelance
journalist Shahid Orakzai and has been suspended for several
months.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary hearing of the case was held Tuesday amid
extraordinary security, with police clashing briefly with Pakistan
Muslim League (PML) workers outside the court building.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, head of the former ruling party PML, was specially
brought from Karachi, where he has been facing an attempted murder
and hijacking case, to attend the proceedings under a court notice.
Some other PML leaders were also accused in the rowdyism case.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the court, Sharif again complained of "inhuman
conditions" he has been supplied when in custody. He said that
since October 12, he has been treated as a common criminal.
</P>
<P>
On October 12, Sharif's government was dismissed in a bloodless
military coup and he was first under house arrest and then
formally arrested.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Anwar, law minister in Sharif's ousted government who is
representing the former prime minister, opposed the petitioner,
saying Orakzai is not an aggrieved party in the case.
</P>
<P>
The apex court barred Sharif from issuing any statement outside
the court. Entry to the building was restricted as no vehicle was
allowed to approach the building with police cordoning off the
area.
</P>
<P>
PML workers, including the party's members of parliament,
attacked the supreme court on November 28, 1997, when the then
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was hearing a contempt of court case
against Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In May 1999, a three-member bench of the supreme court has
acquitted all the PML legislators who were indicted on charges of
contempt of court for the attack due to its inability to give
specific evidence against them while proceedings against the
sitting prime minister were under way.

<HEADLINE> China to Use "Green" Power-generating Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Yantai Power Plant in the
coastal city of Yantai in Shandong Province is preparing for the
introduction of an environment-friendly electricity-generating
technology on an experimental basis, to turn itself into a "green"
power-generating facility.
</P>
<P>
The power plant is set to introduce integrated gasified
combined circulation (IGCC) technology, which will be widely used
in coal-burning thermal power plants in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 20 IGCC power plants built or under
construction worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The new technology will lift coal's heat efficiency by 10
percent and the rate of the coal's desulphurization to more than
99 percent, producing much less coal ash, or none at all.

issue.

VIENNA -- The average price of OPEC's basket of seven crude
oils dropped slightly to 24.54 U.S. dollars per barrel last week
from 24.90 dollars in the previous week, the secretariat of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The average price per barrel in November reached 23.74 dollars,
the highest in recent months, compared with 21.67 dollars in
October. The price averaged only 12.28 dollars per barrel in 1998.
The continuous increase in oil prices strengthened OPEC's
determination to maintain the current production quota. Ali Al-n'
aimi, minister of petroleum and mineral resources of Saudi Arabia,
the main oil producer country of OPEC, said the oil price was
steady now and it was not necessary to change the current quota. (

<HEADLINE> WB to Help Thailand Reform Budget System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will help
Thailand improve and develop its government budget system, the
Thai News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank advisor to Thailand Sherrif Sayin was quoted as
saying on Tuesday that the Thai government's budget system is now
more standardized, compared with some other countries in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the government needs another three to five years to
improve and develop its budget system to meet the international
standard, where budgets of various governments, including those of
developed countries, could be compared and any faults could be
easily found and efficiently corrected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government's budget system is based on cash, meaning
that debiting or crediting of accounts would be proceeded only
when there is any cash receipt or payment and thus causing
loopholes and leaks.
</P>
<P>
The new system would be based on a non-cash principle, enabling
it to help prevent and avoid any financial crisis in the future,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sayin said the World Bank considered that Thailand is now ready
to change its government budget system to be relevant to those of
developed countries and to meet the international standard.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-year-old Portion of Great Wall Confirmed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
confirmed after a recent field examination that a 20-km-long
section of the Great Wall in north China's Shanxi province was
built in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
This section is located in Kelan County in northwest Shanxi and
is made of stones.
</P>
<P>
Sources from local archeological departments said that about 20
km of this portion of the Great Wall remain, though there are
longer ruined portions.
</P>
<P>
The remaining wall is 1.6 meters wide at the top and the zenith
exceeds 3 meters. At some places, 30-cm-high parapet walls can
still be seen and many porcelain pieces were scattered near by.
</P>
<P>
Before this discovery in Shanxi Province, experts had once
thought that no part of the Great Wall was built during the Song
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The best-known sections of the Great Wall were built in the
Ming Dynasty (13681644) based on construction of previous
dynasties. The entire Wall is more than 6,000 km long, running
west-to-east from the Jiayuguan Pass in northwest China's Gansu
Province to the Shanhaiguan Pass at the Bohai Sea in north China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rulers of ancient times built walls in an attempt to
resist intrusions from outside powers. The Great Wall's
construction began during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC),
when separate sections were built at scattered strategic areas.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall was rebuilt time and again through the centuries,
and many sections of it have suffered serious damage from
windstorms and water and man-made destruction over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the Chinese government has allocated
special funds to restore this national monument to its
magnificance in some parts, such as the sections at Badaling,
Mutianyu, and other sites.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this latest confirmation will provide adequate
material for the Great Wall research and related topics.

URUMQI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The far-western city of Kashi in
northwest China's Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Region aims to plant
10 million almond trees and become China's largest almond producer.
</P>
<P>
Almonds, introduced to Kashi more than 1,100 years ago, are

varying greatly between day and night, suitable for the growth of
almonds.

<HEADLINE> 40,000 TB Cases Reported in Zambia Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 40,000 cases of
tuberculosis (TB) are recorded in Zambia every year, a University
Teaching Hospital official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper on Tuesday quoted Francis Kasolo, head of
the virology department of the hospital, the biggest one in the
country, as saying 70 percent of the diagnosed TB cases were
HIV/AIDS related.
</P>
<P>
Kasolo disclosed this during a tour of his department by the
visiting Japanese Prince and Princess Takamado on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the department has this year recorded a reduction in
the rates of HIV/AIDS infection especially among the young people
below the age of 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a reduction from about 14 percent to about five
percent infection rate among teenagers below the age of 19. This
is a positive sign because we know that in the near future as we
get into the new millennium, these figures are going to reduce
further," he said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that over use of drugs by TB patients has led to
non- response to medication as the bacteria becoming more
resistant to the drugs.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Warns EU on Turkey's Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned Monday that the recent improvement in relations
between Turkey and Greece will be harmed if Ankara is denied
European Union (EU) candidacy at the upcoming EU summit in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Demirel sounded the warning on board his plane en route to
Bosnia-Herzegovina for a two-day official visit, Turkey's
English-language Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the thaw in relations between the two neighbors
following two earthquakes in Turkey and one in Greece in the past
four months may be replaced with new tensions if Turkey is denied
candidacy status at the weekend EU summit in the Finnish capital.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is aware of the responsibilities it has to shoulder once
declared an EU candidate, but it will not accept a candidacy
status with strings attached to it, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said it has become clear that there is a consensus
among all EU members, except Greece, which has not stated a
definite position on the issue, that Turkey should be given
candidacy status.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government now reportedly seems uncertain whether it
should vote in favor of granting Turkey candidacy before
extracting concessions from Ankara on the territorial dispute over
the Aegean waters and the Cyprus issue, two major sources of feud
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision will not be voiced until the last moment. It is a
bit premature now to state whether it will be our government's
policy to veto Turkey's bid for EU candidacy. Nothing has been
decided yet," a Greek diplomat in Ankara was quoted in local press
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Softening Turkey's position on the death sentence to Abdullah
Ocalan, captive leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party,
over which EU has expressed strong opposition, Demirel said if
Turkey belongs to Europe, there are European norms and standards
that the country is required to meet.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore Strives for Innovation-Driven Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore unveiled Monday an
ambitious 10-year blueprint aimed at maintaining a top workforce
and scoring a top-10 industry among the ranks of prominent
economic players in the world.
</P>
<P>
The new national productivity plan, or ProAct 21, is hoped to
usher in for the resources-poor state an innovation-driven economy,
or "a knowledge-based economy (KBE)," in the new century to
replace the current investment-based one.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, Singapore has drawn up respective plans to
adapt itself to different phases in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
From the 1960s to the 1970s in a prevailing labor-driven
economy,the first development plan focused on job creation and
economic industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Later in the 1980s and the 1990s, as Singapore entered a
booming investment-driven era, the plan was revamped to stress
higher value-added activities.
</P>
<P>
The immediate results are eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 18 years, productivity increases have contributed
more than half of the 7.2 percent average economic growth in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the standard of living in Singapore rose from 14,000
Singapore dollars (8,333 U.S. dollars) per person in 1980 to 31,
000 Singapore dollars (18,452 U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, Singapore's workforce has been rated top by
Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) and in terms of
industry and service, the city state was ranked 20th and 19th
respectively in the 1999 World Competitiveness Yearbook.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, however, can not afford to rest on its past laurels,
said Lee Suan Hiang, head of the Singapore Productivity and
Standards Board, when announcing the ProAct 21 Plan.
</P>
<P>
Through the new plan, Singapore strives to make itself one of
the world's 10 most productive countries in both manufacturing and
services by 2010 and its workforce the undisputed best.
</P>
<P>
Propelling forces behind the bold visions are eight strategic
thrusts in the fields such as mind-shaping, education, new
technology,pro-business environment, team-work upgrading, industry-
wide transformation and enterprise financing.
</P>
<P>
Among them, one of the major tasks is to inculcate a "new
productivity mindset" among its people and companies and equip
them with new tools and techniques to become more productive.
</P>
<P>
The plan will re-orientate workers toward innovation and value
creation rather than mere quality improvement and problem-solving.
</P>
<P>
The mindset change is "not just among the people but also
companies" because it poses the "greatest challenge" to Singapore'
s next productivity leap, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
A national productivity education program will be launched to
support the "mental revolution" needed for the KBE and as a
dynamic 10-year action plan, various initiatives and programs will
be unveiled over time, monitored by the PSB.
</P>
<P>
But Lee emphasized that ProAct 21 is not PSB's plan, but a
national blueprint, "a multi-agency approach that will involve
unions,employers and the government."
</P>
<P>
To survive and grow in the fast-changing economy, organizations
must build up their innovative capabilities and master the best
practices in managing their business, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With a world-class workforce and work-class organizations that
aim to stay ahead, Singapore will be well-placed for sustained
productivity and economic growth," he said.

JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States believes that the Palestinians should not
make "preconditions" by linking final-status talks to the halting
of Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's spokesman James Rubin said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak "will make sure that the
settlements are not an obstacle to the talks", according to a
source in the Prime Minister's Office. Barak will clarify his
position to Madeleine Albright, who arrives in Jerusalem Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The remains of two Israel Defense Force soldiers missing
since the 1973 Yom Kippur War were recently discovered in the
Sinai desert in Egypt. The IDF hopes that this breakthrough
will lead to the finding of the bodies of at least some of
the 16 soldiers still missing on the Egyptian front.

<HEADLINE> China Cuts Sulfur Dioxide Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China has cut the emission of
sulfur dioxide by 1.3 million tons in nearly two years since
January 1998, a senior Chinese environmental protection official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the International Conference on Sulfur Dioxide
Pollution Control, Wang Xinfang, vice-director of China's State
Environmental Protection Administration, said the reduction has
helped improve the quality of air in 93 of 175 monitored cities.
</P>
<P>
To curb sulfur dioxide pollution, the Chinese central
government launched a campaign in January 1998 in designated
cities across China including Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin and other major cities in coastal areas and those listed
as key tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
These designated areas are responsible for 60 percent of the
country's total sulfur dioxide emissions. Mines producing coal
with high sulfur content and small coal-powered power plants have
been shut down. Clean fuels such as natural gas, and clean
production have been encouraged and introduced.
</P>
<P>
Despite these efforts, China still faces a serious challenge in
resolving sulfur dioxide pollution as it is the largest coal
producer and consumer in the world, said the vice-director. To
make matters worse, China's annual output of coal with high sulfur
content reached 321 million tons last year, though this was 10
million tons less than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China needs both financial and technological support to achieve
its sulfur dioxide control targets in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 people, including environmental protection officials
from both central and local governments and representatives from
environmental protection firms, will attended the three-day
conference which opened today.

<HEADLINE> No New Tenders for Building of Settlements, Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Monday evening he does not expect the issuing of new
tenders for settlement construction in the occupied territories
while negotiations are under way with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Tel Aviv Tuesday morning said Barak
made the statements at a meeting with a number of activists of his
Labour party.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that issuing new tenders will
harm Israel's prestige worldwide and will damage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
threatened, on the eve of the arrival in Israel Tuesday of United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to suspend final
status negotiations should the Barak government continue to expand
Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
According to Arafat's adviser Nabil Shaath, Arafat, in the
course of his recent meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah
with U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, called for U.S.
intervention to rescue the final status negotiations from collapse
due to Israeli settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator for final status talks Yasser Abed
Rabbo announced after the 8th session of final status talks Monday
that his side will not proceed with the talks until Israel stops
expanding settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Monday's negotiations hit a snag as the Palestinian delegation
refused to discuss the issue of Palestinian refugees, which was
tabled for consideration at the session, and demanded a discussion
of the settlement issue instead.

GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohamed Bassiouni said Egypt will continue assisting Israel in the
search of missing Israeli soldiers in the 1973 Middle East war,
"Voice of Israel" radio reported Tuesday.

Bassiouni also called upon the Israeli government to put an end
to Jewish settlement activity, indicating that such activity put
the Palestinian leadership in a critical situation.
</P>
<P>
Final status negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel
have reached a deadlock due to the Palestinian side's refusal to
meet with the Israelis in protest against the continued building
of settlement housing units in the occupied West Bank.

<HEADLINE> China to Turn Deserts Into Vegetated Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that it
will stem its vast deserts, mostly in the western areas, from
expanding within 10 years and make a major bid to turn the
floating sands into vegetated land.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liming, a State Forestry Administration (SFA) official in
charge of desert control, said that a total of 1.69 million square
kilometers of desert or desertified land in 14 provinces and
autonomous regions will be involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
Of the total figure, planting grass and trees will be feasible
on about 530,000 square kilometers of desert, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
China plans to improve 24.6 million ha of desertified land and
plant grass and trees on 15.3 million ha of land over the next 10
years. The upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow River valleys
which have vast arid areas of deserts will be slated for
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Desert control and treatment will be a major part of China's
strategy to accelerate economic development in its mammoth western
areas, said Li Yucai, deputy director of the SFA, who added that
China will earmark 100 billion yuan for a massive afforestation
campaign within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
China has 2.62 million square kilometers of desertified land.
Ever-expanding desert sprawls at an annual rate of 2,000 square
kilometers. Sandstorms brings about direct economic losses of 8.4
billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
China began the fight against desertification as early as in
the 1950s. A comprehensive attempt at controlling China's deserts
was launched in later 1980s. To date, 160,000 square kilometers of
wasteland covered with floating sand, or one-tenth of the
desertified land in China, has been turned into arable land or
forested zones, Li said.
</P>
<P>
A desert expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences said China
has developed a series of techniques to control its desert
including aerial seeding and growing paddy rice fields on arid
areas by lining 20-centimeter deep furrows with plastic cover for
preserving both water and nutrients.
</P>
<P>
An official with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)
said that China leads the world in desert control techniques.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, China will expand its forest areas by 74.5 million ha
and bring 66 million ha of its desert under control by planting
trees and grasses, Li said.

Macao, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chen Shaoji, director of the
Provincial Public Security Bureau of Guangdong, expressed his
confidence in the security of Macao during the period of the
handover ceremony, due on December 20, and celebrations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Review of International Situation in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
December 7, Beijing (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 witnessed a spate
of striking events and developments throughout the world. Fresh
developments of hegemonism and power politics, together with an
escalation of local wars and regional conflicts, further
complicated international relations and the world's security
situation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) created
a dangerous precedent of willfully interfering with the internal
affairs of other countries and invading a sovereign state in its
78-day bombardment against Yugoslavia on March 24. The ethnic
conflicts in Kosovo belong to the internal affairs of Yugoslavia
and should be settled through consultations by the various ethnic
groups. The international community can initiate dialogues on the
issue to help seek solutions.
</P>
<P>
NATO, however, launched massive air raids on Yugoslavia without
a mandate of the United Nations, inflicting suffering upon the
Yugoslav people and incurring strong condemnations from peace-
loving and justice-seeking people of different countries. In a
barbarous move, the military bloc also attacked the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia, arousing extreme indignation among the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The invasion against Yugoslavia was in essence a trial made by
the U.S.-led western powers of NATO's new concept. The concept on
the one hand is to pursue eastward expansion and on the other hand
to extend its defense scope beyond NATO, as exemplified by its
armed intervention in Yugoslavia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
NATO's new concept is an important part of the U.S. global
strategy. Its goal is to maintain its status in the 21st century
as the sole super power that plays a dominant and leading role in
international affairs. The endeavor has been exposed by
international consensus as the U.S. attempts to create a unipolar
system.
</P>
<P>
At home, the United States sought to maintain an absolute
predominance in military technologies by developing its national
strategic defense system. In Europe, the United States reinforced
NATO in a bid to achieve its double aim of controlling its
European allies on the one hand and squeezing Russia's strategic
space on the other.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, the United States strengthened its defense cooperation
with Japan. In the meantime, it jointly conducted research and
development on the Theater Defense Missile system with Japan and
others. The moves have made Asian countries highly alert and upset.
In Latin America, the United States adjusted its policies toward
the region and is now working to create a sweeping American market
to stabilize its backyard. In the Middle East, it insisted on the
continuation of peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians
while trying to suppress Iraq and some other countries. In Africa,
the Untied States expanded its influence by cementing its economic
bonds with African nations.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo war caused big countries to grow sharp on their
differences and conflicts, and harmed their partnership building
efforts. The world disarmament process suffered setbacks as a
result. The question of military security has once again drawn
wide attention.
</P>
<P>
The United States not only led the aggressive war against
Yugoslavia but also drastically increased its spending on anti-
missile defense in a bid to seek nuclear predominance. Its attempt
will force other countries to increase their military expenditures
and may also trigger an arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty in October and the country's threat to quit the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty showed that it ran counter to the
general disarmament efforts in the world. What added to the unease
of the international community was the missile test-fire race
between India and Pakistan and their subsequent military conflicts
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
An array of events that occurred during the year revealed that
the continued existence of factors that could disturb the local or
regional situations. Russia's fight against Chechen rebel forces,
relaxation of conflicts in mid-Africa, the break-off of the
deadlock on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, the development of
the situation in East Timor, the general election in Indonesia and
the coup in Pakistan can serve as examples.
</P>
<P>
Economically, the world emerged from the adverse impact of
financial turmoils and embarked on the track of continued growth.
The International Monetary Fund predicted a 3.5 percent growth
rate for the global economy, higher than the 2.5 percent of last
year. The U.S. economy maintained its growth momentum and the
euroland economy has been back on the track of recovery, while
South Korea and Southeast Asian nations have lifted themselves out
of the valley of crisis faster than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still hidden dangers in the world economy,
particularly the bubbles in the U.S. stock market and the
worldwide low customer demand. Lessons from the financial crises
should be well taken.
</P>
<P>
With the continued development of economic globalization and
regionalization, the economic links between nations and regions
have grown more extensive and closer. How to guarantee the
economic security in the process of economic globalization has
become a significant subject for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The world pattern, composed of one super power, several major
powers, some developed small and medium-sized nations plus the
broad range of developing nations, has undergone no significant
changes. The trend toward multipolar system is still growing.
Historical experiences have demonstrated that any attempt to
monopolize the world is doomed to failure. All powers must get the
support of relevant nations if they wish to solve global or
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
As all nations map out their strategies on the basis of their
own interests in efforts to seek development and occupy vantage
points in international competitions, friction and even disputes
are unavoidable. Development can be secured only in relatively
stable international environment. Dialogues and consultations are
the only way to secure a relative balance. It is hoped that all
conflicts can be settled through various mechanisms of
consultations while upholding justice and fairness, opposing war
and safeguarding peace.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Attorney General Reopens Soeharto's Corruption Case (RPT) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General
's Office has said it was reopening the investigation into alleged
corruption by former president Soeharto, national newspapers
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the investigation by the Attorney General's Office,
we have found new aspects (enabling) the reopening of the
investigation against Soeharto," Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said in a written statement published by the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said evidence pointed to "a misuse of power and
authority"in issuing government regulations and presidential
decrees to amass funds for foundations linked to Soeharto, his
family and associates.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto as a president, who had the authority to issue
government and presidential decrees, is suspected of misusing his
authority as a means to collect money to finance the foundations
he chaired, and for the benefit of his family and cronies ...
which directly and indirectly caused state losses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said his office was revoking a letter issued by then
attorney general Ismudjoko on October 11 suspending the
investigation into Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced down in May last year, is accused of
massive corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices during his 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
However, the Attorney General's Office, after months of
investigation, found no evidence of wrongdoing by Soeharto and the
investigation was halted on October 11 during the last week of B.J.
Habibie's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Since being sworn in as attorney general in October, Marzuki
has expressed his commitment to reopening the investigation.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been hit by a
shortage of foreign exchange, especially the U.S. dollars, raising
concerns among the business community about the falling kwacha,
Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The kwacha has tumbled from 2,550 to 2,700 against one dollar
since last Thursday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
George Chabwera, chairman of the Zambia Association of Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, Monday described the situation as
regrettable and called for the intervention of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The kwacha is reacting to the normal rule of demand and
supply. It is also a sign of the economy not being productive.
Businesses that depend on inputs like imported raw materials are
the ones that suffer most," he said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the only remedy was for the Bank of Zambia
(BOZ) to intervene and increase the capacity of foreign exchange
earnings.

<HEADLINE> Beirut Listed Among World's Most Expensive Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations survey on the
cost of living in 183 cities has put Lebanese capital Beirut among
the most expensive cities around the world.
</P>
<P>
The study, which covered all the countries where the UN has
offices, ranked Beirut as the 22nd-most expensive city in the
world, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New York, which ranked 14th with 100 points, is only three
points ahead of Beirut, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong of China, Tokyo of Japan and Tripoli of Libya were
ranked as the three most expensive cities.
</P>
<P>
The study, which covered the prices of basic commodities
and housing prices, did not include the level of wages.
</P>
<P>
Beirut was also ranked as the second-most expensive city in
the Middle East after Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated Beirut was the most expensive tourist
destination in the Arab world and was seven points ahead of Cairo,
which is considered the biggest tourist destination in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese blamed the high cost of living for the growing
prices of electricity, customs, labor costs and social-security
tax.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Ashqar, president of the country's hotel syndicate,
rejected the notion that hotels in Lebanon were the most
expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We pay expensive power, high customs and 37 percent tax
to cover the social security of staff and yet our prices
are almost the same as many regional countries," he claimed.

HOHHOT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China will build an ecological
demonstration area in Hulun Buir League in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in order to strengthen environmental protection
in the area, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Known as China's "clean green land," the Hulun Buir League has
a diversity of natural resources including huge grassland areas,
forests, wetlands, and hundreds of rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than ten national-level nature reserves in
the league including the Hulun Lake Nature Reserve which is home
to 199 species of rare birds.
</P>
<P>
In the forest area of the Greater Hingan Mountain Range there
are also some 3,000 species of birds and 76 varieties of wild
animals, 12 of which are on the top national protection list.
</P>
<P>
But recent years have witnessed worsening ecological conditions
in the area owing to desertification and water pollution, and
local officials said that creating the demonstration area will

ISLAMABAD, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar has said that the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, has published a
list of 173 enterprises that failed to pay their due taxes.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a punishment adopted by the Liaoning Taxation
Bureau, according to Zhao Shichun, director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The names of the enterprises' chief executives were also listed
in Shenyang Daily last week. The taxes owed by these enterprises
totaled over 30 million yuan (3.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The amount of taxes they owed ranges from a mere 100 yuan (12
dollars) to more than 5 million yuan (600,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"No matter how small the amount, the nature of owing taxes is
the same," Zhao emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Freezing capital and assets and auctioning properties are also
among the measures adopted to punish tax-evasion and delays in
paying tax, he added.
</P>
<P>
These measures are aimed at raising the enterprises' awareness
of their obligation to pay taxes and to protect state interest, he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Oil Reserves Reach 8.89 Billion Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's national petroleum
reserves stood at 8.89 billion barrels as of January 1, 1999 while
natural gas reserves were 133.35 trillion cubic feet, an official
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, we have explored as much 38 basins from 60 sediment
basins which we have," Director Martiono Hadianto of the state-run
oil and gas company, Pertamina, said at the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's oil production capacity could still be
maintained and even increased in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
"(Production capacity can be increased) As long as the
international oil price could be held at a high level and the
government is able to push exploration activities to find new
reserves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is one of the members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Currently oil price in the international market is 25 U.S
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Indonesia's petroleum output comes from
the country's western area.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore in the third millennium the development of oil and
gas industries will be directed to the eastern territory, moreover
we have found new oil reserves in the Malaka Straits and Irian
Jaya," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hadianto added that Indonesia has also a great potential for
developing geothermal energy.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified about 70 fields of geothermal energy whose
potential is estimated at about 19.658 megawatts," he said.

<HEADLINE> Meretz Threatens to Quit Israeli Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli party of Meretz
has threatened to quit the coalition if the government continues
its policies of settlement expansion, land expropriations,
deportations and home demolitions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Meretz can only accept responsibility for government decisions
if it is a partner to such decisions," which is often not the
case, Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid said on Monday at a Knesset
faction meeting, the Jerusalem Post reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meretz's threat to quit the government followed Monday's
decision by the Palestinians not to continue with peace talks
until Israel stops settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Housing Ministry issued tenders for building
another 500 houses for settlers in the West Bank, bringing the
total tenders issued by the current government to 3,196 since it
came to power in July.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Ministry said the tenders were approved by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's Meretz faction meeting, Sarid, also Education
Minister, condemned the recent evacuation of palestinian
cave--dwellers near Yata near Hebron, saying the evacuation was
one of the most ugly and contemptible of the old Israeli
occupation policies in the territories.
</P>
<P>
"Meretz isn't sitting in the government in order to lend
a hand to such things that it would never agree to," Sarid
said.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table,
State Department Spokesman James Rubin told reporters on the
plane en route to Riyadh Monday night that the United States
believes the Palestinians should not make "preconditions" by
linking the final-status talks to the halting of Israeli
settlement activities in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin also made it clear that the U.S. sees
settlement expansion as "unhelpful" and it can "harm the
environment in which the peace process has to take place."

<HEADLINE> Railway Engineers Sentenced for Major Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Two railway engineers who were
found guilty of causing a major train accident on the Beijing-
Guangzhou Railway Line in July were sentenced last weekend to
prison terms of six months and one year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was handed down by the Hengyang Railway Transport
Court of central China's Hunan Province in an open trial held on
December 4.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingcheng and Zhang Hong were both engineers with the
Changsha Maintenance Section of the Changsha Railways Corporation.
On July 9, the two, with Li as the chief engineer and Zhang as co-
engineer, were towing the Wuchang-Zhanjiang 461 Train from
Changsha to Hengshan by locomotive at about 11 o'clock at night.
</P>
<P>
The two failed to apply the brakes and reduce their high speed
of 111 km per hour in time while passing a turnoff near Hengyang,
which allows for a speed of only 45 km per hour. This failure
resulted in derailment of the train.
</P>
<P>
The accident killed nine people, injured 40 others, and
destroyed 12 carriages, causing direct economic losses of over six
million yuan. Because of the accident, railway transport
operations heading south on the major north-south Beijing-
Guangzhou trunk line were completely suspended for more than 32
hours.
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's trial, Li Jingcheng and Zhang Hong were both
found guilty of committing a railway operation safety crime. Li
was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and Zhang was given a six-
month prison sentence. The two were both given one year's
probation in consideration of their cooperative attitude with
accident investigators.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Huge Inkstone to Honor Macao's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A master craftsman in
north China have made a 26-ton inkstone to honor the upcoming
return of Macao to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The inkstone is 6.3-meters long, 2.6-meter-wide and 1.2-meters
high taken from a 60-ton rock from a mountain along the Yishui
River in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Yishui inkslabs, which are very famous for their exquisiteness,
rank among one of the four best kinds of inkstones in China.
</P>
<P>
The artwork on the inkstone bears 1999 lotus in full blossom,
12 phoenix and 20 dragons, and auspicious signs marking the Macao'
s return to the motherland on December 20. Macao has been
subjected to foreign colonial rule for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jingwen, a well-known craftsman, said that inkstone and
swallow are both pronounced as "Yan" in the Chinese language. A
swallow flying home symbolizes the return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
It was no easy feat for local workers to move the rock from
the mountain. Initially, workers attempted to move the 60-ton
stone onto a 10-ton truck with little success. They then laid down
logs on the ground and moved the rock little by little to the
Hebei Yishui Carving Center. During the process two bridges were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of skilled craftsmen have spent more than two years
completing the inkslab.

<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has held talks with Richard Holbrooke, ambassador of the
United States to the United Nations, on the peace process in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after the meeting which took more than two
hours here on Monday, Holbrooke said they discussed how the U.S.
could help in the effective implementation of the Lusaka pace
accord which was signed in July and August this year by the
warring parties to the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We were here to understand first before we are able to make
decisions," said U.S. senator Russell Feingold who was
accompanying Holbrooke on his African tour.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports of renewed fighting in the DRC, with
both sides accusing each other of violating the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke could not give details about the meeting, but he and
his party expressed the concern about the renewed fighting in the
DRC, which threatens to tear the Lusaka accord apart.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan
Rice told reporters last month that her country was prepared to
offer material and financial support to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. supported three main components of the Lusaka
accord, namely the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
DRC, withdrawal of foreign troops and the democratic transition of
the central African country.

Myanmar, Japan Hold Joint Economic Conference
</P>
<P>
YANGON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Japan are jointly
holding an economic conference here to promote bilateral economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day third Myanmar-Japan Joint Economic Conference,
which began Monday, papers on the aftermath of the Asian financial
crisis and on Japan's response to the crisis were presented by
Vice-Governor of the Central Bank of Myanmar U Than Lwin and
Counselor of Mitsui Company Endo respectively.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Myanmar Federation of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry U Zaw Min Win also presented a paper on an
investment analysis of foreign direct investment in Myanmar.

should be confined to the age-level at which the offenses were

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia to See Steady Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- If the faster-than-expected
economic recovery in Asia this year proves a beginning of a
cyclical upswing, then the region is likely to see strong and
steady growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
With a financial crisis drawing to an end, Asia's performance
in 1999 is extremely remarkable. The gross domestic product (GDP)
growth rate for Southeast Asia is projected to be 3 percent this
year, in sharp contrast with a negative growth of 7.5 in 1998,
according to a forecast by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in
November.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which suffered a 5.8 percent GDP decrease a year
ago, could register a 9 percent growth this year, and Singapore,
Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia follow South Korea with
growth in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The developing Asia will register an average growth rate of 5.
7 percent this year from 2.3 percent in 1998, and all these
countries are expected to maintain the same growth rate in 2000,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Asia's recovery this year has been based on an increase in
global demand for electronic products, an increase in commodity
prices and a strengthening domestic demand as a result of
reflationary monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
The fast turnaround, which started in the first quarter of the
year, has set the stage of for a more robust growth in 2000,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
Also, conditions for economic growth in 2000 appear more
favorable than this year.
</P>
<P>
After two years of belt-tightening, consumers in the region are
starting to spend again. More consumption will inevitably
stimulate demand of the domestic market and eventually lead to
economic expansion in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Once more, consumers are spending, despite unemployment
concerns. Retail sales are soaring, including sales of durable
items such as cars," said Manu Bhaskaran, managing director and
group head of research at SG Securities in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Thais and (South) Koreans, among others, are digging deep into
their pockets for more expensive items, suggesting their long-term
view of the economic future has improved substantially," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that a rise in consumption would also help ease
the deflationary pressure in some Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
With investor confidence returning, the increasing inflows of
private capital into Asia could fuel the steady growth next year,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Recent data shows that net private capital inflows to the five
crisis-affected countries -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines, and South Korea -- are forecast to rise to 5.1
billion U.S. dollars in 1999 as opposed to a net outflow of 38.6
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
More foreign capital inflows into the region are almost certain
in 2000, after the initial increase this year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the recent resurgence of loan growth could
gradually loosen a painful constraint on economic recovery in Asia
next year.
</P>
<P>
In a report published last month, Roy Ramos, a regional banking
analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that "loan growth has started to re-
emerge on a month-on-month basis across Asia" and in some cases is
giving rise to"surprisingly robust annualized growth rates."
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, new loan approvals almost doubled in the first
nine months of this year. Even in Thailand, some of the surviving
domestic banks are talking about increasing their loan portfolio
by about 4 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
What is most important for Asia to achieve a steady growth next
year is a much better social and political environment in the
region now.
</P>
<P>
From Indonesia to South Korea, from Thailand to the Philippines,
the easing of economic difficulties in the past year has made the
political and social environment more conducive to the economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Such a trend is expected to continue in the coming year and
help Asian countries to concentrate on economic development,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the new year, reform efforts need to be sustained
if the growth momentum is to be maintained and social costs of any
future downturns are to be minimized.
</P>
<P>
This is the advice for Asian economies by the Manila-based ADB.

<HEADLINE> Seagulls Put on Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Seagulls in Kunming, the capital
city of Yunnan Province in southwest China, have been put on a
special diet after too many bread-toting tourists fattened them up.
</P>
<P>
The red-mouthed sea-gulls migrating from Siberia here this
winter are becoming too plump to reproduce, ornithologists said.
</P>
<P>
"Too much fat will stay in the ovaries of the sea-gulls and
influence their fertility," said Yang Lan, an ornithologist with
the Kunming Animal Research Department of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The seagulls can get enough proteins from fish and shrimps in
their natural environment, but bread provides excess carbohydrates
which are hard to get out of a bird's system, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
With 100,000 yuan (about 11,400 U.S. dollars) in funding from
the local environmental protection department, a nutritionally-
balanced menu has been planned for the birds by biologists from
Yunnan University.
</P>
<P>
The gulls are fed regularly by workers and are expected to get
the special meals soon.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's largest commercial
bank, Bangkok Bank, will apply a new rating system for borrowers
over the next three years as part of a new risk management scheme,
the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new rating scheme would be used by the bank internally in
calculating how to price risks and set interest rates for
borrowers, Ayuth Krishanamara, Bangkok Bank executive vice
president, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But first of all, the bank wants to build up its information
database on borrowers, including business plans and cashflow
projections.
</P>
<P>
At present, the bank's interest rates for loans are based on
minimum lending or minimum retail rates plus a premium based on
risks faced by different industries.
</P>
<P>
The new system would allow the bank to offer good customers
lower interest rates, reflecting their lower credit risks, Ayuth
said.
</P>
<P>
Lending practices by the bank will change completely. Prime
focus will be given on borrowers' capacity to service their debt,
their operational procedures, technology, management practices and
accounting procedures.
</P>
<P>
Borrowers not in line with the bank's standards will go through
a screening process on what risks are present and how they should
be managed and priced.
</P>
<P>
By taking a more systematic approach, old practices of
relationship-based lending will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank ranked among the world's most profitable in 1993,
but since July 1997 it has become one of the most troubled. It
posted a loss of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. Of its loans
totaling 958 billion baht (25 billion dollars), half are
classified as non-performing.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's mobile phone
industry is going to see a boom as an estimated one million
handsets are expected to be sold this year, the Nation newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total handsets sold, 60 percent were purchased by first-
time subscribers, while the rest were picked up by existing
subscribers moving up to newer models, the newspaper quoted
information provided by suppliers and mobile phone operators.
</P>
<P>
Giant international suppliers all benefit from the boom, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The sales of Nokia mobile phones, which has taken more than
half of the local market, had reached their peak, the company said,
without giving details of sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Ericsson and the U.S.-based Motorola also enjoyed good
sales performance this year. Ericsson said it has sold around 250,
000 handsets this year.
</P>
<P>
The soaring demand for mobile phones is also encouraging
network operators to work out network expansion plans to serve the
greater number of subscribers in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Advanced Info Service (AIS), the country's largest mobile phone
operator,allocated 10 billion baht (259.7 million U.S. dollars)
for its expansion project next year, while its two rivals also set
aside four billion baht (103.8 million dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
AIS said it is expected to see 360,000 new subscribers this
year,making the company's total subscribers 1.2 million by the end
of this year.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environment protection
experts have made it a point to promote nationwide a technology to
generate electricity through the burning of garbage and waste.
</P>
<P>
The process was developed at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou,
the capital of Zhejiang Province, and is expected to also be used
overseas.
</P>
<P>
A dozen cities in China, including Xi'an, Ningbo, Zhengzhou,
plan to use the process in an effort to dispose of rubbish and
waste at no cost to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The common practice of burying waste has proved harmful to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million tons of rubbish and waste are produced in
urban areas in China every day. The Chinese government has been
urging to adopt favorable policies on pollution-free treatment of
rubbish and waste.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar has said that the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue
is crucial to the normalization of bilateral relations between
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"It should be clear to everyone that without resolving the core

"There exist many problems between India and Pakistan, of which

and "is anxious to promote nuclear restraint as well as confidence-
building measures."

He said Pakistan is keen to resume a meaningful and result-
oriented dialogue with India. "We trust that this process will be
revived in the near future."

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal on Macao's Role in U.N. Narcotics Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of China and
Portugal on Monday presented to the U.N. office in Vienna their
governments' statements on Macao's participation in the U.N.
Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the U.N. International Drug
Control Program (UNIDCP).
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese statement said that according to the 1987 Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao, the
Portuguese government's control over Macao's foreign affairs and
the territory's participation in the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs and the UNIDCP will cease on December 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese statement said that under the Sino-Portuguese joint
declaration, the Chinese government will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999. From that day on,
Macao will be a special administrative region of China and the
Chinese government will be responsible for Macao's foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
It said China's membership in the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs shall cover Macao as of December 20, 1999. Accordingly, the
Chinese government acknowledges that as of December 20, 1999,
representatives of the Macao Special Administrative Region should
be able to continue to attend plenary sessions and special
meetings of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs and other drug-
related international conferences in the capacity of Chinese
representatives.
</P>
<P>
While respecting regulations of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs, the Macao Special Administrative Region, with the
permission of the Chinese government, should be able to
participate independently, in the name "Macao, China", in Asia-
Pacific anti-narcotic executives' meetings and continue to
participate in relevant activities of the UNIDCP.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant international conventions, Macao's
reports on narcotic and psychotropic drugs should first be sent to
the central government of China which will then transfer them to U.
N. agencies, the Chinese statement said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese representative to the U.N. and other international
organizations in Vienna, Zhang Yishan, in a note to the U.N.
office in Vienna, asked its director Pino Arlacchi to put China's
statement on record and call the attention of all members of the U.
N. narcotic commission to it.

ZAGREB, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel said in Sarajevo on Monday that his country is
willing to provide assistance in all fields to Bosnia and play a
more active role in its reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Demirel called for further efforts to raise the level of
bilateral economic cooperation after meeting with Bosnia's three-

Croatia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although bilateral trade between the two
countries has increased steadily in recent years and reached 43
million U.S. dollars in 1998, the figure did not reflect the
potential for economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's three-member presidency said the visit by Demirel was
an important step to strengthen the traditional friendship between
the two countries, and Bosnia regards Turkey as a strategic
partner in developing economy.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Demirel and his Bosnian counterparts signed a
bilateral agreement on cultural cooperation. The two sides are
expected to sign an accord on bilateral trade cooperation and
avoiding double tariffs.

<HEADLINE> DPR Korea Proposes Exchange of Coaches, Players With Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia - DPR. Korea
friendship institution has suggested an exchange of coaches and
players in a bid to boost both countries' sports relationships,
the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's ambassador to the DPR. Korea Buchari Effendi said
that the institution wanted Indonesian softball and badminton
coaches or players to train DPR. Korea's athletes.
</P>
<P>
Effendi said DPR. Korea had offered to send its table tennis
coaches or players to Indonesia for brief training sessions with
Indonesian athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The institution hoped that it could send coaches here to learn
badminton and softball or that Indonesia could send its coaches
and players of the sports to train in (DPR.) Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian ambassador cited a cultural agreement between
the two countries to support the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"They wished to complete the agreement to develop their
national sports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Effendi said the institution had officially asked for softball
coaches from Indonesia in June 1999, but there had been no
response as yet. He said that he would send a formal request to
the ministry of education and culture, who signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He added that the DPR. Koreans had yet to confirm the stipend
for the Indonesian sports officials. He also said that Korea
basically had potential athletes in store.
</P>
<P>
Effendi said the last performance of the DPR. Korean athletes
was in the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, where they finished eighth
with seven gold, 14 silver and 12 bronze medals. Indonesia was
11th with six gold, 10 silver and 11 bronze medals.

<HEADLINE> China to Snuff out Fake Cigarettes Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The business of making and
selling fake and substandard cigarettes in China is about to go up
in smoke, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The State Quality and Technical Supervision Administration has
launched a nationwide, iron-fisted crackdown on manufacturers and
distributors of shoddy cigarettes. Officials say they want to
restore market order and better protect consumers' rights.
</P>
<P>
In a single crackdown last week in Guizhou Province, officials
seized more than 2,000 cartons of cigarettes with forged
trademarks, 53 manufacturing machines, tons of tobacco leaves and
packing materials, the administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Production and sales of fake and substandard cigarettes have
run rampant in eastern and southern provinces such as Fujian and
Guangdong in recent years, despite crackdowns launched every year.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale action will also be launched in Guangxi, Hainan,
Zhejiang, Beijing and Shanghai, which are known as prime spots for
the manufacturing and sales of fraudulent tobacco products, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers and distributors have even set up complete
networks across the country to dodge crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
They evade about 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in taxes every year through illegal production and sales
of such cigarettes, said Pan Yue, a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
Domestic manufactures of brand-name cigarette products also
suffer grave economic losses from the scam, Pan said.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada staged national memorial
services Monday to mark the 10th anniversary of Montreal massacre,
which killed 14 women.
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean Chretien paid tribute to the
victims with the capital city flying the national flag at half
mast.
</P>
<P>
"Time stood still in Canada on that day and for the families

rage," the prime minister said at Parliament Hill.
</P>
<P>
In Montreal, a plaque with the 14 victims' names was unveiled
at the Ecole Polytechnic School, the scene where the massacre took
place.

A 25-year-old gunman shot and killed 14 female students and
employees and injured 13 others in an anti-feminist shooting spree
on December 6, 1989. The gunman shot himself dead after the
shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
Montrealer Jim Edward was shedding tears Monday for his
daughter Anne-Marie, one of the 14 women killed by the deranged
gunman. He and his wife were among several hundred people turning
out in pouring rain for a memorial service at the Ecole
Polytechnic School.
</P>

Memorial services were also witnessed in other major Canadian
cities including Edmonton and Toronto.

<HEADLINE> New Agency to Help Copyrights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China will select 10 major
cities to try out regulations drafted to protect the intellectual
property rights of technology designers, according to the State
Intellectual Property Office.
</P>
<P>
The selection of cities is just one of the Intellectual
Property Office's moves to strengthen China's protection of
copyrights, reported today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The number of chosen cities will gradually expand. The
government hopes the city-by-city effort will entice developers
such as software engineering firms to build up business in China,
Ma Lianyuan, vice-commisssioner of the Intellectual Property
Office, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his agency is racing against time to help revise China'
s Patent Law in line with global trends and the needs of new
technology developed at home.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his agency has enhanced its administrative role since
it merged last year with the former Conference Office of
Intellectual Property Rights under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Although the name of the State-Council-based office has
changed, the role of enforcing IPR protection has not been changed
or weakened in any way," Ma stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since last April, more steps have been taken to intensify
intellectual property rights protection, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return Heralds New Sino-Portuguese Ties: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio said Monday that Sino-Portuguese relations will enter a
new stage of development after the return of Macao to China on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Sampaio said, "I'm fully confident
that Portugal and China will, as always, continue to maintain and
develop their relations of friendly cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The question of Macao is an issue left over from history, and
the signing of the "Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the
Question of Macao" in 1987 through friendly cooperation and
consultation set a good example of settling bilateral issues
through peaceful means, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the peaceful settlement of the Macao issue is of
great importance in today's world where destabilizing and violent
factors still exist.
</P>
<P>
Portugal in 1975 recognized that Macao is part of China and
this stance was reaffirmed when China and Portugal established
diplomatic relations in 1979 and signed the joint declaration on
the question of Macao in 1987, he said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal will continue to respect the principles of the joint
declaration both literally and in terms of spirit, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio also praised late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping for his
concept of "one country, two systems," which the president said
had played a decisive role in guaranteeing Macao's stable
transition and a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Describing his view on Macao's prospect as "undoubtedly
positive and optimistic," Sampaio said he believed that after its
return to China, Macao will continue to enjoy peace, progress and
economic development and that a successful governance of the
future local government of Macao will be unquestionable.

<HEADLINE> Italian Central Bank Chief Calls on Government to Lower Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy Governor Antonio
Fazio called on the government to bring down the level of taxation
on Monday, arguing that lower taxes would boost the country's
flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the finance police training academy in the
Italian northern city of Bergamo, Fazio said that "while
respecting international commitments to reduce the level of our
public debt, it is necessary to move more firmly towards a steady
reduction in fiscal pressure."
</P>
<P>
"We must implement the measures outlined in the budget with
plans for further reductions over the following years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that lower taxes would stimulate economic growth as
they would "give hope to numerous young people entering the job
market."
</P>
<P>
"The loss of competitiveness is reflected in a reduction of
foreign trade activity. Jobs become concentrated in economically
advanced regions and increasingly take the form of short-term
contracts."
</P>
<P>
He said that structural reforms are necessary and would make
Italy more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government was swift in responding to Fazio's
remarks: Finance Minister Vicenzo Visco told reporters that the
government had been pursuing a policy of lower taxes for the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
"There has already been a partial reduction in fiscal pressure
and we will stick to this path," Visco said.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia to Introduce More Foreign Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region in northwest China plans to introduce some 660 million U.S.
dollars of foreign funding by the year 2005 to stimulate local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The figure will be two times that of the five-year period from
1996 to 2000, a local senior official said, adding that this is
part of the central government's effort to step up the development
of central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia will focus on introducing advanced technologies from
abroad and will raise financing through issuing shares and bonds
overseas, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, Ningxia has used a total of 180 million dollars of
foreign capital, with direct foreign investment amounting to 55
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign money went to energy, transportation,
telecommunications and agricultural sectors and water conservancy,
environment protection and poverty-relief projects.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment, which now accounts for 4.5 percent of the
autonomous region's total fixed assets, has played an important
role in local economic development. Overseas-funded enterprises
have provided jobs for 25,000 people.

HARBIN, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, one of
the country's largest food production bases in northeast China
neighboring Russia, is to provide Hong Kong with 10,000 tons of
spring wheat.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang Bureau for Land Reclamation recently signed a
contract on the spring wheat supply with the Hong Kong Lam Soon

</P>
<P>
After a series of sample tests, officials with Lam Soon said
that the spring wheat grown in Heilongjiang is of high quality and
can be used for food processing.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the Lam Soon Group will produce high-
quality flour using materials in Heilongjiang and processing
technologies in Hong Kong, and export the products to south Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Land reclamation in Heilongjiang started soon after the
founding of new China in 1949, and now the province has more than
100 large state-owned farms, which produce over five billion
kilograms of agricultural products each year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Senior Citizens Turn to Community Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Although Chinese children
traditionally take care of their elderly parents, more and more
senior citizens say they will turn to community services for the
help their kids don't have time to give.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by the Population and Development
Research Institute at the Tianjin-based Nankai University, most
younger family members think that caring for their elderly parents
will interfere with their job -- even though they are willing to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Most senior citizens, according to the survey, don't want to be
a burden to their children, while the rest still hope the kids can
lend a hand with the routine needs, such as providing medical care
and entertainment, food shopping, and doing the laundry.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in Beijing and Tianjin, showed that about
54 percent of the elderly like to use the low-cost services
provided by communities or local residents' committees.
</P>
<P>
About 22 percent of them, however, turned down community
assistance because they feared they wouldn't get good service or
it would be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, a port city in north China, has about 1.2 million
people over age 60, which is 13.15 percent of the total population
of the city. By early 1998, about ten percent of the total 1.2
billion Chinese people were over 60, and the number is growing by
three percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, enterprises and individual investors
have spent a large sum of money to provide high-quality community
services for the senior citizens. So far, more than 100 apartment
buildings have been set up for the elderly in Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Attorney General Reopens Soeharto's Corruption Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General
's Office has said it was reopening the investigation into alleged
corruption by former president Soeharto, national newspapers
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the investigation by the Attorney General's Office,
we have found new aspects (enabling) the reopening of the
investigation against Soeharto," Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said in a written statement published by the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said evidence pointed to "a misuse of power and
authority"in issuing government regulations and presidential
decrees to amass funds for foundations linked to Soeharto, his
family and associates.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto as a president, who had the authority to issue
government and presidential decrees, is suspected of misusing his
authority as a means to collect money to finance the foundations
he chaired, and for the benefit of his family and cronies ...
which directly and indirectly caused state losses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said his office was revoking a letter issued by then
attorney general Ismudjoko on October 11 suspending the
investigation into Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced down in May last year, is accused of
massive corrupt, collusive and nepotistic practices during his 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
However, the Attorney General's Office, after months of
investigation, found no evidence of wrongdoing by Soeharto and the
investigation was halted on October 11 during the last week of B.J.
Habibie's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Since being sworn in as attorney general in October, Marzuki
has expressed his commitment to reopening the investigation.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Edges Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's
basket of seven crude oils dropped slightly to 24.54 U.S. dollars
per barrel last week from 24.90 dollars in the previous week, the
secretariat of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The average price per barrel in November reached 23.74 dollars,
the highest in recent months, compared with 21.67 dollars in
October. The price averaged only 12.28 dollars per barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The continuous increase in oil prices strengthened OPEC's
determination to maintain the current production quota. Ali Al-n'
aimi, minister of petroleum and mineral resources of Saudi Arabia,
the main oil producer country of OPEC, said the oil price was
steady now and it was not necessary to change the current quota.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiya, current president of OPEC and
minister of energy and industry of Qatar, said that OPEC was not
considering any expansion of oil output.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new ambassador to
Libya on Monday promised to "make a fresh start" to the relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Richard Dalton, who was appointed as Britain's ambassador to
Tripoli after the two countries ended their 15 year political
impasse, said he wanted to help Tripoli return to the "mainstream
of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"We're making this fresh start. We will be proceeding
cautiously," Dalton said at the Foreign Office in London.
</P>
<P>
"We want the relationship to be on a sound and stable basis,"
said Dalton.
</P>
<P>
He said the groundwork for the resumption of ties with Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi had been laid in talks before a July
declaration that Libya would cooperate with investigations into
the fatal shooting in 1984 of British policewoman Yvonne Fletcher
outside Libya's embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said last month Libya had agreed
to pay compensation to Fletcher's family and the money, reported
by British newspapers to be 250,000 pounds ($404,900), had been
handed over.
</P>
<P>
Libya had also agreed to support international efforts in
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In April, the two suspects wanted by the United states and
Britain for the bombing in 1988 of a Pan-Am airliner, over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie, which killed 270 people were handed to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes U.N. Vote on Iraq This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
had made "a good deal of progress" on a new arms inspection regime
for Iraq and a U.N. vote would probably take place this week.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a Security Council vote on the omnibus draft
is likely this week," State Department spokesman James Foley told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The five countries -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States -- have been negotiating for months over the terms
they should set for an end to the trade sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The draft U.N. resolution links suspending the sanctions with
Iraq accepting the new inspection system, to replace the UNSCOM
system which broke down last year after the U.S. and British
barbarous bombing of the country.
</P>

"We would like to see this draft adopted with the broadest
possible support among council members," Foley said. "I can't
predict an exact time for the vote or indeed what the vote count
will be but there is an increasing view that the time has come to
vote and to resolve this matter clearly."
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States hoped for progress on the
resolution by Saturday of this week, when the latest U.N. oil-for-
food program for Iraq runs out.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Urges End to Reprisals Against Serbs in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini warned Monday that reports arriving from Kosovo suggest that
the Albanian Kosovars are pursuing something like ethnic cleansing
against the province's Serb and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, Dini, who is now present
at the European union (EU) Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels,
said that "the reports we are receiving go in that direction could
almost say the international community has proven incapable of
ending violence against minorities in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, NATO waged an air war on Yugoslavia with the
declared international aim of halting Serbian ethnic cleansing
against the Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
Since Serbian forces withdrew from the province, there has been
a rising number of reports of Albanian attacks on members of the
Serb, Croatian and Rom minorities.
</P>
<P>
"The Croatians were chased out of a village where they had
lived for 700 years," said Dini, warning that the international
community's commitment to defending the Albanians must be matched
by a similar commitment to the other ethnic groups in the province.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that the head of the civilian administration set up
in Kosovo by the U.N., Bernard Kouchmer, was complaining that he
has neither the forces nor the means to prevent violence and
reprisal in the province.
</P>
<P>
Dini also had harsh words for the KLA, the ex-Kosovar
liberation army, which he said should be issued with a "strong
call" to respect U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he charged that the KLA is illegally levying
taxes on the Kosovars to run a "government-style" administration
in parallel with the UN's.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he pointed out, the KLA asks the EU and the
international community to pay the wages of Kosovars employed by
some parts of the province's administration.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is unthinkable that people should not be aware of
how the KLA behaves," said Dini.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for More Attention to HIV/AIDS in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday called for more efforts to sped up the work on
developing a vaccine, to use every possible means to halt the
spread of the diseases in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, in his speech to the meeting on International
Partnerships Against HIV/AIDS in Africa, painted a gloomy picture
on the serious problem of AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the international community should work hard "to
break the conspiracy of silence at every level," "to meet the
needs of those already infected and their families," and "to make
effective treatment available, at a price African societies can
afford," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, the global community had not even heard of
AIDS," he said. "Today, the AIDS pandemic -- unexpected,
unexplained, unspeakably cruel -- presents us, especially in
Africa, with a tragedy we can barely comprehend, let alone manage.
"
</P>
<P>
"Africa's southern and eastern region, with less than five
percent of the world's population, is home to more than 50 percent
to those living with HIV," the virus that can cause the AIDS
disease, he said. "It is where 60 percent of all AIDS deaths have
happened so far."
</P>
<P>
"And it is where a whole generation of children is now losing
its parents to AIDS," he said. "By the end of this year, the
global epidemic will have left 11 million orphans -- and 90
percent of them will be African children."
</P>
<P>
All this is an unbearable tragedy and burden for millions of
individuals and their families, he said, adding that it is also
devastating the economies of their countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is taking away both breadwinners and those who look after
the young, the old, and the infirm," he said. "It is destroying
the very fabric of society."
</P>
<P>
"AIDS leaves poor countries poorer still, and thus even more
vulnerable to infection," he said. "It brings in its wake
discrimination, prejudice, and often violations of human rights.
It is taking away not only Africa's present, but also its future."
</P>
<P>
"This unprecedented crisis requires an unprecedented response --
a response from all of us, whoever and wherever we are," he said.
"A response that makes humanity live up to its name."
</P>
<P>
"Our response so far has failed Africa," he said. "From now on,
let us resolve that failure is not an option."
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, held at the U.N. headquarters in New York,
is designed to form an international partnership against HIV/AIDS
in Africa by calling for a response to the killing epidemic in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attracted representatives from Africa and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Governments, U.N. agencies, civil society and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
It is intended to be the start of a process to launch a five-
year initiative to reduce HIV infections, particularly among 15-to-
24-year olds in the most affected countries.
</P>
<P>
"The actual launch of the International Partnership against
AIDS in Africa is expected next spring," a U.N. spokesman said.

LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) - Europe's major markets ended in a
mixed mode Monday as weak pharmaceutical stocks dragged down
London market, while buoyant telecom and tech shares boosted
Frankfurt and Paris higher.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 finished down 0.7 percent, or 48.2

gains in the telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
Drug shares, which account for 12 percent of the FTSE 100's
overall value, dropped sharply as investors braced for a difficult
environment for the sector in the year ahead.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome slumped 2.7 percent to 1826 pence, while rival
SmithKline Beecham tumbled 6.9 percent. AstraZeneca shed 7.3
percent, making it the sector's leading decliner.

<HEADLINE> West Ham Play to Goalless Draw with Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Shaka Hislop became the hero of
West Ham United this evening with two brilliant saves which earned
the team a hard-earned goalless draw at Tottenham Hotspur at
English premier league.
</P>
<P>
The West Ham goalkeeper denied Spurs full points after his team
had to play the entire second half without captain Steve Lomas,
who was dismissed moments before the interval.
</P>
<P>
Lomas was sent off after his second yellow card offense for a
wild kick. The midfielder had collected his first caution when a
linesman flagged for an off-the-ball incident.
</P>
<P>
He was the only player to be dismissed in the weekend's 10
premier league games.
</P>
<P>
It was the solitary notable incident of a first period in which
both goalkeepers were largely unemployed -- hardly unexpected
considering both sides went into the game separated by only two
places and two points.
</P>
<P>
David Ginola and Jose Dominguez tried hard to create chances
for Spurs but while their work rates were commendable, their snap
shots were wildly off target and their crosses easily dealt with
by West Ham's defense.
</P>
<P>
Steffen Iversen had a great chance to break the deadlock for
Tottenham in the 51st minute when Ginola found him just outside
the goalmouth. But the Norwegian's effort went narrowly wide.
</P>
<P>
In the 76th minute, Hislop somehow tipped away a fierce goal-
bound shot from close range by Chris Perry.
</P>
<P>
With only three minutes left, Hislop made his best save of the
match, tipping Chris Armstrong's powerful header on to the bar.
Iversen's volley from the rebound just missed the net.
</P>
<P>
West Ham, unbeaten in their last three league games, had their
moments too, particularly when Marc Vivien Foe mis-timed his
attempt from inside the goalmouth in the 70th minute and the ball
cannoned away off the legs of Tottenham goalkeeper Ian Walker.

<HEADLINE> IOC President Delivers Award to Tennis Champion Graf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 6 (Xinhua) -- President of the International
Olympic Committee Juan Samaranch delivered the Olympic Order to
tennis champion Ms Steffi Graf on Monday at an official ceremony
held at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
The IOC President said he was particularly proud to award the
highest Olympic distinction to one of the leading sport figures of
the century and to thank the Queen of tennis for her outstanding
career and contributions to the sporting world, according to an
IOC press release.
</P>
<P>
Having begun her career when she was four years old, Graf, who
announced earlier this year that she was retiring from competition,
is the only person to have won all four Grand Slam single crowns
in the 1990s. She also was a strong supporter of tennis' return in
the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 1984. She later proved to be a
major Olympic champion winning two medals - one gold in Seoul in
1988 and one silver in Barcelona in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Graf said she was honored to receive such a prestigious
distinction and pointed out that among all the awards she had
received lately, the Olympic Order meant a lot to her as she
considers the Olympic Games to represent the fundamentals of sport.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Order is awarded to recognize an individual who has
illustrated the Olympic ideal through his/her action, has achieved
remarkable merit in the sporting world, or has rendered
outstanding services to the Olympic cause, either through his own
personal achievement or his contribution to the development of
sport.
</P>
<P>
Nominations are proposed by the Olympic Orders Council and
decided upon by the Executive Board. Among the personalities that
received the Olympic Order are Fanny Blankers-Koen, Jean Borotra,
Jean-Claude Killy, Bertrand Piccard, Jesse Owens, Alberto Tomba,
Mrs. Indira Gandhi and Mr. Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Various personalities from the IOC and the sporting world were
present including Mr. Walther Troger, president of the German
Olympic Committee; Mr. Thomas Bach, former Olympic champion and
member of the IOC; Mrs. Anita DeFrantz, vice-president of the IOC;
Mr. Marc Hodler, member of the IOC and Mr. Ricci Bitti Francesco,
president of the International Federation of Tennis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aircraft Maintenance Company Guilty in Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. aircraft maintenance
company was found guilty Monday in a 1996 plane crash that killed
all 110 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
A court in Miami convicted SabreTech of improperly packaging
the oxygen canisters blamed for the cargo hold fire that caused
the ValuJet crash in the Everglades, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The company was convicted of eight counts of causing the air
transportation of hazardous materials and one count of failing to
provide training in handling hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
Two former employees of the company were acquitted of
conspiracy and charges they lied on repair records.
</P>
<P>
SabreTech could face 2.25 million dollars fines and be forced
to make restitution to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
The case involved 144 oxygen generators removed by SabreTech
from other ValuJet planes and delivered to the ill-fated flight
without the required safety caps or any markings indicating the
canisters were hazardous.
</P>
<P>
The federal case marked the first time that a maintenance
company faced criminal charges in connection with an American air
disaster.
</P>
<P>
SabreTech lawyer Ken Quinn said the guilty verdicts would be
appealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 6 (Xinhua) - - Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Monday with the blue chip index falling while the technology
index rising.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 61.17 at 11,225.
01, cutting its big gain of 247.12 points Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 9.97 at 1,423.33 but the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 25.38 at 3,546.01, surpassing the record
closing high of 3,520.63 points set last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell as investors sold stocks to take profits
from the strong rising in the previous session. The decline of
Coca-Cola's shares also help to drag the index lower.
</P>
<P>
Cock's shares slumped after the company announced that its
chairman and chief executive Douglas Ivester will step down in
April, next year.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq index rose sharply as investors continued to
pour money into technology stocks after AT&AMP;T confirmed its plan to
spin off wireless operations as a separate affiliated company and
agreed to grand more companies access to its cable TV lines to
deliver high-speed Internet services as well.
</P>
<P>
Rising of the Red Hat's shares also lifted the Nasdaq index
higher. Red Hat, a leading seller of the Linux operating system,
rose sharply after Dell Computer agreed to install Linux on its
PowerEdge servers.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.07 at 641.66 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 5.43 at 829.82. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.17 at 465.75.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,966 down, 1,132 up and 483

<HEADLINE> Francis Set for Tyson Tilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- London promoter Frank Maloney is
rivalling Frank Warren in the bid to stage Mike Tyson's proposed
British debut.
</P>
<P>
Warren has a date of January 29 booked for Manchester's MEN
Arena, while Maloney wants to feature Tyson at the Wembley Arena
on the 22nd.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the date or venue, Maloney's British and Commonwealth
heavyweight champion Julius Francis is the probable opponent.
</P>
<P>
While Maloney manages Francis, Warren has the vital link with
American cable network Showtime who screen Tyson's fights, and
that must make him favourite to win the day.
</P>
<P>
Maloney, meanwhile, is waiting for a fight contract to
guarantee Francis the biggest pay day of a career which has
blossomed late, and brought him outright ownership of a Lonsdale
Belt in April.
</P>
<P>
It must come by Wednesday - Francis' 35th birthday - with an
unreturnable deposit, or Francis goes ahead with his British title
defence against Harry Senior at the Elephant and Castle Leisure
Centre on December 18, insists Maloney.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a lot better if the two promotional companies
could sit down and work out a deal," said Maloney.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fight which has been on and off, on and off for the
last three-and-a-half weeks. If Francis gets the Tyson fight,
Christmas will have come early for him.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Tyson's handlers are happy with the opponent, I just
want to know if Tyson's going to fight in this country and who's
going to promote it.
</P>
<P>
"I've given everyone until Wednesday to deliver a contract, or
else Julius goes ahead with the 18th. I've told him not to even
focus on Tyson, just think about the 18th," he said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fined Over Unauthorized Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 6 (Xinhua) -- Nottingham Forest have pleaded
guilty before a Football Association commission to a misconduct
charge relating to unauthorized payments to management and playing
staff.
</P>
<P>
The commission ordered that the club be censured, ordered to
pay the costs of the hearing and fined 25,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Payments were made to staff outside of their contracts with
Forest covering a period from 1984 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
The charge resulted from evidence passed to the FA following
the FA Premier League inquiry into allegations of irregular
payments.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing in Nottingham the commission heard that a series
of cash payments in the region of 150-500 pounds were made by the
club to management staff.
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized bonus payments were also offered to players as an
inducement to win matches during a period from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
The payments were not recorded in the players' contracts, in
breach of FA rules.
</P>
<P>
The FA accepted that the current management and administration
of Nottingham Forest played no part in the activities which
resulted in the breach of rules.
</P>
<P>
It was also accepted that, in particular given the club's
status as a subsidiary of a public limited company, Forest now
have improved financial controls in place to prevent any
recurrence.
</P>
<P>
The commission took into account the size of the payments and
that no irregular payments have been made since 1993.

<HEADLINE> East China's Fuzhou Striving to Protect Ancient City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Buildings constructed in the old
city area of Fuzhou, the capital of east China's Fujian Province,
can only go so high, and no new structures can be put up in the
nearby mountain area.
</P>
<P>
These are the guidelines of a comprehensive development plan
for Fuzhou that was just approved by the State Council, China's
highest governing body, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to protect the old city's original
appearance, featuring three mountains, two pagodas and one street.
Records show that Fuzhou was built in B.C. 202. A grand ceremony
was organized in 1998 to celebrate the 2,200th anniversary of the
founding.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, 100-meter-wide scenic corridors will be
left in the three mountains, and buildings built inside the
corridors should be no higher than 24 meters, while structures
built inside the triangle formed by the three corridors should be
no higher than 48 m.
</P>
<P>
The plan also says that institutions that have already settled
down in the mountain region cannot begin new construction projects
and should be relocated elsewhere in the future.
</P>
<P>
Better protection of the city's historical sites along Bayiqi
Road in Fuzhou's downtown area is part of the plan.
