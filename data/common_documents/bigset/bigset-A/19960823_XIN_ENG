<HEADLINE> Indian Court Directs Transfer of Former PM's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The case against former Indian
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao took a new turn today as the
Supreme Court directed the transfer of the case to another court,
the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the apex court upheld the summons issued to Rao on
July 9 by a magistrate (chief metropolitan magistrate) from a
local court in Delhi.
</P>
<P>
It said that the chief metropolitan magistrate had acted
"fairly and impartially" while issuing the process (summons).
</P>
<P>
Keeping in view the principle that "justice should not only be
done but also appear to be done," the trial of the case was to be
shifted, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court granted exemption to Rao from personally
appearing before the new magistrate.
</P>
<P>
Rao was accused of helping a controversial godman in cheating a
non-resident Indian businessman of 100,000 U.S. dollars in
December 1983 by falsely promising him newsprint and paper pulp
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Only Two in Five of Young in UK Plan to Vote, Mori Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Political parties face a hard task
to persuade young people to vote in the next general election,
according to a poll conducted by Mori published here today.
</P>
<P>
Only two in five l8-24 year olds are "certain or very likely" to
vote compared with a turnout of more then half in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters, who were conducting the research on behalf of the
Trade Union Congress (TUC), discovered widespread apathy among young
electors but also found that the highest level of support went to
Labor.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 41 percent would always, or normally, vote
for Labor, compared with l6 percent for Conservative and 11 percent
for Liberal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Another poll conducted by TUC helps to explain young people's
apathy. When asked how well politicians understood what working life
was really like, 45 percent said "not very well". A further 24
percent said "not at all well".
</P>
<P>
While the survey results will make disappointing reading for Labor
politicians who are expecting to attract most of the votes among the
young, John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the findings were most
depressing for the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found nearly three-quarters of the young people
surveyed did not meet the "two-year-rule" qualifying period for legal
protection against unfair dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Half of respondents cited instances of unfair treatment at work
with the most commonly mentioned examples low pay and "poor
treatment by management".
</P>
<P>
Some 78 percent wanted a national minimum wage to protect
employees from exploitation and 90 percent agreed they should have
the right to be represented.

<HEADLINE> Paper: U.S. Developing New Combat Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
embarked on the most ambitious overhaul of the nation's air combat
force in more than two decades, The Washington Post said in its
Thursday edition.
</P>
<P>
In the air wars of tomorrow, the Pentagon expects U.S. jet
fighters to roam largely invisible to tracking radar. They will
spot targets on cockpit scanners long before the naked eye can see
them and shoot "smart" missiles at enemies over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon reportedly plans to replace its jet fighter fleet
with three basic new models now under development--the F/A-18E/F,
F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter. The new models promise leaps in
stealth, agility and endurance over current-generation air craft.
</P>
<P>
But the 300 billion U.S. dollars development effort, the most
expensive set of projects now on the U.S. Defense Department's
books, comes at a time of mounting doubts about America's ability
to fulfil its defense spending goals and still balance the U.S.
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. independent review groups as the General Accounting
Office and Congressional Budget Office regard the proposed
development of new planes as ultimately unaffordable, particularly
at the quantities planned.
</P>
<P>
Only the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has so far been
happy to go along with the Pentagon's costly tactical aviation
plan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese and Australian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed appreciation for the
efforts the Australian government has made to advance
Sino-Australian ties.
</P>
<P>
During talks in Beijing with Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Donwer, Qian said that recent years have witnessed
fairly big progress in Sino-Australian relations. Bilateral
exchanges and co-operation in different fields have achieved
positive results, with two-way trade and economic cooperation
maintaining a rapid and steady development.
</P>
<P>
He added that the leaders of both countries have exchanged
visits frequently.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries, both members of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and important countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, have conducted consultations and
cooperation on many international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Praising the Australian government's active attitude toward
Sino-Australian ties, Qian said that the Australian government has
stated repeatedly that it attaches great importance to its
relationship with China, and it opposes the policy of containing
China.
</P>
<P>
China would like to continue to cooperate with Australia to
improve ties on the basis of mutual respect for territorial
integrity and sovereignty, and with an eye on the future, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that the development of Australian-Chinese
relations is one of the top priorities of the new Australian
government, since pursuing cooperation with countries in
Asia-Pacific region is an important part of Australia's foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to contain China is a foolish practice, which
the Australian government firmly opposes.
</P>
<P>
Downer reiterated that his government sticks to the "one China"
policy, and recognizes that Taiwan is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
As for Sino-Australian trade and economy cooperation, Qian said
that the two countries should strengthen cooperation in the fields
of metallurgy, minerals, transportation, energy, communications
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that Australia is satisfied with the development of
Australian-Chinese economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
China has become the sixth largest trading partner of
Australia, and Australia is the tenth largest trading partner of
China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The development indicates that there is great potential for
two-way trade and economic cooperation, and it is very important
to advance bilateral trade ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer invited Qian to visit Australia. Qian accepted the
invitation with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi
and Australian Ambassador to China Richard Campbell Smith signed
an agreement between the Australian Government and the Government
of the People's Republic of China concerning the maintenance of
the Consulate-General of Australia in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Downer arrived in China this morning at the invitation of
Qian.

<HEADLINE> Australia Calls for Action on Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia made clear today its
readiness to work with other countries to forward the draft treaty
on a global nuclear test ban directly to the United Nations
General Assembly for approval, bypassing the Geneva Conference on
Disarmament as well as India's veto.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a plenary of the disarmament Conference this
morning, Australia's Disarmament Ambassador Richard Star said his
country "will be looking forward to working with friends of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to fulfil the goal of a complete
text endorsed and ready for signature by the 51st General Assembly
this year."
</P>
<P>
The final draft text of the treaty, which has been in
negotiation under the disarmament Conference over the past two and
a half years, was formally vetoed by India on Tuesday though it
was accepted by a overwhelming majority of the 61 members of the
Conference.
</P>
<P>
India's veto means that the Conference itself, which always
operates by consensus, is not able to forward the draft to the
U.N. General Assembly for endorsement and signature.
</P>
<P>
Star told reporters after the meeting that "Australian
government has made it clear that we do not want this text to
die...."
</P>
<P>
"Delegations or friends of the treaty have to consider ways of
bringing this (treaty) to the international community for its
attention, for its recognition and endorsement, and then signature
by the outset of the 51st U.N. General Assembly as called for by
the General Assembly resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government is considering a decision in the light
of the result of this week's procedural debate at the disarmament
Conference. "I hope that we'll have a decision shortly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing today's plenary, all the five nuclear weapons
states expressed their support to the final draft treaty and
called for it to be endorsed as it is without any changes. A
number of other states also expressed similar views.
</P>
<P>
It is widely feared, however, that given the firm rejection
from India, even if the draft can be adopted by majority vote at
the General Assembly, it might not be able to enter into force
indefinitely for that requires the approval of 44 states,
including India.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian Ambassador told reporters that the signature
of the treaty by a "credible" number of states, including the five
nuclear weapons states, will in itself have a mediate impact on
global behavior.
</P>
<P>
"It will stand as a disarmament and non-proliferation
instrument which affects behavior of states," Star said.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Furious at German Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- British farmers have reacted
angrily to Germay's warning to its customers not to eat British
lamb and flatly denied that British lamb posed a threat to human
health, according to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
German agriculture ministry official Werner Zwingmann urged on
Wednesday German customers to buy lamb and mutton from countries
other than Britain until further scientific advice is given.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the German warning, the British National Farmers
Union (NFU) said earlier today that the German allegation had no
factual basis and British lamb and mutton are safe.
</P>
<P>
Ben Gill, deputy president of the NFU, is quoted as saying in a
BBC television interview that the link between BSE and sheep was
purely hypothetical, scrapie has been around for 250 years or
more, it's a problem throughout Europe and there is not threat at
all from scrapie to human health.
</P>
<P>
Welsh National Farmers' Union chairman John Lloyd Jones said
that he was astonished by the German comment and he stressed,
"what we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries
are going to take Germany's lead".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Commission, the executive arm of the
European Union, rejected the German call to boycott British lamb
in Brussels this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We don't support any such recommendation because we don't see
any grounds for it," the Commmission's chief spokesman Nikolaus
van der pas told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that further scientific study was required
and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by
the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Massive Exodus of Refugees From Government Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, Augest 22 (Xinhua) --A massive exodus of people has
taken place at the Bo government camp in the south of Sierra
Leone, rebel agencies officials said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
'' They started leaving in small proportion but since the
begining of the week, the number has intensified'', local red
cross coordinator, James Swarray said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people were at the camp at the height of the
rebel war in 1992 but the number dwindled to half the figure by
the start of the ceasefiore in March, Swarray said.
</P>
<P>
According to Swarry, over 50,000 people have already left the
camp with majority returning to Pujehun District also in the
south, from where they were uprooted by the rebel war.
</P>
<P>
The exodus is attributed to a dramatic declare of rebel threat
in Pujehun and thousands are making a return march through thick
bushes, trucks and bicycles, carrying assorted items as mats a
and crumpled buckets, dragging along pot-bellied loadlers.
</P>
<P>
According to the red cross estimate, 28,800 people have so far
returned to Pujehun within the past three weeks but other sources
put the number slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
The Belguim-based Medecins Sans Fronteres (MSF) has already
opened clinics in Potoru, Bamdajuma Sewa and Pujehun towns and
the British organisation Africare has supplied seed rice to
returnees. Markets are also being rehabilited. The Food and
Agriculture Organisation is funding a 399,000 U.S.Dollar project
for the supply of suitable scrap metal for recycling of tools for
blacksmiths.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tries to Ease Tension between Syria and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia is currently conducting a
number of contacts with parties concerned in the Middle East peace
process to remove the tension between Syria and Israel, the
Russian ambassador to Lebanon announced today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Oleg Peressypkine today paid a visit to Lebanon's
Foreign Ministry and held a meeting with the ministry's Secretary
General Zafer Al Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy said at a press conference after the meeting
that all the parties concerned worried about the tension between
Syria and Israel, which he said was resulted from "their
possession of long-range missiles."
</P>
<P>
He noted that his country did not want to see this tension
and supported a continuity of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's press reported today that the tension between Syria
and Israel has mounted so high that it "threatens another Middle
East war."
</P>
<P>
The two countries accused each other of raising tensions to a
dangerous level.
</P>
<P>
The tension between Syria and Israel has mounted since Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June. The new
Israeli premier vowed not to return the Golan Heights Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel Wednesday sent a message to Syria via Washington.
Foreign Minister David Levy said that the message underlined
Israel's readiness to resume the peace negotiations "without
preconditions."
</P>
<P>
Levy accused Damascus, as well as its media, of issuing "bad
expressions and declarations," noting that "this artificial
atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could
become its prisoners."
</P>
<P>
Syria, on the other hand, accused the Jewish state of
launching a "hysterical campaign" against it after Israel's
Channel II television reported on Monday that Damascus had
recently test-fired a Scud-C missile capable to hit most cities in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israel tested its U.S.-funded Arrow 2 missile,
saying it successfully intercepted a target missile.
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly a hysterical campaign is launched against Syria and
its defense capabilities with the participation of Netanyahu, his
generals and his media network," said the Al-Baath daily, organ of
the Syrian ruling Baath party.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Arabic daily Hayat quoted senior Syrian
sources as saying today that Israel was working to "concretize" a
military strike in south Lebanon in order to "obscure" the radical
policy of Netanyahu's rightist government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri today discussed the
tension with Syrian Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam in
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told reporters after the meeting that "Israel is trying
hard to thwart all efforts aimed at breaking the dilemma in the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
He said that Netanyahu's statements and initiatives "are
provocative, intransigent and do not serve the cause of peace in
the region."
</P>
<P>
Hariri reaffirmed Lebanese-Syrian commitment to a just and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> China Orders Power Plant Equipment From Siemens Consortium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese power company today
signed a contract with a Siemens consortium to purchase equipment
for a large power plant, Siemens AG said.
</P>
<P>
Under the more-than-700-million-U.S. dollar contract signed in
Beijing today, the consortium led by the Siemens Power Generation
Group (KWU) with the U.S. Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation is to
equip China's Yangcheng coal-fired power plant.
</P>
<P>
At a total investment of 2 billion dollars and with a capacity
of 2,100 megawatts, the plant, comprising six units each rated at
350 megawatts, will be one of the largest in China.
</P>
<P>
The first unit of the plant, to be built on the site of a coal
mine some 800 kilometers southwest of Beijing in Shanxi Province,
is scheduled to put into operation in the fall of 1999. The power
plant will achieve full output in early 2002.
</P>
<P>
The electricity generated will be transmitted to the coastal
province of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The Siemens/KWU will provide the planning of the overall plant,
the six steam turbines, the mechanical equipment for the
water/steam cycle and the entire power plant instrumentation and
control equipment.
</P>
<P>
Foster Wheeler will supply the boilers and equipment for the
coal handling and ash removal systems.
</P>
<P>
China is regarded as one of the world's most dynamic power
plant markets, with new installations of around 15,000 megawatts
each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Rassemblement pour la
Republique (RPR) has decided to sue for damages inflicted by some
30 extreme leftwing demonstrators who stormed the RPR headquarters
in Paris before being forced out by police this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, all young Frenchmen belonging to the
"Anti-Le Pen Square-cut Piece Section", rushed into the RPR
headquarters shouting "papers, papers," in support of the
paperless African immigrants who are occupying the Saint-Bernard
Church of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police dispersed the demonstrators on the stages of
the building, questioned them and checked their identity cards.
Eight journalists were also questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
The assistant general secretary of the RPR Patrick Stefanini
said that "this action and the damages inflicted prove only the
mistaking by their authors of the values of dialogue and respect
on which our democratic life is founded."
</P>
<P>
"This attempt of despicable intimidation cannot influence the
position taken by the PRP vis-a-vis the clandestine immigration,"
he said.

JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
have agreed to take a common position on ivory at the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) due to be held
in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, next June.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC),who have met in Maseru, Swaziland to prepare for a
summit of the organization, today agreed to hold a special
meeting on the CITIES ban on ivory trade, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"The council agreed that member states should consolidate
their position regarding the CITIES blanket ban on trade in ivory
and elephant products," said a resolution adopted by the
ministers.
</P>
<P>
It said the council agreed that heads of state and
government (of the SADC) should "take note of the forthcoming
CITIES conference and ensure that their respective
representatives co-operate in articulating a common position".
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries, particularly Zimbabwe, have for years been
lobbying for the down-listing of the African elephants from the
CITIES appendix I to II, which allows for controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
As a way to fight the ivory trade ban, the SADC countries
in 1994 established a southern African center for ivory marketing
and the ministers have decided to change the project and name it
the Southern African Convention for Wildlife Management.
</P>
<P>
The change is meant to reflect a broader focus on wildlife
management and marketing of wildlife products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Disarmament Ambassador on Draft Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Disarmament Ambassador
Sha Zukang said here on Thursday that China supports the draft
treaty on a nuclear test ban and regrets that the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) was not able to approve it and forward it to the
UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sha made the statement to a plenary meeting of the Geneva-based
Conference on Thursday. The draft treaty he referred to was tabled
by the Dutch chairman of the negotiations Jaap Ramaker at the end
of the negotiations and was formally vetoed by India on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the draft treaty does not totally satisfy us, neither
does it cover all concerns of many developing countries, including
those of China, the Chinese delegation believes that the current
treaty text represents the achievable result of negotiations in
the past two and a half years, and by and large reflects
objectively the state of negotiations and is balanced in general,"
Sha said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China understand that some countries still
have difficulties with the draft treaty, which should have been
resolved through continued negotiations or consultations.
</P>
<P>
However, in the light of the time limit and the reality of the
negotiations, he believes that continued negotiations on or
amendments to this treaty text "does not seem to be very
practical".
</P>
<P>
"Should negotiations be reopened, the intricate and fragile
balance of the current treaty provisions may be destroyed," Sha
said, adding that in such a case, there would be little chance to
restore the balance and to reach a consensus within a short period
of time.
</P>
<P>
"Worse still, should the situation be mishandled or affected by
certain developments in the international situation, we may even
be pushed farther away from the prospect of a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) which has been long cherished by the
international community, " Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from these considerations, he said, though not
totally satisfied with the draft treaty, China supports this text
as it is and regrets that the CD was not able to approve it and
forward it to the UN General Assembly for endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Sha concluded by saying that Chinese delegation has all along
hoped that a fair and reasonable CTBT be ready and open for
signature before the end of the year. "We are convinced that all
the efforts of the CD and the international community for the
conclusion of the CTBT will not be wasted," he said.

<HEADLINE> Peres to Meet Arafat in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition leader
Shimon Peres and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat are to meet this evening at the Erez Crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first between Peres and Arafat since Israel's
general elections on May 29, was originally scheduled to take
place in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where Arafat was due to
attend a session of the Palestinian Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government reportedly barred Arafat from
flying to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After several hours of delay, Israel finally agreed this
afternoon to allow Arafat to fly to Ramallah, thus leaving not
enough time to arrange the Peres-Arafat meeting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian source said that the delay was technical,
but some Palestinian officials said it only increased tension in
the Palestinian-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Bar-Ilan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
Director of Communication, denied that the earlier decision not to
permit Arafat to fly to Ramallah related to Netanyahu's objection
to meeting between Peres and the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan noted that the delay was only caused by technical and
security reasons, stressing that Peres, the former Israeli prime
minister, can meet whoever he wants.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Netanyahu launched a blistering attack on
Peres, accusing him of interfering in the peace negotiations
between Israel and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"When I was opposition leader, I never thought for a minute
that it was possible for me to conduct diplomatic negotiations
with anyone," said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu did not specify the particular acts of Peres to
which he was referring, but said that he viewed "the attempts by
members of the opposition as very grave."
</P>
<P>
"There can only be one government," he added.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, members of the Labor party blasted the Israeli
premier's attack on Peres, calling it "impertinence" and "an
attempt to conceal a personal failure."
</P>
<P>
Peres himself advised Netanyahu to "get a longer memory and
better manners", noting that the previous government did not
prevent Netanyahu from meeting Jordan's leaders.
</P>
<P>
Peres also claimed that Netanyahu had sent the Syrians a
message urging them to wait until after the Israeli general
elections before signing an agreement with the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary-General Nissim Zvilli noted that Netanyahu was
"simply afraid of anything which smacks of peace."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to encourage meetings between individuals
and groups of Palestinians and Israelis to break the barrier of
hostility," said Zvilli, adding "it is our responsibility as the
party which received half the people's vote."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, it has been reported that Arafat
today has ordered the cancellation of a scheduled meeting of the
joint Palestinian-Israeli civil affairs committee, when it
appeared that Israel had refused to let him fly to the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Institution Urges Ban on Use of Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. institution has called
for a total ban on the use of landmines in the world because they
are the real threats to human life.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of The Defense Monitor, the Center for
Defense Information (CDI) said that there are currently over 100
million landmines scattering in 62 countries, or approximately one
mine for every 50 people on earth.
</P>
<P>
It added that there are estimatedly an additional 100 million
mines in stockpiles around the world.
</P>
<P>
The landmine problems are more serious in Afghanistan, Angola
and Cambodia, which are besieged by an estimated 28 million mines
and suffer 22,000 casualties every year, or 85 percent of the
world total.
</P>
<P>
Landmines are the real weapons of mass destruction because they
have killed or maimed more people than nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons combined did.
</P>
<P>
While urging the world community to continue its efforts
against the use of landmines, the CDI also criticized the
U.S. government for promoting the use of short-lived landmines.
</P>
<P>
"Short- or long-lived, all landmines are indiscriminate and
especially injurious weapons of terror," it said. "Present
policies and actions of the U.S. government fail the humanitarian
cause of protecting civilians from the scourge of landmines."

unite and stand against U.S. plot aimed at dominating the world's
energy center in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the visiting Bangladesh Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad, Nateq-Nouri noted that the United States tried
to control the world's energy center with its growing presence in
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He said the revival of the Islamic thought is the biggest
danger to the White House rulers and that the United States
considered Iran as the focal point for the resurgence of the
thought.
</P>
<P>
Due to the that reason, he added, the U.S. exerted all kinds
of pressures on Iran through various means.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian parliament speaker described Tehran-Dhaka ties as
"deep-rooted and close" and called for expansion of full-fledged
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He termed as "optimistic" the already reached agreements on
economic cooperation between Iran and Bangladesh and called for
speeding up their implementation.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Azad said the bilateral relations are "very good
and cordial," expressing willingness to expand ties in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
During his first round of talks with his Iranian counterpart
Ali Akbar Velayati, the visiting Bangladesh foreign minister
voiced his country's readiness to upgrade bilateral, regional and
international cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is the first state he visited since the
formation of the new Bangladeshi government, indicating the
priority Bangladesh has given to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Azad called for Iran's participation in development plan in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Velayati congratulated Aazad on establishment of the new
Bangladeshi government after the general elections and called for
exploring new grounds for economic cooperation in development
projects, road construction and industry.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of regional cooperation including
tripartite cooperation of Iran, Turkmenistan and Bangladesh and
said Iran is ready to contribute to boosting ties between
Bangladesh and the Commonwealth of the Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Velayati also called for developing Tehran-Dhaka cooperation at
the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Okays Filing of Lawsuit Against Portugal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today gave his nod to a lawsuit which the East Timorese local
authorities plan to file against the Portuguese government at the
International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"I shall not prevent the intention of the East Timorese,"
Abilio Soares, governor of East Timor, quoted President Soeharto
as saying after their meeting at the Bina Graha Presidential
Office here today.
</P>
<P>
Soares said East Timor will sue Portugal for its continuous
claim as East Timor's administrator, even after it abandoned the
territory in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Lisbon has never asked the East Timorese if they want to be
ruled by the Portugal government again, he noted, adding that East
Timor's lawsuit will include a claim to the war compensation given
by Japan to Portugal after World War II.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Portugal would appear at the International Court of
Justice to face the people of East Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former Portugal colony of East Timor was integrated as
Indonesia's 27th province in 1976. But the United Nations and
several European countries still recognize Lisbon as its
administrative authority.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines can become
Poland's important trading partner in Southeast Asia, says the
Polish Foreign Minister, Dariusz Rosati.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a visit by the Philippines foreign
minister, Domingo Siazon. The Philippines had become an important
nation in the region and Poland would like to enhance its
cooperation with the Philippines, he added.
</P>
<P>
Poland's deputy prime minister, Miroslaw Pietrewicz, said
Poland was steadily pursuing a policy of developing economic
cooperation with the southeast Asian nations and would make use of
any chances to promote the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the Philippines government had agreed to send a
delegation to participate in the first Poland-Asia Economic Forum
to be held in Warsaw, at the beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines would set up a commercial representative office
in Poland next year and the two countries would sign an agreement

<HEADLINE> Lebed, Maskhadov Sign Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed and Chechen rebel military chief Aslan Maskhadov signed an
agreement on the disengagement of the warring sides this evening,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed at 19:05 Moscow time (GMT 15:05), also
envisages the pullout of troops and joint control over certain
districts of Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached as a result of the second round of
Lebed-Maskhadov talks which lasted for eight hours. Lebed,
secretary of the Russian Security Council and President Boris
Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya, held his first round of
talks, during his current Chechen trip, on Wednesday night soon
after his arrival in Grozny from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources close to Lebed, the one
problem of the talks was that the Chechen rebels insisted on a
comprehensive solution, while Lebed came out for a phased
settlement of the Chechen crisis, which means that, first and
foremost, Chechen rebels should withdraw from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, up to 10,000 Chechen
rebels are fighting in Grozny, making it clear that Russian troops
in the city totalled about the same number.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000-5,000 Chechen rebels penetrate into the Chechen
capital during the latest onslaught on the city on August 6,
Interfax said, adding that about the same number of local
civilians joined them.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Urged to Be Prepared for Typhoon Nikki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese people and army are
urged to be prepared for a new typhoon and the ensuing floods that
are threatening the capital city and the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological officials said that the storm "Nikki", the 13th
so far this year in the South China Sea and the fourth to threaten
Vietnam, is moving north-west towards northern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The storm is likely to affect the coastal areas as badly as the
storm "Frakie" did three weeks ago, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers warned that the storm could bring more heavy rains,
worsening the floods already in the northern part.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Hanoi, people have been working around
the clock to combat the flooding of the Red River over the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
The river's water level peaked at 12.40 meters on Wednesday,
inundating the suburban districts on its left bank and many
villages on its right.
</P>
<P>
Despite floods in some northern provinces, rice prices remain
stable on the Hanoi market. But beef and vegetables are 10 to 20
percent more expensive.
</P>

<HEADLINE> SADC Protocol: Major Step in Fighting Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A southern African
protocol on combatting drug trafficking represents a major step
in protecting the region from being used as a conduit and dumping
ground for drugs, a South African minister said today.
</P>
<P>
South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar made the remarks
in a statement referring to the formal adoption of the protocol on
combatting of illicit drug trafficking by heads of state of the
12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The protocol, which provides a policy framework for regional
anti-drug campaign, is scheduled to be signed by the SADC heads
of state at their summit in Lesotho's capital Maseru on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol will afford mutual legal assistance in the
region's concerted effort to suppress drug trafficking, said the
minister, adding special law enforcement measures to this effect
are also proposed in the protocol.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has reportedly become a major market for illicit
drugs like cocoaine, and the police claim scores of syndicates
are based in the country or operate from it, often using
neighboring SADC countries as points of entry.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Irish Navy Detains First Japanese Trawler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Irish naval forces have detained
a Japanese trawler and escorted it to port in a crackdown on
illegal fishing in the country's Western waters, according to
press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Irish authorities have detained a
Japanese fishing vessel inside the country's 200-mile "Irish Box"
waters on suspicion of illegal fishing.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese vessel, the Minato Maru, was being escorted to the
coast of Cork, southern Ireland after being found in the Irish
waters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Its captain is expected to be charged with fishing about 100
miles off the Galway coast inside Irish waters and about eight
tons of tuna have been found in its hold.
</P>
<P>
A senior Irish naval officer told Irish radio that navy
officers are preparing to board another Japanese fishing vessel
earlier today found inside the Irish Box.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not know whether the vessel would also be
detained and escorted to port after a search of the hold and
inspection of the trawler's documentation is carried out.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a further 30 Japanese vessels were grouped
just outside Ireland's international waters and the Irish naval
officer declined to admit that there is a coming standoff between
Japanese fishing fleet and Irish fisheries protection vessels.

<HEADLINE> Sixty Percent Couples in World Use Contraceptives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of couples
with the woman of reproductive age in the whole world used
contraceptives in 1994, representing 3 percent increase over 1990,
according to a U.N. publication available here today.
</P>
<P>
Population Newsletter said the Population Division of the U.N.
Secretariat recently completed a study with the results contained
in a publication named Levels and Trends of Contraceptive Use as
Assessed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Based on data collected from 119 countries and areas,
representing 90 percent of the world population, the publication
said that the highest level of contraceptive prevalence was in
Eastern Asia, which reached 79 percent. The average level was 72
percent for developed regions, 58 percent for Latin America, 43
percent in other parts of Asia and 18 percent for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Among the developing countries with populations of 100 million
or more, China registered the highest contraceptive use level of
83 percent, which is followed by Brazil with 65 percent. The
contraceptive prevalence ranged 40-50 percent in Bangladesh, India
and Indonesia, but remained below 15 percent in Nigeria and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter noted that contraceptive prevalence was
strongly associated with national levels of fertility. On average,
the total fertility rate decreased by 0.7 child for every 10
percentage point rise in contraceptive prevalence.
</P>
<P>
The estimated total fertility rate for the world for the
period 1990-1995 was 3.3 births per woman and it was projected 2.9
in 2000-2005 and 2.4 in 2020-2025.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Proposed for Defaulting SADC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Southern African leaders
will be urged to approve a set of sanctions against members
states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) who
default on paying their dues to the organisation, a SADC official
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC's annual summit, expected to be attended by 12 heads
of state and government, was scheduled to take place on Saturday
in Lesotho's capital Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Thursday in Maseru, SADC Executive
Secretary Kaire Mbuende said although the arrears are not too
serious, member states need to ensure they pay up on time.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by SADC's finance committee on Wednesday
showed the organisation is owed about 6.5 million U.S.Dollars by
its member states, with Tanzania owing the most with about 1.25
million U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the non-payment of contributions was
impacting negatively on the organization's programs of action.
</P>
<P>
Proposed sanctions against defaulting members had already been
approved by SADC's council of ministers, which started meeting in
Maseru on Wednesday. These included a provision that a country in
arrears for two years will not have access to conference
documents and will forfeit its right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Nationals of countries in arrears for three years will not be
employed by the SADC secretariat and the organisation's
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Member states in arrears for five years will be suspended from
the organisation.
</P>
<P>

Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

NAIROBI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said today that Kenya will intensify its solidarity and
cooperation with China in all the areas that cover the well-being
of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Receiving a Chinese delegation led by Vice-Minister of Foreign
Affairs Tian Zengpei at State House, President Moi expressed his

Referring to the economic cooperation, Moi said he is happy to

<HEADLINE> First New Cabinet Meeting Focuses on Russian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin told the first meeting of the new cabinet today that
it's unlikely the country could see an economic rebound in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, while citing some positive gains in the economy,
said that slumping production and plunging tax revenues were among
problems that blocked Russia's efforts to get the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we forge ahead and undo these knots before the end of
the year, it's unrealistic to expect economic growth to begin in
1997," he was quoted as saying by an ITAR-TASS report.
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that Russia now has a lower inflation
rate, which may fall to zero in August and wind up year with an
annual rate of about 16 percent, compared to 131 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to the prime minister, the country's
private sector now makes up 70 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) as the result of its rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, the new cabinet approved a draft of
government budget for fiscal 1997, under which the budgetary
deficit would account for 3.3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was expected to stand at 3.8 percent of GDP in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Warns of Further Delay in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today stressed the need to push forward the Middle East peace
process and warned of any further delay in making progress in
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In an open dialogue with university students in Egypt's port
city of Alexandria, Mubarak said that there would be drastic
consequences if no progress was achieved in the peace march and
the signed agreements were not implemented.
</P>
<P>
He criticized what he called Israel's pursuance of the theory
"security first and peace second," saying that it is a theory that
can never be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
The theory would only give an opportunity to enemies of peace
to undermine the peace march, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also warned of the danger of any more delay in
Israel's redeployment of its troops in Hebron, the last West Bank
town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have carried out the redeployment in March under
the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish state has delayed the redeployment following a
series of suicide bombings conducted by Palestinian extremists in
Israel in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he supported Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad's stand that the Syrian and Lebanese peace tracks are
inseparable.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can ever question the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Lebanon, but the fact remains that Syrian
and Lebanese interests are too entangled and interwoven to make
Syria accept the Israeli 'Lebanon first' proposal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal put forward by Israeli Prime Minister
earlier this month, Israel will pull out its troops from the
Israeli self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in exchange for
Syria's help in disarming the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah
guerrillas and ensuring security on Israel's northern border with
Lebanon. Both Syria and Lebanon have rejected the proposal.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Surge Strongly on German Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
surged strongly today after Germany cut its repo rate by a
higher-than-expected 0.3 percent, which triggered a series of
rates cut by several other European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank's decision today to cut its securities
repurchase rate, or repo, from 3.3 percent to an historic low of
3.0 percent surprised and delighted the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of France followed Germany's suit immediately by
lowering its intervention rate from 3.55 percent to 3.35 percent.
Other countries which also trimmed their rates include Belgium,
the Netherlands and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in London closed at a new record high of 3,891.1
on the rate cuts news although the market had earlier been hurt by
worries about the impact of U.S. legal cases on the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Frankfurt bourse surged markedly higher after
the Bundesbank rate cut which surprised most dealers who had been
expecting either no change or a much smaller cut.
</P>
<P>
French stocks also closed with sharp gains, boosted by news of
rate cuts both in France and Germany and by a strong performance
of the Franc.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed up 19 points at a record 3,891.1.
Frankfurt's DAX-30 shares ended up 13.52 at 2,557.26. Paris's

<HEADLINE> Oral Contraceptives Do Not Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Use of combined oral
contraceptives, currently by 70 million women worldwide with most
of them under age 35, does not increase the risk of stroke in
young women as earlier suspected, said the World Health
Organization (WHO) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
WHO based the conclusion on a 10-year study of more than 8,000
women in 12 developing and 5 developed countries, aiming assessing
the safety of the pill and other hormonal contraceptives
concerning the risk of cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
New data showed no link between pill use and haemorrhagic
stroke caused by broken blood vessel in the brain in women under
35, which is the more common among young women of the two types of
stroke.
</P>
<P>
The risk of ischaemic stroke caused by obstruction of brain
blood vessel is also found lower in pill users in this age group
despite a small overall increase.
</P>
<P>
The risk of both types of stroke is found higher in current
pill users who smoke, have high blood pressure or are above 35.
And no increase in risk was observed in women who had taken the
pill in the past, WHO noted.
</P>
<P>
The extensive study is the first of its kind concerning new
pills coming into use in the 1970s, which contain reduced quantity
of the two hormones of estrogen and progestogen compared to those
introduced in early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Studies undertaken in 1960s and 1970s confirmed that the
higher-dose pills increased the risk of stroke and formation of
blood clots in veins, while reducing the risk of cancer of the
ovaries and of the inner lining of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
The recent study showed that in European women using the
low-dose pills, the overall extra risk of either of the two types
of stroke was two cases per 100,000 users annually, and about one
case per 200,000 users under the age 35, and even lower among
non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
The low-dose pills pose less stroke risk than the higher-dose
pills, which are still being used by some women, WHO concluded.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Getting Ahead of U.S. in Arms Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The state-run Russian arms export
company Rosvooruzheniye today refuted information released by a
U.S. congressional oversight report that this year Russia sold
more weapons than the United States did.
</P>
<P>
Valery Pogrebyonkov, spokesman of the Russian company, told a
news conference that the information says Russian arms exports
totaled six billion U.S. dollars in 1996 against 3.5 billion in
1995, putting the U.S. arms export level at 3.7 billion dollars in
1996 against 6.2 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia's real export in 1996 may total about
3.5-3.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"To tell the truth, we are glad that the U.S. Congress
oversight organ is so optimistic about Russia and the potential of
the Russian military-industrial complex," the spokesman said,
ironically.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the real situation is reflected in Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute reports for 1994-1995,
which put Russia second, after the United States, in arms export.
</P>
<P>
Russian arms exports totaled about 1.7 billion dollars in 1994
and slightly above three billion in 1995, with Rosvooruzheniye
accounting for over 90 percent of the exports, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the company is no longer a monopolist in arms
export, and over a dozen defense industry companies have the right
to export their production abroad directly.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis announced tonight that an early general elections will be
held on Sunday, September 22.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after a two-hour cabinet meeting, in
which, he said, the decision to go to the polls early was adopted
unanimously.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reasons for seeking renewal of the mandate

consolidating national interests and the country's defense
capability and the need to pursue further the modernization of the
economy.
</P>

The current Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government
came to power in October 1993 and its four-year term is due to
expire in October 1997.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt Not to Remove Its Scud Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Egypt would not remove its Scud missiles unless
all other countries in the Middle East do the same.
</P>
<P>
In an open dialogue with university students in Egypt's port
city of Alexandria, Mubarak said that Egypt's possession of these
missiles does not violate any international treaty.
</P>
<P>
Israel possesses missiles with a far longer range, he argued.
</P>
<P>
He criticized what he called an anti-Egyptian foreign media
campaign that demands Egyptian removal of its missiles.
</P>
<P>
The president once again called for freeing the Middle East
from all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries, particularly Egypt, have urged Israel to join
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Jewish state is
widely believed to be the only country in the Middle East that
possesses nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Moscow, Chechnya Agree on Truce from Friday Noon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22(Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed and Chechen rebel military chief Aslan Maskhdov today signed
an agreement on ceasefire taking effect from midday on Friday,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, all combat actions shall be immediately
terminated, and the warring sides start the immediate exchange of
prisoners and bodies of those killed in action according to the
principle "all-for-all," Lebed told reporters after his meeting
with Maskahdov.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed at 19:05 Moscow time (GMT 15:05), also
envisages the pullout of troops and joint control over certain
districts of Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also specified that the sides shall complete all
necessary measures to withdraw troops from the Shatoi region by
August 29, from Vedeno and Nozhai-Yurt region by August 26.
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached as a result of the second round of
Lebed-Maskhadov talks which lasted for eight hours. Lebed,
secretary of the Russian Security Council and President Boris
Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya, held his first round of
talks, during his current Chechen trip, on Wednesday night soon
after his arrival in Grozny from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources close to Lebed, the only
problem of the talks was that the Chechen rebels insisted on a
comprehensive solution, while Lebed came out for a phased
settlement of the Chechen crisis, which means that, first and
foremost, Chechen rebels should withdraw from Grozny.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, up to 10,000 Chechen
rebels are fighting in Grozny, making it clear that Russian troops
in the city totaled about the same number.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000-5,000 Chechen rebels penetrated into the Chechen
capital during the latest onslaught on the city on August 6,
Interfax said, adding that about the same number of local
civilians joined them.
</P>
<P>
The presidential press service stated tonight that President
Yeltsin "is not quite satisfied with the work Lebed is doing in
Chechnya," but hopes his trip will be a success.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Defends Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said here
today that the cabinet was mandated to represent the aspirations
and hopes of the Jordanian people and carry out administrative
reform at public institutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lower House of the Parliament, Hussein said
that under the policy statement of the government, the cabinet of
Abdul Karim Kabariti pledged to fight corruption in all its forms,
and it insisted on confronting problems and shouldering
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Jordan has experienced many challenges and faced
dangers but was able to overcome them and make great achievements
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The monarch told the lawmakers that he was in favor of
re-examining the situation in the aftermath of the so-called
"bread riots" which erupted in the southern Jordanian city of
Karak last week when the government doubled the prices of bread in
a bid to restructure the relatively weak economy.
</P>
<P>
The king pointed out that "outside parties" were involved
directly in recent riots which aimed to protest the government's
recent decision to lift subsidy on bread and increase its price.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein called on all Jordanians to shoulder their
responsibilities irrespective of their positions in a framework of
"true national unity."
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that anyone who attempts to harm the sacred
national unity is an enemy to every Jordanian and the state.
</P>
<P>
The king said the event which took place in southern part of
the country is part of an attempt to abuse the image of security
and stability in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said Jordan will firmly face any party trying to
harm the country as there are still some groups attempting to
instigate riots and demonstrations aiming at endangering stability
and security in the country.
</P>
<P>
Two leftist parties in Jordan were accused by the government of
fomenting riots in the kingdom, but no details on them were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The situation throughout Jordan has been calm during the past
two days and reports here said the curfew on Karak imposed last
Saturday is expected to be lifted Friday after the noon prayer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Welfare Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday signed a historic overhaul of America's welfare system,
saying the legislation will "recreate the nation's social bargain
with the poor" by compelling welfare recipients to go to work.
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony, Clinton signed into law a new
state-run network of aid, ending 60 years of guaranteed federal
cash assistance to the poor.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, our nation's answer to this great social
challenge will no longer be a never-ending cycle of welfare,"
Clinton said. "Today, we are taking a historic chance to make
welfare what it was meant to be: a second chance, not a way of
life."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who promised in his 1992 campaign to "end welfare as
we know it," promised to create the jobs needed for the
controversial new system to succeed. He also pledged to work on
changing some provisions criticized by key Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
Several organizations, including the Children's Defense
Fund,took part in a demonstration today protesting the action in a
park across the street from the White House.
</P>
<P>
But the new law is expected to appeal to a broad range of
moderate to conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised to try to work with Congress on making more
palatable changes to the law.
</P>
<P>
"The two parties can no longer attack each other over it,"
Clinton said. "This is not the end of welfare reform. It is the
beginning. And we all have to take responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is said to be considering proposals intended to ease
the burden on welfare recipients. It includes a possible tax break
for companies that hire people off welfare rolls and a series of
economic development ideas aimed at areas with large shares of
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
He also has asked the Justice Department to determine whether
he can grant a grace period for legal immigrants who will lose
benefits under the bill, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton twice vetoed earlier Republican welfare proposals,
denouncing them as "extremist" plans that would hurt children.
</P>
<P>
He agreed to sign this third version, even though he said it
contained provisions he opposed, including deep cuts in child
nutrition programs and tough restrictions on granting welfare to
legal aliens and their families.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised to work to repeal these provisions if he wins
a second term.
</P>
<P>
The new law ends the open-ended guarantee of aid to the poor,
saving an estimated 54 billion dollars over six years.
</P>
<P>
It sets a lifetime limit of five years of welfare for each
family. It requires all able-bodied adults to work after two years
of welfare checks, but has a hardship escape hatch for up to 20
percent of recipients.
</P>
<P>
Under its terms, the states would take over management
responsibilities, receiving federal block grants to run welfare
programs as well as authority to set most of the rules.

<HEADLINE> New Peace Deal Reportedly Signed for Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian national security chief
Alexander Lebed reportedly signed an agreement today with Chechen
rebel military leader Aslan Maskhadov to bring peace to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reached in the Chechen capital at 19:05 local
time (1505 GMT), called for a ceasefire to take effect across the
breakaway republic from 12:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) Friday.
</P>
<P>
It would ban all military actions by the federal troops as well
as rebel forces, and the two sides would jointly punish any
violations, ITAR-TASS and Interfax news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
The new deal was reached hours after a deadline, set two days
ago by a Russian military commander in the area, for launching a
massive offensive against Chechen rebels, expired.
</P>
<P>
In the latest battle with the rebel forces, which continued
after the truce was agreed on, at least 50 Russian soldiers were
killed, according to an Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
Following the ceasefire, sources in Grozny were quoted as
saying, joint control of the city by Russian units and Chechen
rebels would begin at 3:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Within days, Russian troops would start pulling out from their
forward positions in mountainous regions around Grozny and
reposition further away from the city, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In a television speech aired shortly after the news of a peace
deal reached here, President Boris Yeltsin expressed his support
to Lebed's efforts to end the escalated fightings in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin's point man on Chechnya, Lebed arrived at Grozny on
Wednesday to carry out urgent measures to restore calm there.
</P>
<P>
The new fightings in the war-torn city, which have led to heavy
casualties on both side, began when rebels attacked Russian troops
on August 6 and seized most parts of the regional capital.

KUWAIT CITY, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi National Company
for Marine Transportation is to receive the world largest and
most modern oil tanker, a statement issued by the company said
today.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said Abdullah Al-Shreim, the company's
Director General, disclosed that the tanker which was manufactured
by the Japan-based Mitsubishi Company would be the third under a
deal to buy five giant tankers from it.
</P>
<P>
He said the company would name the tanker "Watban" Friday in
the Japanese city of Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the oil tanker is 340 meters long,
52 meters wide and 31.8 meters deep, and can speed up to 15
nautical miles per hour and can carry up to 2.1 million barrels of

<P>
The tanker can sail from the Gulf to the United States directly
without the need of refueling. It can be loaded in 18 hours and
unloaded in 24, Shreim said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi company, the state-owned oil marine transportation
body in the oil-rich kingdom, will receive the fourth tanker in
October and the fifth in mid-January next year, the reports said.

SARAJEVO, August 22 (Xinhua) - The International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) will formally open an
office in Belgrade tomorrow, a senior tribunal official said on

ICTY deputy prosecutor Graham Blewitt told reporters here that

Belgrade has long accused the tribunal of being biased against

far, and refused the court to set up office in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Blewitt said that the tribunal's proceeding had been slow
partly because it could not get from FRY testimony by some key
witnesses and victims of war crimes in Bosnia.

The Belgrade office "will allow us for the first time to have
access to victims and witnesses that we have not had access to

<HEADLINE> USAir Applies for Flying Routes to London Heathrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- USAir Inc., seeking to
blunt the competitive impact of a proposed alliance between
American Airlines and British Airways, has formally applied for
the rights to fly to London's popular Heathrow Airport from four
U.S. cities, USAir Chairman Stephen Wolf said today.
</P>
<P>
Wolf told reporters that the four U.S. cities are Boston,
Cherlotte, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
"These routes will ensure the level of competition that
consumers need," said the chairman of the Arlington, Va.,-based
U.S. airline.
</P>
<P>
To make room at Heathrow, USAir suggested that the U.S.
government take away some of the access rights held by American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The application came after British Airways decided in July to
enter a broad marketing alliance with American Airlines that would
effectively combine the operations of the two airlines, sharing
passengers, coordinating fares, schedules and ticketing, and
pooling profits on some routes.
</P>
<P>
USAir said that the alliance would give American Airlines and
British Airways joint control over 60 percent of the available
seats between the United States and London.
</P>
<P>
Wolf said that USAir, 24.6 percent of which is owned by British
Airways, is the only airline that can redress the potential
imbalance in competition that would occur if the British
Airways-American Airlines deal is permitted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, USAir serves Frankfurt, Madrid, Munich, Paris and
Rome from Philadelphia, and Frankfurt from Pittsburgh and Boston.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Stagnation of Peace Process May Abort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
warned today that the current stagnation of the Middle East peace
process may abort a regional economic summit scheduled to be held
in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
He said that many countries will not participate in the
economic conference for the Middle East and North Africa if no
progress is made in Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In an open dialogue with university students in the port city
of Alexandria, Mubarak called on Israel to move forward in peace
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"How can the economic conference be held in November?" he
asked. "If this situation continues, it will affect the conference
and the countries of the region will not attend it."
</P>
<P>
The president criticized Israel's decision to expand Jewish
settlements and build new bypass roads in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that there would be drastic consequences if no
progress was achieved in the peace march and the signed agreements
were not implemented.
</P>
<P>
He criticized what he called Israel's pursuance of the theory
"security first and peace second," saying that it is a theory that
can never be put into practice.
</P>
<P>
The theory would only give an opportunity to enemies of peace
to undermine the peace march, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president also warned of the danger of any more delays in
Israel's redeployment of its troops in Hebron, the last West Bank
town still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have carried out the redeployment in March under
the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish state has delayed the redeployment following a
series of suicide bombing attacks made by Palestinian extremists
in Israel in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he supported Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad's stand that the Syrian and Lebanese peace tracks are
inseparable.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can ever question the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Lebanon, but the fact remains that Syrian
and Lebanese interests are too entangled and interwoven to make
Syria accept Israel's 'Lebanon first' proposal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu earlier this month, Israel will first pull out its
troops from the Israeli self-styled "security zone" in south
Lebanon in exchange for ensuring security on Israel's northern
border with Lebanon. Both Syria and Lebanon have rejected the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israel still occupies the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau it
seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> US Anti-Terrorism Rules Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- From today on, Americans will
be prohibited from receiving or giving money to such countries as
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, which the United States regards as threatening
its security.
</P>
<P>
The rules, stemming from a U.S. anti-terrorism law passed in
April, are designed to block money, raised by U.S. and foreign
organizations, from being able to flow to the above-mentioned
countries, which are in the U.S. blacklist as hostile states.
</P>
<P>
The rules "prohibit United States persons from receiving
unlicensed donations and from engaging in financial transactions
with respect to which the United States person knows or has
reasonable cause to believe that the financial transaction poses a
risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States."
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies are concerned that the anti-terrorism law might
affect their businesses in Syria and Sudan. But U.S. officials
said the rules do not target legitimate business deals in Syria
and Sudan, in so far as the money in their deals is not to be
funneled toward extremist organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, a Treasury Department spokesman said that even
companies that are sure their transactions are legal should be
aware that "they could be asked for supporting documentation at a
later date" to prove they had no reason to believe their money
would be diverted.
</P>
<P>
Organizations breaking the law would be subject to criminal
penalties.

<HEADLINE> US Army Begins Incinerating Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army today began
burning a deadly stash of chemical bombs, rockets and land mines
in the nation's first chemical weapons incinerator at Tooele Army
Depot, Utah, an Army spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The first munition, an M-55 rocket containing the nerve agent
GB, was incinerated this morning ahead of schedule at the
incinerator, built to destroy a 14,000-ton stockpile of Cold War
weapons over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
The Army said that it had planned to fire up the incinerator at
the Tooele disposal plant at 9 a.m. local time today, the same
time a state environmental panel was scheduled to consider a
last-minute appeal from opponents who fear the plant is unsafe and
will spew out toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
However, the first shell was burned ahead of schedule,
apparently for fear of environmentalists protests.
</P>
<P>
"Everything ran smoothly. No problems," said Craig Campbell,
community outreach coordinator at Tooele.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said all that remained of the rocket was molten
aluminum and ash.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the former Soviet Union pledged to
destroy their chemical arsenals in the late 1980s. They decided
that incineration, where furnaces burn off chemical and nerve
gases, was the safest and most efficient method of disposal.

<HEADLINE> Paris Wins Support From Supreme Jurisdiction on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The French government has won the
support of France's supreme administrative jurisdiction, the
Council of State, on its current immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
In a radio-television announcement made this evening soon after
receiving a message from the Council of State, Prime Minister
Alain Juppe said the 300 paperless African immigrants occuyping
the Saint-Bernard Church do not have the right to stay in France.
</P>
<P>
But he said the government will study the situation of some
individuals in accordance with humanitarian standard.
</P>
<P>
As for those who cannot have their residential status
regularized, "the order of reconducting them to the frontier
should be applied and will be applied," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Frenchmen and Frenchwomen to take up their
responsibility for the maintenance of national solidarity and
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
"The Council of State says that there does not exist the right
to regularization while one is in an irregular situation. The
Council of State says in full that, in all the situations that
have been submitted to it, the people concerned do not possess the
right to stay in France," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the supreme jurisdiction also suggests that the
government make some exceptional decision on some individuals to
give them the right to stay, for example, the gravely sick and
pregnant, or those having the rest of his or her family in France.
</P>
<P>
"On all points, the Council of State confirms exactly the
orientations given by the government in the past several weeks. It
will be contrary to the law to proceed regularization in a group
of this or that category of the paperless," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
He said he has asked Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre to
focus on the examination of the possibility of granting
residential papers to some individuals among the 300 paperless.
</P>
<P>
"Never has it come to our mind to expel someone who is gravely
sick. Never has it come to our mind to separate a mother from her
children and to split a couple," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that since things have been stated very clearly, there
is no point for the paperless to continue occupying the
Saint-Bernard Church.
</P>
<P>
"There are in France many foreigners in regular situation, and
they don't approve the manipulation by politicians or the
exploitation by the media of the issue of the paperless," stressed
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign countries from where the paperless came are
silent because the action of the paperless harms the image of
their countries and places themselves in an indecent situation as
human beings.
</P>
<P>
Juppe warned that the crisis of the paperless could arouse "the
demon of racism and xenophobia which are agitated here or there by
this or that."

<HEADLINE> 2 Black Churches Burn on Same Night in Arkansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Two predominantly black
churches two miles apart in eastern Arkansas burned to the ground,
and federal authorities are making an investigation.
</P>
<P>
"They appeared to be wood-frame, small churches. They were
pretty isolated. They literally burned to the ground," The
Associated Press quoted Bill Buford, an agent for the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Little Rock, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fires in the rural community of Turner was not
known.
</P>
<P>
St. Matthew's Missionary Baptist Church and the Mount Zion
Missionary Baptist Church burned sometime before 2 a.m. Wednesday,
Buford said.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 70 suspicious fires at church
properties belonging to predominantly black congregations in
Southern states since 1995. An equal number of fires have been
ported at white churches in the region.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today appealed to member states of the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) to find a new formula with which to
save the test-ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unfortunate development that the treaty was blocked
at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva a few days ago," said
Deputy U.N. Spokesman Ahmad Fawzi when asked to comment on the
various options for moving the text of the treaty to the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the international community, the Secretariat and the
secretary-general hope the international community to come up with
some formula to save the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to comment on the various options for moving
the text of the test-ban treaty to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It would inappropriate for the secretary-general to comment on
any movement that a member state or a group of states would be
making to bring the text of the treaty to the attention of the
General Assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However I can repeat that the secretary-general is
consistently concerned over proliferation of arms, both nuclear
and conventional arms and has spoken on numerous occasions on the
necessity for disarmament, both for macro and micro disarmament,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Building of Pudong Airport to Begin Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Work on the construction of
Shanghai Pudong International Airport, will start next month. It
will be the second international airport in Shanghai, the largest
city in China.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, 30 kilometers from downtown Shanghai and 40 km
away from Hongqiao International Airport, will be located in
Pudong New Area, according to a news conference held today by the
municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The airport will be the largest traffic project in China in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), and also the largest of
its kind for the municipality this century.
</P>
<P>
Local experts forecast a sharp rise in the volume of air
passengers in the coming five to 10 years. During the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-95), the passenger volume increased by
23 percent annually. This year, the total volume is expected to
reach 13 million and by 2000, the figure is expected to exceed 20
million.
</P>
<P>
The existing Hongqiao Airport will not be able to accommodate
the rapidly growing number of passengers, even though its capacity
has been increased to 9.6 million after several extensions and
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will include a 4,000 meter
runway, a 150,000 square meter main building and 50,000 square
meters of shopping facilities. The phase is scheduled to be
completed by 1999 at a cost of 12 billion yuan. By then, the
airport will be able to accommodate 20 million passengers and
750,000 tons of air cargo.
</P>
<P>
The whole project, to include more phases in future depending
on the changing situation, is expected to be completed in 15-20
years. The plan is for up to four runways capable of taking jumbo
jets, such as Boeing 747-400, and will be able to accommodate 70
million passengers and five million tons of air cargo.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the design plans for the huge
airport has passed official approval recently.
</P>
<P>
The designer, a consortium formed by East China Architectural
Design and Research Institute and Aeroports de Paris of France,
jointly won international bidding for the airport design after
contesting with many other companies, including over 30 from
abroad.

BELGRADE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Croatia signed
an agreement Friday on setting up diplomatic relations, ending the
days of being two war rivals for five years.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and his Yugoslav

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Accord Goes into Effect in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The cease-fire accord, reached by
Russian security chief Alexander Lebed ad Chechen rebel commander
Aslan Askhadov, went into effect at noon today, Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord is documented in the agreement on urgent measures to
end fighting in Chechen capital of Grozny and in the rest of
Chechnya, which was signed by Lebed and Maskahdov near Grozny on
Thursday evening after eight hours of talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, all military actions will stop on
Chechen territory from midday August 23, and all special
operations or terrorist acts are banned.
</P>
<P>
Commands of both Russian troops and Chechen rebels said that
combat operations had practically stopped earlier this morning,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Itar-Tass news agency said that the situation in
Grozny remained extremely troublesome at 12:00 local time, when
the Thursday ceasefire accord between Russian troops and Chechen
rebels took effect.
</P>
<P>
During a day of frantic talks in the war-torn region, Lebed
told a news conference he had canceled an ultimatum issued Monday,
under which Russian troops threatened to retake the Chechen
capital city by storm starting today.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, secretary of the Russian Security Council and President
Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya, also said he hoped to
sign a political deal with Chechen rebels soon which would sort
out the root of the conflict -- the local republic's future status.
</P>
<P>
"I will come back with a draft political agreement in two
days. We will discuss it and sign it," Lebed declared.
</P>
<P>
Lebed met with Yeltsin earlier today over the Chechen
settlement, a well-informed source in the government said, without
giving details.

<P>
PARIS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its wish
that the international economic conference on the Middle East will
be held as scheduled in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Thursday threatened to cancel
the meeting, scheduled to be held in November, if Israel failed to
honor its commitments for the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that France
understands the concern of President Mubarak over the peace
process, but he said that such a conference "is inscribed in the
logic of peace created by the Madrid Conference" in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"It goes without saying that if this logic is jeopardized, its
economic portion will be also threatened," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that France plans to fully participate in
this conference.

development.

DAMASCUS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara held talks this afternoon with his Japanese counterpart
Yukihiko Ikeda on the future of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According a Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman, the talks dealt
with the latest developments in the Middle East, the prospects of
reactivating the peace process and ways of enhancing bilateral
relations between Japan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foreign minister, who arrived here this morning,
asserted the need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the
region on the basis of relevant Security Council resolutions and
the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Syrian foreign minister praised Japan's
constructive role in the peace process.

<P>
He also expressed Syria's appreciation of the development of
bilateral relations and stressed the importance of promoting these
ties in all fields.
</P>
<P>
In his arrival statement, Ikeda said that "Japan is sparing no
effort to push forward the peace process both politically and
economically."
</P>
<P>
"We have come here to promote efforts for activating the peace
process, to support Syria's stance in this process and to promote
bilateral relations in the economic, cultural and political
fields," Ikeda said.

He flew here from Cairo, where he paid a three-day visit to
Egypt. His Middle East tour will also take him to Israel, Jordan

to China, at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, gave
a briefing to the King on social and economic development, as well
as the development goals of the region in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tibet and Nepal can increase cooperation in the
fields of trade, tourism, communications and sports. Since the air
route between Lhasa and Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, opened, and
an agreement on communications cooperation between the two cities
was signed, the ties between Tibet and Nepal have been expanded on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman appreciated Nepal's consistent stand of
recognizing that Tibet is an inalienable part of China, and the
issue of Tibet is an internal affair for China.

Birendra said that his country will not become a tool for
others to split Tibet, adding that the Nepalese government has
maintained a sharp vigilance against such intentions.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The 1996 Beijing International
Healthy City Conference, sponsored by the Beijing Municipal
Bureau of Public Health, will be held from October 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference, "everybody should take care of
himself and others", introduces a new health idea - having a
healthy feeling for oneself, people around, and the city, said
Zhou Kaifa, director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
To create healthy cities on a primary stage is the them of the
World Health Day this year.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 30 countries and regions will
attend the conference in the Chinese capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that to raise people's interest in health problems, a
publicity campaign will be held during the three days before the
october conference. Nearly one thousand health care workers and
teachers will take part in the activity.
</P>
<P>
During the period, lectures will be given to spread knowledge
about heart and cerebrovascular diseases, cancer.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the three diseases have become the biggest
killers of Beijing residents, responsible for almost 71 percent of
the deaths in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The diseases are closely related to urban life style, which can
easily lead to psychological pressures, obesity and high
cholesterol. Helping urban residents form a healthy life style is
one of the efficient ways of guarding against the diseases, said
Feng Ailan, director of the Beijing Health Education Institute.
</P>
<P>
A health hot-line will also be opened during the publicity
campaign to answer residents' questions on health.

<HEADLINE> Birds of Prey Flocking Back in Record Numbers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Some of Britain's rarest birds of
prey, many once close to extinction, are flourishing as they have
not for more than two decades, a report published today in the
journal, British Birds, said.
</P>
<P>
Honey buzzards, marsh harriers, Montagu's harriers, red kites
and ospreys are more numerous than at any time during the past 22
years since ornithologists began collecting detailed records.
</P>
<P>
The honey buzzard, a summer visitor to Britain that feeds on
bees and wasps, numbered up to 28 breeding pairs in England and
Scotland in 1994, compared with two pairs ten years earlier.
</P>
<P>
There were 111 pairs of breeding red kites in Wales, up from 33
in 1984, and 28 pairs in England and Scotland, where they were
reintroduced in 1989 after becoming extinct.
</P>
<P>
Of the 111 red kite pairs in Wales, 70 bred successfully and
reared 90 young, both record totals, the Rare Breeding Birds Panel
said in its annual report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Police Expel Paperless African Immigrants From Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 policemen stormed the
Saint-Bernard Church this morning and expelled all the 300
paperless African immigrants from the church.
</P>
<P>
The operation began at 08:30 a.m. local time when police forced
their way into the church by using tear gas to disperse about 200
sympathizers picketing outside the church. Two men were slightly
injured and one of them was brought to an ambulance by firemen.
</P>
<P>
Some Africans within the church violently resisted police by
throwing chairs at the law enforcers. Police handcuffed some of
the immigrants to put them under control.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and ten Africans, including 89 men, 53 women and 68
children were transported to an administrative detention center in
Vincennes outside Paris, said police.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikers were taken away one by one on stretchers.
By 10:00 a.m. local time, the police have completely cleared the
church of its occupiers.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party First Secretary Lionel Jospin and Communist
Party national secretary Robert Hue immediately condemned the
expulsion, while some left-wing unions have called for a
demonstration to protest.
</P>
<P>
The operation came after the supreme administrative
jurisdiction of France, the Council of State, has expressed its
support to the present immigrant policy of the government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that most of the
paperless immigrants in Saint-Bernarch Church do not have the
right to stay in France, but the government will regularize some
individuals in accordance with humanitarian standard.
</P>
<P>
The paperless immigrants began to occupy the Saint-Bernard
Church about two months ago.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Cooperation with UNICEF on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said today in Beijing that the Chinese government will spare no
effort to ensure all Chinese children of school age enjoy the
right to nine-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach the goal, the government will make the
nine-year compulsory education universal within five years, wiping
out illiteracy in the young generation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing Keshab B. Mathema, representative to China
of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) during a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his satisfaction with the successful cooperation
between China and UNICEF on a project to promote primary education
in China's poverty-stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF will invest 10 million US dollars in the project, which
will be carried out in 100 poor counties in southwest and
northwest China between now and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Li said that education for children is a crucial problem, since
children are the future's competent personnel. Whether China can
maintain prosperity and development in the future depends on the
quality of its workers and the training of talented people.
</P>
<P>
Mathema said that UNICEF will continue its cooperation with
China's State Education Commission to improve the quality of
China's primary education and spread compulsory education by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Later on, Li also met members attending a training course for
principals in rural areas of poor regions. The course is part of
the China-UNICEF project.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in order to solve education problems in
poor regions, officials at various levels should pay attention to
implementing the strategy of invigorating the country through
science and education.
</P>
<P>
The crux of educational needs in rural areas is to have good
principals and teachers, as well as necessary equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the education in rural areas should cater to the
needs of local economic and social development.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Law on Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- In a move to curb the current
disorder in the construction market, China plans to pass a law
that will promote the healthy development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law on construction, the first of the sort in the
country, was submitted today to a meeting of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The draft law is also designed to improve the quality of
construction projects, to reduce accidents in construction, and to
protect the legal rights and interests of both builders and users.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of China's openness and reform, the
country's construction scale in cities and rural areas has
expanded, and the construction sector has become one of the pillar
industries, said Minister of Construction Hou Jie, who was
explaining the law at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the country's investment in fixed
assets is estimated to reach 6,160 billion yuan, and the
investment in construction is about 3,820 billion yuan, accounting
for 62 percent of the total, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the lack of legal regulations and rules needed
to form a new market, there have been cases in which construction
activities do not conform with the standards and contractors do
not act in accordance with set procedures, the minister pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The disorder of the construction market often leads to
embezzlement and bribery, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, construction accidents occur frequently, and the
death toll in the field is no less than that of mining, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft law, all construction projects must be
registered and licensed, and organizations and individuals who are
engaged in construction must meet certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
The draft also includes principles for contracting and
sub-contracting, for supervision of the quality of projects and
for work safety.

<HEADLINE> 25,000 People Flee Chechnya in Last Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that about 25,000
Chechen people have arrived in neighboring republics of Ingushetia
and Daghestan from Grozny over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Of the arrivals, about 20,000 were in Ingushetia and an
estimated 5,000 in Daghestan. They obviously suffered from the
trauma of recent fighting between the Russian government troops
and the Chechen rebels, according to the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
The movement was however believed to be temporary, even though
more refugees are expected to come, a UNHCR spokeswoman told a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
She quoted those people, mostly the elderly, women and
children, as saying that they fled to take children to safety and
were prepared to go back quickly.
</P>
<P>
Adult men were said to stay home probably to protect their
houses from being looted.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, over 5,000 people arrived in Ingushetia, much more
than those in the past week, while about 1,500 in Daghestan,
compared to around 300 arrivals per day previously.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR spokeswoman said that increased arrivals have brought
to about 110,000 the number of displaced people in the two
republics.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is working to replenish its stocks in the Northern
Caucasus in order to meet the needs of expected new arrivals in
the two republics.
</P>
<P>
About 45 tons of supplies were airlifted to the region this
morning, including blankets, plastic sheeting for shelter, kitchen
equipment and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has also had trucks carrying more essential emergency
supplies on the way to the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.N. humanitarian agency is distributing food
parcels among Chechen refugees in Ingushetia. It recently
received the food parcels from Saudi Arabia which contained 300
tons of flour, sugar, tea, oil, rice or milk powder, enough for at
least 20,000 people for one month.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that its budget this year for operations in the
republics around Chechnya totalled 6.5 million U.S. dollars, of
which it has so far received 3.1 million.

<HEADLINE> No Interest Rate Rise Before Election: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's interest rates will not
rise until after the next general election as the British economic
policies deliver strong growth with low inflation, a Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) report said today.
</P>
<P>
The forecast supports Chancellor of Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's
hopes of fighting the election amid a consumer-led recovery marked
by low inflation.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor will give away only 2 billion pounds (3 billion
U.S. dollars) in tax cuts in his last fiscal package before
election, which will be more than matched by a 4.5 billion pounds
(6.75 billion dollars) reduction in public spending, CBI
economists say.
</P>
<P>
Although manufacturing firms are still suffering from weak
order books, the CBI is confident that activity will bounce back
in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
It has revised upwards its forecast for consumer spending
growth in 1997 to 4 percent, and believes that by the third
quarter of next year base rates will need to rise to keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's chief economic adviser Kate Barker said that "growing
confidence about a pick-up to above-trend (2.5 percent) growth and
accelerating consumer spending means we now expect a more cautious
budget in November."
</P>
<P>
However, even that would not be sufficient to bring down
Britain's government debt to 3 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), required under the Maastricht treaty for entry into a
single European currency, she added.
</P>
<P>
The CBI forecast follows data from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) released Thursday showing that consumer spending
was the driving force behind economic growth in the spring,
offsetting heavy de-stocking by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Giving a breakdown of the 0.4 percent second-quarter growth,
ONS officials said the erosion of factory stockpiles had knocked
0.7 percentage points off the three-monthly growth rate.
</P>
<P>
But Treasury officials insisted the reduction of the large
stock overhang -- which fell to 446 million pounds (669 million
dollars) between April and June, against l.52 billion pounds (2.28
billion dollars) in the preceding quarter -- presaged stronger
growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today that the voluntary
repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Burundi was continuing with
some 6,000 people being transported back to Rwanda on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They included some 600 out of a total of 11,000 Rwandan
refugees in the camp Ruku in northern Burundi, and UNHCR expected
another 600 people to leave this camp today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics earlier released by UNHCR showed that there were
about 90,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi as of last May.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Friday also welcomed a bilateral agreement on refugee
issues reached between Prime Ministers of Zaire and Rwanda on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Any kind of move that will help end the refugee crisis in
central Africa is welcome, said a UNHCR press official at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
She said that both Zaire and Rwanda had made commitments at
many meetings to uphold voluntary repatriation and to create
conditions to encourage refugee return.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan refugees totalled one million as of last May in Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Treaty Parties to Discuss Funding Developing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials and experts from some
100 countries will start four days of talks here on Monday on
phasing out ozone-depleting substances.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the talks, to be attended by parties to the 1987
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,
includes the replenishment of funding developing countries to
implement the control measures agreed upon in the protocol.
</P>
<P>
"Emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are declining as a
result of the Montreal Protocol," said Elizabeth Dowdeswell,
executive director of the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP), which hosts the Protocol's secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"However, our success to date could be reversed unless
developing countries too adopt and develop ozone-friendly
technologies," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNEP estimates, developing countries will need
436.5 million U.S. dollars to implement control measures agreed
upon in the protocol for the period from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another 40-60 million dollars will be needed to
continue the momentum of those developing countries that are well
ahead of schedule in implementing these measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, the fund should be paid for by developed
nations to help developing nations with technical assistance and
transfer of technology to switch over to more "ozone friendly"
replacement compounds.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNEP, the four-day Geneva meeting will also
recommend decisions on control of trade in methyl bromide, illegal
trade in controlled substances, and other implementation issues.

<HEADLINE> Party Chief Calls For Being Stricter on Army Recruitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top leader Jiang Zemin
today urged the army to be strict and careful when recruiting new
soldiers to guarantee their political reliability.
</P>
<P>
The army is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary,
political tasks and a strong pillar-stone of the people's
democratic dictatorship, said the Communist Party of China (CPC)
General Secretary and Chairman of Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the army must be a people's army absolutely
under the party's leadership and serving the people
whole-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also Chinese President, made the remarks while
meeting delegates attending the National Work Conference on Army
Recruitment. Also present were Premier Li Peng, Central Military
Commission Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen and Chi Haotian,
State Councillor Luo Gan, and Central Military Commission members
Fu Quanyou and Yu Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang urged all localities to fully understand
the importance of conducting army recruitment under the new
situation, and to send their excellent youngsters to the army, in
view of the long-term construction of national defence and the
army, and the country's long-term stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Ceaselessly adding new blood to the army by wide-range
mobilizing and recruitment of excellent young people has been a
major factor in the persistent development and strengthening of
the army, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He praised the massive number of youngsters who have actively
applied to join the army.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged local party committees, governments and recruitment
departments to regard army recruitment as a joint political task,
with leading officials taking charge of the issue personally.
</P>
<P>
All people should be made aware of the importance of army
recruitment through education and publicity by local governments
and relevant departments, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Commodity Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's import and export
commodity inspection organizations have inspected commodities
worth 524 billion US dollars in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Administration for the Inspection of
Import and Export Commodities show that the organizations
inspected 12.44 million consignments of import and export
commodities. Of the total, 137,000 import and 247,000 export
batches were proved to be unqualified.
</P>
<P>
Compensation for substandard imported commodities for
Chinese companies totalled 100 million US dollars each year
thanks to help from the inspection organizations.
</P>
<P>
To promote the quality of the commodities, the administration has
issued import and export quality certificates for companies and
commodities that meet requirements.
</P>
<P>
The organizations have issued more than 20,000 certificates for
export companies, covering commodities such as machinery and
electronics, clothing, and cotton.
</P>
<P>
They also received 2,000 applications from foreign export
companies covering 43 varieties of commodities.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the inspection organizations evaluated
foreign-invested machines and equipment of 16,600 batches. The
evaluation showed that foreign-invested machines and equipment
with quoted prices of 7.1 billion US dollars were really worth
only six billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The inspection organizations also promoted the international
quality standard ISO9000 in companies in China, and the check on
packages of dangerous commodities to ensure the security of
transport.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Indonesia Has No Problem If U.S. Cancels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will have no problem
if the United States cancels the planned sale of F-16 fighters to
Jakarta, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said here today.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning, President Soeharto has not given top
priority to the purchase of the jet fighters because our main
priority is developing the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that the U.S.
government has not made the final decision on the proposed sale of
the jet fighters to Jakarta amid serious concern over what it
calls human rights problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said it was the U.S. government that offered the sale
of jet fighters to the Indonesian Air Forces.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that President Bill Clinton made the offer to
Indonesia when President Soeharto visited the U.S. in November
1995.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto told Clinton at the meeting that Indonesia would
consider buying the jet fighters only if Washington provided
Jakarta with export credits, said Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, the U.S. agreed to sell nine F-16s to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said Indonesia would apply its own way of settling
its internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government's Budget Surplus Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines registered a
budget surplus of five billion pesos (190 million U.S. dollars) in
the first seven months of this year, according to a report
released today by the Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The seven-month surplus is lower than the 5.9 billion pesos
(226 million dollars) the country posted during the same period of
last year, although it exceeded the projected surplus of three
billion pesos (114 million), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to lower non-tax revenues, which
fell by 22.3 percent compared with the corresponding period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
During the period, expenditures went up due to higher interest
payments and government subsidy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the government's total revenue collections for
the period reached 239.47 billion pesos (9.17 billion dollars), or
an 11.4 percent increase over the previous corresponding period's
actual collection of 214.9 billion pesos (8.23 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> S.African Official on Aliens Permanent Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- only a fraction of
aliens from neighbouring countries who may be eligible to stay in
South Africa have applied for permanent residence, the Department
of Home Affairs said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "The Citizen" today quoted department spokesman
Hennie Meyer as saying that about 11,600 applications of an
expected one million have so far been received by the department.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Meyer said the total number
of illegal immigrants currently living in South Africa is
estimated to be between 2 and 4 million people.
</P>
<P>
He said about one million of them qualify for permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a recent cabinet decision, citizens from Southern
African Development Community member states could qualify for
South African permanent residence if they met certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
They should be able to demonstrate evidence of continous
residence in South Africa from July 1 1991, being engaged in
productive formal or informal economic economic activity, having
dependent children born or residing lawfully in the country and
having no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi in June invited
such aliens from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to
apply for exemption.
</P>
<P>
Considering only a small number of illegal immigrants
submitted their applications so far, the department had decided
to launch an advertising campaign next week to inform people
about this opportunity which would expire at the end of
September. But applications should be made at any office of the
Department of Home Affairs before the end of next month, said
Meyer.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Import of Foreign Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said here
today that China will expand the import of foreign books in an
effort to satisfy economic construction and people's spiritual
lives.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongzhan, vice-director of the Press and Publications
Administration, said at a press conference that China will import
more foreign books by stepping up copyright authorization and
joint publication.
</P>
<P>
China's book importing hit its peak in the mid-1980s. But it
soon slowed down because of the fluctuation of the foreign
exchange rate and other factors. Now, the sale volume of foreign
books in the Chinese market is just one-third of that ten years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Books published in the United States and Europe are 30 times
more expensive than Chinese books, according to Chen Weijiang,
Chairman of the China National Publications Import and Export
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
But more Chinese people want to read books written in foreign
languages as they -- and China -- have become wealthier.
</P>
<P>
And progress in the protection of copyrights is bringing a
bright future to this business.
</P>
<P>
To woo more foreign book publishers, China will hold a grand
international book fair in Beijing from August 30 to September
4. First-time sponsors include the Information Office of the State
Council and several departments at the state level.
</P>
<P>
"This is an indication that the government is paying greater
attention to the import of foreign books," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Jin Hui, an official from the Information Office, said that the
world has been in an information age, and thus the introduction of
state-of-the-art foreign books of both natural sciences and social
sciences is vital to China's economic and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Beijing International Book Fair, one of the largest
in Asia, will attract some 4,000 publishing houses from about 30
countries and regions. More than 90,000 titles of books will be on
display, among them are 30,000 foreign books.
</P>
<P>
Many of the most famous international publishing giants will
send delegations to the exhibition, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
However, they are not allowed to display books that go against
China's policies and standards.
</P>
<P>
"China is a socialist country. We have restrictions regarding
the contents of the imported books. We have sent messages to
foreign publishers, asking them not to send to the fair books that
attack the socialist system, create chaos among nationalities or
contain pornography," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 560 publishing houses, which generated six
billion books in 100,000 titles last year, ranking first in the
world. The country imports 100,000 books every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Omani Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Yusef Ben Alawi has said a meeting of a new group
of countries overlooking the Indian Ocean is due to take place in
Mauritius on September 9, according to reports reaching here from
Muscat today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today to the Omani Press Agency in
Muscat, the minister said the two-day meeting will be attended by
senior officials representing members of the new group -- Oman,
Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya, Singapore, Australia and India --
as well as seven other states overlooking the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The new grouping will be finally decided during the meeting, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Alawi pointed out that the principal purpose of establishing
this grouping is to enhance economic and trade cooperation among
the member states. Consultations have been going on for two years,
and a final agreement has been reached on the outlines of
cooperation, and the related documents are ready for signature.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the market, encompassing the group of
member states, would be quite huge, adding that his country was
interested in the establishment of the group and a number of Omani
businessmen and scholars would take part in the Mauritius meeting
as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua/OANA) -- After an ever best Olympic
feat of eighth place in Atlanta, China's men basketball will
strike out a new league to be started on October 26, organizers
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team Chinese New Basketball Alliance will not only
take the NBA frames and rules but also have four American players
and an American coach in each team.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for China to have more than 30
American players in one basketball season and to have Amerian
coaches to guide eight teams.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural CNBA season will take the double home-and-away
system in China's four largest cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjing and Guangzhou as well as in provinces of Hebei, Jilin,
Hubei and Fujian till February 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The 32 American players will be a mixture of retired NBA
players and some young talents. They will be drafted by the eight
teams in September, one month before the league starts," said
Licoln Venanio, director of the CNBA's main sponsor of Spectrum
Group of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, only two of the four Americans will be permitted in
action at the same time during a match, which will be divided into

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Goes Tough With Foreign Oil Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of Nigeria
has frowned at the activities of major foreign oil producing and
service companies, saying that they have deprived Nigerians of getting
their fair share of the revenue from the petroleum exploration
and production.
</P>
<P>
Addressing key players in the Nigerian oil sector here on
Thursday, Petroleum Resources Minister Dan Etete accused major
oil producing companies and multi-national oil service companies
of fraudulent practices and has rolled out measures, including a
decree, to sanitize the sector.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion, spurious contracts, unfair treatment of Nigerian
workers and contractors, abuse of expatriate quota and lack of
accountability were among serious charges leveled against
multi-national oil companies by the minister.
</P>
<P>
The minister told chief executives of the companies in a
meeting here that the government has decided that no expatriate
should be engaged by any operator without approval of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Nigerian
employees should no longer be disengaged without written approval
of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided that all oil service companies
should re-apply for new operating permits and oil companies
should put in place strategies and programs to combat
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Oil industry is the country's biggest foreign exchange earner.
Over 90 percent of the Nigerian crude oil production comes
through the joint venture arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The government, through NNPC, holds 60 percent shares in the
joint ventures while the remaining 40 percent belongs singularly
or severally to the foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, top executives of the
foreign partners of the joint ventures, including Shell and
Mobil, declined immediate comment of the government decisions,
saying that they "still need to study the documents".

<HEADLINE> Direct Across-Straits Links Benefit People of Both Sides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The realization of the direct
exchange of mail service, trade, air and shipping services
represents the common desires of the people across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
A signed article published today by Xinhua says that achieving
this goal will help deepen mutual understanding, eliminate
differences and facilitate mutually beneficial development of the
economies, as well as the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article asks the Taiwan authorities to take practical
steps to realize the three direct services, in order to benefit
the people of both sides.
</P>
<P>
It says that the mainland has made unremitting efforts to this
end.
</P>
<P>
Leading members of the mainland departments concerned have
repeatedly delivered speeches that reveal their willingness to
hold consultations on direct air and sea passenger and cargo
transport across the Taiwan Straits, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts began with a message to the Taiwan compatriots
issued by the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress in 1979, and continued through the eight-point proposal
on the reunification of the motherland that was put forward by
President Jiang Zemin at the beginning of last year,
</P>
<P>
They have also suggested that the two sides discuss issues on
direct mail service at an early date.
</P>
<P>
They have not only put forward specific proposals on how to
realize direct trading, but also have taken practical measures in
this regard, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that what the mainland has done is fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The article says that gratifying results have been seen by the
mainland departments of communications, civil aviation,
tele-communications, and economic relations and trade, in the
formation of preferential policies for investment in the mainland
from Taiwan business people.
</P>
<P>
Noting increasing exchanges in sea and air transportation, as
well as in mail services, the article says that figures from the
two sides have also sponsored seminars on many occasions related
to business and technology of direct shipping and postal
service. As a result, they have reached common understanding in
many aspects.
</P>
<P>
Conditions are gradually improving for realizing the direct
links across the straits, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It says that the two regulations issued by the Ministry of
Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, one about the passenger and cargo shipping transport
and the other about the cargo transport agents across the Taiwan
Straits, reflect the principles of one-China, two-way direct
shipping and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation of these documents also represents another
important action that the mainland has taken to promote direct
shipping, which fully shows the mainland's sincerity in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
The article says that this will surely win support from the
people of both sides, and also shipping entrepreneurs of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The article urges the Taiwan authorities to fully consider
Taiwan's economic development, in accordance with people's
willingness and take practical steps to establish direct links
between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Rate Cut Won't Impact on Economy Heavily: Economists (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that it should also boost immediate consumption by
encouraging individuals to readjust the structure of their
financial assets.
</P>
<P>
"All this will be positive to economic growth," Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
However, almost all economists contacted by Xinhua denied that
the interest rate cut will have significant, substantial effects.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shucheng, another CASS economist, said that China's market
economy mechanism is far from being mature when compared with that
in the Western countries.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism is slow in responding to the interest leverage,"
Liu said, citing as an example an earlier interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Though the rate of increase in bank savings slowed down as a
result of the interest rate cut on May 1, Liu said, the consumer
market has failed to improve markedly.
</P>
<P>
The economists agree that they expect personal savings to
continue to grow steadily in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
Liu said, meanwhile, that the latest interest rate cut will not
unleash a new round of economic overheating, as it will only
slightly increase investment.
</P>
<P>
This is because the investment and credit scales in China are
to a great extent controled by administrative means and, moreover,
the central government has consistently taken inflation control
as the top task on its work agenda, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest significance of the cut may lie in conveying a
message to the public that interest rates can be readjusted
repeatedly," Liu said. "And this indicates that the government is
ready to speed up the pace to make interest rates more
market-driven, so as to promote the establishment and perfection
of a market economic system."
</P>
<P>
The economists say that in the second half of this year, China's
macro economy will continue to ride on the healthy development
trend of the first half.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product will grow by about 10 percent
year-round, roughly the same as last year, and the retail price
index is likely to be around seven percent, the economists
predict.

NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering taking to the World Trade Organization (WTO) the
United States ban on wild shrimp imports, The Pioneer reported
today.
</P>
<P>
An official press release Thursday said that the Indian
government was consulting some other countries which are also

</P>

It said the government was studying "the possibility and
desirability" of setting in motion the WTO dispute settlement
process for getting the compatibility of the U.S. measure examined
with respect of the WTO obligations of the U.S.
</P>

Earlier this year, the U.S. Court of International Trade

shrimps harvested with the commercial fishing technology that may
adversely affect sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
The ban came into effect on May 1.

<HEADLINE> Australian Agriculture Production Rises in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's agricultural
production rose by 16 percent to 27.6 billion Australian dollars
(21.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995-96, according to preliminary
figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the growth mainly to a jump in crop
prices and increased production in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The most notable increases occurred in wheat and barley, where
gross values more than doubled to 4.6 billion and 1.3 billion
Australian dollars (3.58 billion and 1.01 billion U.S. dollars)
respectively," said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Other crops recording increases included oats, up 87 percent,
hay crops, up 26 percent and pastures and grasses, up 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total gross value of crops amounted to 15.6 billion
Australian dollars (12.16 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 40
percent over 1994-95, signaling a return to the production levels
of 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
However, the gross value of livestock slaughtering fell by 8.3
percent to 6.1 billion Australian dollars (4.75 billion U.S.
dollars), while the gross value of wool dropped by 19 percent to
2.7 billion Australian dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars).

BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia will further
push forward their existing, stable economic and trade ties,
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi
and visiting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer agreed
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here this morning, Wu said that the two
economies strongly complement each other, and the trade and
economic ties between the two countries have achieved much
progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Chinese Customs, trade volume
between the two countries has increased at an annual rate of 15.4
percent for four years, and bilateral trade volume hit 4.21
billion US dollars last year. The figure for the first half of
this year was 2.459 billion US dollars, 33.8 percent more than the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that the Australian government attaches much
importance to developing its trade and economy cooperation with
China, and that China has become Australia's sixth biggest trade
partner.
</P>
<P>
According to Australia's statistics, Australian investment in
China has increased six-fold in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia strongly supports China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Ready to Arrest FOREX Market Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) C. Rangarajan has said that the central bank would
not hesitate to intervene in the foreign exchange (FOREX) market
to prevent persistent volatility or misalignment in exchange rate,
The Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank would do so to preserve the broad objective of the
exchange rate policy of allowing the fundamentals to be reflected
in the external value of the rupee and ensuring a stable real
effective exchange rate, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
In the current financial year (from April 1996 to March 1997),
the rupee has so far remained stable and will remain so in the
coming months, Rangarajan said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He has also cautioned against any further drop in the current
level of the foreign exchange reserves of 17 billion U.S. dollars,
as a large amount of external debt servicing was due in the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The current reserves of 17 billion U.S. dollars would provide
import cover for only four months, he noted.

DAMASCUS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda arrived here this morning on a two-day working
visit to Syria, the second leg of his current five-nation Mideast
tour.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al Sharaa at
Damascus airport, where he said that his country was trying its
best "on the political and economic levels" to promote Mideast
peace.
</P>
<P>
"We stress the significance of the peace process and we
strongly desire to help push it forward," Ikeda said upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Syrian official sources here said that the Japanese Foreign
Minister will meet with top Syrian leaders on the Mideast
peace process and business opportunities. Ikeda will also visit the
Japanese unit in the UN disengagement force.
</P>
<P>
Syrian political analysts believe that Ikeda's Middle East tour
aims at boosting Japan's political and economic involvements in
the Middle East, where the peace process faces new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that the peace process might suffer setbacks
after the right-wing Likud Party came to power in Israel in June.
In this case, Japan"s oil imports from the region might be
affected.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Minister had stressed during his visit to
Cairo that Japan's stance focused on the importance of adherence
and implementation of all obligations, agreements and principles
already agreed upon as pillars of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda stayed in Egypt for three days before he flew here. His
Mideast tour will also take him to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Japan heavily depends on oil imports from the Mideast
countries. This has prompted Tokyo to contribute to the peace in
the region. Some 45 Japanese soldiers have been serving with a
1000-strong U.N. disengagement Observation Force in this country
since February.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Official Meets Zambian Air Force Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, met with Lieutenant General
R. S. Shikapuwashya, commander of the Air Force of Zambia, and his
party here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and defense minister, extended a
warm welcome to Shikapuwashya, describing him as an old friend of
China.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Zambia have maintained close relations
although they are far apart geographically, and people of both
countries have consistently supported each other in their struggle
against imperialism, colonialism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
The friendship and cooperation between the two countries and
the two armed forces have stood the test of time and remained
intact amid the constant changes of the international situation,
Chi noted.
</P>
<P>
Chi described Shikapuwashya's current China visit as a major
event in relations between the two armed forces, which is sure to
promote the friendly cooperation between them and especially
between the two air forces.
</P>
<P>
"China greatly cherishes the existing friendly cooperative
relations between the two nations and the two armed forces," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed his appreciation over the Zambian government's
clear-cut support to the Chinese government on its position over
the Taiwan issue. He also briefed the guests on China's defense
policy, military construction and the important role the air force
is playing during the present battle against flooding.
</P>
<P>
Shikapuwashya said that Zambia greatly treasures its friendly
ties with China, and that their current China trip is aimed at
deepening this kind of friendship.
</P>
<P>
Zambia hopes to see a stable China, because China's stability
is helpful to the stability of the whole world, he said, adding
that this is the reason why the Zambian government upholds the
"one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Shikapuwashya also expressed his admiration for China's efforts
to safeguard world peace, and for the contributions made by the
People's Liberation Army in disaster relief work.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Seeks Probe of Filipino Maid's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today requested Jordanian authorities to conduct a full, partial
and speedy investigation into the death of Filipino maid Eliza
Salem, in Amman, Jordan last July.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Jordanian King Hussein, Ramos expressed the hope
that the facts and circumstances surrounding Salem's demise "could
be ascertained soonest."
</P>
<P>
He told the king that Salem died of unnatural causes and her
death had caused profound grief among her family and friends.
</P>
<P>
Salem's cadaver arrived home on August 1 with a death
certificate saying that she died from "hemorrhage due to
deterioration of the spleen."
</P>
<P>
But members of Salem's family do not believe the report that
she died after she fell while trying to escape from her employer's
third floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
Salem left Manila for Jordan on March 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos today directed Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon to look into the case of a 28-year-old Filipino maid who
escaped from her United Arab Emirates employers for treating her
like a slave.
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten memorandum released by the presidential
palace, Ramos instructed Siazon to extend all possible assistance
to Lourdes Mijaro, who escaped last weekend in Geneva while her
employers were vacationing there.
</P>
<P>
Mijaro is still in Switzerland under the care of the
Geneva-based Syndicat Sans Frontiers (union without borders).
Mijaro arrived at the United Arab Emirates last February as a
domestic helper to the family of Abdullah al-Farisi.
</P>
<P>
Recounting her harrowing experience at a press conference in
Geneva Monday, Mijaro said that she was made to work daily from
early morning until dawn without days off, and often abused, both
physically and verbally, by members of the family.

<HEADLINE> Rate Cut Won't Impact on Economy Heavily: Economists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Mainstream Chinese economists
today expressed their lukewarm support of the latest interest rate
cut, saying that it will not have a profound impact on the
performance of the macro economy.
</P>
<P>
The second interest rate cut this year will have limited effect
on the stimulation of investment and consumption, the economists
said, noting that it also will not trigger a short-term rebound of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, announced on
Thursday that China would cut interest rates today by an average
1.2 percentage points on lending and 1.5 percentage points on
savings.
</P>
<P>
The cut, the second in less than four months, is in response to
steadily-declining inflation levels. China's retail price index
during the January-July period was up 6.9 percent year-on-year,
against a 10 percent rate for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Fan Gang, an economist with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS), said that the latest interest cut is well-timed.
</P>
<P>
"Under the conditions of a steadily growing economy,
maintaining the interest level at one to two percentage points
higher than the price index is enough to reflect an appropriately
tight macro-economic policy," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
The recent cut has brought the interest rate down to 10.08
percent for one-year loans and 7.47 percent for savings.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State Statistics Bureau,
said that the market supply and demand situation in China has
already changed due to the implementation of a macro-economic
control policy over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
"The negative effects of a high interest rate level over the
past two years have begun to emerge," Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem is that overall immediate demand is
relatively insufficient, which might restrain future economic
growth," Qiu added.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, a cut in interest rates helps stimulate overall
demand and increase investment by reducing the burden of
interest payments of enterprises, Qiu said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Center in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Two of China's three
municipalities, Beijing and Tianjin, will join forces with
surrounding Hebei Province to build an economic center in north
China by integrating their economies.
</P>
<P>
The northern economic center will be a good match for the
dynamic economic zone in south China, which has Guangdong as its
center, and the economic center in east China headed by Shanghai,
said economist Wang Zhangnong.
</P>
<P>
Both Beijing and Tianjin are aware of the fact that neither
could serve as the engine of economic growth in north China on its
own in terms of energy and resource supply. Only by co-operating
economically can they establish economic greatness and bring about
an economic take-off in north China.
</P>
<P>
The three partners have agreed to open regional development
banks, set up a unified financial system, and build an expressway
between Beijing and Tianjin, to cut the travel time between the
two metropolises to one and half hours.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin they will build an export-oriented industry and
trade center similar to that of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai
and establish a high-tech zone along China's first expressway in
the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu region.
</P>
<P>
Expansion work on Beijing International Airport is well under
way, and when finished in 1999, will allow it to be China's
largest aviation center, handling 40 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
Airports in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou
are also undergoing technological transformation or expansion.
</P>
<P>
A number of deep-water beths and specialized docks are being
built at Tianjin's harbor, Xingang, the largest multi-purpose port
in north China.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Leaders Join Hands in Challenging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Following President Elias
Hrawi's rhetoric attack at Hezbollah's practices in southern
Lebanon, Lebanon's top leaders seemed to have joined force to curb
Moslem extremists in current parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, by blaming his opponents for splitting the country on
Thursday night, took sides with House Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and Minister of the Displaced Walid Jumblatt
in challenging the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon without the south and Western Beqaa is less than
Lebanon, and monopolizing the right of the south by one group is
against the south and against Lebanon," said the president in an
apparent reference to Hezbollah, who has managed to gain a
foothold in the Moslem-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
Raising its election slogan, Hezbollah has said that "the vote
to its party is to the resistance (against Israel) and to the
south."
</P>
<P>
Hrawi appeared Thursday night at a ceremony inaugurating a
rehabilitation center for the handicapped named after Nabih
Berri, the house speaker and leader of the pro-Syrian Amal
movement.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources see the president's presence at the
ceremony as implicit official support for Berri, who is seeking
re-election.
</P>
<P>
A first round of election was held in the governorate of Mount
Lebanon on April 18, where pro-government candidates scored a
overwhelming victory over the oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Elections in the north, Beirut, the south and Beqaa are to be
held on the next four successive Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Berri's Amal movement has failed to reach an agreement with
Hezbollah on a joint list of candidates between the two rival
Shiite organizations in the south and Beqaa, the two
predominantly Shiite constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said on Tuesday that the next
rounds of election in the south and Beqaa will be between
"moderation and extremism," noting that Hezbollah follows an
extremist path and "we follow the path of moderation."
</P>
<P>
The billionaire prime minister has repeatedly said in the past
that he had profound political, economic and other disagreements
with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Druze leader Walid Jumblatt launched a sharp attack on
Hezbollah, his former ally, at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The south belongs to all the Lebanese. We can not today, in
the name of resistance and liberation, put at risk the security
of the south, the whole of Lebanon and domestic peace," Jumblatt
told a rally in the Druze stronghold of Chouf.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here wondered if there was a role played in
the situation by Syria, which often has the last say in Lebanon's
domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's pro-Syrian daily Ad-Diyar said Friday that an Iranian
envoy would expectedly visit the Syrian capital "in the next
hours" in order "to break the ice" in forming a coalition between
Berri and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hariri paid a prompt visit to Damascus and had a meeting with
Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam, the second meeting
between them in 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Air Defence Law Draft Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China is drawing up an Air
Defence Law to prevent the danger of air raids in future wars
and safeguard people's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the law, the first in China since 1949, was
submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress for review by the State Council and the Central Military
Commission (CMC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Both Li Peng, premier of the State Council, and Jiang Zemin,
chairman of the CMC, signed the draft copy, and Fu Quanyou, member
of the CMC and chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army gave an account of the draft to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that, since World War II and with the rapid
development of science and technology, especially the utilization
of high-tech air-raid weapons, air-raids have come to pose an
ever-increasing threat to nations' security and people's lives.
</P>
<P>
China's air defence construction started over 40 years ago and
many projects have been established, Fu said, but, "incidents
of arbitrary damage and destruction of air defence facilities have
occurred in recent years."
</P>
<P>
So, the draft was made by related departments to prevent such
incidents from happening, and by utilizing experiences both from
China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, China's air defence will focus on
"long-term preparation, key projects and the combination of
peacetime and wartime".
</P>
<P>
"Long-term preparation" means that China is scheduled to build
air defence facilities in a planned way, step by step, Fu said,
and that "key projects" indicates that the projects will be built
in order of importance.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the air defence projects are the responsibility of
both the state and society, and organizations and individuals
intending to make contributions to the building of air defence are
encouraged, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
The draft consists of nine chapters and 53 clauses, and gives
principles, standards, approval procedures, design, management,
and maintenance for the building of air defence projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier meets Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said in
Beijing today that the Chinese Government hopes to enhance
exchanges and understanding with the Australian Government, in
order to further the development of bilateral relations through
joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during a meeting with visiting Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in the Chinese capital this
morning.
</P>
<P>
As neighbors, China and Australia have made progress in
bilateral relations during the past few years, with more exchanges
between leaders of the two countries, as well as friendly
exchanges at other levels, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Australia are members of the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation, noted the premier, adding that effective
cooperation between the two countries in promoting regional
economic and trade cooperation has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the world is accelerating its development in the
direction of multi-polarization, Li pointed out that China adheres
to the independent foreign policy of peace, and is willing to
develop friendly cooperation with countries around the world --
especially its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
China adheres to its principles on issues concerning the
country's fundamental interests, such as sovereignty and
territorial integrity, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that the Australian government attaches priority to
the development of relations with Asian countries, and believes it
is highly important to promote Australian-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Government will commit itself to cooperation
with China, and will try to bring the bilateral relationship to a
new high, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Although Australia and China have different social systems,
they should respect each other and live in harmony, the foreign
minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade relations, Li said Australia
has rich resources and advanced technology, and that the Chinese
economy is undergoing steady and sustained development.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the Chinese Government's willingness to further
expand bilateral economic cooperation, while taking advantage of
their economic complementarity.
</P>
<P>
Downer expressed his appreciation for China's remarkable
economic achievement.
</P>
<P>
He attributed China's success in lowering its inflation rate,
while maintaining a sustained and steady economic development, to
the implementation of a correct economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Downer hoped that the economic and trade relations between
Australia and China will continue to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State
Council, was present at the meeting.

<P>
TIANJIN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite a drought and heavy
flooding, people in the port city of Tianjin are battling to have
a bumper harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Before June, Tianjin's rural areas suffered from severe
drought; since August, the city has been pounded with nonstop
rain. Both natural disasters have posed serious threats to autumn
crops growing in about 387,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin authorities have consulted experts for advice, and sent
large groups of officials to the countryside to provide assistance
to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
All available equipment for draining water out of farmland has
been put into use. In the heavily-flooded districts or counties of
Jixian, Baodi, Ninghe, Jinghai, Wuqing, Dagang and Hancha,
hundreds of thousands of people are draining water round the clock.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are trying numerous methods to strengthened farmland
management. They have lost no time in planting or replanting, and
are vigorously spreading fertilizer and fighting pests in an
attempt to keep losses to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 agro-technicians are working with farmers. They
will work till the end of the autumn crop season, which will last
for about 40 days.

LONDON, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
Five hundred prisoners are facing imminent release from jail
because of a legal blunder over the way in which the Prison
Service has been calculating sentences for almost 30 years. Up to
5,000 prisoners in the 138 jails in England and Wales are also
likely to have their release dates brought forward after an urgent
review by prison governors of sentence lengths.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a strong rebound in UK economic growth looked
more likely as official figures showed companies sharply cut the
rate at which they built up stocks of unsold goods in the second
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
Britain's largest rail union called off its three-month dispute
with London Underground Thursday night although rail passengers in
many areas of the country will still face chaotic journeys.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
The Government was accused Thursday of trying to introduce a
compulsory national identity card by stealth. It became
increasingly clear that the Government intends all British
citizens children as well as adults, eventually to carry one.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture secretly avoided implementing a
Brussels ruling designed to stop BSE spreading to the continent.
As a result, almost 2 million cattle were sold to Britain's
European Union partners without checks to see if they had been
born to cows infected with the disease.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Foreign Minister Arrives in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Yukihiko Ikeda arrived here this morning on a two-day working
visit to Syria, the second leg of his five-nation Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at Damascus airport by Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al Sharaa and senior Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
According to Syrian official sources, the Japanese Foreign
Minister will confer with a number of senior Syrian officials on
the Middle East peace process and bilateral relations. Ikeda will
also visit the Japanese unit in the UN disengagement force.
</P>
<P>
Syrian political analysts believe that Ikeda's Middle East tour
aims at playing a role in pushing the peace process forward
particularly under the current circumstances.
</P>
<P>
There were fears that the peace process might suffer setbacks
after the right-wing Likud Party came to power in Israel in June.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Minister had stressed during his visit to
Cairo that Japan's stance focused on the importance of adherence
and implementation of all obligations, agreements and principles
already agreed upon as pillars of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda stayed in Egypt for three days before he flew here. His
mideast tour will also take him to Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Japan heavily depends on oil imports from the Middle East
countries. In the recent years it has been seeking a greater role
in the oil-rich region regarding the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Dar Port To Increase Cargo Handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian port of Dar
es Salaam, the gateway to much of east and central Africa, plans
to increase its cargo handling capacity and navigational aid.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper, the Business Time, today quoted Samson
Luhigo, Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA) Managing Director, as
saying that a dredging project valued at 35 million U.S. Dollars
was scheduled to start next March to allow bigger cargo ships
into the port.
</P>
<P>
The port entrance is restricted to ships of 35,000 tonnes
drawing not more than nine metres (27 feet) at high tide.
</P>
<P>
Luhigo told the newspaper on Wednesday that the narrow harbour
entrance would be widened and deepened to allow in larger ships
and enable the port to operate 24 hours per day.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do night navigation which causes quite a few delays,
an average vessel costs about 14,000 U.S. Dollars in 24 hours -
so that means a loss of 12 hours with current operations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Luhigo said Belgium had agreed to pay for 65 percent of the
dredging bill and donors were being sought for the balance.
</P>
<P>
The port chief said customs clearing regulations had also been
streamlined in a drive for greater port efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"It's totally different from the past where the customs
officer was just a civil servant and didn't really care what
happens. Now they care and that's the most important thing for
us," Luhigo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, THA spokesman, Franklin Mziray said cargo handling
equipment was on order to upgrade Dar es Salaam's container
terminal.
</P>
<P>
He said, a multi-million-dollar order had been placed to buy a
35-tonne capacity ship-to-shore gantry crane and two
rubber-wheeled 35-tonne gantry cranes.
</P>
<P>
The cranes from the Dannish Company -- Kone -- can handle
containers of 6.8 metres (20 feet) and 13 metres (40 feet),
Mziray said, adding that the port recently commissioned 15 more
tractors and trailers for container handling.
</P>
<P>
The THA spokesman said the renovations were part of a program
which began in 1985 with the help of the World Bank and funding
from Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austrialia, Britain and
Norway. enditem

Carlos Menem, both agreeing to increase bilateral activities
covering all areas.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions covered areas including bilateral trade and
cooperation on international arena, Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said when briefing reporters after the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that the Malaysia-Argentine bilateral
relations are very well established and there should be growth in
air and sea transportation to facilitate closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to continue consultations on
subjects regarding the organization of the United Nations and the
restructuring of the Security Council as well as the coming World
Trade Organization meeting, the Malaysian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the two leaders emphasized the importance of the
G15 serving as a catalyst to promote South-South cooperation
because it was important for such cooperation to succeed as
countries in the South must also develop their own market.
</P>
<P>
After their talks, Mahathir and Menem witnessed the signing of
some agreements which Abdullah described as a reflection of the
greater activities that would take place following Menem's visit.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an air service agreement, a memorandum
of understanding (MOU) for cooperation on tourism and another MOU
on mutual cooperation on trade promotion.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's imports from Argentine in 1995 totaled 649.9 million
ringgit (about 259.96 million US dollars) while its exports to
Argentine in the same year amounted to 151.5 million ringgit
(about 60.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Menem arrived here yesterday for a five-day visit to Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Cull Infected Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Southern African ministers
decided yesterday to destroy about 200,000 cattle infected with
highly contagious bovine lung disease in Namibia, Botswana and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in Maseru in a regional food security
debate prior to the summit of the Southern African Development
Community tomorrow, the local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The affected region would be cleared of grazing animals for
six months. In Botswana, 250,000 head of cattle had already been
culled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier South Africa's Transvaa Agricultural Union President
Dries Bruwer said the disease posed a serious threat to the
region's beef industry.
</P>
<P>
Once diagnosed, he added, whole herds had to be destroyed to
prevent it spreading. SADC members had to inoculate their herds.
If it was not eradicated the red meat industry could suffer
massive losses, said Bruwer.
</P>
<P>
He said while it would not harm people, it posed a bigger
threat to South Africa's red meat industry than ''mad cow''
disease, which prompted the banning of British imports to South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Shandong Province's Doctors Working in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- When 58-year-old Zhaxi Zholma in
Tibet's Nyalam County, who was tending her livestock, suddenly
fainted, her family asked lamas from a nearby lamasery to chant
scriptures, but no help.
</P>
<P>
They had heard that there were three doctors from Shandong
Province in the county hospital, so they sent Zhaxi Zholma there
and her life was saved.
</P>
<P>
The team of doctors is made up by gynecologist Hou Jianqing,
surgeon Xie Tao, and neurosurgeon Li Xiaoyu, who came in March,
bringing with them X-ray and ultra-sound equipment, and a large
quantity of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Their presence has greatly increased the hospital's
strength. For minor illnesses, they manage individually, and work
together in the case of serious diseases. Recently, they operated
on the liver of a patient.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet, the vast area and the secluded lives mean that
natives find it difficult to get good medical service, but the
central government and governments of a number of provinces and
municipalities have sent more than 3,000 doctors to work in Tibet
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Tibetans refer to them as the miracle-working
doctors, but these three doctors' only wish is that they could
have an abundant supply of anesthetic and plasma.
</P>
<P>
In addition to their work at the hospital, the doctors often go
to remote villages and grasslands to help and train local medical
workers.
</P>
<P>
With their help, the local people have been increasing their
medical knowledge and got to know that water containing small
things called bacteria needs to be boiled - something that is
common knowledge elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The doctors have also tried their best to get local people to
change their bad eating habits.
</P>
<P>
The county's name, Nyalam, actually means hell in the Tibetan
language, and the doctors have come to be regarded as "angles in
white".

<HEADLINE> South Korean Lawmakers Charged With Election Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Twenty South Korean incumbent
lawmakers were today formally referred by the Central Election
Management Commission (CEMC) to the prosecution for alleged fraud
in the April National Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
The CEMC discussed the action to be taken against 3,568 people
associated with suspected election law violations involving 1,096
of the 1,309 candidates in the elections.
</P>
<P>
It decided that 109 violators will be charged, 231 others will
be subject to investigations by law enforcement authorities and
the remaining 3,228 will be given warnings or admonitions.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent lawmakers to be prosecuted include 13 from the
ruling New Korea Party (NKP) including former NKP Chairman Kim
Yoon-whan, three from the main opposition National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP), two from the conservative opposition United
Liberal Democrats (ULD), one from the minor opposition Democratic
Party (DP) as well as one independent.
</P>
<P>
Of the 20 lawmakers, nine are direct targets of investigations,
while another nine are indirectly involved through their campaign
accounting officers (who are also direct targets of
investigations) and the remaining two through their campaign
managers.
</P>
<P>
In the worst case scenario, the nine legislators directly
involved could lose their parliamentary seats and be deprived of
the right to elected office for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Those indirectly involved may also have their elections
nullified if their campaign managers or campaign accountants are
convicted of a crime severe enough.
</P>
<P>
The CEMC found that 1,096 candidates, or 79 percent of all the
candidates who ran in the April parliament elections, violated the
election law in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 420 officials from the four political
parties which took part in the election were found to have
violated the law and the CEMC has asked the prosecution to look
into 73 of the violations.
</P>
<P>
Under law, the prosecution must determine whether or not the
alleged violators will be indicted or not by the October 11 legal
deadline because the period of limitations for public action for
election violations is six months after the parliamentary election
day.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will determine whether to indict, or suspend
indictment or drop accusation after reviewing the complaints and
on the basis of their own investigation.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11 this year, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim
Young-sam won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the
299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the NKP later lured into its fold 12 opposition and
independent legislators to secure 151 seats.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Discusses Eight Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
will review eight draft laws in a 7-day meeting starting today.
</P>
<P>
Three drafts submitted for discussion two months ago, a draft
of the Law on Protecting Rights and Interests of the Elderly, one
of Amendments to the Law on Mineral Resources, and a draft of the
Law on the Coal Industry will be put up for vote by the end of
this 21st meeting of the legislature, according to an agenda.
</P>
<P>
They have been changed to provide stronger family support for
the elderly, tighter controls on the exploration and exploitation
of mineral resources, and more protection of coal resources and
the environment, the NPC Law Committee said in reports to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Five drafts, on rural enterprises, preventing and controlling
noise pollution, construction, air defenses, and revision of
election methods of NPC deputies of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) were handed to the lawmakers for the first time for
deliberation today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports given by the drafting committee, the law
on rural enterprises is intended to stimulate this particular
creation of Chinese farmers in the course of reforms and opening
up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The draft law on preventing and controlling noise pollution
concerns traffic noise and noises affecting people's daily lives,
because they pose an even greater threat than industrial noise to
people's health.
</P>
<P>
The draft construction law is essentially about the quality of
buildings and construction safety, a subject of heated public
debate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the revisions of the election method of the PLA NPC
deputies, a PLA NPC Standing Committee member said that the
revisions are aimed at improving the system for the military to
get them more involved in the democratic policy-making of the
state and management of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over
the meeting this morning.

<HEADLINE> Japan's August Rice Crop Conditions at Average Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's August rice conditions are
at average year levels, with the national average rice crop index
standing at 101 as of August 15, Kyodo News Service quoted the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The crop index for the average year is 100.
</P>
<P>
If rice crop conditions continue at current levels, Japan is
likely to see a large rice surplus for the third year running,
said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Abundant harvests in 1994 and 1995 plus rice imports have led
to bigger rice inventories.
</P>
<P>
Rice prices are therefore likely to fall further in the future,
said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, US Discuss Counter-Terrorism Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and the United States
discussed the counter-terrorism issue during a US delegation's
visit to Colombo from August 18 to 21, a press release issued by
the Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the US delegation, led by Ambassador Philip
Wilcox, Coordinator for Counter-terrorism of the US State
Department, provided an opportunity for the two countries to
discuss the common concerns about the scourge of terrorism, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the US sent a delegation to Sri
Lanka in a bid to discuss the counter-terrorism issue. Wilcox
reiterated that US supports the efforts by the Sri Lankan
government to seek a peaceful solution to the on-going conflict in
the country, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar, Wilcox said the US government sympathizes with the
current predicament Sri Lanka is facing and would do all within
its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of American soil
to perpetrate violence against the Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
Wilcox informed Kadirgamar that the United States intended to
initiate certain discussions at the 6th Committee of the United
Nations on a comprehensive treaty to counter terrorist bombings,
said the release.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar assured the ambassador that Sri Lanka would be
willing to cooperate in developing this initiative.
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, accompanied by officials from the US State Department
and US law enforcement agencies, held two sessions of discussions
with senior officials of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry and other
Sri Lankan government security and intelligence authorities.

<HEADLINE> Book on History Of Hui Ethnic Group Being Compiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Compilation of works on history
of the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227) and the Hui ethnic group
has started in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The regional academy of social sciences is responsible for the
compilation and publication of the books, which are part of the
state's key projects for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The Hui ethnic group came into being 700 years ago, but there
is no general history book on it that has been published in the
past except for a brief historical sketch.
</P>
<P>
Although China had published a number of short history books on
the study of wars and diplomatic affairs of the Western Xia
Dynasty, there is still a lack of comprehensive historical study
of the politics, economy, and culture of the period.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huaizhong, a researcher on the Hui ethnic group, says that
they plan to publish a one-million-character book to describe the
history of the formation, development, and culture of the Hui
ethnic group, and their contribution to the country's civilization.
</P>
<P>
The history of the Western Xia will include 600,000 characters,
with some parts of the book being taken from Russian historical
records about the dynasty.

ATHENS, August 23 (xinhua) -- Greece will launch its version of
open university this winter that grants equivalent degrees, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The institution will offer correspondence courses based on
British methods with degrees equivalent to those of the

</P>
<P>
Students will have to pay fees, but the government will offer
substantial grants.
</P>
<P>
Branches will be set up in provincial towns, open to all
secondary school leavers.
</P>
<P>
The open university program is designed to give a second chance
to those who are unable to study at a state university, Pandreou
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that limited places in conventional universities have
forced many young people to study abroad, a drain on the country's
foreign reserve.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Urges Israel to Meet Peace Preconditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
has urged Israel to meet preconditions of peace with its Arab
neighbors, reiterating that his country would not give up their
peace commitments, the Beirut press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony inaugurating a rehabilitation center in
south Lebanon on Thursday night, the president underlined
Lebanon's adherence to solidarity with Syria for an
implementation of U.N resolutions and the principle of land for
peace.
</P>
<P>
"We never give up this commitment," Hrawi was quoted by the
conservative daily An-Nahar as saying while opening the Nabih
Berri center for the handicapped at the south Lebanese fishing
port of Sarafand.
</P>
<P>
"Between Israel and us there is resolution 425," the president
emphasized. U.N. Security Council resolution 425 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said, "Lebanon is not a venue to arrange the domestic
affairs of others or to settle regional accounts, Lebanon is a
nation whose right is holy."
</P>
<P>
"The peace is not a game but a right, dignity and fate," he
said. "Our sovereignty is not subjected to anyone's maneuver."
</P>
<P>
He added that Lebanon and Syria would only achieve peace with
Israel when the Jewish state meets the demands for just and
comprehensive peace with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"There are preconditions for the just and comprehensive peace
and when Israel is able to meet these preconditions, we and Syria
will be ready for this peace," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, who won a three-year extension of his presidency last
October, announced that he had set three priorities for his
mandate, the first of which was "to liberate south Lebanon and
Western Beqaa and to make Lebanon recover its united and free
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The second priority was to complete a return of the
war-displaced people to their villages and homes, and the third
was to set up a modern administration, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's remarks came at a time when the tension mounted
between Syria and Israel after the two sides repeatedly accused
each other of creating a dangerous atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Some Lebanese have expressed a fear that their country could
become the stage if an armed conflict erupted between its south
and east neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently put forward
a proposal on an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in
exchange for a disarmament of Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas and
a guarantee for the security of northern Israel. Both Lebanon and
Syria have refused the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Rural Enterprises  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A draft Law on Township-Run
Enterprise was submitted today to China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), for
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The draft is designed to standardize the development of the
enterprises, which are a pillar industry of the country's rural
economy and a major component of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
Liu Suinian, chairman of the NPC Financial and Economic
Committee, gave an explanation of the draft Law to the 21st
meeting of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Agriculture show that
the gross domestic product (the value of goods and services
produced) for rural enterprises across the country amounted to
1.459 trillion yuan in 1995, a quarter of China's total.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises also paid a total of 205.8 billion yuan in
taxes to the government last year, one-third of the nation's
total. Taxes paid by the enterprises have risen at an annual rate
of 43 percent over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Liu noted that rural enterprises have
encountered a number of difficulties in the course of sustained
development. Central government policies to aid the development of
the enterprises, for example have not followed legal
guidelines. Also, without some assistance, enterprises in the
underdeveloped central and western parts of China will not be able
to expand.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law On Rural Enterprises (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In aiding the growth of the farming sector and the rural
economy, rural enterprises have no laws to follow. Some local
governments collect improper charges from them and illegally use
their assets.
</P>
<P>
Liu also criticized some enterprises for evading taxes, wasting
resources, causing pollution, neglecting safety measures on the
job, and selling fake and shoddy goods.
</P>
<P>
"We should solve all these problems by formulating laws," he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The draft Law states that township-run enterprises mean various
kinds of enterprises run by villages or townships (towns), mainly
backed by investment from rural collective organizations or
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Other types of enterprises that are closely related to farmers,
rural areas, and the farming sector will be managed for some time
to come in the same way as rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises are, at the same time, duty-bound to aid the
farming sector and must earmark a certain portion of their
after-tax profits for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the draft Law, the government will use
preferential tax policies for rural enterprises and extend
low-interest loans, and localities can set up funds for the
development of rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The draft Law also contains specific articles on penalizing
rural enterprises for evading taxes, wasting resources, polluting
the environment, and neglecting safety on the job site.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
said that Israel would resume peace negotiations with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) soon, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the commitment during a phone call to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak late Thursday night, noting that the issue
of Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron
would also be discussed.

NEW YORK -- Chemical evidence found from the wreckage of the
TWA Flight 800 led investigators to believe that an explosive
device was detonated to cause the crash, The New York Times
reported in its early Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
Chemists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) crime
laboratory have found traces of PETN, a chemical component in
plastic explosives, on a piece of wreckage retrieved from the
jet's passenger cabin between rows 17 and 27, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The finding provides evidence that the jetliner was destroyed
by an explosive device, but the Times said the chemical is
commonly found in many bombs and surface-to-air missiles, making
it impossible to know which type of device was involved in the
July 17 crash that killed all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Times said senior investigators were not yet ready to
declare the crash the result of a criminal act.

Marcos' payment of deficiency taxes from 1969 to 1989 totaling
some 43 billion pesos (1.64 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The BIR said these liabilities included 19.8 billion pesos (756

and 23.2 billion pesos (885 million dollars) in estate taxes
following the death of former president Ferdinand Marcos in Hawaii

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Skywalk Waterfall in Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A famous Chinese acrobat is
planning to set a new world record - by crossing a Yellow River
waterfall on a 1000-meter long tightrope.
</P>
<P>
The stunt is aimed at smashing the current world record of
Canadian-American "prince of the air" stuntman Jay Cochrane. He
crossed the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River last year on a
640-meter long cable.
</P>
<P>
The challenge will be carried out by Feng Jiushan, a well-known
Chinese acrobat or his nephew. One of them will walk the
1,000-meter tightrope over the Hukou Waterfall on the Yellow River
on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The steel tightrope has already been fixed over the waterfall,
but it is not yet decided who will carry out the death-defying
feat, Feng or his nephew Feng Xile.
</P>
<P>
Feng has a wide experience, while his nephew is young and
energetic. They both work with the Henan Skywalk Performing Troupe.
</P>
<P>
According to Ji Tongde, director of the troupe, both Feng and
his nephew will go to the waterfall to guarantee the success of
the skywalk, though only one of them will perform the adventurous
walk.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that Feng, a crew from the Shanghai TV Station and
representatives from the Shanghai office of the Guinness Book of
World Records have already arrived at the waterfall to make
preparations.
</P>
<P>
Cochrane, 57, is said to have refused Feng's challenge to
compete on the same tightrope in Shanghai, for he has signed an
agreement to walk across a cable between two skyscrapers in the
Pudong New Area on the evening of September 25, during the
Shanghai Tourism Festival.
</P>
<P>
The walk will be a world record at a height of 108-134 meters,
with the height difference reaching 40 meters.
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers say that there would be no arrangement for
the two skywalkers to compete on September 25, but Feng may appear
and perform during the festival.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, another well-known Chinese acrobat, Zhong Yinguo,
41, died in a fall from a mountain cable in Jiangyou City in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Following Cochrane's crossing of the Three Gorges, skywalk
fever has hit China, with daredevils eager to demonstrate their
skills.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Work on a pedestrian tunnel
that passes under the Huangpu River in China's largest
metropolitan business center, will start in October this year.
</P>
<P>
The project, a key part of Shanghai's Ninth Five-Year Plan,
calls for a 506-meter tunnel, linking the well-known Bund area in
Shanghai's western part with the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, at
Lujiazui in the western part.
</P>
<P>
The journey will take only 14 minutes, because of an elevator
at the entrance and exit, and automatic sidewalks inside the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
A special company was set up yesterday to take charge of the
project, which is estimated to cost 435 million yuan. The project
is scheduled for completion by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Companies from France, the Netherlands, Thailand and Hongkong
have agreed to invest in the project, sources say.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Lujiazui financial and trade area has two
bridges, two automobile tunnels, and several shipping routes to
reach western Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> More Income for the More Educated, Survey Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The average income of
intellectuals in China has been significantly increased compared
to some years ago, a new survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Until recently in China the income of intellectuals was much
lower than the less-educated self-employed laborers and private
enterprise owners.
</P>
<P>
But according to a recent survey conducted by the Public Poll
Institute of the People's University of China, this abnormal
phenomena has been basically erased in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
"The average income of a typical intellectual in China now is
424 Yuan (51 US dollars) monthly, while that of a typical
self-employed laborer or private enterprise owner is 438 (53 US
dollars), the gap is not as high as some years ago," the survey
says.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the data we collected we see clearly the trend
that the more educated, the more income," said Professor Liu
Xiayang, who was in charge of the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The average monthly income of families with only junior school
education is 280 Yuan per capita, while the figure for families
with high school education is 360 Yuan, and families with college
education, 550 Yuan."
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, more than one third of the
intellectual families are now on the list of families in China
with the most income.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the income gap between urban
residents and their rural counterparts is still big.
</P>
<P>
"The average income of urban families is twice the figure for
rural families. There are 1.2 percent of urban residents living
with monthly incomes of less than 100 Yuan (12 US dollars) per
person, while the figure for rural residents is 26 percent," the
survey says.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Joint Ventures Increase Imports and Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The readjustment of state
import and export tax policies has not had a negative impact on
overseas-funded enterprises in China's richest province.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports of Sino-foreign joint ventures in
Guangdong Province hit 26.4 billion US dollars in the first half
of the year, rising 12.4 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Their imports and export volume accounted for 52.9 percent of
the province's total, giving them a leading position in the
province's imports and exports for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Businesses funded solely by foreign businessmen witnessed the
fastest growth.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the development of overseas-funded
businesses to the following:
</P>
<P>
First, cutting import taxes by customs has stimulated
imports. In the first half of the year, imports by Sino-foreign
joint ventures reached 470 million US dollars, up 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Second, last year the state stated that goods produced by
foreign-backed companies which were established after 1994 can get
a tax refund on exported goods, and customs have tightened
controls on imported goods in bond, bringing about an import
increase of 108.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Third, import and export volume generated by processed goods
in joint ventures rose 12 percent to 22.3 billion US dollars in
the first half of the year, and the state decided to introduce a
duty security system in the processing trade starting July 1 this
year.

<P>
During the period, light industry and textiles accounted for
most of the exports, such as garments, shoes, plastic products,
and toys. The majority of imported goods were raw materials and
half-finished goods, steel, polystyrene, automatic data processing
equipment parts, paper, paperboard, and synthetic fiber.

<HEADLINE> Reforming Rural Financial System in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- All rural credit cooperatives
will be required to disassociate themselves from agricultural
banks in Guangdong province before mid-1997 - a major financial
reform in south China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This message comes from the executive vice-governor, Zhang
Gaoli, at a recent meeting, where he said that rural cooperative
banks will be tried experimentally in some counties and cities
with "necessary conditions."
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that there are contradictions between the
fact that credit cooperatives are administered by agricultural
banks and the fact that the agricultural banks are being turned
into commercial entities. The management of rural financial
institutions is still insufficient, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"All this has affected the development of the rural economy,
and a comprehensive reform of the financial system in rural areas
has become an urgent task," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that outstanding deposits at the
agricultural banks and rural credit cooperatives in Guangdong were
193.5 billion yuan (about 23 billion US dollars) at the end of
last year, about 16 times the 1985 figure. During the period,
outstanding loans grew at an average of 25 percent annually to 180
billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the banks and credit cooperatives have more than
15,000 business operations in the province. The credit
cooperatives had 800 million yuan in profits during the country's
Eighth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of these facts, the existing rural financial system
and its operating mechanism do not suit the new order of a
socialist market economy in many ways," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yunxiang, governor of the provincial branch of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, said that the reform of
the rural credit cooperatives will go step by step and
subsidiaries of the Agricultural Development Bank of China in
Beijing, a policy-oriented bank founded in 1994, will be set up at
the county level by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A coordinating office has already been set up to facilitate
financial reforms in rural areas, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Pledges to Resume Talks with PNA Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel would resume peace
negotiations with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) soon,
Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the commitment during a phone call to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak late Thursday night, noting that the issue
of Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron
would also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said that the premier told Mubarak that
negotiations will be launched "in the very near future,"
including meeting of the Steering Committee, headed, on the
Israeli side, by former army Chief of Staff Dan Shimron.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Netanyahu's office told Israel Radio that the
phone conversation was "friendly and good," and Mubarak was
pleased to hear that in fact the peace process was moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mubarak pledged to assist the peace process, using
all the means at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the phone call to Mubarak after the Egyptian
president threatened to cancel the regional economic summit
planned to be held in Cairo, capital of Egypt, in November,
unless Israel upholds its commitments to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of academics Thursday in the Egyptian
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, Mubarak said that he had
told the Israelis that no progress in the peace process may abort
the economic summit, because not many countries would attend.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed that Israel needed to move fast, adding that
"we are worried that the length of time could affect the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
After the phone call, the prime minister's office issued a
statement, insisting that Netanyahu understood from Mubarak that
the economic conference would take place.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to maintain the ongoing contacts.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser
Dore Gold met Thursday with Mahmoud Abbas, PNA President
Yasser Arafat's deputy, as an attempt to make some progress
on the outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also announced that he would soon dispatch Foreign
Minister David Levy to Egypt, in an effort to smooth over
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Noise Control Submitted for Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- A draft of the Law on Preventing
and Controlling Environmental Noise was submitted today to China's
top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zongtang, chairman of the NPC Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee, delivered an explanation of the proposed law
to a meeting of NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years China has scored successes in
preventing and controlling noise pollution, particularly pollution
from factories.
</P>
<P>
But traffic noise and noise from public behavior have become
major problems in China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Environmental Protection Bureau show
that two-thirds of urban residents across the country live in an
environment where the noise level exceeds government-set
norms. Traffic noise accounts for nearly 29 percent of all kinds
of noise, noise from public behavior, 46.8 percent, and noise from
factories, 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Residential areas usually suffer from the most serious noise
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zongtang said that it is necessary to create a law to
prevent and control environmental noise in order to solve new
problems that have cropped up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The draft stipulates that the objectives for preventing and
controlling noise pollution and other relevant measures must be
included in plans of governments at various levels for economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the draft law, the government will restrict
the use of equipment and products that cause serious noise
pollution, and introduce a system that will discard them.
</P>
<P>
The draft law contains measures to prevent and control noise
pollution from motor vehicles, ships and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It also sets stringent standards for noise from restaurants and
recreational places. And it orders public security departments and
environmental protection departments to reduce all kinds of noise
from public behavior to meet government-set levels.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Threatens to Dismiss Striking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
threatened to dismis striking civil servants who do not return to
work today after negotiations between the two sides were
deadlocked on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro said last night that any employee who would defy the order
to return to work would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro's order for resumption of duty by the government
workers protesting a nine percent salary increase has been
spurned by union leaders, who said the work stoppage would
continue.
</P>
<P>
The minister met yesterday with two separate groups of workers'
representatives who presented varying demands which she said were
confusing.
</P>
<P>
While one group demanded a 30 percent increase, the other wanted a
100 percent raise without bonuses this year or a 60 percent increment
with bonuses.
</P>
<P>
The Public Service Association had on Wednesday agreed to call off
the strike, but its members refused to relent saying they would only
go back to work after an announcement of new increases of no less
than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strike which entered its fourth day on Thursday has grounded the
provision of essential services to a halt. enditem

placed under protection as archaeological research is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 cultural relics, such as pottery, bamboo
records, grottos, and the Dunhuang frescoes have come from 13,300
historical sites in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial relics authorities, Gansu has 14

<HEADLINE> Earthquake-Damaged Ancient City to Be Rebuilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUNNAN, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Yunnan provincial government
has decided to raise 45 million yuan for a three-year rebuilding
project for the ancient city of Lijiang, which was hit by an
earthquake in February, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, 1996, a quake measuring seven on the Richter
Scale hit Lijiang and surrounding areas, killing 309 people and
seriously injuring 4,070 others.
</P>
<P>
Some one million local residents were affected, the official
said, economic losses were estimated at 4.03 billion yuan, and
1,737 of the 800-year-old town's 4,750 houses collapsed.
</P>
<P>
All the building work must meet severe earthquake standards,
the official said, adding that an effort will be made to improve
the water supply and drainage facilities, to plant trees along
roads, and to install fire-prevention equipment.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial department of construction said
that those buildings in the classical style that survived the
quake will be kept.
</P>
<P>
Buildings that collapsed and some unsafe buildings will be
rebuilt, he said, and buildings incompatible with the style of the
old town will be torn down.
</P>
<P>
Any bridges must be built of stone or wood. Lijiang currently
has 374 arched stone or wooden bridges built during the Song
Dynasty (960-1279) and the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

DHAKA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Thursday reiterated her government's firm resolve to open
up the country's economy in a bid to attract foreign investment
and to create "millions of jobs and billions of dollars."
</P>
<P>
At a meeting, she assured foreign businessmen that "good
governance" and a package of incentives will be offered for
foreign investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister, who took office just two months ago,
pointed out that inflow of foreign investment has been less than
30 million U.S. dollars per year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
She attributed this partly to a poor inflow and pervasive
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the investment policy, the prime minister said
that measures had already been taken to attract investors to the
country's stock markets.
</P>
<P>
However, she emphasized that it was the direct foreign
investment that had played a crucial part in accelerating
industrialization, growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"Our targets are to create millions of jobs and billions of
dollars in foreign investment. I am confident we can reach this
goal," She added.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer demands in Australia
showed signs of weakness as new motor vehicle registrations fell
in June.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
new motor vehicle registrations fell by 17.7 percent to 50,651 in
June seasonally adjusted from 61,547 in May.
</P>
<P>
The figure indicated a weaker domestic demand at the end of the
1995-96 fiscal year. It showed that people are buying less new
cars in face of the uncertainty of a softer economy.
</P>
<P>
New car sales have remained flat in the past few months. The
figures went in line with other economic indicators that the
Australian economy is slowing down markedly.
</P>
<P>
In the budget released by the coalition government on Tuesday,
the economy growth rate for the current fiscal year is forecasted
to be down to 3.5 percent, with the inflation rate falling to
about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The June new car registration figure was also down near 4
percent from one year ago, comparing with 52,720 in June last
year.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Plans to Boost Grain Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine plans to more than
quadruple current grain exports to between 10 million and 15
million tons a year to cut the country's trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The government said it aims to earn some 3 billion U.S. dollars
a year in foreign exchange from grain exports which are currently
running at only 3 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, for the first time since independence from the
former Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine enjoyed a 19 million-dollar
trade surplus. But another deficit is looming for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, once the breadbasket of Europe and producer of a
quarter of the former Soviet Union's grain supply, used to have 20
million hectares devoted to grain production.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a variety of reasons, including an inefficient
farming system, lack of fuel, outdated machinery and bad weather,
that has now dwindled to 14 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
To meet its new export target, the government plans to increase
the amount of land used for grain production to 16 million
hectares, including 7 million hectares of winter wheat, Deputy
Prime Minister Mikhail Zubets announced at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way, he said, can the production of 34 to 36
million tons per year, including 16 to 18 million tons of winter
wheat, be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
This year Ukraine is expected to export 3 million tons of
grains, roughly on par with last year. So far, the Republic of
Belarus has decided to purchase 1.5 million tons of grains from
Ukraine. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Communists Call to End State Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Communist Party will
cooperate with the government in working out a national economic
development plan to overcome the country's economic crisis, party
chief Petr Simonenko said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of a social market economy is a must
in efforts to get the country out of the crisis, but will take
seven or eight years.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's economy has been devastated by the impact of economic
reform launched in 1994. Inflation was 183 percent last year,
industrial and agricultural output are falling, the budget deficit
is growing and there have been mass strikes in protest at wage
arrears.
</P>
<P>
The government is in talks with the IMF for funding to help
solve the crisis, but in return is having to make key economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Simonenko said the Ukrainian Communist Party has agreed to
speed up reform of the financial system while recovering the state
monopoly of economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Communist Party, born out of the former Soviet
Communist Party and the biggest political force in Ukraine,
opposes state privatization of land.

<P>
SHENYANG, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a regional
labor market in the northern industrial city of Shenyang to get
some relief for the burden of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Since it went into operation in October, 1995, the market has
helped more than 100,000 jobless people find new jobs. Over 30
cities have become market members and have agencies there.
</P>
<P>
The market has a large screen displaying domestic and overseas
job information and has joined an information network of the
Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
"Issues relating to a market economy have to be dealt with
through the market itself," said Song Haisheng, director of the
municipal labor department, who noted that attention has been
shifted from job placement via the local government to an
effective employment market.
</P>
<P>
Song said that the quality of service should be improved so
that as much information as possible is available to job hunters
and that there are more choices for both employers and employees.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang is one of China's heavy industrial cities, and has had
nearly 300,000 jobless from the state sector, not counting the
surplus labor from rural areas who have flooded the cities looking
for work.

<HEADLINE> Most Serbs, Croats Oppose Unification with Muslims: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Most Bosnian Serbs and Croats
don't want to live with Muslims in a unified country, a survey
conducted by the United States Information Agency (USIA) has shown.
</P>
<P>
The results are a blow to the aims of the Dayton peace
agreement signed last December after a nearly four-year war in the
former Yugoslavia between Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the peace accord was the ethnic
unification of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
But the USIA survey of 2,763 Bosnians in July showed 95 percent
of the Bosnian Serbs and two thirds of the Bosnian Croats opposed
the unification of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the Croats and 96 percent of the Serbs said
that Bosnia will inevitably be divided into three ethnic regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Muslims are more optimistic. Some 97 percent of
the Muslims questioned support unification and 80 percent said the
three ethnic groups will finally live together peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Three fourths of the Croats questioned in the survey said that
the regions controlled by the Bosnian Croats should become part of
Croatia and 96 of the Serbs questioned agreed with the idea that
the self-styled Bosnian Serbs mini-state of Republika Sprska
should merge with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the result of the survey showed that it
will be very difficult to implement the Dayton accord, which
brought an end to the 43-month Bosnian war last December and set a
course for the country's unification as a unitary, multi-ethnic
state within its pre-war borders.

<HEADLINE> Evidence Shows Explosive Detonated on TWA Flight: NY Times (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chemical evidence found from
the wreckage of the TWA Flight 800 led investigators to believe
that an explosive device was detonated to cause the crash, The New
York Times reported in its early Friday edition.
</P>
<P>
Chemists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) crime
laboratory have found traces of PETN, a chemical component in
plastic explosives, on a piece of wreckage retrieved from the
jet's passenger cabin between rows 17 and 27, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The finding provides evidence that the jetliner was destroyed
by an explosive device, but the Times said the chemical is
commonly found in many bombs and surface-to-air missiles, making
it impossible to know which type of device was involved in the
July 17 crash that killed all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Times said senior investigators were not yet ready to
declare the crash the result of a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not a bomb or missile brought down that plane at
this point we don't know for sure," according to a source close to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
If the crash is declared a criminal act, it will be the
deadliest crime in American history, surpassing the April 1995
bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168
people.
</P>
<P>
The investigators still hoped to retrieve more wreckage and
were particularly interested in finding metal fragments showing
what investigators call shock waves which are the physical damage
left by a blast that suggests what type of device exploded.
</P>
<P>
Five days after the crash, investigators found preliminary
indications of PETN residue on a piece of the right wing near the
fuselage, but that was not confirmed by a later test at the FBI
lab in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration investigators who probed the Challenger space
shuttle disaster in 1986 were called in Thursday to examine
specific pieces of TWA Flight 800's wreckage.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Cut Rates Again to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada today cut its
key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25
percent in a bid to prod the country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh time this year and the 16th since May 1995
that the central bank has lowered its key interest rate. The last
rate cut was made less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
(CIBC) and other commercial banks also slashed their prime rates
today, from 6 percent to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some three-to-five-year variable mortgage rates also dropped,
local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
CIBC, the second largest bank in the country, said it would
trim the rate it charged on outstanding balances for most of its
Visa credit cards by one percentage point on October 1.
</P>
<P>
A deeper-than-expected cut in European interest rates, combined
with the stand-pat attitude of the U.S. Federal Reserve, has left
enough room for the Bank of Canada to move in for the reduction,
local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing slide in Canadian interest rates has led many
foreign investors in Canadian securities to dump their holdings.
</P>
<P>
Last month, foreigners sold off two billion Canadian dollars
(1.46 billion U.S. dollars) in short-term interest rate paper,
according to figures released today by Statistics Canada.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Motorola Company of the
United States has shifted its headquarters to Beijing after
establishing a large production base in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Japan has stored
color TV kinescopes produced in Beijing at warehouses in
neighbouring Tianjin's bonded zone, where they are available for
export at any time.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-based Qinghua University has worked in cooperation with
Hebei Province since 1981 to develop 218 research projects.
</P>
<P>
These combined factors suggest that the economies of Beijing,
Tianjin and neighboring Hebei Province have, over years, mixed
together during the course of a transition from the socialist
planned economy to a market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan described Beijing and Tianjin as the
areas with scientific and technological might in China, for the
two cities boast a contingent of 1.4 million scientists and
technicians.
</P>
<P>
The bonded zone of Tianjin Harbor has expanded its service
scope to Beijing and Tianjin, said Wang Haiping, director of the
Bonded Zone Managing Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is now common for engineers and technicians at universities,
research institutes and large and medium-size enterprises in
Beijing and Tianjin municipalities to provide technical guidance
for rural industrial firms in Hebei on weekends and during
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Areas near Beijing and Tianjin, such as Tangshan, Langfang and
Cangzhou, recorded the speediest development in Hebei, thanks to
inter-regional economic cooperation, according to Zhou Fengkai, an
official of Hebei province in charge of affairs related to the
province's opening to the outside world.

<HEADLINE> German Court Jails U.S. Neo-Nazi for Four Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A German court today sentenced a
U.S. neo-Nazi leader, Gary Rex Lauck, to four years' imprisonment
for inciting racial hatred by smuggling extreme right-wing
propaganda into Germany.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in the Hamburg court said the 43-year-old neo-Nazi
leader, who is of German extraction, has been a Hitler fanatic for
more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
The head of the National Socialist German Workers' Party
Foreign Organization (NSDAP-AO), a group which derives its name
from the full German title of Hitler's party, has devoted all his
energy to preach Nazi theories in Germany over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Lauck's worldwide propaganda empire produces anti-Semitic and
rightist publications such as the "NS Kampfruf" magazine
("National Socialist Battle Cry") and other propaganda including
posters, badges and stickers.
</P>
<P>
Through various means, he sent 2,000 to 2,500 items of
propaganda into Germany every two months.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had been trying for years to get the U.S. citizen,
from Lincoln, Nebraska, extradited to Germany to face trial.
</P>
<P>
Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi materials is illegal in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
But they didn't strike luck until last year when Lauck visited
Denmark in March. He was detained on an international arrest
warrant and then extradited to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Lauck was also accused of portraying violence and
disseminating insignia and propaganda of anti-constitutional
organizations in his publications.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that during his trial, Lauck didn't break his
silence until the court announced the verdict.
</P>
<P>
He immediately jumped up and cried that the struggle would
continue. His lawyers said they would appeal against the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther expressed
satisfaction with the verdict, saying the move was the right
answer of a nation and the international community to reactionary
extremist activities.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Protocol on Dispute Settlement Drafted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of ASEAN
countries have completed drafting a protocol on dispute
settlement, aimed at resolving economic disputes in a legal
approach, according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The draft protocol, scheduled to be approved by ASEAN economic
ministers at their annual meeting in mid-September in Jakarta, is
modeled on the new dispute arbitration process of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), but includes a shorter and less complicated
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN economic ministers have felt a need to have a formal
mechanism for dispute settlement, in addition to their traditional
consultation methods.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft protocol, the principal decision-making body
would be a meeting of senior economic officials, with the
possibility of setting up a panel of experts to look closely at
the details of an issue.
</P>
<P>
Appeals could be lodged with the ASEAN economic ministers.
</P>
<P>
At the appeal stage, consensus would be required among economic
ministers from all ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Once a ruling has been made, the parties concerned must
implement the final decision within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
If the parties could not reach an agreement on compensation,
any party could ask ASEAN economic ministers to approve
retaliation -- suspension of concessions or other obligations
normally granted to the other side.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Companies See Lower Profits in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The profits of Canadian companies
dropped in the second quarter of this year as the weak economy
took its toll on many industrial sectors, especially forestry and
electronics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported today that the operating profits of
corporations slipped 1.6 percent to 16.1 billion U.S. dollars
during the quarter, following a 3.6 percent slide in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Canadian corporate profits had grown strongly in 1993 and 1994,
and maintained their historically high level through 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent declines, corporate profits remain well above
the previous peak level achieved in 1989, the federal
fact-gathering agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that wood and paper industry companies
continued to lose ground, with a 34 percent drop in operating
profits to 580 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Food industry operating profits dropped to 500 million dollars
from a level of 800 million in each of the two preceding quarters
as competition intensified.
</P>
<P>
In the electronic equipment and computer services industry,
profits fell to 220 million dollars from 360 million in the first
quarter and from a record high of 510 million in the third quarter
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Demand for electrical and electronic products appeared to be
softening, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial institutions posted profit growth for the
third quarter. In the second quarter, operating profits rose 6.6
percent to 4.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Cease-Fire in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration today
welcomed a cease-fire deal between the Russian government and
Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire will take effect from midday on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this agreement. It's a positive step forward. We
look forward to its implementation by both parties and hope it
leads eventually to a political settlement to the Chechen crisis,"
U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Alexander Lebed, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's security aide, and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff
Aslan Maskhadov at a village south of the Chechen capital of
Grozny earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, all hostilities will stop immediately, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed to pull out their armed forces
from Grozny, set up joint military police patrols in the
devastated city and list the permanent locations of their warring
forces as well as routes and deadlines for the withdrawal of
troops, he added.
</P>
<P>
War has been raging in the breakaway republic of Chechnya since
December 1994 when Boris Yeltsin sent in troops to crush the
republic's bid for independence. More than 50,000 people have

<HEADLINE> Germany Lowers Key Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank has lowered
its key securities repurchase rate from 3.3 percent to a historic
low of three percent.
</P>
<P>
But two other key interest rates, the discount and Lombard loan
rate, remain unchanged at the 2.5 and 4.5 percent rates set in
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which analysts saw as "a definite signal of a
falling trend in interest rates", came after a meeting of the
Bundesbank's Central Bank Committee in Frankfurt today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was applauded in most quarters and is regarded as
an "appropriate step" in stabilizing policies and maintaining
economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The cut animated currency markets. The U.S. dollar rose from
1.4845 marks to 1.4903 marks and exchange rates of other European
currencies against the mark also rose.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the Bundesbank's action was aimed at creating a
favorable financial environment for the sluggish German economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of Internal
Revenue (BIR) next month will auction 14 pieces of real estate
property assumed by former first lady Imelda Marcos, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the proposed sale would account for
Marcos' payment of deficiency taxes from 1969 to 1989 totaling
some 43 billion pesos (1.64 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The BIR said these liabilities included 19.8 billion pesos (756
million dollars) in deficient income taxes in the covered period
and 23.2 billion pesos (885 million dollars) in estate taxes
following the death of former president Ferdinand Marcos in Hawaii
in September 1989.
</P>
<P>
The BIR also said the liabilities were separated from the
collection and tax evasion cases slapped by the Bureau against
Marcos' children.
</P>
<P>
The first bidding of the Marcos' property was rendered moot
last year because no one wanted to buy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Women ministers and officials
from 19 Latin American countries and Spain and Portugal are
meeting in Managua to discuss women's role in politics, economy
and society.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Violetta Chamorro de Chamorro, who opened
the conference, stressed the role of women in the advancement of
society, saying that "our point of view has double value: the
value of our experience in government and the value of our
condition as women.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot attain sustainable development if we do not return
to women the dignity and respect due to them in our societies."
</P>
<P>
She added, "The Iberoamerican countries have a lot to gain when
women's proposals are heard on increasing the quality of life of
our people, creating jobs and improving health, education and
housing conditions and the income of the more vulnerable sectors
of our nations."
</P>
<P>
Rosario Hernandez, director of the Nicaraguan Women's
Institute, underlined the importance of women's participation in
deciding the public policies.
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to have more women in the structure of public
powers. It is necessary to have them in positions where their
decisions affect the direction of our societies," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Women's Ministry head Maria Josefina Bilbao said
women's role and capability in society had been recognized by the
Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing last year and
government tasks cannot be carried out without the might of women.
</P>
<P>
The Managua Declaration is expected to be approved by the end
of the meeting, which will be the basis for the Sixth
Iberoamerican Summit to be held this November in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Deterioration Affects Tourism in El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Severe soil erosion,
deforestation and pollution are threatening the development of
tourism in El Salvador, an ecology group warned today.
</P>
<P>
Only 2 percent of the country's original forests remain; more
than four fifths of its fertile areas suffer from soil erosion and
90 percent of the country's rivers are contaminated, a report from
the Salvadoran Ecological Unit (Unes) said.
</P>
<P>
Mangrove tree forests along the country's Pacific coast
extended over 160 square kilometers in 1989, but now just over
three square kilometers are left, said Unes spokesman Nestor
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
Beaches are being turned into bare deserts and forests around
the coast are shrinking due to excessive cutting of trees to make
way for houses.
</P>
<P>
Martinez added that the development of a few ecological zones
is expected to bring more environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Despite such a desperate situation, the spokesman said,
Salvadoran authorities want to turn the nation into a tourist zone
and build impressive tourism complexes in the environmentally
damaged regions.

<HEADLINE> Organic Farming to Be Boosted in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Agriculture and
Cooperatives Ministry will boost exports of organic farm products
and replace chemical-dependent agricultural system with more
environment-friendly ones, said deputy permanent secretary
Pitiphong Puengboon.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to revamp the agricultural system came after European
Union (EU) members indicated the quality of farm products would be
the main consideration in their decision to purchase from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Requiring imported agricultural goods to be safe and
environment-friendly should not be considered a trade barrier
because the World Trade Organization allows each country to
determine its own criteria, Pitiphong was quoted by local
newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand could benefit from the tough EU measures as
the country has the potential to produce chemical-free organic
products even though prices could be 20 to 50 percent higher than
chemically-raised farm products.
</P>
<P>
Thailand exports about 50 billion baht (2 billion US dollars)
worth of agricultural goods to EU countries each year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry is ready to
support farmers to convert from current production which is highly
reliant on chemical fertilizers and pesticides to organic systems.
the current budget is enough to promote organic farming in the
country, Pitiphong said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, non-governmental organizations working on organic
farming said the entire society has to get involved in the effort
to promote organic agriculture and boot exports of its products.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Exchanges Fire with Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military has said
that troops on Thursday killed one of the kidnappers who is taking
12 workers hostage during a shootout.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Irian Jaya's Trikora military command Lt. Col.
Maulud Hidayat said the soldiers also seized an SP-mouser rifle
and two magazines as well as 34 bullets during the clash, Antara
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Maulud said the troops suffered no fatalities in the shootout.
He did not mention if any troops injured or any of the hostages
were freed.
</P>
<P>
The armed contact occurred at 11 a.m. local time in an area
about 15 kilometers from the place where 50 tribal kidnappers took
16 employees of a logging company on August 14.
</P>
<P>
The captors are still holding 12 people after two escaped and
two were released to deliver a letter to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The army has formed a team of soldiers code named Rajawali or
Eagle, to free the hostages. The task force is led by Col. Frans
de Wanna, the local military commandant.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were backed by four helicopters and a sniffer dog,
which was used in a military operation to free 11 hostages in the
same general area in May.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers have demanded the ending of logging in the area,
negotiation involving human rights organizations and the mediation
of Amungme tribal chief Tom Beanal as conditions under which they
would free their captives.
</P>
<P>
However, the military has ruled out any negotiation with the
kidnappers and is determined to launch a military operation for
the release of the hostages if the abductors refuse to surrender.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the hostages will be released soon," Maulud said.

<HEADLINE> French PM Dashes African Immigrants' Residence Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Alain Juppe said
today that the 300 African immigrants, including 10 hunger
strikers, who have occupied a Paris church for nearly two months
have no right to stay in France.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that based on a ruling of France's highest
administrative tribunal, the Council of State, those who cannot
get residence permits would be expelled.
</P>
<P>
However, the council left the door open to case-by-case reviews
and Juppe pledged that the government would not expel those who
were ill or use deportation to break up families.
</P>
<P>
In a televised statement, he said that carrying out the laws of
the republic is the best way to safeguard the unity of the French
people and all nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The protesters responded to the government's rejection by
vowing to continue their struggle until they win residence permits
for all 300 in the church.
</P>
<P>
The French administrative tribunal met Thursday afternoon on
the request of Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre and ruled that
the 300 immigrants, who are protesting against immigration laws
passed in 1993, have no right to obtain legal residence
certificates, thus they cannot stay in France.
</P>
<P>
The African illegal immigrants took over the Saint-Bernard
church on June 28 and demanded the French government grant them
legal residence rights.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the protesters began a hunger strike on July 5 in an
attempt to pressure the French government to compromise.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said the Council of State fully backed his view that
none of the protesting immigrants had the right to stay in France
under the 1993 laws tightening conditions for residence.
</P>
<P>
"It would be against the law to give blanket residence permits
to this or that group. We are going to continue a review of
individual situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was senseless for the immigrants to hold further
demonstrations or hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
The immigrants argue that they once had residence rights. But
their residency became illegal after France passed laws tightening
conditions for residence and citizenship in 1993 at a time of high
anti-immigrant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Their cause has been supported by several leftist opposition
parties. The French Socialist Party, the Communist Party and
leftist trade unions called on President Jacques Chirac to help
resume negotiations between the government and the immigrants.

<HEADLINE> More Competition in Mobile Telecom Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Competition in China's mobile
telecommunications market has become more intense as the number of
foreign telecom companies entering the country increases.
</P>
<P>
According to "People's Posts and Telecommunications News",
projects for 900 MHz analog cellular phones are dominated by
Motorola, whose products are used in 21 provinces and autonomous
regions, and Ericsson, a Swedish telecom company whose sales
network extends to 15 provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The more profitable market for digital mobile telecom networks
is shared by a dozen companies from Canada, South Korea, Japan and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the mobile telephone handset market, Motorola's traditional
dominance was challenged by a number of newcomers such as Nokia,
Philips, Ericsson, NEC, and Nortel, who set up offices in various
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation with local enterprises is an effective way for
foreign companies to expand their market share, and Motorola,
Japan's NEC, and Siemens have launched handset joint ventures in
Wuhan, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. They have handed over their latest
GSM (global service for mobile communication) technology to
Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that in the near future, a monopoly of the
handset market would not be an easy thing to establish.

CARACAS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 40,000 youngsters, most of
them women, are sexually exploited in Venezuela, a child welfare
organization said today.
</P>
<P>
The child prostitution victims are aged from eight to 17.

It blamed poverty for the sharp increase in child prostitution
in the country over the last few years, particularly in urban
areas with high population growth.

<P>
Some 40 percent of child prostitutes are destitute and in dire
poverty while another 40 percent are poor and the remaining 20
percent only have the basic necessities, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
Child sexual exploitation is one of such social problems as
sexual maltreatment, family disintegration and financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one million children a year around the world enter
prostitution which has become a multi-billion dollar industry, a
report from the United Nations claims.

The fight against the sexual exploitation of children and
teenagers will be the theme of a world congress in Stockholm,
Sweden, at the end of August.

of the regulations, at a time when the Taiwan Authorities are
attempting to block the growth of normal trade relations across
the straits, demonstrates the Chinese mainland's unremitting
efforts to promote direct mail services, trade and air and
shipping links across the straits.
</P>
<P>
It said the shipping market between the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan has emerged and the publication of the regulations will
have a huge impact on opening direct shipping links across the
straits.
</P>
<P>
"Wen Wei Po" said that the issuance of the regulations is a
major policy decision conforming to the will of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
It said that the regulations stressed the principles of one
China, direct shipping from both sides and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Tin Tin Daily News" cited a HongkongBank analyst as saying
that the direct shipping business across the Taiwan Straits will
provide more opportunities for Hong Kong's development.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the increasing trade across the Taiwan Straits
will benefit Hong Kong's economic development in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Economic Times" said that the implementation of the
regulations will benefit Taiwan's economy and promote the
development of Taiwan's shipping business.
</P>
<P>
It added that it will also bring great benefits to Hong Kong's
ordinary people and commercial circle.
</P>
<P>
"Ta Kung Pao" said that the regulations are aimed at
accelerating the process of opening direct shipping business
across the straits so as to cut the distance and time for
transport across the straits, and spare shipping business on both
sides unnecessary operational burdens.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Judge Wants Former President Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A Paraguayan judge today
asked lawmakers to strip former President Andres Rodriguez of
immunity from prosecution so that he can be tried on charges of
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, an army general who became president after a coup in
1989, was charged in July with involvement in a cocaine smuggling
operation six years ago when he was head of state.
</P>
<P>
Under the new 1992 constitution he was barred from seeking
re-election and lost power after the general election in 1993.
</P>
<P>
But under the constitution, former presidents and lawmakers
enjoy certain privileges including immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion said
Judge Jose Servin Bernal submitted to the Senate of the National
Congress the request to deprive Rodriguez of his privileges.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Produces 13,000 Tons Life Waste Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has said it will
improve its waste handling, since it produces 13,000 tons of waste
each day.
</P>
<P>
Five garbage projects, involving 230 million yuan (about 28
million US dollars) donated by the German government, and 236
million yuan from the Chinese, are being built in Beijing, two of
which will go into operation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
These are expected to handle 2,100 tons of waste per day,
according to "Beijing Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
Experts say this will greatly increase the processing of waste
and help improve public hygiene and the environment. In 1994, the
first waste handling plant that met international standards was
set up in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that in 1995, the capital handled a
total of 4.84 million tons of waste materials.
</P>
<P>
The city is now considering importing more processed vegetables
from outside, in an effort to reduce the amount of waste.

<P>
CHENGDU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- China's most populous province

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Andalusite Production Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Planning Commission
plans to build Xixia County in central China's Henan Province into
the largest andalusite production base in the country.
</P>
<P>
Andalusite is a refractory mineral widely used in the
metallurgy industry, in building materials, and in the chemical
and machine-building industries.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry say that
China has some 15 million tons of proven reserves of andalusite,
and that Xixia County alone has more than 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that both the amount and quality of the county's
andalusite are in the forefront in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The county began to extract andalusite ore in 1992. The
processed ore is in great demand on the international market, with
5,500 tons of it exported last year.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for a project for processing 200,000 tons of
andalusite concentrate are underway.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Streamline Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia is to restructure its
Army by reducing up to 3,000 from its 26,000-strong troops this
year.
</P>
<P>
The ten-percent cut will be part of the Australian Defense
Force's (ADF) plan to break down its two standing divisions into
smaller, highly mobile joint task forces.
</P>
<P>
The move will also meet the Coalition government's election
promise to create a sixth regular infantry battalion through the
establishment of an elite unit of special forces, or commandos.
</P>
<P>
The cut will be focused on the 5,300 civil staffs of the army,
so as to achieve the target of concentrating resources to the
army's combat edge.
</P>
<P>
In return, the ADF will increase the number of its General
Reserve troops by 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The streamline of regular troops was aimed at achieving savings
of up to 130 million Australian dollars (103 million US dollars)
from operating costs, ADF stated in its reform plan Army 21. The
money will be re-allocated to areas such as improving the army's
mobility and combat capability.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said that Army 21 plan, which
was tabled on Thursday, was still to be approved by the
government. The Coalition government would make its response to
the ADF proposals in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was "philosophically" committed to the
direction of Army 21.
</P>
<P>
The task forces will absorb all sorts of supporting units,
including artillery, armor and aviation. They are expected to have
higher flexibility and mobility than in the division structure.

MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue will sell to
highest bidders next month the real estate properties of the
Marcoes, the former first family in the country, to partly settle
their alleged tax debts totaling more than 43 billion pesos (1.64
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Manila Chronicle:
</P>
<P>
-- Kidnapping cases are increasing in the country with 92
people kidnapped in the first seven months this year, three more
than the total number of last year, the Philippine National Police

Sayyaf, another rebelling MORO group, plans to derail the peace

Front (MNLF) by assassinating top critics of the proposed Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development and blaming it on
the MNLF.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stock Value of Mexican Steel Producers Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The stock value of Mexican
steel companies rose 32 percent in terms of U.S. dollars since the
beginning of this year, the Banamex-Accival (Banacci) group
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to the exchange rate between the dollar
and Mexican peso which has been influencing the performance of the
country's steel enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But the main Mexican steel producers such as Ahmsa, Hylsamex,
ICH, Simec and Tamsa are expecting a lower-than-average production
in the next 12 months in that steel prices on the international
market will see no big increase.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations issued a report in late July saying that the
worldwide consumption of crude steel will shrink in the near
future which is expected to lower the prices.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Urges Changes to Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate gave its
unanimous support to President Ramos' peace formula in Mindanao
but reiterated their demand for amendments to the peace agreement
between the government and the MORO National Liberation Front
(MNLF).
</P>
<P>
However, the senators split over how to change the proposed
Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD).
Seventeen of them submitted eight proposals and seven others
proposed 14 amendments in their respective resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The senate's move was regarded as a great contribution to
refining the final peace deal after the senate dropped its
opposition and expressed its reservations on the SPCPD during its
Mindanao hearings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of the government peace panel dealing with
the MNLF said the senators' recommendation cannot be accommodated
before the final peace agreement is signed. But he gave assurances
that the changes will be included in the executive order that will
be issued by the president when he creates the SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that MNLF Chair Nur Misuari is studying the
senate proposals. He has rejected the government's proposal to
renegotiate the accord to consider senators' recommendations
because of the time limit.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement is scheduled to be initialized in Jakarta
next week and be formally signed in Manila on September 2.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Telecom Firm Exports SDH Equipment to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Northern Telecom (Nortel), a
leading Canadian telecommunications company, will supply
transmission equipment for the Wuhan-Xi'an-Lanzhou Cable, one of
China's optical telecom trunk lines.
</P>
<P>
According to "Science &AMP; Technology Daily", Nortel clinched the
deal with China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications this
month.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the cable will use Nortel X/40 SDH
(synchronous digital hierarchy) microwave equipment, and will be
accessible to broad-band and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode)
services.
</P>
<P>
The SDH installation project will start in the first quarter of
1997, and will be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Nortel SDH system will add 22,600 lines to the cable's
capacity, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Nortel used its SDH system for an optical cable
between Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, and Wuhan, and the
company has got SDH orders from nine provinces and autonomous
regions, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Sichuan, Fujian and
Guangxi.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tennis Open Forced to Restage Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Tennis Association
on Thursday has to restage the men's draw for next week's
U.S. Open after many players complained about the draw results.
</P>
<P>
The tournament Wednesday announced men's seedings that did not
match tour rankings, drawing questions and anger from some
players, it was reported by AP today.
</P>
<P>
``After talking to players, agents and a variety of interested
and informed people, we have decided to redo the draw, but not
change any of the seedings,'' USTA president Les Snyder said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report from AP, other officials said they did
not know which players protested.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Muster of Austria, ranked second by the ATP Tour, was
seeded third behind American Michael Chang, and perennial favorite
Andre Agassi of the United States was moved up one place.
</P>
<P>
The problem concerned perceptions the seedings may have been
done after the draw, which would be a rule violation, said another
USTA official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Taxi Drivers Promise to Deliver Top Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Refusing to accept a passenger,
overcharging, and keeping the change after being paid -- Beijing's
taxi drivers have pledged to avoid these three practices, thanks
to the local authorities' commitment to better services.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey show that more than 90 percent of drivers are
honoring the pledges they made on July 1, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
Both Beijingers and travellers to the capital city are
benefiting from the Beijing Municipal Taxi Administration's three
pledges program.
</P>
<P>
Some drivers are now taking the initiative to ask the
customers' advice about the route, giving up the habit of charging
more by taking the longest route possible, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Taxi business has grown fast in Beijing, which now has a fleet
of 64,000 sedans, minibuses and medium-sized buses, serving more
than 10 million residents and travellers.
</P>
<P>
Local taxi authorities hope that the three pledges will not
only strengthen taxi drivers' self-restraint but will also raise
passengers' consciousness as to their rights.
</P>
<P>
The city's 1,400 taxi companies, employing about 85,000
drivers, have asked their employees to act according to the poster
pasted on the back of each taxi: "On taxi ride, one piece of
love."

<HEADLINE> Cement-maker Sets Output Record, But Profits Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 23 (Xinhua) -- Huaxin Cement Co Ltd, one of the
country's major cement producers, set an output record in the
first half of the year, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, although the company, based in Huangshi, Hubei
Province, earned a profit of 23 million yuan, it was nearly eight
percent less than earned in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop to the sharp price hike of raw
materials and increases in the bills owed by customers.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, with the introduction of a fourth
kiln, the company produced 493,400 tons of cement and 459,800 tons
of grog (an intermediate product in the making of cement) during
the first half of this year, 30,100 tons of cement and 128,000
tons of grog more than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
High-grade cement made up nearly 70 percent of all output,
reflecting an improvement in the company's product structure.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures failed to fulfill annual planning goals
because of a seasonal slump in the cement market.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that demand for cement will boom in the
coming months as optimistic economic prospects are likely to give
a shot in the arm to infrastructural construction.
</P>
<P>
To take that opportunity, the company will increase its efforts
to improve its marketing.
</P>
<P>
Until then, it will make full use of new production lines to
fulfill annual targets while preparing for a better start next
year.
</P>
<P>
A fifth kiln will be built this year, while several other
technical renovations are being carried out, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The company also intends to explore more overseas markets, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, Huaxin exported 22,500 tons
of cement and 10,800 tons of grog, mostly to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Huaxin, with a total asset of 963 million yuan, is one of the
country's big four cement makers. Its B shares are listed on the
Shanghai exchange.
</P>
<P>
China has been the world's largest cement producer since the
mid-1980s. In 1995, the country's annual cement output hit 460
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The volume is expected to expand in the next five years to meet
the demand for the country's key projects -- expressways, ports,
airports, power stations and buildings.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Shows Evidence for Diplomatic Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban foreign ministry today
showed evidence for its expulsion of a Havana-based American
diplomat last week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol showed the press
some books and pocket folders distributed by Robin Meyer who had
been the second secretary of the U.S. Interests Section.
</P>
<P>
Among the publications was one entitled "Guide of Resources for
the Transition in Cuba" which was described as destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
Meyer left Cuba on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba rejects destabilizing activities by diplomats from any
foreign country, the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
The United States expelled a Cuban diplomat on Monday in
retaliation for Cuba's expulsion of Meyer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said that it was taking reciprocal
action against Jose Luis Ponce Caraballo, a diplomat accredited to
the Cuban Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in Washington.
The Cuban diplomat will be required to leave the United States
within a week.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cuba and the United States worsened early
this year when U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the
Helms-Burton bill that strengthened the 35-year U.S. embargo
against Cuba by penalizing foreigners who invest in the Caribbean
island nation.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Rises Against Mark on German Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rallied against
the deutsche mark and most other currencies today after Germany's
central bank made a surprisingly large cut in an important
short-term interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The cut in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase or repo rate,
from 3.30 percent to 3 percent, was aimed at stimulating the
growth of Europe's biggest economy. It was the first decrease in
German rates in four months.
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread expectations that the rate would be
reduced because German growth remains slow and inflation is kept
low.
</P>
<P>
Traders immediately sold marks and bought dollars after the
decision was released.
</P>
<P>
The dollar once hit a high of 1.4960 marks today, the strongest
level since July 16. At closing of the market in New York, the
dollar traded at 1.4918 marks, up from 1.4825 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar traded at 108.20 yen, down from 108.46 Wednesday,
partly because the Japanese currency also rebounded against the
mark on the Bundesbank's decision.
</P>
<P>
Slower money-supply growth diminishes inflationary pressure,
which is the central bank's primary concern.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose today as
technology shares rebounded and an interest rate cut in Germany
lifted European markets.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 43.65 to 5,733.47, its
best finish since July 1 and its biggest advance since August 2.
The Dow is now within 55 points of an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume totaling 354.49
million shares, up from 348.74 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.61 to 358.72, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.60 to 670.67.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.07 to 1,143.91, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 2.64 to 560.32.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed much of the market's strength to news the
German central bank lowered a key interest rate, a surprisingly
large cut aimed at stimulating Europe's biggest economy. The
Bundesbank's action prompted central banks in Belgium and France
to lower their lending rates as well.
</P>
<P>
U.S. stocks were higher despite another weak day in the bond
market where the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.84
percent, up from 6.83 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco shares were pressured again by late Wednesday's news
that rules allowing the Food and Drug Administration to regulate
nicotine as an addictive drug could be announced by President Bill
Clinton as early as Friday. It could be the nation's toughest
crackdown on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Among Nasdaq technology issues, Dell Computer, Intel and Cisco
Systems advanced. IBM, the only technology component of the Dow,
was one of the biggest gainers in the blue-chip average. The Dow
also drew support from its three oil stocks: Texaco, Chevron, and
Exxon.

<HEADLINE> SADC Approves Draft for Elimination of Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today achieved a major step toward
regional integration by approving a draft protocol to eliminate
trade barriers between its member states.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement, signed by the ongoing SADC Council of
Ministers meeting in Lesotho's capital of Maseru, ended more than
two years of negotiations, according to a statement issued by the
ongoing SADC ministrial meeting.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the draft agreement was to enhance economic
development, diversification and industrialization in the region,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The draft would be presented to the SADC's Heads of State and
Government summit for approval and official signing. The annual
summit was scheduled in Maseru on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Once signed, SADC members would begin to work on a schedule
for the phased reduction of tariffs on various goods, a move
expected to take about six months.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the preparation of schedules would be
followed by a ratification process, which was expected to take
another six months.
</P>
<P>
The protocol would become effective after being ratified by at
least two thirds of the SADC's 12 member states.
</P>
<P>
The regional group comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> 1st Medical Cargo Plane Arrives in Burundi After Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The first cargo plane carrying
medical aid materials arrived in Burundi's capital Bujumbura today
after an embargo was imposed by the neighbors of the central
African state a month ago, a Paris-based humanitarian group said.
</P>
<P>
The plane left France today under arrangements of Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF) and another French humanitarian group
Medecins du Monde (MDM) with 25 tons of medicines and medical
equipment on board, said Annick Hamel, head of the MDM mission in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"This aid is destined to health centers and hospitals in four
provinces of the country. Presently, the stocks of medicines are
reduced and the stocks of others such as anti-malarial and
anti-biotics are running out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has demanded a control of the cargo
before the cargo plane left for Burundi, and the MDM has followed
the order, said Hamel.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring countries of Burundi, which imposed the
sanctions on July 25, agreed last week to let medical aid into the
country, but restricted aid of food to refugee camps sheltering
Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi.

<HEADLINE> New Safety Child Car Seat Brought to US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading car seat
manufacturer has entered the U.S. market, offering new patented
products and a unique distribution process focused on safety.
</P>
<P>
Britax Child Safety Inc. established headquarters for U.S.
operations in Fort Mill, South California, and began distribution
in June. The company has sold its products in Europe and Australia
for more than 25 years. In addition to meeting U.S. safety
requirements, Britax's products meet European standards, which
include safety requirements not addressed by U.S. regulations,
according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Retailers must sign contracts with the company for guaranteed
right installation methods.
</P>
<P>
Britax also makes the back seat of a vehicle available to
retailers for in-store use in teaching the consumer actual
installation techniques.
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of car seats are installed incorrectly," said
Bob Bell, president of Britax Child Safety Inc. "No child is safe
in a poorly installed seat of any kind."
</P>

The company's seat has a patented lock-off clamp that allows
parents to install the car seat tightly into the vehicle. The
invention does away with the need for so called locking clips,
cumbersome attachments to car seats that serve to tighten the seat
belts to the seats.

Bell said Britax recently partnered with Mercedes-Benz to
create a child safety seat for the new Mercedes-Benz SLK. The
seat contains a special detector that when installed in the SLK
roadster shuts off the passenger side airbag. Children in child
seats, especially rear-facing, should otherwise never be placed in
a front passenger seat equipped with an airbag.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 in the United States alone, passenger side airbags
are known to have killed over 20 children, some of which were in
rear-facing car seats.

<HEADLINE> East Slavonian Serbs Urge Normal Yugoslavia-Croatia Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 22 (Xinhua) -- President of Eastern Slavonia
Goran Hadzic said today the normalization of relations between
Yugoslavia and Croatia offered great prospects for a peaceful
solution in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hadzic said the region, which was placed under a U.N.
Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia in January, had to
be part of the normalization of relations between Serbs and
Croats, as that would help open the doors for it to the rest of
Europe and the world.
</P>
<P>
East Slavonia is the only part of the Republic of Serb Krajina
that was not occupied by Croatian government troops a year ago.
But according to an agreement reached by the local Serbs and
Croatia last November, the Serb-held region will be reverted to
the government's control next year.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Croatia are expected to sign an agreement to
normalize their relations Friday, which is regarded by the West
as a most crucial step towards a lasting peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"We must in no way hinder the move of normalization," the
Tanjug news agency quoted Hadzic as telling the local press in
Erdut, the administrative center of Eastern Slavonia.

WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine F/A-18 fighter
attack plane crashed in the Atlantic off the Virginia coast today,
military sources said.

told reporters, adding that the investigation is under way.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Croatia, Yugoslavia to Establish Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic will visit Belgrade Friday to sign an agreement on
establishing diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY), the Croatian Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Granic announced the visit during a
meeting with members of foreign diplomatic missions in Zagreb and
briefed them on the accord that he and his Yugoslav counterpart
are expected to sign.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic met in Athens and agreed in principle
to normalize relations between Croatia and the FRY which were main
republics of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It then took several rounds of intense negotiations for the two
countries to iron out remaining disputes concerning issues such as
Eastern Slavonia, the Prevlaka Peninsula, the old Yugoslav debt
and those missing in the war fought between Croatia and the
FRY-backed Serbs.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether those thorny issues have all
been solved or some of them have simply been set aside for further
negotiation later.

<HEADLINE> France Promises to Help Cote d'Ivoire Maintain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- France today promised to support
Cote d'Ivoire in fighting drug and arms trafficking and in
preventing the war in neighboring Liberia from spreading to other
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire this week, French
Defense Minister Charles Millon said the military restructuring
program at home will not reduce its military presence in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of going home for the French troops
stationed in Africa," said Millon during a meeting with his
Ivorian counterpart, Vincent Bandama N'Gatta, in Abidjan,
according to a report by Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
President of Cote d'Ivoire Henri Konan Bedie expressed his
worry over the possibility of withdrawal by France of part of its
troops from Africa, which is continuously tormented by regional
wars and tribal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Bedie said that since a bloody war is raging in Liberia 500
kilometers from the border of his country, Cote d'Ivoire is deeply
worried about the aggravating drug and arms trafficking which
resulted from the war.
</P>
<P>
He called on France to help train the Ivorian armed forces and
improve their combat readiness by sending transport and
communication logistics.
</P>
<P>
Millon promised that France will send army equipment to be made
available by the military restructuring and professionalizing
programs of the French army in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
France maintains military cooperation treaties with seven
African and Indian Ocean countries. France can carry out military
interventions with its forces stationed in Africa or with troops
to be sent from home.
</P>
<P>
France has 2,800 troops in Djibouti, 1,400 in the Central
African Republic, 1,300 in Senegal, 800 in Chad, 600 in Gabon and
500 in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
French troops helped suppress a mutiny against President
Ange-Felix Patasse in the Central African Republic in May.
