<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 816,503
registered electors cast their ballots in the first District
Councils election of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The election scored a record high turnout rate of 35.82
percent, nearly 2.7 percentage points higher than the 33.13
percent in the 1994 election of the district boards. Compared with
the 1994 polls, 120,000 more voters cast their ballots on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The election was conducted in an atmosphere of openness,
fairness and justice," Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong
Kong SAR, told a press conference late in the evening immediately
after voting ended. "We think the election is a success," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The first District Councils election is of special
significance," Tung said. "The District Councils will play a more
important role in supervising the civil work and communicating the
government with the public."
</P>
<P>
"The government will be more active to cooperate and
communicate with the District Councils," he said, adding that he
believed the District Councils would do more work in terms of
sports and culture than the previous District Boards.
</P>
<P>
David Lan, secretary for home affairs, also said he is pleased
with the results of the election.
</P>
<P>
"With regards to the pace of democratization, I think all I
would like to say is that we have a timetable, a proper timetable
set out in the Basic Law that is really for the Legco election,"
Lan said. "We would certainly go along with what is laid down in
the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
From the early morning till late night, 432 polling stations in
18 districts across Hong Kong opened for 15 hours for voters.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 798 candidates running for the election, 722
competed for 314 seats and the other 76 have been elected
uncontested.
</P>
<P>
Each constituency, which has a population of around 17,000
people, will return one District Council member.
</P>
<P>
There will be a total of 519 District Council members, of which
390 will be elected members, 27 ex-officio members and 102
appointed members.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Affairs Commission set up the hotline to receive
public complaints about breaches of the Electoral Guidelines. The
commission will continue to receive complaints in the next 45 days
after the polls ended.
</P>
<P>
Woo Kwok Hing, chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commissions,
said his commission has received some 1,415 complaints Sunday
which are mainly concerned with triflings like canvassing and
posters, and electoral officers gave immediate settlement.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Issue Is Russia's Internal Affair: Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov underlined here Sunday that the issue of Chechnya is an
internal affair of Russia and Russia's operations are against
terrorists, not Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, Ivanov also denied any attacks on
Chechnya and massacre of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Before anything else it should be said that no such attacks
have been or can be made on Chechnya because the territory is part
of the Russian Federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to such allegations, he said, terrorist attacks have
been launched from Chechnya on Daghistan and terrorist operations
conducted by bandits in Moscow and other Russian cities have
claimed lives of more than 1,500 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Russian operations are not against Muslims,
but terrorists, irrespective of their nationality or religious
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Presently, major parts of the region are controlled by Russian
Federal forces and normalcy is returning to the region, he
said. He also expressed welcome to a delegation from the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to Moscow to follow
up the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that during his one-day stay in Tehran, he
conveyed a message of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to his
Iranian counterpart Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Russia should be considered as reliable neighbors,
friends and colleagues in the 21st century, therefore
understanding between Iranian and Russian officials at this
juncture is of high significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi told the press conference that he
proposed a visit of OIC delegation to Moscow to discuss the
Chechen issue and Ivanov promised to convey the proposal to
the Russian cabinet soon.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Tehran's readiness to provide humanistic
assistance to Chechen refugees who fled their hometowns during
recent Russian military operations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Iran think that Caucasus should be a region of
peace, security and cooperation, Kharrazi said, adding that the
two countries have held elaborate talks on the issue and believe
that all countries of the region, including Iran and Russia,
should have closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran and Moscow are against transformation of
the Caucasus into a scene of clashes and fighting and the zone of
influence for other countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that he and his Russian counterpart also
exchanged views on the developments in Tajikistan, Afghanistan,
the Caucasus and the recent events in Armenia and the Caspian Sea
legal regime.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Bissau Holds Second Multi-Party Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Guinea Bissau people are
voting Sunday for a new president and parliament in the second
multi-party elections designed to return the west African country
to civilian rule, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve candidates are vying for presidency to succeed Joao
Bernardo Vieira, who won the last elections in 1994 but was
toppled by former Army Chief of Staff General Ansumane Mane in May
this year.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen political parties, including the African Party for the
 Independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC) which had
ruled the country since independence from Portugal in 1974, are
contesting 102 seats in the new national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The leading candidates in the presidential poll are the current
acting President Malam Bacai Sanha, who has the support of the
former ruling PAIGC party, and Koumba Yalla of the Party for
Social Renovation, a popular opposition figure who only narrowly
lost the 1994 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The only woman candidate is Antonieta Rosa Gomes of the Guinean
Social Democratic Civic Forum.
</P>
<P>
More than 525,000 of the country's 1.1 million population are
eligible to vote in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Neither Vieira who lives in exile in Portugal nor junta leader
Mane who took up arms in June 1998 after Vieira sacked him as army
chief are contesting the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has organized the elections which are being
supervised by some 100 international observers.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday appealed to all
parties involved in the electoral process in Guinea Bissau,
"including the military" to work for "free, fair, transparent and
interference-free elections."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Charged with Election Funds Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) - Ophir Pines-Paz, whip of
Israeli Labor party, accused on Sunday that former Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and the Likud party were guilty of violating
election campaign funds regulations in the general election last
May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the Knesset (Parliament),
Pines-Paz called on the state comptroller to launch an immediate
investigation into these violations, Israeli Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Pines-Pas said he has evidence which shows that the officials
in Netanyahu's office illegally siphoned public funds for
financing the Likud's publicizing.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that both Netanyahu and the Likud received
funding forbidden by the election laws which stipulate domestic
donations total no more than NIS 1,700 (400 U.S. dollars) per
voter, with no overseas contributions permitted.
</P>
<P>
The Likud denied the allegation and claimed that Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and his One Israel coalition are only
trying to cover up their own election funds violations.
</P>
<P>
In September, Netanyahu was charged with illegally keeping
dozens of valuable gifts, which he received while he was in power
from 1996 to 1999. He was also in suspect of billing the
government for his private house service in the three years of
his office.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Official Defends Action to Streamline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Interior Minister
Nayef al-Kadi Sunday defended the government's action to deport
illegal workers to streamline the labor markets of the desert
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official news agency Petra, Kadi
said the government must take the step because at least one
million Arab and foreign workers are working in the country, but
only ten percent of them have obtained valid work permits and
residence cards.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry started a nationwide inspection drive
earlier this month to check illegal workers in cooperation with
the Labor Ministry and the Public Security Department of the
police.
</P>
<P>
The authorities concerned had conducted similar checks on
illegal workers in May this year and in December of 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government deported some 250,000 illegal
workers during the first 10 months of this year, most of whom are
Egyptians, according to statistics by the police.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor is also implementing articles of the
Labor Law to force local employers to obtain work permits for
their foreign workers, or to face fines.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the foreign workers are Egyptians, whose
number was estimated at 250,000, then followed by workers from
Syria, Iraq and other Asian and African countries.
</P>
<P>
The government measure to deport illegal workers are also
aimed at bringing down the unemployment rate among Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics put the unemployment rate at some 10
percent, while independent estimates still stood at over 20
percent.

<HEADLINE> 8 Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S. Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Eight Iraqi civilians
including three children were injured Sunday when U.S. and British
warplanes attacked a primary school in northern Iraq's Mosul city,
an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:05 a.m. (0805 GMT), nine
formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from the Turkish
airspace made 18 sorties over northern Iraq's Dohuk, Erbil and
Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed a primary school in Mosul, the
capital city of Neineva, leading to the injury of eight civilians
and severe damage to the school, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bombardment also destroyed two cars and
some surrounding houses.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi air defenses fired back at the enemy planes
and repulsed them to their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He also said 17 formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming
from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases on Saturday evening made 52 sorties
over most southern Iraqi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 16,031 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targetted regularly Iraqi civilian and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south "against attacks by Iraqi government troops."
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, regarding them
as unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain as they are not
covered directly by any U.N. Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> Violence Occurs During Election Campaign in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Violence broke out in central
Zambezia Province Saturday when Afonso Dhlakama, presidential
candidate of former rebel Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo),
took his election campaign to the district of Maganja da Costa.
</P>
<P>
Radio Mozambique reported Sunday that Renamo security guards
attacked a group of supporters of the ruling Mozambique Liberation
Front Party (Frelimo) who were waving placards with the portrait
of Dhlakama's rival, incumbent President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
According to a local Frelimo official, the Renamo security men
smashed their way into the building, broke down interior doors and
beat up anyone they could lay hands on. Seven people were injured
in this rampage
</P>
<P>
The local head of the Renamo mobilization department, Paulo
Guerra, said that he had not ordered the beating. It was the work
of "the people" who objected to the victim tearing down portraits
of Dhlakama, he added.
</P>
<P>
There were also violent incidents Saturday in Nhamatanda, in
the neighboring province of Sofala, where Renamo supporters beat
up a Frelimo parliamentary candidate. The police arrested two
after the violence.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Zimbabwe to Show Commitment to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has to show a national
 commitment to the Economic Structural Adjustment Program for it
to be successful, the World Bank said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwean government should come up with its programs
because if it did not have a national vision, it was bound to
lose," Rogier Van den Brink, deputy World Bank representative in
Zimbabwe, said in a paper presented to a conference of the
Institute of Administration and Commerce of Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
While hailing Harare's action plan aimed at restoring stability
and growth and reducing poverty, Brink noted it is unfortunate
that the action plan has not yet been approved by the World Bank
board as it looks up to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF has placed under review its 193-million-U.S. dollar
rescue package for Zimbabwe agreed in August this year,
effectively halting any further disbursement of aid under the
14-month plan because the Zimbabwean government had failed to meet
economic targets agreed by the institution.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the IMF stopped the aid because Harare misled
it on war bill.
</P>
<P>
But Brink said that "the Democratic Republic of the Congo issue
is not a major sticking point."
</P>
<P>
He added that a lot of other issues like fiscal deficit and
exchange rate should be determined by market.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank supported Zimbabwe's land reform program because
it made economic, social and political sense, Brink said, urging
Zimbabweans not to look for a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
The bank earlier this month signed a five-million-dollar credit
deal to finance the resettlement program in the southern African
country.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Hsing-Hsing Dies in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Hsing-Hsing, the only giant
panda in the U.S. National Zoo, died here Sunday, a zoo official
announced.
</P>
<P>
Hsing-Hsing was put to sleep at around 7 a.m. by injection
after suffering from kidney disease for 6 months, said Bob Hoage,
chief of the zoo's public relations department.
</P>
<P>
The panda was becoming increasingly weak and inactive in recent
days and zoo officials determined that it was impossible for him
to maintain his quality of life, he said.
</P>
<P>
"His system has failed and his eyesight has got very weak for
the last week, the keeper feels very sad, so it is best to put him
to sleep," Bob said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sad to announce the news, he has been loved by
millions of visitors," Bob added.
</P>
<P>
"His death is like the passing of a close friend," said
National Zoo director Michael Robinson.
</P>
<P>
The panda was 28, an advanced age for the rare animal. Hsing-
Hsing was discovered to have non-reversible kidney disease last
May.
</P>
<P>
Hsing-Hsing's death leaves only five giant pandas in American
zoos, three in San Diego and two that arrived earlier this month
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Hsing-Hsing and his mate Ling-Ling came to the National Zoo
from Beijing in 1972, a gift from the Chinese government following
President Nixon's visit to China that year.
</P>
<P>
The two produced five offspring, but none lived longer than
four days. Ling-Ling died of heart failure in 1992 at age 23.
</P>
<P>
Bob said the zoo is still in negotiation with the Chinese
authorities to get a pair of new giant pandas from China.
</P>
<P>
"We have very good facilities for giant pandas in the zoo," Bob
said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Congratulates Jiang Zemin on Spaceship Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
sent a message to Chinese President Jiang Zemin to congratulate
China on the successfully launch of the "Shenzhou" automatic
spaceship, said the Russian Presidential Press Service on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is pleased by successes of friendly China in the high-
tech aerospace sphere and wishes new achievements to Your country,
" Yeltsin said in the message.
</P>
<P>
China successfully launched its first experimental spacecraft
several days ago. The spacecraft and carrier rocket were made by
China itself.
</P>
<P>
The launch was part of the country's manned space flight
program. The space vehicle, named "Shenzhou" by President Jiang
Zemin, was launched with a new model of "Long March" rocket on
November 20 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest
China's Gansu Province and landed smoothly in the central Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China the next day.
</P>
<P>
As another milestone in China's astronautical history, the
successful launching and retrieval of the spaceship marks the
country's new major breakthrough in manned space flight technology.
</P>
<P>
Manned space flight technology is the most difficult one in the
aerospace area. In the past, the United States and Russia were the
only countries that had this technology.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng, Barak Hold Talks on Bilateral Ties, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 28 (Xinhua) -- As a big country in the
world, China plays an important role in world affairs and Israel
looks to further enhance Sino-Israeli cooperation in all fields,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks in talks with Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, who
arrived here Thursday on a week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit to Israel is a big event in our relations and I
believe the visit will further strengthen the existing friendly
relationship between our countries," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
To promote bilateral relations is the common desire of the
Israeli and Chinese peoples and the Chinese side will try its best
to strengthen the relations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Israel attachs great importance to the Sino-Israeli ties and
Israel will adopt a more open policy to share with China Israel's
technology and management experience, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Israel also hopes to strengthen contacts with China not only at
the governmental level, but at provincial levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Barak also spoke highly of the progress China has made in the
past 50 years, particularly since China adopted the opening-up
policy 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Barak briefed Li on the development in the Mideast peace
process, saying that he will continue the peace policy of former
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and push the process forward.
</P>
<P>
"During the election campaign in May, I promised to the whole
nation that I will achieve peace with all neighbors. This promise
was painful, but a serious one," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has made some progress, but still faces some
difficulties, Li said. But he stressed that China sincerely hopes
the Israeli-Palestinian talks achieve results.
</P>
<P>
Peace is beneficial to all countries in the region and an early
solution to the Middle East issue will contribute a great deal to
the world peace and development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the Middle East issue is not so easy, so it needs the
leaders of all countries in this region to make political
decisions in order to realize a lasting peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on how to strengthen
economic cooperation between the two countries, particularly in
the fields of agriculture, science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Unified Tariffs Agreed, Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the six Gulf
Arab states have agreed to unify their tariffs and decided to
put off the establishment of a Gulf common market for four
years, a senior diplomat announced here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal told a press conference
Sunday afternoon that the six Gulf leaders have reached the
agreement in their 20th annual meeting within the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) being held in the Saudi capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, tariffs on a total of 1289 kinds
of imported goods in the six GCC members, namely Bahrain, Qatar,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, will be
classified into three categories: 0 percent, 5.5 percent and 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
No details of the classification were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the six GCC member states will put off the targeted
date for the establishment of a common market, initially set at
March 2001, to March 2005.
</P>
<P>
After the GCC finance ministers had failed to reach a consensus
 on the establishment of a customs union earlier this month, GCC
Secretary General Jameel al-Hujailan said he hoped the issue would
finally be resolved at the Riyadh summit.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers had, at that time, agreed upon items
to be included in the united tariffs but difference remained
over the ceiling of the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which has the lowest tariffs among the six GCC
members, was concerned that a unified tariff that is higher than
its current customs level will impair its bid to attract foreign
investment. It has asked for various forms of compensation if it
has to raise its customs to a higher GCC unified tariff.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries have been trying since 1983 to unify
their customs duties, which now vary between 4 percent, in the
UAE, and 20 percent, in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
They initially agreed in their 19th summit, held in the UAE
capital Abu Dhabi in 1989, to set March 1, 2001 as the target date
for a customs union, aimed eventually at establishing a Gulf
common market with an annual import of more than 50 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The six oil-rich Gulf states are in the hope that a closer
economic alliance will enable them to compete with other powerful
world economic blocs like the European Union (EU) in an
increasingly globlized world economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a common market with a unified tariff is a
precondition set by the EU, the GCC's biggest trade partner, for a
trade agreement with the GCC.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls on Political Factions to Close Ranks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday called on all political parties and factions to
close their ranks in order to achieve a free and fair
parliamentary elections in February.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we should hold free and fair elections and what I
recommend is solidarity and honoring commitment to the common
principles as well as giving preference to efficiency and
experience (of the candidates)," he said in a meeting with a group
of moderate Majlis (parliament) deputies.
</P>
<P>
He said that tranquility and calm atmosphere is required for
the Majlis elections, adding that "we should work to promote the
people's power of choice, any action bringing tense situation will
not serve the interests of the country."
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret with the imprisonment of Abdollah Nouri,
one of his close allies, saying that "it seems that we have been
deprived of an experienced and competent colleague."
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that during later stages of legal
proceeding and given all aspects of the issue, the country could
benefit from Nouri's services more than before.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, Khatami's former interior minister and vice president
for development and social affairs, was jailed on Saturday soon
after the conservative Special Cleric Court sentenced him to five
years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
As managing director of the Persian language daily Khordad,
Nouri was also sentenced to five years of dismissal from his post
and a cash fine of 15 million rials (5,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He was accused of publishing anti-religious materials and
sacrilegious articles, insulting the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and opposing his views and opinions,
disseminating false ideas aimed at disturbing public opinion and
harming others, misinforming the country's system and insulting
the system's officials and related organs.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council elections
last February, stepped down in September from his post as the
chairman of Tehran City Council to run for the parliament and many
moderate factions have announced him as the candidate for the
future Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
The trial and sentence on Nouri was widely believed here as a
move by the powerful conservatives for his disqualification from
forthcoming Majlis elections.
</P>
<P>
The influential reformist Constructive Executives of Iran Party
on Sunday lodged a protest at the ruling against Nouri and called
for its revocation.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami underlined that all political parties should
put forward their views, saying that expression of transparent
views by political parties would serve to boost the level of
public thought.
</P>
<P>
"All those people who are not after toppling the Islamic
Republic (of Iran) and favor progress of the country should be
respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian head of state noted that "we should work to find
common ground between different political parties to pave the way
for attaining the lofty goals of the Islamic Republic and focus
our potentials on this purpose."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the different expression of views result in
reaction other than debate and exchange of views, it would be
detrimental to the country and the Islamic Republic system.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The Food-for-Work program
financed by the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) in the
southern Mozambican provinces of Maputo and Gaza has had a
"positive impact" in reducing vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
A visiting WFP assessment mission said that some of the
micro-project undertaken as part of the food-for-work scheme have
contributed significantly to improving living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has supported a number of community-based integrated
development projects in order to mitigate natural disasters,
improve access to health, education and clean water, and raise
food production, the Mozambique News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The projects involve repairing or building schools and clinics,
 rehabilitating roads, opening drainage systems to evacuate storm
water from farming lands, amongst others.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for working on these projects, local residents
receive food from the WFP. The food provided consists of maize
and beans.
</P>
<P>
The WFP support has been an incentive for poor strata of the
population to undertake activities which, in the long run, will be
to their own benefit.
</P>
<P>
The micro-projects form part of the WFP program for Mozambique
for the period from 1998 to 2001, during which over 311,000 people
will receive assistance.

</P>
<P>

Some 180 million U.S. dollars of the kingdom`s 720 million
dollars of foreign debts are owed to Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Proposal On Iraqi Embargo Top Moscow Talks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tareq Aziz said on Sunday that he would discuss with Russian
officials the U.N. Security Council's latest debate on the British
proposal on Iraq during his December visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We will express our opinions frankly and clearly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters that his upcoming visit to Moscow was
arranged several weeks ago and fell within the framework of
exchanging opinions between friends.
</P>
<P>
Aziz expressed hope that Russia, one of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, would help Iraq to take a solid
stand on the British proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have recently been pushing for the
adoption of a British-Dutch proposal, which recommends a
conditional suspension of the sanctions if Iraq agrees to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors to return to the country and cooperate
with them, and put its oil revenues under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Reports from New York indicate that the U.S. and Britain are
pushing for a Security Council voting on the British proposal
before completing the discussion of its content, which proves that
they want to practicize conspiracy and intrigues against Iraq, said
Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposal is mere a propaganda campaign aimed
at deceiving the international public opinion, because the
U.S. and Britain feel increasingly embarrassed at the continuation
of the unjust embargo on Iraq though it has cooperated with the
Security Council for nine years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The professional and accurate reading of the British proposal
will lead to the conclusion that it will not lead to the lifting,
or even suspension of the sanctions on Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly declared its rejection to the proposal,
saying it will not accept any U.N. resolution that falls short of
total and comprehensive lifting of the sanctions imposed on it in
1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
ROME, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi will begin a two-day official visit to Spain on Monday,
where he will meet King Juan Carlos and Premier Jose' Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi's visit aims to consolidate Italy's political, cultural
and economic relations with Spain, continuing the long list of
official contacts between the countries recently.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of talks will be European Union enlargement,
a theme expected to dominate the Helsinki summit of EU leader on
December 11 and 12.
</P>
<P>
Madrid's position is more cautious than Italy's, especially
with regard to the scale of reform needed in EU institutions to
accompany the entry of new member countries.
</P>
<P>
Spain is also against fixing a date for the entry of new
members -a point of view reiterated by Aznar in a meeting on last
Friday with Finnish Premier Paavo Lipponen, currently the EU's
duty president.
</P>
<P>
Through his meetings over the two days, Ciampi is expected to
push for further Italo-Spanish cooperation in the Mediterranean
area and in moves to establish a common European defense policy
and identity.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes after the Spanish king's visit to Italy in
September 1998 and Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema's visit to
Madrid two months later.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Rejects Joint Border Protection With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday reiterated Tbilisi's rejection of a joint
protection of its borders with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the passage of Russian troops through
Georgian territory, saying such a step might trigger "a global
conflict in the Caucasus," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops are in the middle of a major campaign against
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, which borders
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, with almost no control over the Chechen section of its
borders with Georgia, has called for a joint protection of the
border to prevent rebels and weapons from flowing into the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Shevardnadze said the joint protection of the border"
would be a mistake in the military, political and even strategic
aspects."
</P>
<P>
"It might entail tragic consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military campaign in Chechnya has entered the
eighth week and authorities said the troops are at the third stage
aimed at flushing out the rebels in southern regions and secure
control of the section of the border with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"If it is done, we would hail such actions and cooperate with
the Russian side," Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
While characterizing Russian actions in Chechnya as justifiable,
Shevardnadze said hostilities there were hurting Georgia's ties
with Moscow. "The Chechen events complicated everything."
</P>
<P>
He said Georgia's position in relation to Chechnya is dictated
by a need for proper relations with all neighboring peoples. "We
must think not only about today but about the next generation, "
Shevardnadze said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia itself is also conducting and will continue to conduct
a relentless struggle against terrorists, including Chechen ones,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Over 23,000 Russians Registered as HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, is increasingly ominous, Onishchenko
told a news conference held on the eve of the World AIDS Day,
which falls on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Russia saw the fastest increase in HIV infection in the past
three years, with intravenous drug use blamed as the main culprit.
Therefore, the fight against drug abuse is closely linked to
Russia's efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS, Onishchenko said.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection has now been reported in 88 of Russia's 89
administrative regions, but the only "untouched area" of Buryat-
Aginsky Autonomous District may also fall victim soon as AIDS is
rampant in neighboring regions, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and the surrounding regions have the largest
concentration of HIV carriers, accounting for about half of the
newly registered cases in the first nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12,500 people were registered as being infected with
HIV during that period.
</P>
<P>
Other regions with the high incidence of HIV infection were
Kaliningrad, 2,589 cases, Krasnodar, 2,160 cases, Irkutsk, 2,191
cases, Rostov 1,549 cases, and Tver, 1,446 cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chief representatives of both
sides of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached
consensus on two key issues concerning Macao after a 2.5-hour
meeting here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
One issue is about the detailed arrangement of stationing
Chinese troops in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) as
soon as China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The other issue is related to the official use of Chinese and
Portuguese in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, and his Portuguese counterpart Santana Carlos
expressed satisfaction with their achievements at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said the achievements would be favorable to resolving the
remaining questions in Macao's transitional period and ensuring
its steady transition and smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
However, the two chief representatives did not reveal the
details of the issues.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that both sides reached consensus on the two issues
demonstrates the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal
in handling the questions concerning Macao," Han Zhaokang said.

He also described it as "a giant step forward in the journey
toward peace."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Delaying Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Umid
Medhat Mubarak on Monday again lashed out at U.S. and British
efforts to block its contracts under the oil-for-food program,
calling the attempts as "political bankruptcy."
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Monday, the
minister said Washington and London are still creating pretexts to
hamper the delivery of medicine and other basic necessities to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and British representatives at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee have recently obstructed the approval of a number of
medical contracts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a source with the Trade Ministry said the
U.S. representatives at the Sanctions Committee have put on hold
another 12 new contracts concluded under the fifth and sixth
phase of the oil deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoys did this during the committee's sessions held
on November 17 and November 19, and the contracts were for the
purchases of trucks, pumps, spare parts, oil tankers, machinery
and generators, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were concluded with companies of France,
Germany, China, Denmark, Egypt, Jordan, Austria and Lebanon, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Under its oil deal with the U.N., Iraq is allowed to sell
limited amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other infrastructure-related materials for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
The program is now in a two-week extension of its sixth phase,
which expired on November 20.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved on November 19
the two-week extension until December 4 to allow it to reach an
agreement on a new comprehensive policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad rejected the extension and stopped oil export last
week. Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid has said that Iraq would
accept a full six-month extension, or the seventh phase of the
program.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will deal with such a resolution and clarify its
position at the time when it is adopted," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- "Teenagers across the World,
Unite to Protect the Earth!," an 11-year old Chinese girl made the
appeal here today to an international meeting on ozone layer
protection.
</P>
<P>
The exhortation was made by Zhang Yijing, a girl from the
Chongwen Primary School in Beijing, on behalf of teenagers from
200 "hand-in-hand global villages" across China.
</P>
<P>
The villages were set up three years ago by Chinese teenagers
for environmental protection and poverty relief in primary and
middle schools and they are managed by the students themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We found that the Earth is sick following our investigation
into the status of environmental protection. There is also a hole
in the ozone layer over Antarctica," Zhang told nearly 1,000
representatives from some 180 countries, regions, and
organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to make our own contributions to the cause of
environmental protection with our little hands, while leading
experts gathered here to discuss big matters to patch the sky,"
meaning repair the damaged ozone layer, the hole over Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
According to the students' six-point initiative, teenagers
across the world should make their own efforts to protect the
Earth by spreading ozone protection information among their
families, classmates, and community.
</P>
<P>
She said teenagers should also persuade their parents to buy
environment-friendly products.
</P>
<P>
Zhang asked the "ladies and gentlemen" at the 11th Meeting of
the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete
Ozone to join her initiative so as to "save the Earth and leave a
blue sky, clean water, and fresh air to our future generations."
</P>
<P>
Members from the "hand-in-hand global villages" have helped
build one primary school for poor kids in a poor Chinese province
with 200,000 yuan (about 35,000 U.S. dollars) they earned from the
sale of recyclable materials they collected.
</P>
<P>
Her initiative won the applause of the participants.
</P>
<P>
Madhava Sarma, chairman of the meeting and executive secretary
of the Secretariat for the Vienna Convention and the Montreal
Protocol, described the initiative as excellent and offered to
recommend it publication overseas.

<HEADLINE> Russia Chides Camdessus for Statement on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia criticized on Monday
the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for his threat
to withhold loans if Moscow presses ahead with its military
campaign against Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Russia does not share the IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus' concerns over its financing of the anti-terrorist
operation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Finance Minister
Mikhail Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Camdessus' statement last week that the
world body would block the release of another tranche of loans to
Russia before military actions in Chechnya are wrapped up, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We do not quite understand this statement as Russia fully
complies with its obligations," including financing of the North
Caucasus operation, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reasons for political concerns to influence the
fund's decisions," he said, noting that the fund was "a non-
political organization."
</P>
<P>
Russia "timely disburses" payments to the IMF and other
international organizations, Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of Russia's lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, also expressed dissatisfaction over
Camdessus' statement, urging the country to "avoid borrowing from
the IMF," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Monday that the West "continues to exert pressure on
Russia" especially after the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At that summit, Russian President Boris Yeltsin delivered a
forceful rebuff to Western leaders, saying they have "no right to
criticize Russia over Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said Camdessus was "not an independent person" and
that he made the statement under the same Western pressure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> First World "Digital Earth" Conference Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The urgent needs of social
development in China will be the biggest impetus for creating "
Digital Earth," said Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the world's first Symposium on Digital Earth, which
opened in Beijing today, Li said that as the world's largest
developing country, China is playing an important role in global
sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The "Digital Earth" will help promote sustainable growth in
China and in turn contribute to the world's sustainable
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Digital Earth" is the process by which any geographical
location on earth can be digitized and made available for viewing
on the Internet, for either economic or military use.
</P>
<P>
Expertise and hardware needed for launching "Digital Earth"
involve information and space technology and related
infrastructure, among others.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China will expand cooperation with the countries
of the world to play an active role in introducing the concept of
"Digital Earth," sharing information resources, and creating a
digital world.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
and co-sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the
State Development Planning Commission, and other state
organizations.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 scientists and scholars from 25 countries and
regions will be discussing the concept of "Digital Earth" and its
development strategy during the four-day symposium.

<HEADLINE> Long-term Strategic Planning Urged for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government says
short-term problems will continue to hinder development efforts in
Africa if they are not addressed as part of a comprehensive and
coherent long-term strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Valentine Kayope made this
observation when he addressed participants at a seminar on
Integration, Economic and Social Development of Southern Africa
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kayope said it was extremely important for Africa to
anticipate, master and manage those structural changes and to
rethink and redesign national, sub-regional and regional
development strategies and policies.
</P>
<P>
He said under-development of African countries had led to a
rethinking as to whether Africa's problems could be solved under
existing and inherent structural deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
kayope said the serious economic crises and adjustment problems
 experienced by African countries since the mid 1970s had helped
increase awareness among African countries of the need to plan for
a new and better defined vision of the future through national
long-term perspective studies.
</P>
<P>
He said past perspective plans could no longer be used today
because the global environment had changed and new technologies
and stronger alliances were forming outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said long-term planning played a pivotal role in economic
development and growth and urged the participants to take the
exercise seriously.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program country representative
Olubanke King-Akerele called on all Africans to stop practicing
lip service but instead develop and position the continent as time
had run out.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Says No to Labor, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- At the much anticipated
multilateral trade talks in the northwestern U.S. city of Seattle
this week, Thailand, as a major agricultural exporter and a
developing nation, hopes to see an agreement reached to liberalize
agricultural trade, while shunning the labor and environment
issues.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a new round of world trade talks will begin at the
World Trade Organization (WTO) trade ministers' meeting in
Seattle, during which the liberalization of agricultural and
service trade, along with tariff cuts on industrialized products
will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hopes the developed countries will agree in principle
to liberalize agricultural trade at the meeting as an incentive to
persuade developing countries to work on environmental and social
issues.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has been one of the toughest issues in the run-up
to the Seattle meeting, which is scheduled for November
30-December 3.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Thailand and the United States had
discussed a preliminary framework and the prospect of the WTO
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, who will head the WTO in three years, said the
United States should take the leading role in offering benefits to
developing countries, especially in the negotiations on farm and
textile trade.
</P>
<P>
According to Supachai, Washington and the Cairns Group of 15
agricultural exporters, of which Thailand is a member, are
demanding the reduction of subsidies on key farm products, both to
farmers and exporters, and cancellation of quota systems to
prevent price distortion.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU), which accounts for 85 percent of world
subsidies for agricultural exports, is firmly opposed to any
attempt to treat agriculture as a sector for market opening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan also reportedly wants to maintain its
protectionist policies.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has been proved a thorny issue in the previous
Uruguay Round of global trade talks. After a marathon seven years
of negotiations which ended in 1994, the participants agreed to
come back and try again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said Thailand and other developing nations are
unlikely to accept negotiations on environment and labor issues in
the WTO context, as requested by developed members.
</P>
<P>
"If the core labor rights issue is submitted as part of a new
round, I fear that it might have some serious consequences on the
launch of a new round," Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
It might arouse a lot of negative feelings in the majority of
the membership, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the International Labor Organization (ILO)
already looks after labor issues, therefore Thailand disagrees
with the appointment of a working group to study the issue in the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
But he said Thailand might accept the ILO be appointed as an
observer in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the United States has been pushing for labor
issues in the WTO because it has been forced by its civil society
groups while the candidates for the new presidency want to keep
their political base within labor groups.
</P>
<P>
As for the environmental issue, Supachai said there are many
international conventions related to environmental issues so it
would be better to raise the issues under those conventions in the
WTO rather than raise the overall picture related to the
environment in the forum.
</P>
<P>
The WTO leader-in-waiting also said the new round of talks
should address the "imbalance" suffered by developing countries
resulting from last round.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the WTO's 134 members should at least reach a
basic agreement towards a framework for the new round.
</P>
<P>
But he also urged the WTO to give respite to crisis-hit Asian
economies struggling to meet the deadline, saying they might face
problems in meeting commitments they made in the last round of
global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a special session be set up to deal with problems
facing those members reluctant to join the new round of talks.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Health Workers to Be Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Regional Director for Africa of
the World Health Organizations (WHO) Ibraham Samba urged the
agency's health workers on Monday to behave well and be
responsible for their actions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing health officers attending a WHO information and
promotion workshop in Harare, Samba said WHO officers should
always display exceptional behavior when carrying out their duties
as servants of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said one's personality was of paramount importance than the
qualification itself as one's behavior reflected not only on the
individual but on the organization as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said officers should not engage in immoral behavior because
it would tarnish the image of the well reputed world body and also
make people lose respect for the them.
</P>
<P>
Samba urged ministries of health in every country to promote
the work of the organization by distributing news releases and
other information on health to the public.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not happy with the situation where most health
places did not have literature on health matters in their waiting
rooms for the public to read but instead would have unrelated
information.
</P>
<P>
A total of 46 WHO officers from Africa are attending the
workshop which is aimed at finding ways of enhancing
collaboration between the media and health officers.
</P>
<P>
The workshop also aims at training officers on health issues to
make them efficient and competent personnel.

<HEADLINE> High Court Rejects Appeals in Foreign Exchange Fraud Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Court
today upheld the rulings of a lower court in the cases of 17
swindlers and three enterprises involved in foreign exchange fraud.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court found that Luo Baodong, legal person
of the Shenzhen-based Ganggui Trade Company Ltd., colluded with
Zhuang Hankun in Huizhou City to set up seven shell companies.
They obtained 150 million U.S. dollars of foreign exchange and 120
million HK dollars by offering false bills of entry and commercial
documents.
</P>
<P>
The Yunfu Intermediate People's Court of Guangdong Province has
sentenced Luo to 15 years in prison and a fine of 5 million yuan.
Zhuang was sentenced to a jail term of 14 years and a fine of 4
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the second case, it was found that Li Bin, manager of the
Dayawan New Technology Development Corporation in Huizhou City in
Guangdong Province, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a fine
of 200,000 yuan for altering and falsifying import and export
customs bills in collusion with Hong Kong businessmen. The Dayawan
New Technology Development Corporation was also fined 6 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the third case, the court ruled that Rong Dajia, general
manager of the Qiaobai Company of Industry and Commerce in Wuzhou
City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, illegally assisted
businessmen to falsify commercial documents and draw 24 million U.
S. dollars from the bank by fraud for personal gain. He was
sentenced to seven years in jail and fined 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Luo, Zhuang and several others appealed to the Supreme People's
Court after these first rulings were announced. Their appeals were
rejected today. The original judgments will be upheld as the high
court found the evidence to be ample and the cases properly
decided.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Global Cooperation on Ozone Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top environmental
protection official today called for continuous global cooperation
to protect the ozone layer that shields the Earth from harmful
ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, said global cooperation is the only way the world
community can successfully solve the problem of ozone depletion.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to nearly 1,000 representatives from some 180
countries and organizations at the 11th Meeting of the Parties to
the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete Ozone, the
director described ozone depletion as one of the global
environmental issues which affect human existence.
</P>
<P>
Despite "encouraging progress" the world community has made in
the past decade, it remains a challenge to realize the goal of
halving the output and consumption levels of ozone-depleting
substances (ODS) in developing countries within the next six years,
Xie said.
</P>
<P>
China, a major ODS producer and consumer in the world,
fulfilled its international obligation by having reduced its ODS
output and consumption to 1995-1997 levels by July 1 this year,
and by having slashed its ODS output and consumption by 50,000
tons over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
"Without international cooperation and assistance from
developed countries, this achievement could not have been made in
China," the minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The counting of more than
816,000 ballot papers from 314 constituencies in Sunday's District
Councils election was completed Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the Electoral Affairs
Commission, said a preliminary analysis attributed the smooth
process to the small number of questionable ballots, the well-
organized delivery of ballot boxes from polling stations to
various District Counting Stations and well-trained counting staff.
</P>
<P>
"As the commission has expected, the new method of using a chop
to mark ballots is really effective in reducing questionable
ballots. Only 363 ballots or 0.044 percent of the total ballots
were not marked with the chop," he told a press conference after
the conclusion of the election.
</P>
<P>
The commission will review various electoral arrangements and
carefully study how to improve this new way of marking ballots.
</P>

It shall make a report to the chief executive on matters
relating to the election within the next three months.

MAPUTO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's ruling Frelimo
party led by President Joaquim Chissano is expected to get an
upper hand in the second multi-party general elections on December
3 and 4, local media said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidential candidates, President Chissano and the
main opposition Renamo party leader Afonso Dhlakama, will wind up
their election campaign on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano is widely predicted to be re-elected for a
second five-year term in office.
</P>
<P>
Since President Chissano took power in the first multi-party
elections in 1994, Mozambique has made much progress in
consolidating peace and national reconciliation, reviving and
developing the war-ravaged economy and improving the livelihood of
its people.
</P>
<P>
In order to retain and expand its majority in the 250-seat
parliament, the Frelimo party promised in its manifesto to crack
down on corruption, raise living standard, eradicate absolute
poverty and narrow gaps between the rich and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Most of some seven million registered voters are expected to
cast their ballots in the coming presidential and parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> Trade Union Chief on Workers' Role in SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, president of the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), said in a recent
inspection tour of Tianjin, a port city in north China, that
reform and development of state-owned enterprises must fully rely
on the working class.
</P>
<P>
The central task of trade unions at all levels at the present
stage is to study conscientiously and implement the tasks set by
the Fourth Plenum of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and by the Central Economic Working
Conference, and mobilize workers to make new contributions toward
attaining the goal of seeing the SOEs out of difficulty in three
years, said Wei, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He urged trade unions to carry out various kinds of labor
competitions, technical innovations, and other activities among
workers, while performing the functions of trade unions and
maintaining the lawful rights and interests of workers.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should assist the Party and government to fulfill
the tasks of reducing the labor force and increasing efficiency
while helping laid-off workers find new jobs. They should also do
a conscientious job of conducting democratic evaluations of
factory leaders, building a corporate system for state-owned or-
controlled enterprises, expanding trade unions to new firms, and
improving the building of trade unions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of all these tasks is to arouse the enthusiasm of the
broad masses of workers and channel their zeal into the three-year
objectives for the reform of state-owned enterprises, Wei said.

GUANGZHOU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has chosen 87 projects and set a purchase list of more
than 100 million U.S. dollars for the coming 99' Guangdong Foreign
Trade and Economic Fair in London and Paris on December 7 and 14,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
These projects involve infrastructure, machinery and
electronics, building materials, medical equipment, textiles,
chemicals, and agriculture. The province also expects to purchase
underground subway components as well during the fair, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The fair will provide a good opportunity for Guangdong to
introduce itself to more foreign investors in Europe, said Huang
Ziqiang, who is in charge of the provincial foreign trade and
economics.
</P>
<P>
About three-fourths of the projects are for small and medium-
sized European enterprises, and they are also very competitive,
with hi-tech features and good operational systems, said Huang
Zhiwei, who is in charge of the province's foreign investment,
adding that they will make every effort to intensify their
economic activities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The recent visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Britain
and France, the Sino-U.S. agreement on China's accession to the
World Trade Organization, and the ongoing negotiations between
China and the European Union (EU), are all favorable conditions
for Guangdong to expand its trade and purchase activities in
Europe, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's annual foreign trade value is some 130 billion U.S.
dollars, 40 percent of the country's total, while EU countries
have invested in 900 projects in the province involving 7.5
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Condemns Congo Rebels for Violating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe on Monday accused
rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) of
continuing to violate cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defence Ministry spokesman Chancellor Diye said in a
 statement that despite the deployment of monitors from Joint
Military Commission, the Organization of African Unity and United
Nations in the DRC, rebels were moving heavy weapons in
preparation of a major offensive.
</P>
<P>
"On November 27 Rwanda and the Rally for Congolese Democracy
launched a ground attack supported by mortars, heavy machine guns
and artillery on the allied forces positions at Ikela," said Diye.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack was a flagrant violation of the Lusaka
cease-fire accord and utter disregard to calls by the
international community to all belligerents in the DRC war to show
goodwill and commitment to the cease- fire accord.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe support the DRC President Laurent
Kabila against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC people are hungry for peace and should be given an
opportunity to be masters of their own destiny," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li
Peng and Israeli Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg
Monday exchanged views on how to further the parliamentary
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Li's visit to Israel, Burg said the Jewish and
Chinese nationals have very ancient civilizations, and the
exchange of visits and contacts between the National People's
Congress of China and Israel's Knesset will help promote
cooperation between the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
China is big and influential country in the world and all
the Knesset members and the Israeli people have a common
desire for further strengthening the cooperations with China, Burg
added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC), said that the NPC and the
Knesset are the representatives of the peoples of the two
countries and their contacts will undoubtedly be conducive to
promoting Sino-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the Jewish and Chinese histories, Li, who arrived
here Thursday on a week-long visit, said that both the Chinese and
the Jews had a similar fate in the past and suffered a lot during
the World War II.
</P>
<P>
During the World War II, about 6 million Jews lost their lives
in Europe, while millions of Chinese people were killed by the
Japanese aggressor troops, Li said, adding that the peoples of
China, Israel as well as the whole world will never forget the
historical lesson and never let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed Burg on China's national construction over the
past 50 years and structure of the NPC.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Revalued Yen Gives S.Korea Mixed Feeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese yen's recent
appreciation against the greenback has given a mixed feeling to
South Korea which is keeping a close eye on the impact upon its
economy brought by yen's fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the recovery of the Japanese economy, the yen surged
to 101 against one U.S. dollar last Friday, a four-year high since
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
As in the past, the strong yen is expected to help South Korea
increase its exports and promote their price competitiveness
against Japanese products in the markets of the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
South Korea competes with Japan very fiercely in such sectors
as autos, shipbuilding and petrochemicals, which account for 60
percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
The country's auto, shipbuilding, electric home appliance,
semiconductor, petrochemical and heavy equipment industries will
be most benefited from the strong yen, said observers.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is to increase exports to maximize the price
competitiveness against Japanese goods, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, the strengthened yen will impose a negative impact on
South Korea which is meanwhile a heavy importer of Japanese goods.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which relies on Japan for 30 percent or more of
its imports in machinery, parts and material, will have to produce
more export items to pay for its imports from Japan as the result
of the stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
It pays for some 60 percent of its imports from Japan in yen
and 40 percent of its exports to Japan are settled with the yen.
</P>
<P>
South Korean companies and financial institutions will also
suffer from the yen' s rally when borrowing fund from Japan.
</P>
<P>
South Korean exports are expected to rise by 2.08 billion
dollars if the yen climbs up 10 percent while imports will
increase by 600 million dollars, helping the nation's trade
balance up 1.48 billion dollars, according to an analysis by the
Korea International Trade Association.

technology, and market accessibility.

MANILA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph

discussions here Monday on matters of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters

<HEADLINE> Hamas Not to Open Political Office in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian militant Islamic
group Hamas does not plan to open a political office in Gaza "to
refrain from disturbance and pressure," a Hamas official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) had political offices
wherever Palestinians were present, Ismail Abu Shanab said.
</P>
<P>
Shanab's words came in response to an invitation by the
Palestinian National Course Movement, a pro-peace party formed by
a group of former Hamas members, to open a political office in
Gaza, the Palestinian daily Al Qods reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He repeated a demand for the return of three Hamas officials,
namely, Emad Al Alami, Mustafa Al Qanoun and Khalil Al Qouqa, who
were deported by Israel in 1988.
</P>
<P>
On the deportation of four Hamas officials from Amman, Jordan
to Qatar, Abu Shanab said that Hamas would make efforts for their
return, adding that it would not weaken the operations, objectives
and determination of the movement.
</P>
<P>
Hamas opposes Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace policy
with Israel and it advocates liberating Israeli-occupied
territories through armed struggles.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, inceptive 10 years ago, has carried out several suicide
bombings that killed scores of Israelis over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Course Movement, which is
also partly funded by Arafat's Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), has expressed its readiness to mediate between the PNA and
Hamas to arrange for a meeting and subsequent coordination.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Digital Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua)-- Digital Earth, a concept first
put forward by U.S. Vice-President Al Gore in 1998, aims to
provide data and information about every spot on the planet.
</P>
<P>
Under the concept, scientists from different countries would
jointly build a 3D "Digital Earth" by collecting data and
information about the Earth based on geographical coordinates.
</P>
<P>
Via the Internet, people around the world could then obtain
easy access to data and information about any place in the world
by locating its coordinate and taking a 3D look at it on the
computer, no matter where it is.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the creation of "Digital Earth" will be
one inevitable by-product of global science and information
technology, backed by information technology including remote
sensing and geographical information systems.
</P>
<P>
"Digital Earth" could be used for rapid reaction to natural
disasters by providing data and information on any event and human
resources related to it.
</P>
<P>
"Digital Earth" is expected to play an important role for any
country seeking to achieve sustainable economic development.

<HEADLINE> OIC Raps Israel's Attempts to Judaize Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) Ezzidine Laraki on
Monday condemned Israel's attempts to Judaize Jerusalem and
change the city's religious and historical features.
</P>
<P>
"These attempts are inconsistent with international legality
and Security Council resolutions," Laraki said in a message read
at a preparatory meeting held here for the 5th conference of
OIC information ministers.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to stop its settlement activities and
immediately withdraw its troops from the Palestinian and all other
Arab territories that are still under its control in order to
establish a just, comprehensive and durable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed OIC's full solidarity with the Palestinian
people and their just struggle under the leadership of the
Palestinian National Authority to recover their legitimate
national rights, to ensure the success of their cause and set up
an independent state with Jerusalem as the capital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Mohajerani also reaffirmed solidarity by the Muslim world
with the Palestinians, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran, which is holding the OIC chairmanship, is
firm on the stand that a real peace in the region would only be
achieved by materializing all the just rights of the Palestinians,
including the return of Palestinian refugees to their motherland
and Israel's withdrawal from the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
The 55-member OIC was set up in 1970 with an aim of promoting
Islamic solidarity among member states.

<HEADLINE> Large and Medium Cities to Take Lead in Agriculture Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 29 (Xinhua) - With the rapid development of
urban agriculture, large and medium cities in China have the
experience needed to lead the country in agriculture modernization,
experts at a recent ag-development seminar agreed.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Shanghai Municipality said here recently
at the seminar that Shanghai will attempt to realize agricultural
and rural modernization by 2005, and turn the city into a major
international center for agricultural sciences and technology,
information, processing and trade.
</P>
<P>
China's urban agriculture started in the early 1990s, when
provincial capitals in the central and eastern regions as well as
large and medium coastal cities gave full play to their advantages
in capital, technology, market, information and personnel to
develop high-efficient and environment-friendly agriculture.
</P>
<P>
And their efforts have paid off, as agriculture in the areas
has taken a modern shape. This has not only benefited the healthy
development of urban areas but also had a positive influence on
the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture in Beijing has become a new growth point for its
economy and played an important role in food supply, ecological
improvement and tourism. Meanwhile, southern Shenzhen city has
chosen agriculture as a major means to revitalize the economy of
the special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qiang, a research fellow with Beijing Municipal Research
Center for Rural Economy, said that urban agriculture which
integrates production, ecological, living, educational and other
functions has improved the quality of rural communities and rural
life as well as narrowed the gap between urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"The development of urban agriculture is an epoch-making event
in China's agriculture, which will be a major force in
accelerating the country's agriculture modernization drive," said
Hong Fuzeng, a member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress and president of the China Association of
Agricultural Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Rejects Demand for Deletion Rajiv's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Monday rejected the Congress's demand for the
deletion of Rajiv Gandhi's name from the Bofors chargesheet.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told reporters that the attorney general had given the
opinion that Rajiv Gandhi had neither been made an accused, nor
chargesheeted, nor was he being tried in the case of the Bofors
issue, a Swedish arms sale scandal.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, he said, the relevant laws being cited for
deletion of Rajiv Gandhi's name did not apply.
</P>
<P>
As both houses of parliament met for the opening day of the
winter session, members of the Congress party raked up their
demand for the dropping of Rajiv Gandhi's name, which they
contended was included out of "political vendetta."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BJP hoped that the Congress would cooperate with
the government in the passage of important bills, necessary to
carry forward economic reforms, instead of using the Bofors issue
to stall proceedings in parliament.
</P>
<P>
BJP General Secretary Venkaih Naidu said: "It is unfortunate
that the Congress is trying to link up the Bofors chargesheet with
the bills related to economic reforms, as the two have nothing in
common."

BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese national
organization serving the interests of the next generation has
called for further exposure of the banned cult Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaohua, executive director of the China Working Committee
for Caring for the Next Generation, noted that numerous facts have
shown that Falun Gong is a cult which follows philosophies that
run counter to science, society and the government.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it has always targeted its recruitment on the old
and the young, trying every means to corrupt the elderly and
influence the next generation.
</P>
<P>
"This is truly a serious ideological and political fight, which
will have great bearing on the future of the Party and nation,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The older people, who truly care for the well-being of the
country's young, fully realize the danger posed by the Falun Gong
cult, and have voiced their strong support for the government's
ban of the cult, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for us to see through the facade of the Falun
Gong and its founder Li Hongzhi, further expose the crimes
committed by the cult and help the young build up a world outlook
that is based on scientific reasoning," he added.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Drainage
Services Department today awarded a contract worth 217 million HK
dollars (27.8 million U.S. dollars) for the drainage improvement
works to alleviate the flooding problem in Lai Chi Kok and Mong
Kok.
</P>
<P>
The works, under Stage 2, Phase 1 of the West Kowloon Drainage
Improvement Project, will comprise the upgrading of about five
kilometers of stormwater drains of 300 to 2,100 millimeters in
diameter and 350 metros of box culverts in the two areas.
</P>
<P>
The improvement works for the remaining 18 kilometers of drains
will commence in the following few months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after signing the contract, Assistant Director of
Drainage Service (Projects &AMP; Development) George Lai Fuk-kan said
when the works were completed before the wet season of 2004, the
hydraulic capacity of the drainage system in the areas would be
substantially increased.
</P>
<P>
"The works are part of an overall scheme to improve the
drainage system in West Kowloon to meet heavy rains for a return
period of 50 years," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Works under Stage 1 of the improvement project have progressed
well since commencement in April 1998. They include laying of
about 10 kilometers of storm water drains and are scheduled for
completion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Other works under the improvement project include the
construction of the Hang Tung Storage Scheme and the Kai Tak
Transfer Scheme under Stage 2 Phase 2. The third stage will see

LUANDA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Traffic has resumed on the
600-kilometer road linking the capital cities of two southern
Angolan provinces, facilitating the transportation of relief goods
to the impoverished displaced persons, official sources said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The road traffic between Menongue, capital of the Province of

interrupted by the destruction of a bridge over the Kuvango River
and rampant conflicts along the road during the 25-year civil war.

<P>
The first five-truck convoy carrying salt, dry fish and other
goods from Lubango has reached Menongue, said the source.
</P>
<P>
One of the drivers said although nothing happened during their
travel, they considered the task as difficult because of bad state
of the road.
</P>
<P>
Cuando Cubango has been suffering from serious scarcity of food
and other humanitarian assistance since the civil war re-erupted
in late 1998.

<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese education departments
should move to improve the quality of graduate education, minister
of Education Chen Zhili told participants at a national graduate
education working conference here recently.
</P>
<P>
At the highest level of China's educational structure, graduate
education shoulders the responsibility of nurturing high-quality
talent for China's modernization drive, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ended last over the weekend, was the
first of its kind held by the Ministry of Education (MOE). During
the event, experts discussed reform of the graduate enrollment
system and tuition fees, and educational modes for graduate
students.
</P>
<P>
"All these efforts aim to make graduate education diversified,
with emphasis on fostering individuality, which will help
stimulate students' creativity," said Zhou Yuanqing, vice-minister
of education.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China's higher education reform will be
completed within three years. After that, most central government
organizations will no longer run universities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Go Ahead With New Telecom Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government is to go
ahead with the implementation of its new controversial national
telecommunication policy.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper on Monday quoted the Communications
Minister of State Alhaji Elewi as saying that the government is
firm with its stand of levying 100-million-U.S. dollar license
fees for would-be operators.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account of other fees to buy different permits, the
total cost for a green light for a new company may be several
hundreds of million dollars, said experts in the telecom sector in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The new policy nullified the previous eight licenses for the
global system of mobile communication services in the country, and
required reapplying for the four slots prescribed by the policy.
</P>
<P>
The policy recently caused quite a controversy in the west
African nation, where the telecom system is outdated and beyond
the reach of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that it would not help break the monopoly of
the government-owned Nigerian Telecommunication Cooperation
Limited and reduce the high price of the telephone service.

<HEADLINE> HK's Exchange Fund Amounts to 121.2b U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced Monday that the total assets of the
Exchange Fund amounted to 945.1 billion HK dollars (121.2 billion
U.S. dollars) as on October 31.
</P>
<P>
The figure is included in the Exchange Fund Abridged Balance
Sheet, which is released on a monthly basis together with the
Currency Board Account.
</P>
<P>
At end-October, the total assets of the Exchange Fund were 400
million HK dollars (51.3 million U.S. dollars) lower than at end-
September.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency assets decreased by 7.7 billion HK dollars (
987 million U.S. dollars) while Hong Kong dollar assets increased
by 7.3 billion HK dollars (936 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase in Hong Kong dollar assets was due largely to the
change in the market value of Hong Kong equities held by the
Exchange Fund, according the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the Currency Board Account show that the Monetary
Base at end-October was 199.1 billion HK dollars (25.5 billion U.S.
dollars), a reduction of 1.6 billion HK dollars (205.1 million U.S.
dollars), or 0.81 percent, from end- September.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was primarily due to decreases in Certificates of
Indebtedness and the Aggregate Balance, according to the HKMA.

<HEADLINE> Polling closes for Malaysia's 10th General election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Polling for Malaysia's
10th general election was closed at 5.30 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
The polling, which started from 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in
Peninsular Malaysia and from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in Sabah and
Sarawak, two states in East Malaysia, was smooth without any
untoward incidents nationwide, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The turnout was estimated at between 60 to 70 percent of the
total number of about 9.6 million voters eligible to cast their
votes in the general election.
</P>
<P>
There are 193 parliamentary seats and 394 state legislative
assembly seats at stake in the general election. There are 1,238
candidates including 1,200 put up by 21 political parties
contesting both parliamentary and state seats.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission (EC), there are 192 vote
tallying centers nationwide with the first result expected to be
known by 8:30 p.m. Monday and the new government was expected to
be known by early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) led
by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, which has placed candidates in
all parliamentary and state constituencies at stake, already won
two seats, one parliamentary seat in Sarawak and one state seat in
Johor, uncontested on the November 20 nomination day.
</P>
<P>
The opposition front known as Barisan Alternatif (Alternative
Front) comprising four parties, put up 170 candidates for
contesting parliamentary seats and 391 for state seats, according
to the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BN and the opposition front are heading for straight
fights in nearly 80 percent of the 193 parliamentary
constituencies at stake in the election.
</P>
<P>
The number of the straight contests was said to be the highest
since the first election in 1959.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52,000 policemen are on duty Monday throughout the
country to ensure incident-free polling, the election commission
said.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament and legislative assemblies of the 11 states in
peninsular Malaysia were dissolved on November 11, while state
legislative assemblies of Sabah and Sarawak, which hold state
elections separately, are not dissolved. Sabah had its state
election in March while the Sarawak state legislative assembly
expires only in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election held in April 1995, the ruling BN
coalition led by Mahathir won 162 seats out of the total 192 in
the parliament.

BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan and visiting South African Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad have pledged to cement cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
While expressing satisfaction with the development of the
bilateral ties, Ramadan said at the talks with Pahad Sunday
evening that "there are huge potentials for both countries to
further enhance cooperation between our two friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are capable of establishing wide-scale
ties with each other and also able to build up their countries
away from foreign aid, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Ramadan
as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would continue its construction and development efforts
despite the stringent embargo imposed on it since 1990, said
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Pahad, who arrived here over the weekend with a 30-member
delegation mainly grouping businessmen from major South African
firms, said his visit was aimed at cementing cooperation with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was very keen on developing relations with Iraq in
political, economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Members of his delegation were keen on assessing the demands of
the Iraqi market and trying to meet them, said the South African
minister.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf and Trade
Minister Mehdi Salah also met with Pahad on Sunday to discuss ways
of enhancing bilateral cooperation, said INA.

<HEADLINE> Early Release of Former Tehran Mayor Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian judicial
official has ruled out the possibility of an early release of
former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi jailed on graft
charges since May.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi can only be freed if he is pardoned by supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who will consider the case upon request by
Karbaschi himself, an unnamed official told Tehran Times
published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Local media have reported in recent months that efforts have
been made both inside and outside the Iranian judiciary to find an
amnesty for Karbaschi, a prominent reformist with close links with
President Mohammad Khatami and former President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an appeals court attempted to release Karbaschi
after Tehran municipality withdrew a complain against him.
Tehran's new Mayor Morteza Alviri indicated the public funds
allegedly embezzled by Karbaschi have been returned to the
municipality.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court stopped the
attempt before the appeals court announced its ruling.
</P>
<P>
With the sensitive Majlis (parliament) elections one month
away, Iran's powerful conservatives do not want to see Karbaschi's
release, which could be a blow to effort to continue dominance
over the Majlis, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, the support extended by the Party of Constructive
Executive of Iran led by Karbaschi, to the moderates helped
Khatami win a landslide victory over conservative candidate
Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was sentenced last year to five years in prison, a
20-year ban from holding government posts, 60 lashes and a fine of
1 billion rials (about 160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But a Tehran appeals court later reduced his prison term from
five years to two years and the period Karbaschi was banned from
taking public office from 20 years to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was appointed mayor of Tehran in 1989 when the
government of Rafsanjani started post-war reconstruction
programs. He was widely praised for the city's face-lifting with
new highways, parks and high-rise apartment blocks.

<HEADLINE> Winter Session of Indian Parliament Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The winter session of Indian
Parliament began here on Monday amid efforts of the coalition
government to seek consensus on all the major bills that will be
tabled before the two houses.
</P>
<P>
Major bills to be introduced during the four-week session
include the controversial Insurance Regulatory Development
Authority Bill, Foreign Exchange Management Bill and Women's
Reservation Bill, which seeks to provide 33 percent quota for
women in state assemblies and the Lok Sabha (the lower house).
</P>
<P>
The opening session witnessed strong protests by the opposition
including the Congress and left parties which staged noisy
walk-outs on issues which they said would be harmful to the
country if passed.
</P>
<P>
While the Congress staged a walk-out in the Rajya Sabha, or the
upper house, protesting the rejection by the government of its
demand to delete former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's name from a
chargesheet of the so-called Bofors case, a corruption suit
relating to arms imports from a European country in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Agitated members from the left and some other parties also
staged a stormy walk-out, opposing the introduction of the
insurance bill on the ground that tens of thousands of employees
of insurance companies are against the opening up of the insurance
sector.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha managed to have
introduced the Foreign Exchange Management Bill amidst opposition
from a left party.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Meeting on Ozone Protection Opens in Beijing (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- An international meeting to
discuss ozone layer protection began here today with about 1,000
participants from some 180 countries, regions and organizations.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol on
Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer will mainly discuss
further global collaboration in preventing ozone depletion, a
worldwide issue that affects the living environment of man.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest international environment meeting ever held
in China. Participants include Shafqat Kakakhel, deputy executive
director of United Nations Environment Program, and Xie Zhenhua,
minister in charge of China's State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
Xie told the opening ceremony that the Chinese government "is
highly concerned with the issue of ozone depletion" and "has been
performing international obligations in a serious and
conscientious manner."
</P>
<P>
Through implementing the National Action Plan and a series of
policies and regulations, China has effectively controlled the
increase of production and use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS),
and met the target control levels for the production and use of
major CFCs by July 1 this year, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Since China signed the protocol and took part in international
cooperation on ozone layer protection in 1991, the country has cut
ODS output and consumption by a total of 50,000 tons, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer, which shields the earth from the sun's harmful
radiation, has had large holes eaten out of it by substances such
as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used to make appliances, such as
refrigerators. CFCs are known to cause cataracts and diseases
including skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was adopted in 1987 under the auspices of the
United Nations Environment Program and has been signed by 172
participants.
</P>
<P>
A multilateral international fund set up by the participants
has provided about one billion U.S. dollars in aid to help
developing countries fulfill their obligations in ozone layer
protection.

<HEADLINE> More Lebanese Banks to Offer "Islamic" Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 29 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
Lebanese banks are moving toward Islamic banking and offer their
customers the interest-free service, the Daily Star reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Beirut, Credit Libanais and Bankque Saradar, the
country's three leading banks, signed agreements this month with
Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation to offer Islamic-style
financing in Lebanon, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Allied Business Bank launched an "Islamic Window" range of
deposit and financing products earlier this summer and the
Sauidi-owned Baraka Bank says it will open its fourth branch in
Lebanon before the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
Baraka, which only practices Islamic banking in Lebanon, has
deposits of 40 million U.S. dollars and an investment portfolio of
about 30 million dollars, compared to the conventional banking
sector's totals of about 33 billion dollars and 40 billion
dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we've made a big dent in the wall, and people are
far more aware of Islamic banking today than they were two or
three years ago," said Khodr Temsah, Baraka's general manager in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banking, which is governed by Sharia law, forbids
transactions based on interest.
</P>
<P>
Instead returns to depositors usually depend on the profit or
loss that the bank makes on a range of permitted investments.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government approved the Islamic banking law in 1996
but not allowed the full range of Islamic banking products,
including the real estate.
</P>
<P>
"We want all banks in Lebanon to be under the same banking
laws," Makram Sader, secretary-general of the Association of Banks
in Lebanon was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some Lebanese conventional banks are afraid of highly
capitalized Islamic banks from the Gulf coming to Lebanon, buying
up real estate and grabbing a large share of the local property
market.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Parliament Adopts Draft Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's parliament has adopted
the draft treaty on the establishment of East African Community,
paving the way for the signing of the pact on Tuesday in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
However, during debate in Kenya's National Assembly, members of
 parliament expressed apprehension about the treaty. Opposition
MP Mukhisa Kituyi said that Tanzania should renounce its intention
of remaining in the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
and forge closer cooperation with Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"It is not practical for Kenya to embrace a market union as
Tanzania can serve as a conduit for South Africa to flood the
Kenyan market," Kituyi said.
</P>
<P>
As the leaders of the three east African countries prepare to
sign the agreement, the issue of single tariff remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania worries that lowering tariff level will result in the
reduction of revenue because the 25 to 30 percent tariff imposed
currently goes to financing 30 percent of Tanzania's annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania also fears that the realization of a "zero-rating"
tariff may elbow local products out of the market.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Publishing House Punished for Falun Gong Publications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai People's
Publishing House in China's northwest Qinghai province has been
suspended for printing illegal Falun Gong publications, and those
responsible have been punished.
</P>
<P>
In January of this year, the publishing house released four
books that promote the banned Falun Gong cult, Xinhua learned from
the State Press and Publication Administration (SPPA).
</P>
<P>
In addition, from July, 1998, to April, 1999, it printed a
number of books spreading feudalism, superstition and pseudo-
science.
</P>
<P>
Such conduct seriously violates the country's laws and
regulations, according to SPPA officials.
</P>
<P>
The SPPA has suspended business operations of the publishing
house and issued a notice of criticism on the matter to the
country's press and publication circles.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai provincial government has sent a team of
investigators to the publishing house. Those responsible were

<HEADLINE> UAE Welcomes GCC Common Customs Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) welcomed the common customs tariffs reached by Gulf
countries on Sunday, terming it as the best possible deal the UAE
had expected for.
</P>
<P>
The new 5.5-7.5 percent customs tariffs will certainly affect
the UAE, and Dubai in particular, but there could not have been a
better deal for the country, Obaid Busit, director general of
Dubai Customs, was quoted by the Khaleej Times daily as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders struck a deal to
unify their customs tariffs in March 2005, during the second day
of their ongoing 20th summit in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement outlined three categories of goods: duty free
goods, basic goods with a 5.5 percent tariff and luxury goods with
a 7.5 percent tariff, officials said in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The agreement had been expected, "as we have had long
discussions during the past two years," said Busit.
</P>
<P>
"There is no better solution than the one approved though we
were bargaining for the 4-6 percent level which we have at present
in the UAE," said the official, who represented the UAE's second
largest emirate.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Bahrain were striving for a level of 8-12
percent, while Kuwait, Oman and Qatar were backing a level of 6-8
percent. The UAE was the only country that suggested the 4-6
percent formula.
</P>
<P>
Busit said that the tariffs will affect the countries but will
equally benefit their economies in the long run.
</P>
<P>
"The Dubai Customs Authority will now start educating the
people on the benefit of the new tariff and will launch an
awareness campaign to support the move," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have five years before the implementation of the new
customs tariff begins, and any one of the six GCC countries has
the right to request for extension of the time if they fail to
adjust the consequential decline in their markets," the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
By achieving the unified tariffs, the GCC is 80 percent on the
way to forming a customs union and the long-awaited Gulf Common
Market with annual imports of more than 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Such a deal is needed to realize free trade with the European
Union, which currently imposes a 6 percent punitive duty on
aluminium imports from the Gulf, Busit said.
</P>
<P>
A common customs tariff had been a goal of the six GCC
countries, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the UAE, since early 1980s. They had originally set March 1, 2001
as the target date for a customs union.

<HEADLINE> China Chooses 10 Firms For State-Owned Shares Placement Experiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) today announced a list of 10 publicly-
listed firms from which two will be chosen to participate in the
government's state-owned shares placement experiment.
</P>
<P>
The 10 firms include the Tangshan Jidong Cement Co., Ltd., the
Yunnan Huayi Investment Co., Ltd., the Guizhou Tyre Co., Ltd., the
Chongqing Taiji Industrial Co., Ltd., the China Jialing Industrial
Co., Ltd. and others.
</P>
<P>
Owners of the circulating shares of the chosen two firms will
be given priority in buying the state-owned shares on offer. The
remaining part, if any, will be sold to securities investment
funds.
</P>
<P>
The price of the placement will be above the net asset value
per share and not higher than a 10 price-earning ratio, the CSRC
said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned shares bought by owners of circulating shares
can be sold in the secondary market immediately, while those
bought by the securities investment funds can only be sold
gradually in the same market within two years.
</P>
<P>
The eight other firms will reserve their candidacy for next
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that selling part of the state-owned shares
will improve the equity structure of the target firms, and force
them to improve their management and efficiency, as the firms will
be more exposed to public investors.
</P>
<P>
They also hailed the experiment as a positive move in realizing
the government's goal in repositioning the role of the state-owned
sector in the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Labor Unions Protest on Eve of WTO Talks in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- World labor unions began a
protest campaign Sunday against the World Trade Organization (WTO)
that is to convene here Tuesday, hoping to force the delegates to
address workers' rights during its week-long trade talks.
</P>
<P>
At a Seattle news confernce on Sunday, the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and AFL-CIO leaders
warned that unless WTO members agreed to tie core labor standards
to WTO free trade rules, they would face a major backlash from the
workers around the globe.
</P>
<P>
"If the ministers fail to act on what is an unmistakable demand
from the world's peoples, they could well this week have set in
train the beginning of the end of the WTO," ICFTU General
Secretary Bill Jordan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, WTO Director-General Mike Moore, addressing the ICFTU
conference on "Globalization and Workers' Rights" in Seattle, said
trade was an ally of workers and not an enemy, but he insisted
that his organization's role was limited and there were other
bodies like the International Labor Organization that were better
placed to promote workers' rights and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
Other demonstrators -- with interests ranging from protecting
the environment to ending farm subsidies -- began to gather in
Seattle. More than 300 groups vowed to bring 50,000 protesters
here, seeing this as a unique opportunity to influence global
trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
urged poor countries to keep up resistance to the pressure from
the United States to insert a "labor clause" into the rules of the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The 29 least-developed States already in the 135-member trade
body, ranging from Bangladesh and Tanzania to Haiti, "should
continue in their opposition to the inclusion of core labor
standards in the work of the WTO," the nearly 300-page handbook of
UNCTAD declared.
</P>
<P>
This stance, it said, should include "resistance to any
consideration or discussion of a social clause with trade
sanctions imposed through the WTO."

<HEADLINE> More Money Considered for Ozone Layer Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing meeting of the
parties to the Montreal Protocol is expected to consider further
funding for eliminating chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-
destroying chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened here this morning, will discuss a
report on the implementation of the protocol designed to phase out
ozone-depleting chemicals, including CFCs and halon.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was adopted in 1987 under the auspices of the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and was signed by more
than 160 participants.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day meeting, the members of the Montreal
Protocol will also decide on a three-year replenishment of the
Multilateral Fund, said a senior official of the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1991, the fund makes it possible for developing
countries to meet their treaty commitments, including the phase-
out of CFCs and halon by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
To date, the fund has approved some 940 million U.S. dollars
for projects to eliminate the use and production of CFCs and halon
in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The partnership between developed and developing countries
that has been realized through the Multilateral Fund is one of the
great success stories of global environmental protection," said
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
"I urge governments to continue investing in ozone protection
for as long as it takes for this natural shield against harmful
radiation to be completely revived," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer, which shields the earth from the sun's harmful
rays, has had large holes eaten out of it by substances such as
chlorofluorocarbons, used in making appliances such as
refrigerators. CFCs are known to cause cataracts and disease,
including skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have predicted that the damaged ozone layer will
start to improve in the near future and will fully return to its
original state some time in the 21st century, but only if the
Protocol continues to be vigorously enforced.

<HEADLINE> First Condom Ad Appears on China National TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China's national television
station has started airing ads for condoms to promote their
benefit in preventing unwanted pregnancy and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The public awareness spots are the first condom ads ever
released by the mass media in China, where sex-related topics
continue to be embarrassing to the general audience, even though
condoms are available throughout the country as a major form of
contraception.
</P>
<P>
The first condom ad debuted Sunday on the popular Channel One
of China Central Television (CCTV), which has an audience of
hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
In cartoon-style, a child-like condom fights off attacks of the
AIDS virus and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Subtitles
read "Avoiding Unwanted Pregnancy" and "Use a Condom, No Trouble."
</P>
<P>
The producer of the ad said he aimed to demonstrate that the "
correct use of the condom is a safe, convenient and very effective
way to block HIV/AIDS and STDs."
</P>
<P>
"We hope the ad will raise public awareness about sexual health,
as well as concern about the serious epidemic of HIV/AIDS," Zhang
Jian, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Family Planning
Publicity and Education, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
A series of educational activities are being carried out across
China as World AIDS Day approaches. The country has been warned
that it has over 400,000 HIV carriers and some six million STD
patients, and is on the brink of a possible epidemic if preventive
measures are not taken immediately.
</P>
<P>
Anti-AIDS campaigners in China have long advocated the positive
role of the condom in cutting off transmission of AIDS and STDs.
However, they often find it difficult to promote condom use in
this country, which has long abstained from public discourse on
sex.
</P>
<P>
Some researchers of STD intervention have complained that local
police have forbidden their efforts to promote condom use at
hotels and communities, saying such acts are "encouraging
prostitution."
</P>
<P>
But things are changing as the Chinese government, particularly
the public health department, has strongly backed condom use in
AIDS-control work.
</P>
<P>
Vending machines with condoms have been installed along some
streets of urban Beijing and on the campuses of some colleges such
as Qinghua University.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Banks to Cut 2,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Kenyans
working in the banking sector will lose jobs in the next three
months as several banks implement restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
Major banks are cutting costs due to the downturn in the
financial performance, high interest rates and the heavy
investment in computer technology, the East African weekly issued
on Monday reported.
</P>
<P>
The leading players in the banking sector include the
Cooperative Bank of Kenya, the National Bank of Kenya, Kenya's
Commercial Bank and Barclays Bank.
</P>
<P>
Last year, banks in the east African country reduced their
staff by five percent from 16,224 in 1997 to 15,023 in 1998 as a
result of computerization and the whole country's flagging
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the banks are now digging into the files for those
with any pending cases in order to dismiss them on disciplinary
grounds without replacement. At the same time, most banks have
slowed down recruitment process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Fashion House Cooperates With Pierre Cardin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Pierre Cardin Company will
train a well-known Chinese fashion enterprise in techniques of
European-style clothing design, according to a letter of intent
signed between the two sides recently.
</P>
<P>
The famous French fashion house will also increase orders for
materials from the Sanmao Group, in east China's Jiangsu province,
and act as Sanmao's sole sales agent in Europe, according to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sanmao Group started cooperation with Pierre Cardin four years
ago by providing 20 percent of Pierre Cardin's exclusive materials.
</P>
<P>
Fabric and designs used by Sanmao, which have a distinct
European flair, attracted the attention of designer Pierre Cardin,
who came to China several times to negotiate cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
In September, Sanmao opened a boutique on the Champs Elysees in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Pierre Cardin Company reportedly has about 30 sales agents
in China, with more than 100 shops in over 20 large and medium-

<HEADLINE> EU Says It's Ready to Negotiate on Agriculture </HEADLINE>

<P>
SEATTLE, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Sunday
that agriculture is set to play a major role in the Millennium
Round of trade talks, which the World Trade Organization (WTO)
aims to launch in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural
Development and Fisheries, also stressed that the EU sticks to its
approach to have comprehensive negotiations on agriculture which
go beyond purely market-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Seattle for the third WTO ministerial
meeting, Fischler said, "The European Union is prepared to reach a
comprehensive agreement on agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Trade representatives from 135 WTO members failed last week to
reach agreement on the agenda of the Millennium Round and left the
thorny issue to their ministers who are gathering here and will
meet between November 30 and December 3.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and services are on the built-in agenda of the next
round of trade talks according to the Uruguay Round Agreement,
which was concluded in Marakech, Morocco. But WTO members disagree
on what new fields should be put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The EU is pushing for a comprehensive agenda for the round,
covering agriculture, services, tariffs on industrial goods,
investment and competition rules.
</P>
<P>
Many other members including the U.S. want a narrower agenda
and intend to focus on all subsidies on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"As stated in Article 20 of the Marakech Agreement, a new round
must also cover non-trade issues. The inclusion of the areas of
social concern such as environmental protection, animal welfare,
food quality and safety are crucial for the acceptance of the WTO
by society at large," Fischler said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is also pushing for new WTO initiatives
on electronic commerce and on trade-related labor issues.
</P>
<P>
In services, the developing countries want to focus efforts on
removing barriers in sectors where they are competitive such as
labor, maritime and entertainment while the developed countries
favor financial, air transport and information.

LUSAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has been
urged to protect local economy while implementing the zero tariff
plan of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
, Zambia's Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Federation of Employers President Samuel Musonda told
delegates to the just ended tripartite consultative labor council

clause be put in place before it could reduce its tariff to zero,
scheduled for October 31, 2000 by COMESA.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the government should approach this issue with
extreme caution as stronger economies will benefit far much more
than economies such as ours."
</P>
<P>
He also called on the government to restructure the tax system
in favor of both local and foreign industry, saying the current
structure was making it impossible for the local industry to
compete on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Province Prepares for Upsurge of Western Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi
Province has beefed up its reform and development, and is well
prepared for a coming upsurge of economic growth in the country's
central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
A special leading body has been formed to implement the central
government's measures on acceleration of economic growth in
western China.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi province will give priority to the planned, steady
improvement of some 100,000 sq km of eroded land, speed up the
pace of infrastructure construction, promote industrial
restructuring and upgrading of product mix, accelerate the growth
of such pillar industries as tourism, power energy, electronics
and pharmaceuticals industries and adopt still more flexible
policies to absorb more funds, technology and talents from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has, over the past three years,
implemented a series of key central government policies, including
those concerning the expansion of domestic demand and readjustment
of its economic structure. And it has invested a total of 117.5
billion yuan (14.2 billion US dollars) in building approximately
100 infrastructure projects during the 1998-99 period.
</P>
<P>
As a result, its economic growth rate exceeded the national
average for three consecutive years. The local state-owned
enterprises recorded a marked improvement in their performance in
the first three quarters of this year while the ratio of non-
public sectors in Shaanxi's gross domestic product rose remarkably.

DHAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The opposition alliance in
Bangladesh will hold its summit meeting on Tuesday, The
Independent daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The much-talked-about meeting of the four opposition parties
would take place at the official residence of Khaleda Zia,
chairperson of the country's largest opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and leader of the opposition in the
parliament, press adviser to the BNP chief Anwar Zahid was quoted
as saying.

<P>
Zahid, who attended a liaison meeting of the four parties --
the BNP, the Jatiya Party (JP, Ershad), the Jamaat-e-Islami and
the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front) -- at the JP
office on Sunday night, said they had also finalized a draft
declaration to be announced from the summit.
</P>
<P>
However he did not mention whether the four parties would work
out a single platform to contest future elections, saying only
that the declaration would address the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four parties are organizing separate rallies and
processions on Monday as part of their countrywide program to
protest the killing of an opposition activist during a strike held
by the opposition last Thursday and the filing of what they call
false cases against opposition leaders and activists.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Encouraged in Chongqing'S Agricultural Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Business people from overseas
are encouraged to invest in the agricultural sector in Chongqing,
China's largest municipality in southwest.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations formulated by the Chongqing municipal
government recently, overseas investors ready to sponsor projects
in its agricultural sector will enjoy preferences with regard to
land use, taxation and imports and exports of goods.
</P>
<P>
Those who are willing to invest in outlying, poorer mountainous
places, ethnic minority people-inhabited regions and the Three
Gorges Dam Project area will also receive preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 80,000 sq km with a total population of
some 30 million, Chongqing is one of China's leading agricultural
production bases. In the year of 1998 alone, its contractual use
of overseas investment reached 59.23 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During a recent large-scale agricultural investment fair and an
agricultural produce exhibition hosted by Chongqing, the
municipality was expected to draw six billion yuan (723 million US
dollars) in overseas investment for more than 100 projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Condemns U.S. House Resolution on China's Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
United States Li Zhaoxing has strongly condemned a concurrent
resolution of the U.S. House on Falun Gong, a cult banned by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Li described the resolution as "groundless accusation and
vicious attack" on China's handling of the Falun Gong case, saying
it was an interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted on November 18 with presence of only
five or six congressmen before the winter recess of the Congress,
asked the Chinese government to "stop its persecution" of Falun
Gong practitioners while urging the U.S. administration to
pressure China into releasing detained Falun Gong members and
allowing them freedom to practice.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that facts have proved that Falun Gong is neither a
religious nor a Qigong organization, it is a cult which has led to
death of more than 1,400 people. The U.S. House resolution was
passed regardless of these facts, and "was strongly resented and
opposed by the Chinese government and people," Li said in a
November 22 speech at a university in Kentucky State.
</P>
<P>
No responsible government in the world will leave cults go
unpunished, Li said, adding that Germany, Japan, Belgium and
France have recently also cracked down on cults.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said it is a "double standard" practice
for the U.S. Congress to attack China on its handling of the Falun
Gong case while raising no objection to the crackdown on cults by
the U.S. government and its allies.

COLOMBO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen persons were killed
and 40 others seriously injured when a bus fell into a precipice
50 feet (16 meters) deep in central Sri Lanka last Saturday night,
reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bus which was carrying people returning from a wedding at
Bogawantalawa, skidded off the road and fell into the precipice at
Dickoya, about 80 kilometers from Colombo.
</P>
<P>
As the accident had taken place late at night in a lonely spot,
rescue work was delayed and the fact that passengers scrambled to
escape only worsened the circumstances and caused further injury
to other passengers, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Assistance finally arrived hours later and the injured were
rushed to nearby hospitals in Dickoya, Nawalapitiya and Kandy.
</P>
<P>
While seven persons had reportedly died on the spot, eight
others succumbed to their injuries before being admitted into
hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Jorge Batlle of Uruguay's
ruling Colorado Party won the presidential run-off election on
Sunday and will become the country's new president, according to
preliminary official results.
</P>
<P>
Of the 95.9 percent of the votes counted, Batlle captured 51.87
percent, while his left-wing challenger, Tabare Vazquez, won 43.76
percent.
</P>
<P>
Vazquez has conceded defeat and congratulated Batlle on his
victory.
</P>
<P>
However, Vazquez said his party, the Progressive Broad Front,
which won the majority of the seats both in the Senate and the
Chamber of Deputies, has become the biggest political power in the
South American country.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of voting on October 31, Vazquez won 39
percent of the vote, compared with Batlle's 31.9 percent. Former
president Luis Lacalle managed to place third with 21.3 percent.
Since none of the candidates achieved an absolute majority,
Vazquez and Batlle entered Sunday's run-off.
</P>
<P>
Batlle told a press conference on Sunday that during his coming
five-year term of office, he would focus on the country's economic
stability and national unity and improvement of living standards.
</P>
<P>
Batlle would be sworn in on March 1 to succeed President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election was the fourth general election in Uruguay
since the country returned to democracy in 1985. It was also
Batlle's fifth presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
Batlle, 72, entered politics in 1947 and was elected a member
of parliament in 1959 and 1963. He was jailed by military rulers
in 1973 and was re-elected member of parliament in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Batlle is married and fathers a son and a daughter.

our machines, but we plan to conduct the rollover test to ensure
that nothing will go wrong," DSE Chief Executive Officer G.Q.
Chowdhury said.
</P>
<P>
But the stock exchanges, with their members dialing in to the
system and trading on-line, cannot consider themselves to be free
from such glitches unless the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone
Board (BTTB) declares itself fully Y2K-ready, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two bourses launched automated trading last year, making
the BTTB an integral part of the stock business.
</P>
<P>
The problems that are expected to arise from non-compliance are
modification of internal date of computers from December 31, 1999
to January 1, 2000 at mid-night on December 31, 1999, malfunction
of hardware and software using two-digit year convention, hardware
shutdown and data corruption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chittagong Stock Exchange, the other bourse of
the country, is set to begin mock manual trading from next month
to get rid of the Y2K problem, The Financial Express daily
reported.

<HEADLINE> Moldova's Foreign Trade Declines Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 28 (Xinhua) -- The foreign trade of the
Republic of Moldova sharply declined to just 810 million U.S.
dollars during the first 10 months of this year, a 43 percent
decrease compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to October this year, Moldova's exports to the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) decreased by 49.7 percent,
but those to central and eastern European countries (CEECs) and
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
increased by 16 percent and 17.8 percent respectively, according
to latest statistics issued by the government on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moldova's foreign trade registered a deficit of 81 million
dollars as of October 1, even though imports from the EU and CEECs
also decreased, falling by 49.6 percent and 47.7 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Moldova mainly exports food, cigarettes and alcoholic drink to
CIS countries, with Russia accounting for 60 percent to 70 percent
of all its shipments.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the Ministry of Economy and Reform pointed out that
the drastic foreign trade drop was mainly attributable to Russia's
financial crisis last year, which adversely affected the CIS
market as a result of the devaluation of the Russian currency,
ruble.
</P>
<P>
Besides, export-oriented companies have been severely
discouraged by the unstable domestic political and economic
situation, a declining GDP and increased taxation.

<HEADLINE> Polling Starts for Malaysia's 10th General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Polling for Malaysia's
10th general election began Monday morning as voters started
casting their votes at polling stations in the capital city of
Kuala Lumpur at 8:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission arrangement, polling in
Sabah and Sarawak, two states in East Malaysia, started at 7:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
Polling will last for only one day. This is the first time in
Malaysia's history that polling is conducted for only one day,
instead of two days in the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
Some 9.6 million voters are legal for casting their votes in
the election at some 17,000 polling centers set up throughout the
country. Some 112,000 Election Commission workers are involved in
the election, according to the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,238 candidates including 1,200 fielded by 21
political parties, contesting 193 parliamentary seats and 394
state seats at stake in the general election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front)
which has placed candidates in all parliamentary and state
constituencies at stake, already won two seats, one parliamentary
seat in Sarawak and one state seat in Johor, uncontested on the
November 20 nomination day.
</P>
<P>
The opposition front known as Barisan Alternatif (Alternative
Front) comprising four parties, put up 170 candidates for
contesting parliamentary seats and 391 for state seats, according
to the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BN and the opposition front are heading for straight
fights in nearly 80 percent of the 193 parliamentary
constituencies at stake in the election.
</P>
<P>
The number of the straight contests was said to be the highest
since the first election in 1959.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52,000 policemen are on duty Monday throughout the
country to ensure incident-free polling, the Election Commission
said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament and legislative assemblies of the 11 states in
peninsular Malaysia were dissolved on November 11 while state
legislative assemblies of Sabah and Sarawak, which hold state
elections separately, are not dissolved. Sabah had its state
election last March while the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly
expires only in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election held in April 1995, the ruling BN
coalition led by Mahathir Mohamad won 162 seats out of the total
192 in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Renewed Clashes in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were killed in
renewed violence in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province,
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A policeman and a civilian were killed and seven other security
officers injured when they tried to separate groups locked in
communal clashes in Nusawine sub-district, Ambon, the Antara News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Pattimura Provincial Military Command Brig. Gen.
Max Tamaela said he had got a report from Chief of the Maluku
Police Brig. Gen. Dewa Astika.
</P>
<P>
"Security apparatuses have tried hard to break up the clash to
prevent increase in the number of victims, both from the civilian
and military parties," he was quoted by the Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
People living near the scene said the unrest escalated because
of security forces' failure to disperse the warring crowd of two
groups, which fought each other with self-made firearms, bombs,
bows, arrows and machetes.
</P>
<P>
The unrest has further worsened the condition in Ambon while
hand-made bomb explosions were still heard, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and its surrounding areas have been ravaged by a series
of communal clashes over the last few months. The worst riots
occurred in the January-March period and claimed hundreds of
lives.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid last week expressed the hope that
Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri will soon visit Maluku to
solve the problems that have arisen in the province.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's Ruling Party Candidate Leads in Presidential Run-off: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Jorge Batlle of Uruguay's
ruling Colorado Party is leading in the country's presidential run-
off on Sunday, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
Two independent polling groups CIFRA and Factum gave identical
figures, with Batlle winning 52 percent of the vote and his
challenger Tabare Vazquez, of the left-wing Progressive Broad
Front, 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
CIFRA and Factum reported margins of errors of 1 percent and 1.
5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Either candidate needs only a simple majority to win this run-
off election.
</P>
<P>
The winner would succeed President Julio Maria Sanguinetti on
March 1 for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of voting on October 31, Vazquez seized 39
percent of the vote, compared to Batlle's 31.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Batlle, 72, who had been a lawyer and a journalist, entered
politics in 1947 and became a member of parliament in 1959 and
1963 respectively.
</P>
<P>
He was jailed in 1973 by military rulers and was re-elected a
member of parliament in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Vazquez, 59, is a former mayor of Montevideo and a doctor
specializing in cancer.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Send Olajuwon Home to Have Groin Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 28 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets center
Hakeem Olajuwon reportedly will miss the last three games of a
four-game road trip after being sent home on Saturday to have his
groin strain examined.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon played only 15 minutes on Friday night as Houston
opened its trip with a 91-88 overtime loss to Portland. According
to the Houston Chronicle, he was sent home Saturday so doctors can
search for a possible tear.
</P>
<P>
Team officials were unavailable for comment. Olajuwon could
miss his first game in two seasons if he is unavailable to play
Monday in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who have the fourth-worst record in the league at
3-11, also visit Phoenix and the Los Angeles Clippers on the trip
before returning home for Saturday's game against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon is one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, but his
production has diminished this season. He is averaging only 14.8
points per game, 8.8 below his 15-year average.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Women's Doubles Miss Grand Prix Badminton Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in
Indonesia's badminton history, it failed to qualify women's
doubles in the Grand Prix Finals in Brunei Darussalam starting on
Wednesday, the Jakarta Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other bad news is that the 1996 Olympics gold medalists Ricky
Subagja and Rexy Mainaky also failed to qualify for the 250,000 U.
S.dollars event for the first time since their participation in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The International Badminton Federation (IBF) rules say only
eight best doubles in the men's, women's and mixed doubles events
can be admitted to compete in the finals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Etty Tantri and Cynthia Tuwankotta are ninth
ranked in the world while seniors Elysa Nathanael and Deyana
Lomban are in 10th place.
</P>
<P>
Ricky and Rexy are only ranked 11th.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) training
director Christian Hadinata said that Elysa and Deyana had been
unable to boost their performance since early this year as Elysa
had been suffering from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
"Despite tougher competition in the women's sector, our
shuttlers performances' are decreasing as they lack self-
confidence which can occur when the athletes and their coaches do
not have a close relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Rexy said he failed to qualify for the closing-
year event not because of his trip to England, where he plans to
coach after retirement.
</P>
<P>
"Ricky and I had planned to compete in the Danish Open in
September two weeks prior to D-day because we realized we must
secure our positions in the event as we were only in seventh
position in the world. But PBSI secretary general Leo Wiranata
declined our request saying it was too late to register us.
</P>
<P>
"Three days before the just-concluded China Open took place,
PBSI tried really hard to register us because we dropped from
seventh to 11th position. I was in England and Ricky called me
saying that I must rush home to compete in the event. When the
China Open organizers declined the request, they put the blame on
me," Rexy said.
</P>
<P>
"I went to England with the permission of PBSI officials. If
only they had told me earlier that Ricky and I had to perform in
the China Open, I would have canceled my flight to England to
compete in the event," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rexy said he would move to England after the Olympic Games in
Sydney next year.
</P>
<P>
"Christian told us that we must focus our attention on the
Olympics and cancel our plans to retire. We will take part in the
remaining tournaments. Ricky and I experienced the pressure in the
Olympics and it was really tough to overcome it. Christian hopes
we can share our experiences especially with our successors Candra
Wijaya and Tony Gunawan," he added.

</P>
<P>
The inaugural flight took place between Yangon, the capital of
Myanmar, and Macao last Saturday, official newspaper The New Light

<HEADLINE> European Animated Films Compete for Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China is the largest potential
market in the eyes of the EM.TV company, the giant European
animated film producer, said Uwe Kraeuter, chairman of Asia World
Network. Ltd., an agent of EM.TV.
</P>
<P>
EM.TV, the largest company among all the 120 attending the Kids

animated cartoons, including the well-known "Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland," "Heidi," and new ones like "Poochin's Yard," and "
Rascal" to the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Kraeuter said that China has nearly 300 million people below
the age of 17, the target age group for animated films, and
European makers are continuing to get their share of this huge
market.
</P>
<P>
The series "Twipsy" shown on CCTV (China Central Television) is
one of their products, with its main character an animal that
wanders the Internet. "Both the content and the character are very
creative," commented Kraeuter.

<HEADLINE> Labor Party, Alliance Prepare for New NZ Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party and the
Alliance, which won a combined total of 63 seats in the 120-seat
parliament in the November 27 general election, are going full
steam ahead on forming a new New Zealand coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On the day after the election, Labor leader Helen Clark and
Alliance leader Jim Anderton had their first coalition meeting in
Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand. After the meeting,
Clark told the local media that she vows to forge a deal between
the two parties by the end of the week and see the new government
sworn in by December 10.
</P>
<P>
She said she wants a 20-strong cabinet, with 17 posts for her
Labor Party. She envisages Anderton as deputy prime minister with
an economic affairs role.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister-elect said: "It will be a coalition with a
mission, which is to make things better and change direction. I
don't think there are fundamental problems there."
</P>
<P>
Anderton said much of the groundwork for a coalition government
has been laid in the past 18 months and the two parties now have
to agree on general direction.
</P>
<P>
"Neither party expects to get everything they campaigned on,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Clark and Anderton disclosed that the parliament will sit
till Christmas Eve to introduce tax increase legislation, review
of the minimum wage, a bill banning party-hopping by MPs and
easing of student loan interest.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday election also saw a 91-percent vote in favor of a
referendum on tougher penalties for violent crime and 81 percent
vote for another referendum on the reduction of the number of the
MPs from the current 120 to 99. It seems that either Clark or
Anderton is eager to act timely on the sharp messages contained in
the two referendums.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Continued Efforts for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on
Sunday called for continued international efforts to push further
the Middle East peace process and find an early solution to the
Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
In a written message to the conference marking the
International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, Zhu
said: "I would like to take this opportunity to call on the
international community to attach greater importance to the just
cause of the Palestinian people and work harder to facilitate the
continued progress of the Middle East peace process, and help
realize the aspiration of the Palestinian people at an early date.
"
</P>
<P>
Zhu reviewed the progress made in the 50-year efforts by the
Palestinian people under the leadership of President Yasser Arafat
to recover the lost land and restore their legitimate national
rights and interests, hailing their achievement of self-rule among
"positive results" through peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, he hailed the September signing of the Sharm el-
Sheikh Memorandum, which cleared the way for implementing the 1998
peace deal Wye Accord and relaunching the Palestine permanent
status talks and the talks that have led to the late October
opening of the safe passage connecting the Palestinian Autonomous
Area.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Premier Zhu reiterated China's policy to
support the Palestinian people and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope for the Palestinian people to make new
progress in peace talks and in their bid for the restoration of
their national rights and interests and the establishment of an
independent state.

<HEADLINE> Lots of Difficulties Remain For N.Ireland Peace- Adams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There are lots of difficulties yet to be resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland is to hold a meeting on Monday to herald the
birth of the first home-rule government in the province for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
"None of us will have done our bit until this work is completed.
All of us have a lot more to do," Adams, whose party is the
political wing of the Northern Ireland Republican Army(IRA), said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized that David Trimble, leader of the pro-
British Ulster Unionists (UUP), was trying to dictate how and when
the thorny issue of disarmament should be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The UUP voted on Saturday to accept a formula to revive
Northern Ireland's flagging peace process, but warned final
approval must be left until February to establish whether the IRA
had started to disarm.
