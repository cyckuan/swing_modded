Astros erupt late, subdue Indians
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CLEVELAND _ The Astros woke up from their three-game nap Saturday,
and boy, were they fussy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing pacifies them like a come-from-behind
victory, and they mangled embattled Cleveland Indians relief
pitcher Jose Mesa as if he were their favorite chew toy.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros overcame a three-run deficit, forced extra innings
and scored four runs in the 11th to claim a much-needed 9-5 victory
at Jacobs Field. Their 23rd comeback victory of the season halted a
three-game losing streak and kept the Astros from going 0-4 on
their current five-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's two-out single against Mesa proved to be the
game-winning hit, and Carl Everett provided plenty of insurance
with a three-run homer as the Astros won for the 13th time in their
last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge win for us,'' Astros second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``After three tough losses _ games that could have
gone either way _ we really needed this one.''
</P>
<P>
   There could not have been two more appropriate heroes than Alou
and Everett. Not surprisingly, the Astros' drought coincided with
cold stretches by both players. Before Saturday, Alou and Everett
had combined for just three hits in the first three games of the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's run of bad luck dates even farther than the previous
three games. After watching his batting average peak at .351 at the
end of May, the Astros outfielder is hitting just .221 this month.
The hit off Mesa was one of Alou's few recent at-bats that didn't
end with his batting helmet being slammed into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moises has been pretty cold for the last week or so, and I'm
hoping this is the sort of thing that can break him out of it,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``For some reason, I just
thought he would get a hit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Alou and Everett jumped on first-pitch fastballs from Mesa,
who was booed and hissed throughout his brief stint on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time Mesa is on the mound, I'm going to be looking for a
fastball every time,'' Everett said. ``That's his out pitch, so
that's what you have to go up there looking to get. I'm glad I was
able to give us a few insurance runs, because Cleveland has the
kind of team that can come back on you with one swing. We lost
three games in a row, and it wasn't any fun watching the other team
come back on us, because that's what we're usually able to do.
Hopefully, this will get us back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen, which had been derailed the previous few
days, was chugging at full speed Saturday. Doug Henry, Billy Wagner
and Reggie Harris combined for 4 scoreless innings and only
surrendered two hits. Wagner, who struck out three batters in 1
innings, qualified for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen is going to have its ups and downs just like
everyone else's bullpen,'' said Wagner, who lowered his earned run
average to 1.99. ``You just have to take the good with the bad and
go on about your business. Today was a good day, and more times
than not, we've been getting the job done. Doug and Reggie were
great.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling short of expectations in the first three games of
the trip, the Astros' offense was pretty good, too, piling up 15
hits, including three home runs and two doubles. Two of the homers
were particularly timely, because they tied the score against a
pair of tough relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ausmus' three-run shot off Eric Plunk tied the score at 4
in the seventh, and Jeff Bagwell's 15th homer of the season _ a
first-pitch solo effort off Paul Shuey _ knotted the score at 5 in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (scouting) reports told us this is the hardest-throwing
staff in the (American) league,'' Dierker said. ``Hard throwers
like to get strike one, and our guys seemed to be ready. We've got
guys up and down the lineup who can hit home runs, and today we got
some big ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros needed those long balls to offset the 1,209 feet's
worth of home runs surrendered by starter Jose Lima, who has served
up 18 gopher balls in his 17 starts this season. Four of the five
runs Lima allowed Saturday came on homers by Mark Whiten, Manny
Ramirez and David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a couple of mistakes, and they've got a great club,''
said Lima, who had a 2.61 ERA at the end of April but owns a 4.48
ERA in his last nine starts. ``If you make mistakes against these
guys, they're going to hurt you. They've got a hell of a lineup,
and you can't pitch around them all day. But I'm pleased, because
my job is to keep my club in the game, and that's what I did. I got
a no-decision, but I'll take 10 no-decisions if we win those 10
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 11-6 in games started by Lima, who has six
no-decisions, including five in his last eight outings. Indians
starter Dwight Gooden also received a no-decision, but he pitched
well enough to win, leaving the game to a standing ovation after
holding the Astros to three runs (two earned) in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the way Gooden was pitching, the Astros were happy
to seen the Indians' bullpen, especially Mesa, who lost his
closer's role to Houstonian Mike Jackson earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa retired the first batter he faced in the 11th before giving
up a one-out single to Bill Spiers, who was thrown out trying to
steal second base. After Derek Bell beat out an infield single and
Bagwell drew a walk, the stage was set for Alou, who has quite a
reputation for coming through in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be aggressive,'' said Alou, who is hitting .310
with runners in scoring position. ``I wanted Bagwell to walk,
because that would put me on the spot, and I love being on the
spot. Fortunately, I was able to come through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been playing the way I'd like to be playing lately,
but I knew (a slump) like this was coming, and I know how to get
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Saturday's go-ahead hit was just the thing to get Alou
and the Astros going again.

KINGS TAKE BIRON IN DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the National Hockey League draft began Saturday in Buffalo,
the Kings rated 18-year-old Mathieu Biron the eighth-best player
available, and the third-best defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were focusing on defensemen Saturday, but considering
their first selection wasn't until No. 21, they weren't exactly
counting on having a chance to add the mountainous 6-foot-6,
212-pounder to their collection of prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But Biron - rated the seventh-best player by NHL Central
Scouting - was still available when the Kings' turn came, and
General Manager Dave Taylor snapped him up. Biron had eight goals
and 36 points last season for Shawinigan in the Quebec Major Junior
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Taylor said when asked why Biron slipped so
low. ``Our scouts who see him all the time really like him. He's
got excellent size, he's a good skater for his size, he has good
reach, and he moves the puck well.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Taylor classified Biron ``a bit of a project,''
mainly because he needs to grow into his body by adding 10 or 15
pounds of muscle, and to become a more consistently physical
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing important is being drafted by an NHL team,''
Biron said when asked if he was disappointed not to have been
chosen sooner. ``To be drafted in the first round is not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings used this draft to stock up on defensemen. Among the
players they chose were two goalies, three forwards and four
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings had to wait to get started. Nearly two hours
before the Kings chose Biron, the Tampa Bay Lightning surprised no
one by picking QMJHL star center Vincent Lecavalier with the first
pick. Moments later, after moving up a spot by swapping picks with
the San Jose Sharks, the expansion Nashville Predators chose
talented Ontario Hockey League center David Legwand, a Detroit
native, with the second selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks used the fifth pick to make Russian defenseman
Vitaly Vishnevsky their first selection.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Kings selected one player in each of the nine
rounds: Biron, center Justin Papineau of Belleville in the Ontario
Hockey League; Russian goalie Alexey Volkov; Ontario defensemen Kip
Brennan; Quebec defenseman Joe Rullier; Czech defenseman Tomas
Zizka; Finnish center Tommi Hannus; center Jim Henkel from the New
England junior hockey league; and goalie Matthew Yeats from the
Alberta junior hockey league.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor seemed almost as excited about Papineau as he did about
Biron, comparing the tiny center from Ottawa to NHL stars Steve
Yzerman of Detroit and Joe Sakic of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor acknowledged that the 5-foot-10, 160-pound Papineau
has a way to go (and grow) before he will be ready to play in the
NHL. Papineau scored 41 goals in 66 games for Belleville, but his
size makes him a rarity among recent King draft choices. In the
last four drafts, the Kings have chosen 34 skaters, and only four
have been under six feet tall. Still, Papineau is considered a
solid all-around player with decent speed and playmaking ability,
and though the Kings got him with the 46th selection, he was rated
27th by Central Scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good player,'' Taylor said. ``He's been one of the
top players in his age group all along. He'll have to get stronger
before he can play in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   KING NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake and fiancee Brandy Fleming were married
Saturday night in Marina del Rey. ... The Kings lost goalie
Frederic Chabot to Nashville in Friday's expansion draft, meaning
they cannot lose a goalie in the draft to stock the new Atlanta
franchise next year. That's the good news. The bad news is the
Kings are completely without NHL-ready goaltending depth in their
organization after Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr. General Manager
Dave Taylor said, ``I think there are probably some goalies who
would be very interested in coming to Los Angeles because of our
lack of depth in goaltending.'' One possibility is Mike Buzak, 25,
who played in the IHL for the Ice Dogs and was under contract to
the Kings late last season. He's an unrestricted free agent.

Brazil displays championship form
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ As night fell and the lights of Paris twinkled, a cool,
damp sky draped itself around Parc des Princes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little Chile.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   As if to show all doubters that what they saw in the meaningless
first-round finale against Norway was just that _ meaningless _ the
Brazilians showed off their real game Saturday in a 4-1 romp past
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when neither slick conditions nor an inspired
Chilean team would keep Brazil from being wholly Brazil, from head
to toe.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, it was Cesar Sampaio's head and Ronaldo's toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit the net twice, you have a lot more friends'' said
Ronaldo, criticized by some for a lack of offense in the first
round. ``I like my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Sampaio scored two goals, the first on a beautiful header
off a free kick by Dunga in the 11th minute. The goal seemed to set
the Brazilian machine in motion and spark Ronaldo, who also
finished with two goals.
</P>
<P>
   From the 11th minute, Brazil began looking much more comfortable
at both ends of the field. Cesar Sampaio added his second goal in
the 27th minute and the creative Ronaldo scored his two on a
penalty kick in first-half injury time and a nice shot to the left
post after suckering Chile goalkeeper Nelson Tapia on a move to the
right post in the 70th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo had two great chances to add to his goal spree but
ricocheted both shots off the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to defend our title,'' Ronaldo said. ``It's our title
and tonight we played our best because from now on every moment
could be our last. We don't want it to end until we are champions
again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a marvelous show, if maybe not spectacular for Brazil,
which moves on to the quarterfinals Friday to face the winner of
today's game between Nigeria and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the kind of football that we can play tonight,''
Brazil coach Mario Zagallo said. ``The difference between the
Norway game (a 2-1 loss) and tonight was we had our full team back
and it played very well. We're going to keep winning. We're going
to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked like a championship team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A steady rain made the field soggy and had players slipping and
sliding, but Brazil used quicker movements and shorter passes to
adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio, who missed the Norway game because he
had received two yellow cards in the first two games, were by far
the most active players.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dunga, Roberto Carlos and Cafu controlled possession
at midfield. Chile had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against most teams, we are even,'' Chilean striker Ivan
Zamorano said. ``Today we thought we had a chance. But Ronaldo and
Cesar Sampaio can score at any moment and they beat us today. They
were better than us.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question possibly facing Brazil as it moves on is
whether Denilson will replace Bebeto at forward in the next game.
</P>
<P>
   Bebeto, a star at USA '94, never clicked with Ronaldo and looked
a step slow. When Denilson, 20, replaced Bebeto, 34, in the second
half, the Brazil offense clearly kicked into a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't as if Brazil struggled with Bebeto on the
field. It was his rebound pass to Cesar Sampaio that set up
Brazil's second goal.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Bebeto was jeered and whistled by Brazil's
perfectionist fans when he was replaced by Denilson in the 65th
minute, the score was 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a team that did everything it needed to do,'' Zagallo
said, when asked about whether Bebeto would be replaced. ``We went
ahead early. That's always what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Chile's national anthem lasted longer than their
chances, although they got a nice goal on a Marcelo Salas header
off an assist by Zamorano in the 68th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Despite controlling the ball early and making a few runs up the
sideline toward the Brazilian goal, the early Chilean control
proved a mere charade.
</P>
<P>
   Literally every chance the Brazilians had in the early going was
converted.
</P>
<P>
   They took their first shot in the 11th minute. And scored.
</P>
<P>
   They took their second shot in the 27th minute. And scored.
</P>
<P>
   They took their third shot on Ronaldo's penalty kick in
first-half injury time. And scored.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency made Chilean heads spin. And it made Brazilians
look ahead to bigger and better things, like defending their 1994
championship and winning an unprecedented fifth World Cup.

Holland has usual lofty goal
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ They are perennial heartbreakers, like a sort of Chicago
Cubs of the world soccer stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs traditionally boot baseballs. The Dutch boot soccer
balls.
</P>
<P>
   In any language and with any appendage, hearts break just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost every other nation, people celebrate going to the
second round,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said. ``Our people expect
much more. We are in the second round, but they are not happy yet.
They want to win the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, could this be the year for the Dutch?
</P>
<P>
   As the elimination round of the 1998 World Cup began with
Saturday's victories by Brazil and Italy _ traditionally clutch
teams with seven World Cup championships between them _ perhaps the
most intriguing contender left in the field is the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   It has no championships, but quite the World Cup story in its
wake.
</P>
<P>
   So many times the Dutch have come to the World Cup with an
immensely talented squad. So many times they have looked virtually
untouchable, but never more than in 1974 and 1978, when opponents
were all but conceding the trophy to a veritable dream team of
Dutch players.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Cruyff, Robbie Rensenbrink, Johan Neeskens, Ruud Krol.
</P>
<P>
   They are Ernie Banks-type of Hall of Fame names within the
sport, players who pioneered the ``total football'' style to which
all ensuing Dutch teams have aspired.
</P>
<P>
   But they lost in the Cup championship game, twice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``total football'' is a reputation the Dutch cherish and
this 1998 team seems to have again mastered, at times showing
remarkable skill in every phase of the game, depending on the
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The English are known for ``long-ball'' soccer, in other words,
tightening the defense and booting the ball long upfield hoping for
a break and an individual effort. The Brazilians are known for
ball-handling skill and quick-striking attacks. Italy likes to
counterattack and build from midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dutch have won using any of those styles. Total
football.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Dutch have won the European Championship and
reached the World Cup finals tournament seven times. The Dutch
professional league, led by Ajax, which is one of the winningest
professional teams in Europe, has produced countless superstars.
The youth and developmental programs in Holland are emulated around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the years and all the great teams, the Dutch have
zero World Cup trophies. And zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here for one reason,'' Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der
Sar said. ``We are here to win the Cup. I don't think we will be
happy unless we win. You need luck and skill. I know we have the
skill.''
</P>
<P>
   That much has been obvious to anyone who has seen the Dutch in
France.
</P>
<P>
   The play of Ronald de Boer, Phillip Cocu, Marc Overmars, Wim
Jonk and the super-popular Dennis Bergkamp have conjured up images
of the great 1974 and 1978 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch won the tough Group E, which included Belgium, South
Korea and Mexico. They will face Yugoslavia, a dark horse by most
accounts, Monday in Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Bebeto has said he considers this Netherlands team the
toughest he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   And Cruyff, in France as a commentator, says this team has
something the 1974 and 1978 sides did not have _ cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all pulling in the same direction,'' Cruyff told the
French sports daily, L'Equipe. ``This team has extremely great
qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet notice the hints of underachieving that have crept into the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dutch took command of Group E with a scoreless draw
with Belgium and a 5-0 whipping of South Korea last week, they
opened against Mexico with a blurring display.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch took a 2-0 lead over Mexico in the first 20 minutes,
meaning that in their first 225 minutes of the 1998 World Cup they
had not allowed a goal.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was a complacency that seemed to set in, a lack
of an ``over-my-dead-body'' attitude, as Hiddink called it.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico controlled the ball in the second half of the game and
cracked the Netherlands' defense for two goals to tie the score,
including one just 15 seconds before the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Amsterdam reporters grilled players and coaches,
one asking Hiddink, ``Why have you failed?''
</P>
<P>
   Hiddink's response: ``We're through (to the second round). We
haven't failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch fans, who are among the most supportive in the world,
decked out in bright orange jump suits and carrying horns and
whistles, looked in shock as they filed out of the stadium after
the Mexico game.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the two halves against Mexico might have perfectly
epitomized this nation's World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   It can devastate opponents. But it also can devastate itself.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the inconsistency was clear in sluggish
first-round games. Then, there was a hugely impressive win over
Ireland, then a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to eventual champion Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the team fell well short of expectations again, playing
miserably in the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And the ghosts that continue to haunt and hurt the most are from
1974 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The 1974 team dominated every opponent leading up to the Cup and
once the tournament began, Cruyff, Neeskens and Resenbrink charged
to remarkably easy wins, 4-0 over Argentina, 2-0 over East Germany
and 2-0 over Brazil. But in the final, even though the Netherlands
took a 1-0 lead before West Germany even touched the ball,
everything collapsed and West Germany prevailed 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the Dutch again overwhelmed supposed
contenders, taking out Austria, Italy and West Germany on the way
to the final. But, again, they fell apart in extra time against
Argentina and lost 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Dutch again look potentially overwhelming. They
say it could be their year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to learn from the (Mexico) game,'' van der Sar said.
``If we don't play the whole game, we could be in trouble.''

   Roffman, whose firm owns Viacom shares, agrees with that
enthusiasm and notes that Blockbuster's first-quarter cash flow was
up 6 percent while revenues rose 13 percent. Those trends should
continue, he said, adding, ``They have addressed what was their
major problem -- that customers could not find new films on a

   Blockbuster's resurgence isn't good news for everyone else.
``This is a mature industry, so what's going to happen is that

have great management, be the low-cost producer and have

three miles of a Blockbuster have seen revenues fall 11 percent
this year and has announced it might file a lawsuit alleging unfair
pricing in the revenue-sharing deals.
</P>
<P>
   But Blockbuster's recent success will have a profound impact on
the rest of the business. ``With Blockbuster doing it, everyone
else has to do it,'' media researcher Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tusher, who operates three Alamo Video stores in Ventura
County, believes Blockbuster's strategy is unfortunate for the
industry over the long term because it is redefining in customers'
minds how a video store should be stocked. It's also taking away
customer choices by overstocking the most popular films at the
expense of lesser-known titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 120 copies of `Tomorrow Never Dies' in a store,
it'll be dead in a week because there's no way that you have that
many people who want to see the movie,'' he said. ``I can't afford
to have that many, and I don't need that many anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   Tusher believes the chains are overlooking the importance of
stocking a wide selection of never-before-seen product. ``Most
people do not have a specific title in mind when they come to a
video store,'' he said. ``What they're interested in is value,
convenience, selection and service. You only get the complaint
about lack of a hit product once in a great while.''
</P>
<P>
   Business has been solid at Tusher's stores this year, up 8
percent over a year ago, which he attributes to savvy buying of
entertaining titles that didn't stay long in theaters such as
``Fallen'' and ``Switchback.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM's Bishop believes the small fry in the business need to be
looked after, too. ``We're in an environment that's changing very
quickly, so we have to be very cautious, particularly with
secondary titles,'' he said. ``The goal is to lift the business as
a whole and not just shift it from one side to another.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the year, the outlook has brightened
considerably with the recent announcement by Paramount that it
would release ``Titanic'' in video stores Sept. 1. ``The business
is going to explode with `Titanic,' '' Adams said.

COYOTES SELECT TOP-RATED GOALIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ The loudest applause during Saturday's entire NHL
entry draft came when the Coyotes, of all teams, made their
first-round selection. And they only had the 14th overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   The noise was so deafening, the Marine Midland Arena almost
started to shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my family and a bunch of my friends,'' said Patrick
DesRochers, the top-rated goalie in the draft, referring to the
wild celebration in the crowd when his name was announced by NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's at least 50 of them here today. They've all been
great. Especially my family. They've always been supportive of my
hockey career.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Coyotes' planned trade with Nashville for one of
the players the Predators took in Friday's expansion draft once
again was delayed. It will be announced early this week. Phoenix
likely will trade a draft pick to get a third- or fourth-line
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The traded pick probably won't be the 18-year-old DesRochers. If
he turns out to be half as good as the way his relatives can raise
the roof, the Coyotes may have found themselves the next Dominik
Hasek. According to scouts, he should be pushing Nikolai Khabibulin
for the No. 1 job in Phoenix within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   `We had him ranked really high,'' General Manager Bobby Smith
said. `We've always thought this guy was a genuine top prospect. We
watched him a lot and (goalie coach) Benoit Allaire has worked with
him before and we know he's a tremendous talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were smiles all around our table today when the 14th
pick came up and he was still there.''
</P>
<P>
   DesRochers, who was 26-17-11 with a 3.35 goals-against average
last season for Sarnia in the Ontario Hockey League, is the first
goaltender the franchise has ever picked in the first round.
Previously, the highest-drafted goalie in club history was Scott
Langkow, the 31st overall pick in 1993, whose job, like
Khabibulin's, just got a little tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a while before I'm ready to step in and play
at the NHL level, but who knows what's going to happen down the
road?'' said DesRochers, whose size (6-foot-3 {, 195 pounds) and
brilliant butterfly style impressed scouts across North America.
`I'm sure I'll go back (to Sarnia) for one more year of juniors and
then spend some time in the minors before I do anything in the
NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said there was only one other player rated higher in the
draft that he considered trading up to get. He wouldn't say who,
but he did say he would have done the same thing to get DesRochers.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of teams drafting ahead of Phoenix were rumored to be
eyeing him. Especially the Edmonton Oilers, who picked just before
the Coyotes at No. 13, and likely will lose star goalie Curtis
Joseph to free agency. But Edmonton took Barrie right wing Michael
Henrich instead, opening the door for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal picked the next highest-rated goalie, Eric Chouinard,
with the following selection at No.15.
</P>
<P>
   Considered to be almost as good as Roberto Luongo, last year's
goalie sensation who went fourth overall to the New York Islanders,
DesRochers had the eye of Coyotes scouts long ago. One of them, in
fact, Terry Doran, drafted him into juniors with a first-round
pick, making DesRochers only the second goalie in OHL history to go
that high.
</P>
<P>
   With their second pick, the 43rd overall, Phoenix took Finnish
defenseman Ossi Vaananen, a 6-foot-3, 200-pounder from Helsinki who
plays a rugged style and can skate extremely well. The Coyotes have
done well scouting in Finland, finding players such as Teppo
Numminen and Juha Ylonen, in addition to defenseman Juha
Gustafsson, their first pick last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to go in the second round, although, you know, I
was kind of hoping there was a chance I might go in the first,''
said Vaananen, who was ranked 13th among all European players in
the draft. ``I will go back to Finland and work very hard until my
time is ready to play for Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to drafting the first goalie and the first Finn, the
Coyotes also drafted the first high-school player when, in somewhat
of a surprise, they took Minnesota-born center Pat O'Leary with the
73rd pick in the third round. He averaged 25 goals and 52 points
each of his last two seasons and will play for the University of
Minnesota in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like our draft,'' Smith said. ``We probably took more
defensemen than we wanted to (four overall), but they were the best
players available at the time. Your first-round picks really
determine your draft, though, and we love the player we picked up
there.'' &QL;

FOX STRUGGLES TO REGAIN HIS RACING PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Stan Fox still can't remember the crash or the two
months that followed. They remain sealed in a place where memories
go when the race car you're in slams head-on into a concrete wall.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred seconds after the start of the 1995
Indianapolis 500, when Fox's machine veered sharply into the
outside wall in Turn 1 after apparently running over some rumble
strips.
</P>
<P>
   Although the impact sheered off the front half of the car, which
exposed Fox's dangling feet and legs, he miraculously suffered no
lower-extremity injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox took such a massive blow to the head that it left him
with a serious brain injury and put him in a coma for five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember anything about that wreck or my rehab,'' Fox
said. ``Maybe that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   It is good.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the horrible accident and its consequences, Fox is
determined to one day again return to the sight of one of the most
brutal crashes in Indy 500 history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start the 1999 Indianapolis 500,'' said Fox, who
will be 46 on July 7. ``That's all I want to do. I want to go back
there. I have to get back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What Fox did for three days this week at the Bob Bondurant
School of High Performance Driving near Chandler was participate in
an advanced oval driving course. A few weeks ago, Fox said he
attended a similar course in Florida at another driving school.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also drove several practice laps in a midget car Tuesday at
Manzanita Speedway, but he said the rust of a three-year layoff was
evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't hurt the car or spin out,'' Fox said. ``That was
my last time in a midget.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the last time in a race car, Fox said. Although he has
no set plan in an attempt to regain his driving touch, he wants to
move up the driving ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could drive an Atlantic car or whatever,'' said Fox, who
returned home Thursday to Wisconsin. ``I just want to keep driving
a bigger and bigger car. And I want to keep improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to go talk to any Indy-car owners yet. I
don't want to jack them around until I know I'm getting somewhere
with my driving.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a long road back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some work to do,'' Bondurant instructor Mike McGovern
said. ``He realizes that, too. He's going to get in as many cars as
he possibly can to bring himself, he hopes, back up to the same
speed he was before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the feel. I can tell that. The feel is still there,
meaning if the car gets loose, he can handle it. The part he's
having trouble with is the decision making that a driver goes
through on the racetrack. You know, learning which is the most
efficient way around a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox spent about nine hours over the three days in an open-wheel
Formula Ford and drove only on a small oval approximately a
quarter-mile in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely improved over the three days,'' McGovern said.
``His skills are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   But driving on a makeshift quarter-mile oval and driving on
Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile oval are two different
things, as different as a Volkswagen Beetle is to an army tank.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole goal is to get back to Indy,'' Fox said. ``That's
where I crashed and I want to get back there to pay it back. I
don't have to win. I just have to make it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to drive as hard as I can in all sorts of cars so I
can get better. I thought I did pretty good (in the Bondurant
course). My body knows what's going on, but there's other things I
have to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I got in the car (Monday), I forgot to buckle
my helmet. That happened again (Tuesday). That's never happened
before. But I'm going to remain positive. And I'm going to spend a
whole year in rear-engine cars trying to get back to Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of (the movie) ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.''
Well, I'm going to be ``Mr. Fox Goes to Indy.'' Just watch.'' &QL;

NBA LABOR PROBLEMS MAY SPLIT PLAYERS' RANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A league built on individual stars and free agents faces a
dangerous test that threatens to divide players.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA shutdown will begin Wednesday with owners in one camp
and the players union in another. The battle is drawn along classic
lines. For now.
</P>
<P>
   The owners can play a waiting game. Money from television
contracts will continue to fill their coffers. But there will be no
dependable stream of income for many players.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the players made minimum wage last season.
Nearly $300,000 a year is a very nice minimum, but nothing about
the NBA lifestyle is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   When bills start to add up in the fall, some owners are betting
the union will fall apart. November is when many players get
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The most explosive issue is the so-called Larry Bird exception.
Under the current collective-bargaining agreement, teams can pay
their free agents any sum. The result: The salary cap is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the cap was supposed be $26.2 million. The average
payroll was $32.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Owners contend 15 to 20 teams lost money. There's debate about
that number, but there's been little argument that players get 57
percent of total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough there for everybody, but the system isn't
working,'' said Suns President Jerry Colangelo, a member of the
owner's committee.
</P>
<P>
   The system, in fact, isn't working for a plurality of the
players. There are 39 stars who make at least $5 million a year and
149 players making the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a divide exists between the filthy rich and merely
wealthy. In part, the owners have themselves to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But, at some point, it's fair to predict that players at the
bottom will question the fairness of a system that seems to enrich
a few at the expense of many. &QL;

DID THE SUNS GET A STEAL IN BAI LEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY(at) 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They gathered around the television, a mixture of
relatives and home boys from Ladera Heights, and nobody could
understand. The names would come and go, including a couple of
schoolboys who wouldn't know the first thing about dropping in 26
points to win an NCAA championship. And as two hours stretched into
a lifetime, a night of celebration became a lay-up drill of
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Toby Bailey was back on the playground. Not the
Los Angeles legend dunking on impostors. Rather, like a kid no one
wants on their team, waiting to be picked, smiling through the
humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most disappointing thing in the world,'' Bailey said,
``to see players you know you're better than, players who haven't
proven themselves, getting picked ahead of you.''
</P>
<P>
   It is five days after the NBA draft, and you still need an
industrial-size fan to clear the smoke away from Jefferson Street.
Notre Dame Coach John McLeod says Pat Garrity will make a bigger
impression in the pros than he did in college. The brain expert is
touting the shape of someone's cranium. Danny Ainge is smiling as
if he stole Babe Ruth from the Red Sox. And, by the way, please
welcome Mark Bryant, your starting center for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   For all their bluster, the Suns' draft-day adventures cannot be
assessed until they parlay a first-round pick from the Dallas
Mavericks into a breathing entity. And by that time, the real coup
may have nothing to do with the peddling of Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Toby Bailey, who is smiling now, holding a
Suns' jersey in his arms, ready for a large helping of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely happy to be here,'' Bailey said. ``But I'm also
kind of (upset) that people disrespected me and didn't pick me in
the first round. So I'm definitely putting in the work this summer.
People will see a new Toby Bailey by next year.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing as reliable as an athlete who has been picked
apart by experts, robbed of a nice signing bonus, implicitly
informed that his game isn't so special, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Not that much has changed about Bailey's game since he was
touted for stardom. He's a wonderful rebounder for his size, a
nimble defender who once shut down Damon Stoudamire, an incredibly
gifted athlete with a 40-inch vertical. And if he ever develops a
consistent jump shot, the game is his.
</P>
<P>
   Why Bailey lasted into the second round is a mystery. Scouts
frowned on his performance at a rookie camp in Chicago, although
Bailey claims classes at UCLA hindered his workouts. Some say he
tapered off after his freshman season, even though he played out of
position for two years, inside a program swimming in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt kind of stifled in college,'' Bailey said. ``The NBA
game is more suited for me. I'll be playing my natural position,
I'll have that wide-open court, I'll be able to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Get past the overwhelming doses of optimism regarding the draft,
and we'll concede this: When the second round was on the clock and
Bailey's name remained unspoken, Ainge and general manager Brian
Colangelo did something smart. They picked up the phone, and the
Lakers bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have taken him ahead of 20 players in the draft,'' Ainge
said. ``I think Toby hasn't begun to scratch the surface of his
potential. Besides, we'll pass the ball a little more than UCLA
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day, you might look back and rue the day the Suns gave away
Nash. Or maybe, you'll only remember the day they stole Toby
Bailey. Either way, the Suns currently have enough players under
contract for a 3-on-3 tournament. Bailey will get a fair shot.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why his father is smiling, too, holding a Suns hat in
his hands, knowing something only a father would know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Toby signed with UCLA, he was like a throw-in,'' John
Bailey said. ``He saw it as a chance to prove people wrong, and he
did. We have a saying in our family: `Things always happen for the
best,' And, for some reason, Toby always plays well coming out of
adversity.''
</P>
<P>

ROENICK-FOR PICK DEAL NIXED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Had the San Jose Sharks not asked for the moon,
the Coyotes could have had themselves one of the brightest stars in
Saturday's NHL entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Coyotes passed on highly-touted center  &UR; David
 &UR; Legwand, &UR; who went to the Nashville Predators with the second
overall pick after the expansion team struck a last-minute trade
with San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, who talked with at least a half-dozen teams about
moving the No. 2 pick, apparently wanted center  &UR; Jeremy
Roenick, &UR; and possibly more, in exchange for the right to draft
Legwand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to them, but their price was way beyond what we were
willing to pay,'' Smith said, adding, ``I wouldn't trade Jeremy
Roenick for a No. 2 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did take a fifth-round pick from the Sharks, however,
dealing away the Coyotes' fifth-round pick next year so he could
take his second goalie in Saturday's draft,  &UR; Josh Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
   This is at least the third time in the past two years Roenick's
name has been linked to trade rumors involving San Jose. At the
trading deadline last season, the Sharks supposedly were willing to
deal center  &UR; Jeff Friesen and a player to be named for Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   Legwand, who scored 54 goals and 105 points last season for
Plymouth in the Ontario Hockey League, was rated as the second-best
prospect in the draft behind fellow center  &UR; Vincent Lecavalier, &UR; who
went No. 1 to Tampa Bay. Both are seen as can't-miss future stars.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, said he won't lose any sleep over passing on
Legwand. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Bowman watch &QL; 
 &QL; 
Detroit Red Wings Coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman said during a break in
Saturday's draft that he will make an announcement next week
regarding his decision to retire after winning eight Stanley Cup
championships or to return in hopes of leading Detroit to a third
consecutive title.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like a man who won't be back. And the recent death of
his 61-year-old brother,  &UR; Jack, &UR; may have something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has been very considerate. For the last seven years,
she's pretty much let me live with the team. . . . But with my
brother dying, she's worried. She wants me to enjoy life a bit
more.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ossi and the Worm &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smith didn't know how correct he was when he said Finnish
defenseman &UR; Ossi Vaananen, the Coyotes' second-round pick from
Helsinki, has a ``colorful character.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaananen, 17, convinced the entire Finnish national junior team
to dye their hair white on the eve of the European championships.
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever heard of  &UR; Dennis Rodman, the king of colored
hairdos?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure, I know who he is,'' Vaananen said. ``He's a
character. Just like me.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trading places &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nashville acquired eight players to bolster its roster following
Friday's expansion draft, in which the Predators selected one
player from each of the NHL's 26 established teams. The Coyotes
lost defenseman  &UR; John Slaney.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville acquired  &UR; Darren Turcotte (St. Louis),  &UR; Sergei
 &UR; Krivokrasov (Chicago),  &UR; Sebastien Bordeleau (Montreal),  &UR; Jim Dowd
(Calgary) and  &UR; Jan Vopat and  &UR; Kimmo Timonen (Los Angeles) for
future considerations. The Predators also got goalie  &UR; Dominic
Roussel and  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Staples from Philadelphia for a seventh-round draft choice and
 &UR; Ville
 &UR; Peltonen from San Jose for a fifth-round pick. &QL;

PLAYERS FALL FROM SUPER BOWL HEIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Neil O'Donnell's troubles began in Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He threw two bad interceptions in Super Bowl XXX, costing the
Pittsburgh Steelers the 1995 NFL title and assuring Dallas
cornerback
 &UR; Larry Brown of winning the game's Most Valuable Player award and
becoming a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's two interceptions enabled him to get a $2.5
million-a-year free-agent contract from the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, meanwhile, turned down an $18.75 million deal from
the Steelers and signed a five-year, $25 million deal with the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, both have been humbled.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, possibly the biggest free-agent bust ever, was released
by the Raiders this off-season and signed a deal with the Minnesota
Vikings that pays him $425,000 for one year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell is looking for work after being dumped by the New York
Jets last week. He was cut because he refused to reduce his '98
salary from $4.2 million to $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   His two seasons in New York were disastrous. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked eight times in his first game, a 31-6 loss to
Denver in the 1996 opener.
</P>
<P>
   He was 0-5 as a starter that season.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a separated shoulder in the sixth game.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to come back six games later but suffered a torn calf
muscle in pregame warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's options for next season are to sign with San Diego,
Seattle, Carolina or Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers are the only team for which he could start, and
that would only be until first-round draft pick  &UR; Ryan Leaf is
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far from being over for me,'' O'Donnell said. ``I have a
lot left. I'm going to find the right situation and make a run at
it.'' &QL; 
Straight shooters? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With O'Donnell gone, the Jets' quarterback job will go to  &UR; Glenn
 &UR; Foley, backed up by  &UR; Vinny Testaverde, signed after O'Donnell's
release.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, a Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells favorite, is unproven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a fair chance for the No. 1 spot,'' Foley said.
``That's all I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who was 8-20-1 as a starter in Baltimore, is joining
the team he rooted for growing up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Donnell, he also doesn't have fond memories of Sun Devil
Stadium, throwing five interceptions for the University of Miami in
a loss to Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl's 1987 national title
game. &QL; 
Liar, liar &QL; 
Two years ago,  &UR; Steve DeBerg was Coach Dan Reeves' quarterbacks
coach on the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   With Reeves' Atlanta Falcons looking for a backup quarterback,
DeBerg had a tryout last week.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBerg was asked his age, he told reporters he was 39.
</P>
<P>
   The former San Francisco/Denver/Tampa Bay/Kansas City/Miami
quarterback is 44. &QL; 
Nobody's Buddy &QL; 
Former Philadelphia Eagles owner  &UR; Norman Braman, the man who
gave &UR; Buddy Ryan his first NFL head coaching job, has few fond
memories of Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably be remembered historically in the National
Football League as the man who revolutionized defensive football,''
Braman said of Ryan, who later brought his ``46'' defense to the
Cardinals. ``Everything you see today (on defense) evolved out of
his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had a problem functioning within an organization. He
was a little man with a little man's inferiority (complex). I felt
a coach had to be a mirror image of the owner. And when I looked in
the mirror at Buddy Ryan, I didn't like what I saw.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Former Valley resident  &UR; Max McGee, the ex-Green Bay Packers tight
end, is retiring as the team's radio analyst after this season.
McGee, who lived in the Valley from 1978 to '90, has been working
for the Packers' radio network for 18 years.

AINGE DEFENDS GARRITY TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coach  &UR; Danny Ainge rejects criticism that the Suns
goofed in a draft-day deal for No. 19 pick  &UR; Pat Garrity, a Notre
Dame forward, instead of Kentucky center  &UR; Nazr Mohammed, picked No.
29 by Utah and traded to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said  &UR; Horacio Llamas will be more effective next season
than the unproven Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a few years for these guys to develop,'' Ainge said.
``I absolutely like Horacio better then Mohammed, or a few other
guys who were taken in the second round. We've been working with
him for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge also said  &UR; Loren Meyer can be better next season than
Mohammed. Meyer spent last season on the injured list, recovering
from back surgery. Ainge remembers how effective he was in
match-ups against
 &UR; Charles Barkley and others.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ainge said the 6-foot-11 Llamas has a good chance to
be a reliable backup next season. There was some surprise that
Ainge left Llamas off the playoff roster against San Antonio's big
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horacio was legitimately hurt,'' said Ainge, who added that
the Suns' acquisition of Dallas' 1999 first-round pick might one
day be a cornerstone in a deal for a first-rate center. ``I know
people thought we were hiding him, but he just underwent surgery
for a spur on his foot.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
 &QL; 
Name-dropping: Bulls guard  &UR; Steve Kerr has been mentioned as a
possible successor to  &UR; Steve Nash, whom the Suns traded to Dallas.
Kerr was the Suns' second-round pick in 1988 after a brilliant four
years at the University of Arizona. He still has a home in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   And former Suns Coach  &UR; John MacLeod of Notre Dame says Garrity
reminds him of Minnesota's  &UR; Tom Gugliotta and  &UR; Dave DeBusschere,
who helped the Knicks win two NBA titles. &QL;

MERCURY TAKES TO ROAD  
 GAME VS. MYSTICS BEGINS 5-GAME TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's one thing to win at home, where the Mercury
already has drawn a third of the WNBA's 15 five-digit crowds and
was 11-3 last season. The road is entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was 5-9 away from America West Arena in 1997 and just
1-5 in three of the cities it will visit during a seasonlong
five-game trip that begins today.
</P>
<P>
   Even here at the MCI Center, where the Mercury (5-1) is playing
for the first time, the environment will be plenty hostile. The
expansion Mystics (1-5) drew a WNBA record 20,674 for its first
home game, followed that up with a crowd of 14,314 and figure to
draw well again for a Sunday afternoon game that brings
media-friendly Cheryl Miller and her troops to entertain the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury broke on top, 11-0 and 22-8, in beating the Mystics,
69-54, less than two weeks ago, but has improved vastly since.
Closing its five-game homestand with a win over defending league
champion Houston and 96-63 mauling of Utah puts Phoenix in position
to accomplish what it previously couldn't in places such as Madison
Square Garden (0-2) and Charlotte Coliseum (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different ballgame on the road,'' Miller said.
``As comfortable and confident as we feel here (at home), people
feel in their arenas. We'll have some growing pains probably, but
the experience on the road will allow us to bond and jell as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-day trip actually is a two-parter. After playing here
today and in a nationally televised game against the New York
Liberty on Monday, the Mercury gets an extra day in the Big Apple
before games against Cleveland on Thursday and Charlotte, again on
national TV, on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   A flight to Phoenix immediately after the Sting game, which
begins at 10 a.m. (Arizona time), gives the team two full days at
home before it travels to Detroit for a July 8 initial meeting with
the Shock, coached by former Mercury guard Nancy Lieberman-Cline.
</P>
<P>
   If Phoenix, which opened the season with a road win vs.
Sacramento, finishes over .500 on the trip, it will be at least 8-3
when it returns July 10 to launch a season-long six-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we really believe we can win on the road,'' said
center Jennifer Gillom, the Mercury's leading scorer with an
18.2-point average. ``We didn't have this type of feeling last
year, and it stems from the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   A bench that outscored Utah, 42-25, even without forward
Michelle Griffiths, bumped to the starting lineup in place of
injured Toni Foster (stress fracture right leg). The Mystics will
be seeing 6-foot-5 backup center Marlies Askamp and Japanese
sharpshooter Mikiko Hagiwara for the first time, both having been
on the injured list for the first meeting June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's lone victory came before Tipper Gore, among those
at a sold-out home opener, 85-76 over Utah. Since then, the Mystics
twice dropped the battle of expansion teams in losing home and away
to Detroit, cut co-captain Tammy Jackson and nearly lost its other
captain, Nikki McCray.
</P>
<P>
   The former American Basketball League MVP suffered a severe cut
that sliced a nerve below her left elbow and required 12 stitches
to close during practice Wednesday. She played Thursday, scoring 23
points in a 79-71 loss to the Shock, as did starting point guard
Rita Williams, who took an elbow to the forehead Wednesday and had
to leave practice.
</P>
<P>
   McCray is averaging 21.5 points, second in the league behind
Houston's Cynthia Cooper, but so far not getting nearly enough help
from a lineup that includes Brazilian center Alessandra Santos de
Oliveira and rookie power forward Murriel Page from the University
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   McCray had 20 and Deborah Carter 11 in the first game with the
Mercury, but the rest of the roster combined for only 23. Phoenix
is giving up a league-low 64.2 points per game. &QL;

A VERY GOOD YEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The folks who run baseball have always talked about
how it's an amazingly resilient game, one that, basically, could
never really kill itself, no matter how stupid some of their
decisions have been.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 season is proof positive that the people running the
game are probably right, at least on this subject. Baseball is
enjoying its finest season since 1994, at least in terms of
record-breaking offensive numbers and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   That season, then-San Francisco Giant  &UR; Matt Williams, now with
the Diamondbacks, had 43 home runs when the season ended abruptly
on Aug. 11. We'll never know if he could have made a serious run at
 &UR; Roger
 &UR; Maris' single-season home run record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that three players _ St. Louis'  &UR; Mark
McGwire,
 &UR; Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Seattle's  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. _
have had the kind of first half necessary to make a run at Maris.
</P>
<P>
   We also know that Texas'  &UR; Juan Gonzalez has a legitimate shot at
chasing down  &UR; Hack Wilson's single-season RBI record of 190, a
record once believed untouchable. A September run by the four
sluggers would be wonderful for the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of shot in the arm the sport can badly use. There
are those who believe baseball is a dying sport. They are the same
people who believe basketball and football are overtaking baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Hah! It won't happen, no matter what the television numbers say.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball remains this country's game. Try and quickly remember
who won the 1986 Super Bowl or NBA Finals. If you're having
trouble, try and remember who won the '86 World Series. It's easy.
It was the year of  &UR; Bill Buckner and  &UR; Mookie Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   We've always been able to associate years with the World Series.
The same cannot be said for football or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Years from now we may be talking about 1998 as
the year Roger Maris' and Hack Wilson's records fell in the same
season. &QL; 
The Boss is in a jam &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees Boss  &UR; George Steinbrenner had a firsthand taste
of what Yankees fans must endure to watch a game in the south
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who flew into a New jersey airport last week and
then jumped into a limo to make his way to a Yankees game, got
stuck in traffic, just like everyone else on their way to Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but I saw what some of these people have to go
through to get to the games,'' said Steinbrenner, who is pushing
for a new home in midtown Manhattan. ``You have to love the Yankees
to do that, and they do, and I give them credit. Bumper to bumper
to bumper to bumper. I pulled up alongside one wagon full of kids
and the driver. I could tell they were all upset _ they all had
their Yankees hats on. I rolled down the window and said, `Don't
worry, they ain't starting until I get there.' They didn't have any
idea who I was.'' &QL; 
La-La Land or Lu-Lu Land? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The once stable-as-a-mountain Los Angeles Dodgers have turned
into a daily soap opera, with the players and coaching staff
changing more frequently than  &UR; Dennis Rodman's hair color.
</P>
<P>
   So in the interest of clearing up some of the rampant talk
surrounding the Dodgers, here's some more of the same (caution, use
at your own risk):
</P>
<P>
   Early talk from within the Dodgers organization has new
president  &UR; Bob Graziano and GM  &UR; Tommy Lasorda already sniping
behind each other's back and jockeying for power. It's anyone's
guess how long this marriage will last.
</P>
<P>
   All that talk of  &UR; Mike Piazza and  &UR; Bobby Valentine heading west
after the season is probably nothing more than talk. Piazza loves
New York, and Valentine has another year on his contract to manage
the Mets, who must waive a clause in order to allow Valentine to
manage elsewhere during the length of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   If  &UR; Tommy Lasorda wins the power play, expect  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Leyland to be the front-runner to land the managing post. If
Lasorda loses to Graziano, expect San Diego coach  &UR; Davey Lopes, and
possibly Yankees third-base coach  &UR; Willie Randolph, to be the
favorite. The only way  &UR; Glenn Hoffmann keeps the job is if he
guides the Dodgers into the playoffs. &QL; 
La-La or Lu-Lu, Part II &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could have some serious payroll problems next year.
They are on the hook to pay  &UR; Gary Sheffield,  &UR; Raul Mondesi,  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Bonilla,  &UR; Eric Young,  &UR; Eric Karros and  &UR; Jose Vizcaino a combined
$36.9 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dodgers have relievers  &UR; Dave Mlicki and  &UR; Greg
 &UR; McMichael under contract for a combined $4 million. Catcher
 &UR; Charles
 &UR; Johnson is arbitration eligible and can easily expect to be paid at
least $5 million. Even if  &UR; Ramon Martinez is injured and cannot
pitch, the Dodgers would probably have to acquire a front-line
starter. Price for that? About $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Dodgers are looking at about $53 million before
they fill out the rest of their roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``No general manager operates without some constraints,''
Graziano said. ``Every general manager has constraints, even if
it's $74 million. No one is unlimited in terms of spending on
player talent. Tommy is no different, as Fred was no different.
That's the challenge.'' &QL; 
What's Miami's area code? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Manager  &UR; Terry Francona so badly wanted to push for
several of his Phillies to be considered for the All-Star Game that
he telephoned the NL manager and left a 10-minute explanation on
his voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   After stating cases for several of his players other than  &UR; Curt
 &UR; Schilling, Francona hung up. Hours later he realized he'd called
Atlanta's  &UR; Bobby Cox. Of course, Florida's Leyland is this year's
NL manager, not Cox, who has managed four of the past six NL
squads. &QL;

GREG RAY'S WAY, NOT THE HIGHWAY 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANO, Texas _ Greg Ray says his most recent race-day successes
have marked him as one of the ``go-to guys'' of the Pep Boys Indy
Racing League. But for the immediate future, Ray will be going to
IRL races as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm riding a pretty big wave in everybody's mind right now,''
said Ray, who qualified second for the Indianapolis 500 in May and
finished second in the True Value 500K at Texas Motor Speedway
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks I'm one of the `go-to guys' right now,'' said
Ray, a 31-year-old resident of Plano. ``That's shown itself because
I have five contracts from IRL teams for me to sign, that if I
decided to drive for them, I could probably be racing at New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making left-hand turns at New Hampshire International
Speedway today, Ray will watch Race No. 5 of the IRL schedule from
the sidelines. After failing to attract a full-time primary sponsor
and having spent approximately $500,000 this season, the 1998
budget at Thomas Knapp Motorsports is running on methanol fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and team owner Knapp, a couple of card-carrying pragmatists,
have opted to skip today's race in Loudon, N.H., and the following
event at Dover, Del., on July 19 while they court long-term
financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   Ray seemingly is a perfect fit for what IRL founder Tony George
is selling with his fledgling, 3-year-old series _ an affordable,
all-oval program that theoretically will feature talented, young
American drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ray exhibited an aggressive, run-up-front driving style during
the Indianapolis 500 and the True Value 500-kilometer race in Fort
Worth. And his offtrack presence exceeded the expectations of his
most recent sponsor, AT&AMP;T Wireless Services of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the hangup?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Golden Rule,'' said Fort Worth's Johnny Rutherford, a
three-time Indy 500 winner. ``Them that has the gold, rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford, who also is the IRL's director of special projects,
said racing always has been run that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the big puzzles of this business,'' Rutherford
said. ``Finding sponsorship is the hardest job in the world, and it
all boils down to being in the right place at the right time. And
tripping somebody's trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Ray is hunting for the $3 million to $4 million deal
that will allow him and Knapp to retain the nucleus of their small
team and expand the supplies of personnel and parts over three
years. But if a major sponsor can't be secured in the next 60 to 90
days, Ray is willing to join an established IRL outfit _ Team
Menard would do nicely, for instance _ and bring Knapp along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable sitting out for a while as long as we put
ourselves in a position to have no excuses,'' said Ray, seated in
an office at Plano Marine, his family-owned boat and yacht
business. ``I don't want to blame our performance on money. I'm
just so tired of talking about `the money.' On race day, I don't
want to hear any bull about how this broke or we didn't get to test
or we missed the setup. I want everybody to have all the tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to say, `You've got yours. I've got mine.
Let's race.'''
</P>
<P>
   Infinitely confident, Ray nevertheless continues to struggle
with an infinitely confounding identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went out and asked Joe Blow on the street corner about
Greg Ray, they'd say, `Greg Who?''' said Ray, who won the Sports
Car Club of America's Formula Ford 2000 championship in 1992 and
the SCCA's Formula Atlantic title in 1993. ``To sell a big sponsor,
you can't be `Greg Who?' You have to be `Greg Somebody' for them to
want to participate in a big program. This is how I'm perceiving
it: `There's just no big ``oooomph'' on what you did before.'''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Ray has come to the big ``oooomph'' of an IRL
victory was his runner-up finish to Billy Boat by .928-seconds at
TMS in Fort Worth on June 6. Ray's black No. 97 Dallara/Aurora
carried backing from AT&AMP;T Wireless Services for the night race. Ray
answered the call around the 1.5-mile trioval, at speeds exceeding
227 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T signed on only for the Fort Worth race, and we weren't
pushing to go to the next race and the next race. We're very soft
that way,'' Ray said of a deal struck with Gary Fleming, the vice
president of AT&AMP;T's Business Markets Division.
</P>
<P>
   As the race at TMS wound down, Ray drove up under the rear wing
of Boat's No. 11 Dallara/Aurora _ owned by four-time Indy 500
winner A.J. Foyt of Houston and sponsored by financial services
giant Conseco of Carmel, Ind. Ray even cut corners off the
manicured infield grass in pursuit of victory. He was
breathtakingly fast, just not fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promised them a good show,'' Ray said. ``We got a ton of
good media throughout the country. It was a great investment for
AT&AMP;T. In seven days, we did a better job than anybody on this
planet could have done, on or off the racetrack. I believe they
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Gary, public relations manager of AT&AMP;T Wireless Services,
confirmed that Ray made a huge impression with Fleming and his
corporate cohorts beginning with the Indy 500, where his
underfinanced team led 18 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he got on our radar screen,'' Gary said. ``He's a
hometown boy, and we have a major presence in Texas. We're very
happy with his performance in the race. Second is terrific. We were
just trying to get through the week, and he did more broadcast
media than I ever thought he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said negotiations are continuing with AT&AMP;T for a long-term
package.
</P>
<P>
   Ray could have avoided all this uncertainty. Last fall, he was
the leading driver candidate at Panther Racing, LLC, of
Indianapolis. The team's owners include Baltimore Ravens
quarterback Jim Harbaugh, TV executive Terry Lingner and veteran
Indy-car crew chief John Barnes. The job at Panther Racing came
gift-wrapped with primary sponsorship from Pennzoil, among the
highest-profile corporations to climb aboard the IRL bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he truly was excited by the prospect but went into the
negotiations with three specific requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wanted Firestone tires, Dallara chassis and Tom Knapp
to engineer my race car,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically, Barnes nixed all three requests, and the seat went
to veteran Scott Goodyear. Barnes said Ray's ``demands'' did not
make much difference in who got the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical driver,'' Barnes said with a laugh. ``We really like
Greg a lot. It just didn't work out with our sponsor.'' Barnes
added that Ray was as aggressive in his business dealings as he is
in dealing with race traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an attitude. And that's not all bad,'' Barnes said.
``It's his way of dealing with motor racing and life. A lot of
people build that fence around themselves, and that seems to be the
case with Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said that for the longest time after that deal fell through,
he felt he had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never been a difficult person to work with. I'm real
honest in what I say,'' Ray said. ``I could have made the better
part of $1 million this year taking that deal. To date, I've made
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's hard for me ... if I think Firestone tires are a
better tire and Dallara has a better chassis, and I know Tom and I
are capable of doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have already taken me to be a little bit cocky and
have a big ego. I just think they're taking it the wrong way.
That's my way of expressing that I have a lot of self-confidence. I
don't beat around the bush with what I want. I want to win. I want
to win. I want to win. In racing, if you don't believe you can win
and you don't believe you should win, then guess what _ you're
probably not. Because people like me are going to kick your butt.''

A PEEP AT THE SHEEP: BIGHORN OUT ING SET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Desert bighorn sheep are unusual, fascinating
creatures. The vast majority of Arizonans have seen them only in
zoos or on TV wildlife shows.
</P>
<P>
   Being out among them in the wild is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest adventure is accompanying biologists on a sheep
capture and transfer. One method is to fly over an animal with a
helicopter and fire a net over it. Another is to bait sheep to a
certain spot, then fire a huge net over them, capturing many at
once.
</P>
<P>
   The bighorns then are examined, treated for diseases, loaded
onto trailers and taken elsewhere to be released as part Arizona's
successful program to reintroduce sheep to their historic habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as exciting is to travel the Colorado River below Hoover
Dam. There is a large number of bighorns along the river here, and
they don't seem particularly concerned by boats.
</P>
<P>
   It's thrilling to look up at the rugged cliffs and see a big ram
looking down at you. It's even better when he comes to the river to
drink. The big rams are careful when they drink. It's doubtful they
could float because of their heavy horns and might drown if they
fell in.
</P>
<P>
   But few observers get that experience.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Arizona Game and Fish Department is providing a
free Watchable Wildlife Clinic, with a focus on bighorn sheep, July
17-18 in the northwest part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic will begin on a Friday at 6:30 p.m. in Kingman.
Participants will meet at Game and Fish's regional office, 5325 N.
Stockton Hill Road, where they will spend about two hours learning
about how to view wildlife, how to find it and how to photograph
it. Then the session will focus on bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, participants will gather at Willow Beach
Marina on the river, where Game and Fish personnel will take them
upriver by boat to find and view bighorn sheep up close.
</P>
<P>
   Since the breeding season will be in progress, the rams should
be providing plenty of noise when they start banging heads.
</P>
<P>
   Due to limited boat availability and meeting room seating, the
clinic will be limited to 40 participants. Children under the age
of 16 won't be allowed to attend because viewing requires
considerable patience and a minimum of movement and noise.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested should make their reservations by calling the
Kingman Game and Fish office at (520) 692-7700. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Speaking of wildlife . . . &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How would you like to run around in the middle of the night,
using a spotlight to look for animals _ and be doing a service for
them?
</P>
<P>
   The Aubrey Valley near Seligman isn't too far east of Kingman,
and the Arizona Game and Fish Department is looking for volunteer
help there.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the endangered black-footed ferret was reintroduced
to Arizona. This program has produced some of the first ferrets
ever born in the wild but still is being managed intensely.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ferrets were transplanted to Arizona, biologists did
extensive surveys of prairie dog villages in Arizona to make sure
no native ferrets were present. Prairie dogs are the natural prey
of ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   Since ferrets are nocturnal creatures, walking around in a field
with a spotlight and looking for the green eyes of a ferret to
shine keeps you interested. If that's not enough, there might be a
fox or coyote staring back.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24-29, Aug. 21-26 and Sept. 25-30, biologists will be
doing surveys of the prairie dog communities at Aubrey Valley to do
a count on the ferrets. The more help, the better. That's why
volunteers are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The work will begin at sundown and last until sunrise.
Volunteers must bring binoculars, camping equipment and their own
food.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in participating on some of the nights should
contact biologist Richard Winstead at Game and Fish's Kingman
regional office, (520) 692-7700. &QL;

KONERKO WON'T BE PART OF DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cincinnati Reds want prospects for closer Jeff
Shaw, so the Dodgers spent much of Saturday's batting practice
reassuring left fielder Paul Konerko that he will not be part of
any deal.
</P>
<P>
   New manager Glenn Hoffman had Konerko last season at Triple-A
Albuquerque, where Konerko was named Minor League Player of the
Year after hitting .323 with 37 home runs and 127 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Dodgers player development staff the past
five seasons, Hoffman was asked if he is ready to dispatch
prospects he nurtured personally to get a player who can help now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to evaluate the talent I've seen and report on
that,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko has struggled most of the season, but he entered
Saturday's game with five hits in eight at-bats on the home stand,
including a two-run homer in Friday's 5-2 Dodgers victory. Konerko
was 0 for 2 Saturday before leaving the game in the sixth inning
after fouling a ball off his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an outstanding talent and we wanted to make sure he knew
that,'' Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible shuffle of talent raises a question. When third
baseman Bobby Bonilla, placed on the 15-day disabled list with a
growth in his colon, returns, will it be in left field in place of
Konerko? Or at third, where top prospect Adrian Beltre has played
well since his call-up Monday?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, after what I've been through, I don't care where I
play,'' said Bonilla, who learned Wednesday the growth was not
cancerous. ``I just know that I'm feeling much better and that I
feel my strength returning. That other stuff will take care of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallach chosen: The Dodgers named former third baseman Tim
Wallach manager of the organization's Single-A club at San
Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was hoping former coach Mark Cresse would take the job,
but Cresse turned it down. All three major-league coaches Lasorda
reassigned Wednesday have declined new positions in the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Smith rejected a spot as the manager of Triple-A
Albuquerque. Pitching coach Goose Gregson originally accepted a
similar position with San Bernardino but called the Dodgers on
Saturday and said he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping we'd go 3 for 3 with them, but instead we went 0
for 3,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach, a five-time All-Star with Montreal, played with the
Dodgers from 1993-95 and part of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy is a great student of the game,'' Lasorda said. ``When
he was a player, I told him he would be a manager someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino worse: Shortstop Jose Vizcaino, who suffered a severely
sprained right ankle last Sunday in Denver, has not improved and is
scheduled to have an MRI today.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino, who was placed on he 15-day disabled list but expected
to miss a month, is no longer walking with the help of crutches. He
said the swelling is down but the pain is constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it is this bad,'' he said. ``I really thought
it would be better by now. I don't know what to think.'' &QL;

NORWAY'S EFFORTS ALL FOR NIL

   MARSEILLE _ OK, so it wasn't bellissimo. But it wasn't brutto,
either. The ``kings of 1-0,'' as the French call their blue-shirted
neighbors, did what they do best Saturday afternoon inside the
scorching cauldron that was the Stade Velodrome _ survive. Italy 1,
Norway 0. It was all still tutto bene for the Azzurri in the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very good match indeed,'' coach Cesare Maldini proclaimed,
after his side had earned a quarterfinal date with Sunday's
France-Paraguay victor. ``We didn't take many risks and had two or
three good opportunities to score. I thought we deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Azzurri needed was Christian Vieri's goal in the 18th
minute off a classic counterattack. Then they sat back in their
half and let the overheated Norwegians trip over themselves trying
to score. It wasn't lovely, but after what they've been through
since the last Cup, the Italians aren't interested in lovely.
</P>
<P>
   They were whacked out of the 1996 European championships in the
first round. They blew their qualifying group despite blanking
England at Wembley because they couldn't beat the Georgians. So the
Azzurri had to go to Moscow and play the Russians in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   And though they won their here by 4 points, it wasn't easy. The
Italians needed a penalty kick by Roberto Baggio on a dubious hand
ball five minutes from time to tie Chile. They beat Cameroon, 3-0,
but the Africans played a man short for the second half and the
Azzurri didn't score their second goal until the 75th minute. And
they didn't put away winless Austria until the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy must suffer to win,'' said captain Paolo Maldini. ``But
we're ready to suffer until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Italians were 6-2-2 against Norway, including a
10-on-11 win at the Meadowlands in 1994, they were prepared to
sweat blood Saturday. The Norwegians, after all, had beaten
defending champion Brazil with two goals in the final seven minutes
to get here after being dominated all night. ``They beat the
giant,'' shrugged Cesare Maldini.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians knew that the Norwegians were fit, patient, and
calculating. They sit back in their 4-5-1, wait for a mistake, and
storm back on the counter, looking for striker Tore Andre Flo. But
the Italians wrote the book on counterattacking, and as soon as
Norway brought too many men forward and missed, they went for the
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Here was Luigi Di Biagio, the clever midfielder from AS Roma,
launching a lovely through ball for Vieri, who dashed between two
defenders and ripped the ball past keeper Frode Grodas for his
fifth goal of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians would have equalized in the 71st minute had
Italian keeper Gianluca Pagliuca not gotten a glove on Flo's header
just before it went over the line.
</P>
<P>
   That is how the kings of 1-0 endure _ by getting what they need,
then forcing you to come at them again and again while they throw
their sky-blue net over you. When it was done, the Norwegians
walked off shaking their heads, saying that the Italians would
never beat France. ``I'm not very impressed with Italy,'' Norwegian
coach Egil Olsen said. ``They won because we didn't play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bello, brutto, the Italians weren't quibbling. All they knew was
that the Norwegians are going back to Oslo and they are going on to
Saint-Denis and the final eight. If this is suffering, bring the
pain.

RED SOX FLATTEN SLOPPY MARLINS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ At this point, sweeping the misbegotten Marlins becomes
secondary, especially when the Floridians are so accommodating,
adding missed pop flies to a repertoire that already includes wild
pitches, passed balls, and throwing errors.
</P>
<P>
   More important for the Red Sox, who made it two in a row over
the Marlins with a 9-4 win Saturday night and matched their
high-water mark of 16 games over .500 with their third straight
win, is to escape before a Florida pitcher inflicts bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't as easy as it may sound. Reggie Jefferson, playing
first base in place of the injured Mo Vaughn, was drilled in the
back of the head by a fastball from Marlins rookie Jesus Sanchez in
the fifth inning. An inning later, Nomar Garciaparra, who earlier
extended his hitting streak to 19 games, was struck in the back by
a breaking ball from Marlins near-rookie Matt Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   And for coming attractions, the Red Sox Sunday have to face
another rookie, Ryan Dempster, who in just 24 2/3 innings already
ranks third in the league in hit batsmen with seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a danger any time you're throwing the ball inside and
don't know where it's going,'' said Red Sox starter Tim Wakefield,
who wasn't exactly the picture of control himself, walking five. He
ran his rec-ord to 9-3 by checking the Marlins on six hits in 7 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, until Wakefield walked pinch hitter Derrek Lee _ ball
four escaping catcher Jason Varitek for his second passed ball that
helped lead to Wakefield's exit in the eighth _ he'd walked only
one man, Todd Zeile, but did so all four times he faced him. Was he
pitching around the Marlins' cleanup hitter, one of the few Florida
players whose time in the big leagues can't be measured by the
second hand on a watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Wakefield said. ``I just couldn't throw him a strike. I
don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson apparently sustained nothing worse than a terrific
headache when Sanchez's fastball caught more of his helmet than his
head on an 0-and-1 count in the fifth. He sprawled face down in the
dirt before being assisted to a sitting position by trainer Jim
Rowe, then rose to his feet and walked off the field under his own
power. X-rays were negative, and Jefferson, who returned to the
team's hotel before the end of the game, was reported to be alert
and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Jefferson was OK allowed the Red Sox to turn their
attention after the game to the grievous offense committed by one
of their own: Reliever Jim Corsi, who batted for only the second
time in a major league career that began 10 years ago, broke
catcher Scott Hatteberg's bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the few chances in my whole life to get a big-league
knock,'' moaned Corsi, who grounded to third to end the eighth
inning. ``And I think Hattie's mad at me because I broke his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who singled home a run in the first, walked in the
third, and singled and scored in the fifth, was struck near the
shoulder blades by Mantei in the sixth. He became the third Red Sox
in two games to be hit by a pitch, as Lou Merloni was hit by rookie
Joe Fontenot Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The evening already had been an adventure for Jefferson, who
hasn't worn a glove all season and found leather to be an ill fit
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Vaughn nursing a strained hamstring, Jefferson found
himself at first base. He singled and doubled in his first two
at-bats against lefthander Sanchez after having had just 12 at-bats
against lefties this season.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made errors on two of the three ground balls hit his
way. Ryan Jackson's groundball skipped underneath his glove for an
error to open the second, and Cliff Floyd's high bouncer clanked
off his glove for another error in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Ashley, who had never played first base before signing
with the Red Sox and being given a first baseman's mitt in
Pawtucket, replaced Jefferson after his beaning and showed manos de
piedra (hands of stone), too, botching Todd Dunwoody's easy hopper
in the seventh. Seldom has Vaughn resembled a Gold Glove candidate
more than when compared to the alternatives on his own team.
</P>
<P>
   But the errors were of little consequence, especially on a night
when Marlins fielders were unable to detect falling objects out of
the sky. With the Red Sox already leading, 4-1, Marlins fielders
missed pop flies by consecutive hitters after Garciaparra lined a
single to open the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   That loaded the bases, and a run scored when Jefferson was hit
by Sanchez. ``Tough way to knock in a run,'' manager Jimy Williams
said. An easier time was had by Mike Benjamin, who drew a
bases-loaded walk from Sanchez's successor, Mantei, to make it 6-1
and Darren Lewis lined an RBI hit on an 0-and-2 pitch to make it
7-1.
</P>
<P>
   An artistic triumph, it wasn't. But Williams never was one for
style points, anyway. ``It was a good win for us, as far as I'm
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On deck: a sweep. Strap on your helmets, and bring plenty of
aspirin.

KINGS TAKE BIRON IN DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the National Hockey League draft began Saturday in Buffalo,
the Kings rated 18-year-old Mathieu Biron the eighth-best player
available, and the third-best defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were focusing on defensemen Saturday, but considering
their first selection wasn't until No. 21, they weren't exactly
counting on having a chance to add the mountainous 6-foot-6,
212-pounder to their collection of prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But Biron - rated the seventh-best player by NHL Central
Scouting - was still available when the Kings' turn came, and
General Manager Dave Taylor snapped him up. Biron had eight goals
and 36 points last season for Shawinigan in the Quebec Major Junior
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Taylor said when asked why Biron slipped so
low. ``Our scouts who see him all the time really like him. He's
got excellent size, he's a good skater for his size, he has good
reach, and he moves the puck well.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Taylor classified Biron ``a bit of a project,''
mainly because he needs to grow into his body by adding 10 or 15
pounds of muscle, and to become a more consistently physical
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing important is being drafted by an NHL team,''
Biron said when asked if he was disappointed not to have been
chosen sooner. ``To be drafted in the first round is not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings used this draft to stock up on defensemen. Among the
players they chose were two goalies, three forwards and four
defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings had to wait to get started. Nearly two hours
before the Kings chose Biron, the Tampa Bay Lightning surprised no
one by picking QMJHL star center Vincent Lecavalier with the first
pick. Moments later, after moving up a spot by swapping picks with
the San Jose Sharks, the expansion Nashville Predators chose
talented Ontario Hockey League center David Legwand, a Detroit
native, with the second selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks used the fifth pick to make Russian defenseman
Vitaly Vishnevsky their first selection.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Kings selected one player in each of the nine
rounds: Biron, center Justin Papineau of Belleville in the Ontario
Hockey League; Russian goalie Alexey Volkov; Ontario defensemen Kip
Brennan; Quebec defenseman Joe Rullier; Czech defenseman Tomas
Zizka; Finnish center Tommi Hannus; center Jim Henkel from the New
England junior hockey league; and goalie Matthew Yeats from the
Alberta junior hockey league.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor seemed almost as excited about Papineau as he did about
Biron, comparing the tiny center from Ottawa to NHL stars Steve
Yzerman of Detroit and Joe Sakic of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor acknowledged that the 5-foot-10, 160-pound Papineau
has a way to go (and grow) before he will be ready to play in the
NHL. Papineau scored 41 goals in 66 games for Belleville, but his
size makes him a rarity among recent King draft choices. In the
last four drafts, the Kings have chosen 34 skaters, and only four
have been under six feet tall. Still, Papineau is considered a
solid all-around player with decent speed and playmaking ability,
and though the Kings got him with the 46th selection, he was rated
27th by Central Scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good player,'' Taylor said. ``He's been one of the
top players in his age group all along. He'll have to get stronger
before he can play in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   KING NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake and fiancee Brandy Fleming were married
Saturday night in Marina del Rey. ... The Kings lost goalie
Frederic Chabot to Nashville in Friday's expansion draft, meaning
they cannot lose a goalie in the draft to stock the new Atlanta
franchise next year. That's the good news. The bad news is the
Kings are completely without NHL-ready goaltending depth in their
organization after Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr. General Manager
Dave Taylor said, ``I think there are probably some goalies who
would be very interested in coming to Los Angeles because of our
lack of depth in goaltending.'' One possibility is Mike Buzak, 25,
who played in the IHL for the Ice Dogs and was under contract to
the Kings late last season. He's an unrestricted free agent.

STAR BERTH COULD ELUDE GARCIAPARRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even with All-Star rosters inflated to 30 players
because of the addition of two expansion teams, a deserving
shortstop is likely to be left off the American League team.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if it's Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about it,'' said Garciaparra, who was an
All-Star selection as a Red Sox rookie and has come back from a
separated shoulder to post numbers that would seem to warrant a
return trip. ``That's not why I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has a 19-game hitting streak, extending it Saturday
night with a run-scoring single in the first inning against the
Florida Marlins after having his first four-hit game of the season
in Friday night's 6-1 win over the Fish. Garciaparra is batting
.407 (33 for 81) during the streak, and in his last 10 games has 10
extra-base hits: five doubles, four home runs, and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's streak is tied for longest in the American League
with streaks by Damion Easley of the Tigers and Carlos Delgado of
the Blue Jays, and it is within one game of matching Larry Walker
of the Rockies for longest streak in the majors. Already he's on
the second-longest streak of his brief career, eclipsed only by the
rookie-record 30-game streak he had last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anybody who plays against the guy,'' teammate Lou Merloni
said, ``and they'll all say he should be on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a chance it won't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez of the Mariners is a runaway leader in the
voting, and deservedly so. Rodriguez is batting .319 and, with 26
home runs and 21 stolen bases, is on track to join Jose Canseco and
Barry Bonds as the only players with 40-40 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter of the Yankees has made just three errors in 62
games, is hitting ..312 with nine home runs, and has been mentioned
frequently as an MVP candidate on the best team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Omar Vizquel, whose manager, Mike Hargrove, will be
managing the AL stars. Vizquel may be the best defensive shortstop
in the game. He entered Saturday's game with just one error in his
last 110 games, dating to Aug. 19, 1997. And the error he made was
on the easiest of plays, as he dropped a chest-high flip from
Indians second baseman David Bell on an attempted force play.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, who has won the Gold Glove in each of the last five
seasons, is the most spectacular of the shortstop candidates
defensively, a master at plucking bouncing balls out of midair with
his bare hand. Hargrove would be well within his rights to reward
one of his own with an All-Star selection.
</P>
<P>
   So, where does that leave Garciaparra? Rodriguez's offensive
numbers far outrank everyone else's, of course. But Garciaparra's
batting average is three percentage points higher than Jeter's,
..317 to .312, and the Sox shortstop has two more home runs and 9
more RBIs than his Yankee counterpart in virtually the same number
of games: Jeter 62, Garciaparra 61.
</P>
<P>
   The statistic in which Jeter has a clear edge is errors.
Garciaparra has made 10, one fewer than Rodriguez has made in 80
games and seven more than Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   But the way he is swinging the bat, Garciaparra almost certainly
will have much better numbers than he had at the break last season.
He already has more RBIs (48 to 44 at last year's break), nearly
the same number of home runs (11 to 13), and a significantly higher
batting average (.317 to .291).
</P>
<P>
   Merloni played with Garciaparra in the shortstop's first two pro
seasons, in 1994 with Sarasota and 1995 with Trenton. He's seen
quite an improvement. ``In the field, I don't think anything has
changed,'' Merloni said. ``He's still making the great plays he
always has. The biggest difference is obviously the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten so much stronger and hitting the ball so much
harder. Saturday night, when he got his fourth hit, guys in the
dugout started laughing, he's just so on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in Double A and hitting .260, you'd figure he'd
improve, hit in the .285 range while his glove would take him
anywhere. But now he's got the all-around complete game. No matter
what they throw up there, he hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would I pitch him? I'd try to walk him. You know how
little he likes to walk.''

REVOLUTION DROP 8TH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ A great start couldn't do it. The return of Joe-Max
Moore and Mike Burns from World Cup duty couldn't do it. Even
playing the struggling and usually good-for-what-ails-them Dallas
Burn couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution took leads of 2-0 and 3-1 Saturday night but
ended up falling to the Burn, 4-3, in a shootout at Foxboro
Stadium, running their losing streak to eight games with a
three-game road trip ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach Thomas Rongen knew the Burn were missing a
couple of their top scorers. Knew the Revolution had beaten the
Burn the last six times they'd met. And knew the Burn were coming
in off a pair of 1-0 losses.
</P>
<P>
   And he still warned that the Burn were going to be tough. And
resilient.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly were.
</P>
<P>
   They weathered the early Revolution attack. Survived an own goal
in the ninth minute. Withstood the work of Moore, who set up a pair
of first-half goals, one a highlight-film score by Raul Diaz Arce
and the other a blast by Edwin Gorter that created a 3-1 Revolution
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to come in here and steal one,'' said Dallas coach
David Dir. ``It seems we've had a couple stolen from us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was more resilient for the Burn than defender Ted Eck. He
played a significant role in the Dallas comeback _ after helping
create the deficit. He was charged with the own goal when he, with
Ivan McKinley pressuring, headed the ball into the Burn net as he
tried to clear a nice Gorter corner kick.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, following the one by Arce, made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kreis got one back for the Burn with a direct kick blast
after a handball call on Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter's goal made it 3-1 before Dallas forward Damian answered
with some pretty footwork that got him by the Revolution defense
and keeper Ian Feuer. The Revolution thought Damian was offsides.
The goal cut it to 3-2 late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eck who tied it at 3-3 with a blast in the 56th minute.
The Burn had taken over control of the play, and the Revolution
were having all sorts of problems in their own end until Eck
stepped up, collected an errant McKinley clear that bounced off the
referee, and buried the shot.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was Eck's goal in the shootout that finished off
Revolution and boosted the Burn to a win.
</P>
<P>
   Four Dallas players got their shootout attempts past Jeff
Causey, who came off the bench to replace Feuer late in the game.
New England's Imad Baba and Burns made their shots, too, but keeper
Mark Dodd stopped McKinley's shot and Moore's went wide of the net,
and the Burn had the 1 point for a shootout win.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution now must take their losing streak on the road.
They are at Kansas City on Wednesday, at Tampa Bay on Saturday, and
at Colorado July 11. Their next game at Foxboro Stadium is July 14
against D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had chances late in regulation to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Baba, a late substitution, set up an Arce header that went just
wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn also had a good chance, a Damian attempt that went wide
in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, though, the Revolution jumped out on top and then
couldn't sustain it. They had chances to widen their lead, and
didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had the 3 points (for a win),'' Moore said. ``In
the first 15 minutes, you're up, two-nothing, and you should figure
out a way to win it at that point. Once again, we let the other
team back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rongen thought a turning point might have been in the opening
minutes of the second half, when, with the Revolution ahead, 3-2,
Gorter and Arce worked a pretty give-and-go in close but came up
with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive failures tell only part of the story, though. With six
goals in their two games _ they lost to New York/-New Jersey, 5-3,
Wednesday _ the Revolution's focus is squarely on the defense and
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six goals in two games, and you'd like to think that anywhere
in the world those will be two Ws,'' Rongen said. ``We're working
hard and we need to work on our defense. We're giving up too many
goals and we're giving up too many soft goals.''

DUCKS DRAFT DEFENSEMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks could use some immediate help on defense as
they attempt to bounce back from a disastrous 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, they may have laid the foundation of their defensive
future Saturday by selecting defensemen with their first two picks
in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   With the fifth pick of the first round, the Ducks drafted Vitali
Vishnevsky, a 6-foot-2, 187-pound defenseman from the Ukraine. With
their second-round selection (No.32 overall), they chose 6-21/2,
205-pound defenseman Stephen Peat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ducks assistant general manager David McNab admitted
both are probably two years away from contributing at the NHL
level, Vishnevsky and Peat are the type of players the Ducks lacked
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Vishnevsky, rated as the No.2 prospect in Europe by the NHL's
Central Scouting Service, is a two-way defenseman that can
quarterback a power play and still give the Ducks a much-needed
mean streak on the blue line. His style has been compared to Darius
Kasparaitis and Vladimir Konstantinov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys thought he was, by far, the best player after the
first four,'' said McNab, who admitted the Ducks held out little
hope that one of the top two defensemen in the draft (Brad Stuart
and Bryan Allan) would fall to them. ``He's a playmaker. He doesn't
have a big shot, but he's very physical and that's what we like.
His courage level is at the very top.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Peat is ticketed for two years of junior league play,
the Ducks expect him to eventually provide Paul Kariya and Teemu
Selanne the type of protection they sorely missed last season. Peat
is a willing fighter and accumulated 189 penalty minutes in 63
games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player we interviewed in the Western Hockey League said
he was toughest guy in the league,'' said McNab of Peat, who played
for Red Deer. ``But we aren't just reaching for a tough guy. We
think he can be a decent player.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous teams made offers for the Ducks' top pick -- one
rumored deal had Colorado sending defenseman Alexei Gusarov and
draft choices to Anaheim -- but McNab said no offer overwhelmed
them, despite the team's obvious need to fill holes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To move the fifth pick, especially when you can get somebody
you like, is really tough,'' he said. ``You have to get somebody
back who is pretty dynamic.''

CHEEVER AT HOME ON VICTORY LANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOUDON, N.H. _ The local TV reporter from Manchester, N.H.,
had not yet posed his first question to Eddie Cheever Jr., winner
of the 82d Indianapolis 500, when the driver anticipated it during
an interview Friday afternoon at New Hampshire International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me guess,'' Cheever joked. ``What do you want to talk
about?''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Cheever thought, his victory at Indy would be the topic
of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But the TV reporter took a different tack. Instead of asking the
obvious, he wanted to know Cheever's thoughts on other matters. On
his visit to NHIS for Sunday's Pep Boys Indy Racing League New
England 200: ``It's a great place to come to race; it's like a
mini-Indy, because the configuration of the corners are very
similar.'' The competitiveness of the IRL series: ``It's probably
the most competitive year I've had in racing, anywhere.'' And the
challenges of being an IRL owner/-driver: ``I'm having a really
great season, obviously, after having won the Indianapolis 500.
Robby Unser, our second driver, ran a strong fifth at Indy, we've
got a new sponsor for him, and our cars are running very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Three questions had been asked. None had pertained to the
biggest victory of Cheever's career. That's when the 40-year-old
Cheever deftly steered the conversation to the Indy 500 _ by
broaching the subject himself. It was, perhaps, the first time
since he's won the Greatest Spectacle in Racing that he's done so
in an interview. Ah, but it is only part of the territory that
comes with being an Indy 500 winner.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous demands. The media requests. The photo ops.
Sponsor obligations. Corporate hospitality. Driver appearances.
Autograph sessions. And, oh yes, the occasional TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always expect the first question to be about Indy _
always,'' Cheever said, smiling broadly after he won $1.4 million
for his first career triumph. ``I've talked more about Indy in the
last month than I have anything in my whole life.'' Then, launching
into an imaginary, one-sided interview, he added, ```Yes, it feels
very good to be an Indy 500 winner.' `No, I have not spent all the
money.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor given to very few and I've raced for a very long
time and I thought I had done just about everything, but being an
Indy 500 winner is very special. It's special because it's such an
important part of America's sporting history every year. So many
people recognize it. You know who won the Kentucky Derby. You know
who won the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone knows now that Eddie Cheever Jr. won the 82d Indy
500.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not have realized the odds Cheever faced when his
primary sponsor, FirstPlus, opted to commit its resources to the
fledgling Winston Cup partnership of Bill Elliott and Dan Marino.
Cheever, however, pulled all the pieces together, landing a sponsor
in Rachel's Potato Chips, and assembling a crack crew headed by
experienced crew chief Owen Synder, and a talented apprentice
driver in Unser, the youngest son of Bobby Unser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I jokingly told him, if I got any Unser luck in me, then
some of it probably rubbed off on him,'' said Robby Unser, who will
unveil a new Dallara this weekend at NHIS. ``But, for me, it was an
amazing experience to be a part of it in my first time at Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cheever, ``Robby did such a great job at Indy. When he got
out on the oval, it was like a duck to water. He's an Unser, which
just proves that _ genetically _ Unsers are different. They just
know ovals.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, when Cheever first began racing on the worldwide
stage of the Formula One circuit almost 20 years ago, he had
romanticized visions of winning Monaco in May, not Indy. Though
born in Phoenix and now residing in Tampa, Cheever grew up in Italy
knowing of only one series _ Formula One _ and its most glittering
street circuit, Monte Carlo. But, as his father counseled him, if
there was one race to win, it was Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day I won it, I wasn't really quite sure what happened,''
said Cheever, who fought off the demons of his past failures at
Indy to win going away from runner-up Buddy Lazier, the 1996 Indy
500 champ. ``I mean, I'm not an idiot. I knew I won the Indy 500,
but it takes a while to sink in. But the best recollection I had
was when I woke up that (next) morning, it was almost like waking
up the day after Christmas when you're a little kid, and you find
those presents are all still there and they haven't taken them
away. So it was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, another present _ a victory here at NHIS _ had been
taken away. Cheever led twice for 80 laps in the Pennzoil 200 but
fell out of the lead with three laps to go when his gearbox failed.
It ushered Robbie Buhl to his first career IRL triumph. It was but
one chapter in Cheever's well-documented tome of hard luck that had
kept him winless in 133 Formula One starts and 81 starts on the
CART circuit.
</P>
<P>
   That was why winning Indy was such a liberating experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I've got a big load off my shoulders now,'' Cheever said.
``I got so tired of people telling me, `you didn't win a Formula
One race.' It almost sounded like I was playing tiddlywinks or
something. I was a Formula One driver. To those who criticized,
well, feel free to go over there and try to do it. Michael
(Andretti) tried to do it, and he's an exceptional driver, but he
didn't succeed. Danny (Sullivan) tried it and he didn't succeed. I
was probably a little too thin-skinned with people saying I hadn't
won an F1 race, which wasn't false, but it wasn't as if I wasn't
busy doing something worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very lucky. The other day somebody told me that I'd
been extremely unlucky. But I disagreed. I think I've been very
lucky. I started racing go-karts when I was 13 years old. I had no
idea I'd become an Indy 500 winner. I wouldn't have even dreamed of
it, much less being the only American driver on the Grand Prix for
10 years. Yeah, I've lost a lot of races in the last minute, but I
did with my life what I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cheever, who is fluent in three languages, found the
words hard to come by when he was asked to describe the emotions he
felt immediately after the race. ``It was impossible,'' he said.
``I've had a hard time over the years when things have gone bad to
stay motivated. You keep thinking, `Well, the next race will be
better; I'll win the next one.' And after a while you start to
believe it's not going to happen, so not until I had actually
finished the Indy 500 had I realized I'd won. I kept thinking,
`Well, next corner it'll stop. Next straightaway, it's gonna
break.' But when it didn't, I was almost incredulous. How can they
take it away now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad this happened in a latter part in my career
instead of an earlier part of my career, because I wouldn't have
enjoyed it as much as I am now. I savor ever race I do now. I have
more races behind me than I have ahead of me, so every time I
drive, I drive with a smile on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Cheever has finally validated himself as a driver
_ ``an American driver,'' he intoned _ as a winner of the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   No questions asked.

DRAFT DAY NO BIG DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BUFFALO _ The National Hockey League's entry draft, the annual
taffy pull that turns teenagers into millionaires and can turn
franchises upside down, rightside up, or stuck in the neutral zone,
went off here Saturday with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier, touted as the game's next Mario Lemieux, was
selected first overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning. Only moments
later, the Lightning's new owner, Art Williams, touted the
6-foot-4-inch, 180-pound center as hockey's ``Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that wasn't enough Air from Williams, he also said that
Lecavalier was a ``sure-fire Hall-of-Famer.'' Williams, an
insurance magnate who only Thursday received league approval to
purchase the Bolts, tempered the Hall of Fame statement by saying
that he didn't know a lot about hockey and was learning the game
as, ``I go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey 101: Talk a good game, even if you can't carry a stick.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who gave up their first-round draft pick more than
18 months ago when they acquired Landon Wilson and Anders Myrvold
from the Avalanche, had to sit on their hands for some 3 1/2 hours
before making their first pick. The new Bostonian to be is Jonathan
Girard, a 5-11 1/2 defenseman from Laval in the Quebec League, born
May 27, 1980 _ just days before another Quebecer, Ray Bourque, was
named the NHL's rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, held the same Saturday every June, will come to
Boston next year and officially make Our Town the Hub of Hockey.
Two members of the FleetCenter's administration, Chris Maher and Ed
Krayer, were on hand at Marine Midland Arena, taking pictures and
making notes in preparation of the event coming some 450 miles east
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   If you're booking early, the NHL typically doesn't charge
admission to the draft. There isn't a lot of action, other than the
elbowing and jousting that occurs on the floor between the general
managers, who sit surrounded by staff members at tables that in
Boston will be spread out across the FleetCenter's floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited, it's a great event,'' said Maher, after
snapping pictures of press row shortly before the draft began. ``It
should tie in nicely with the Bruins' 75th anniversary year. It
gets people into the arena and keeps hockey on everyone's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The league was expected Saturday to announce Boston as the host
city of next year's event, but official word was not forthcoming.
One source suggested that contract language had to be finalized.
The event is never a moneymaker for the host club or arena, but
does provide a boost to the local economy. A league official
estimated some 7,000 hotel rooms would be needed to accommodate the
NHL and individual club staff, media, agents, players, and their
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   If you're already renting out your house next summer for
baseball's All-Star Game and the Ryder Cup, you might as well copy
another key for a week in June.
</P>
<P>
   Deals are usually the order of the day at the draft, but there
wasn't much of a trading wave here on the shore of Lake Erie.
Nashville jiggled up one spot, trading places with San Jose, and
selected speedy center Jeff Legwand with the No. 2 overall pick.
The Flyers unloaded smooth-skating but aging Paul Coffey on the
Blackhawks for a fifth-round draft pick. Coffey immediatley agreed
to a two-year contract with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and the Avalanche were at the center of the first
round's only interesting moment. Neil Smith, boss of the Broadway
Blueshirts, could be seen on the telephone, haggling with Colorado
general manager Pierre Lacroix. Think they were trading bon mots
over the Rangers trying to steal away Joe Sakic last summer with a
three-year deal that cost Colorado $21 million to match?
</P>
<P>
   Smith talked calmly into the phone. Lacroix was more animated.
The clock ran. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman implored the Rangers
to make their pick. Finally, the Rangers called time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This better be good,'' a leatherlung in the balcony yelled,
his voice echoing among the crowd of some 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing of note happened. Smith calmly walked to the podium
and selected 6-2 center Manny Malhorta from the Ontario Hockey
League. Colorado continued on and made its four picks in the first
round, including 6-3 defenseman Robyn Regeher at No. 19, the pick
acquired from the Bruins. That trade now should read: Wilson and
Myrvold for Regeher.
</P>
<P>
   Who will turn out to be the impact player of the '98 draft? The
slick, skilled Lecavalier has the best chance. Tampa Bay coach
Jacques Demers, who works for Williams, wasn't slinging the same
hyperbole over Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to bring him along slowly,'' said
Demers. ``Vincent Lecavalier is not coming to Tampa to save the
franchise. We're no longer the last-placed team in the NHL, and the
reason for that is we went out and picked up Craig Janney (from
Phoenix) and Bill Ranford (from Washington). We're a better team. I
liked how the Bruins brought along Joe Thornton last year. I think
Pat Burns did a great job with him. He played some games. He didn't
play some games. When the playoffs came along, Joe Thornton looked
pretty good out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It all begins for Lecavalier in September when training camp
opens. He'll be the hottest 18-year-old in Tampa since, well, since
the Lightning made Roman Hamrlik the No. 1 pick in '92. Hamrlik now
laces 'em up for the Oilers. And so it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, they're just kids. Thornton lived with a Brookline
family last season, in keeping with how junior players in Canada
live with their billet families. Demers has a son about
Lecavalier's age, and initial plans are for the young phenom to
live at the coach's house. Only in hockey.

BRASS SECTION DUE FOR AN OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Claire is not ready to retire. The Dodgers fired him as
their general manager last week, but Claire isn't ready to end a
30-year baseball career and wants another opportunity at running a
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   He may get that chance. So, too, may some of the good young
assistants in the game like Minnesota's Wayne Krivsky, Florida's
Frank Wren, Cleveland's Dan O'Dowd, the New York Mets' Omar Minaya,
the Chicago White Sox's Dan Evans and the Rangers' Dan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around baseball, there could be as many as 11 general
manager jobs changing hands between now and the start of spring
training. Some are more likely than others, and all depend on what
happens in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The rundown:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona _ Joe Garagiola Jr. does the job now, a reward for
helping bring baseball to Phoenix. But he'll probably move upstairs
in the next year or two and let Sandy Johnson, the Rangers' former
scouting director, take over. Johnson does most of the work now.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs _ Ed Lynch's job security may hang on what he does
to keep the Cubs in the pennant race. He had a good off-season, but
the Cubs still need help.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox _ The team is a disaster area. At some point,
Ron Schueler has to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati _ The Reds don't have much money, but Jim Bowden has
not done well through drafting and player development. This
franchise has been on a downward spiral since getting lucky in
winning a division title in 1995, and there's absolutely no sign of
things getting turned around soon.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado _ The Rockies have been a major disappointment, and
it's only a question of who takes the fall: general manager Bob
Gebhard or manager Don Baylor. Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   Florida _ Dave Dombrowski will likely abandon baseball's Titanic
and have his pick of what is available. The Dodgers are a strong
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles _ Tommy Lasorda is supposedly just the interim GM,
but he'll likely pull every Machiavellian maneuver possible to keep
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore _ Owner Peter Angelos keeps Pat Gillick handcuffed,
and baseball's absolutely best general manager will likely decide
he has had enough at the end of the season. The question is if
assistant Kevin Malone goes with him or takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City _ Herk Robinson will likely be forced out once the
Royals get a new owner. But nobody really knows when that will be.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle _ On one hand, Woody Woodward has built two division
champions in the past three years, which was a big improvement for
the Mariners. But he has also made several bad trades, and a
last-place finish behind the rebuilding Oakland Athletics would be
embarrassing. He may be allowed to retire gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto _ Gord Ash has made several good moves in trying to get
the Blue Jays back into contention, and they're still on the
periphery of the wild-card chase. They just haven't been able to
get their younger players going yet. He deserves more time.
\Nrailhed:The Wonder Dog It was a sad day for baseball Wednesday
when the Phillies released outfielder Rex Hudler, who is 37 and
batting just .122. All signs suggest he can no longer play, but
that doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rex ``The Wonder Dog'' Hudler is a joy and a treat to everybody
he comes across, one of the truly great people in baseball. Just
look at what happened when he was released.
</P>
<P>
   First, he performed his own interview for Comcast SportsNet, the
all-sports television station that carries Phillies games. Then, he
broke down in tears talking about what a pleasure it was to hear
fans thank him for signing autographs along the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked the Phillies for all they had done for him.
Then, after saying his goodbyes to his teammates, Hudler walked
across the Phillies' clubhouse and hugged Jon Zuber, the man who
had just taken his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Hud,'' Zuber said.
Rocketing to 300
</P>
<P>
   When Roger Clemens pitched seven innings against the Expos on
Wednesday, it gave him 366 2/3 innings in 50 starts with the Blue
Jays. That's notable because he has an option in his three-year
contract for a fourth season if he pitches 360 innings in his first
two years _ with at least 190 this season _ or if he makes 55
starts in 1997-98. It looks like he'll make good on both.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's victory was also the 221st of his career. If
Clemens, who will turn 36 on Aug. 4, can stay healthy and
effective, he has a shot at 300 career wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, I get closer; my wife \RDebra\S has mentioned
she'd like me to take a chance at it, if my body can do it,''
Clemens said. ``It's an attainable goal if I pitched till I was 40,
41, but I don't want to blink, come home and my two oldest boys are
headed to college. I went to Nolan Ryan's retirement dinner, and he
had one boy in college and another going in. Koby and Kory
\RClemens' two oldest sons\S like having their dad around and I
like going to their football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting 300 victories should not determine if Clemens is a Hall
of Famer. He should have clinched that last year when he won his
fourth Cy Young Award.
Dream team
</P>
<P>
   Let the fans pick the All-Star teams. This is my dream team, the
absolute best at their positions: C _ Ivan Rodriguez 1B _ Mark
McGwire 2B _ Craig Biggio SS _ Alex Rodriguez 3B _ Scott Rolen LF _
Barry Bonds CF _ Ken Griffey Jr. RF _ Juan Gonzalez P _ Greg Maddux
THE BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees took three of four from the Atlanta Braves
last week, confirming what most people suspected. The 1998 baseball
season boils down to whether anybody can beat the Yankees. ...
Braves general manager John Schuerholz said he expects Mark Wohlers
to return to form and won't trade for a closer. ... Twins second
baseman Todd Walker, who was hitting .342 going into the weekend,
was a 51st-round pick by the Rangers in 1991 out of Bossier City,
La. The Rangers offered him $25,000, but he decided to go to
Louisiana State instead. ... The Dodgers need a closer and will
probably take a hard run at Reds closer Jeff Shaw, who is
overlooked but one of the best. ... Davey Lopes might finally get a
chance: He's being mentioned as a candidate for the Dodgers manager
next year. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals had hoped to have a new owner by the
All-Star break, but the process has been delayed by at least three
months. Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt is one bidder, so is a group headed
by Royals great George Brett. But Brett's group has yet to offer
the minimum $75 million. ... Things are looking up for the
Pittsburgh Pirates. They just about have the funding in place for a
new ballpark in 2001. They also have the young talent coming
quickly that would make the ballpark a success. Brewers manager
Phil Garner says the Pirates have the best pitching staff in either
league, and highly touted Kris Benson is still in the minors. ...
</P>
<P>
   White Sox pitcher Jason Bere, who is 3-7 with a 6.34 earned-run
average, is demanding a trade now that manager Jerry Manuel has
dropped him from the rotation. Who would want him as a starter? ...
Reds hitting coach Ken Griffey left the team for one day Monday,
angry over a lack of respect. He came back Tuesday and one of his
complaints was getting pinch-hit for by manager Sparky Anderson,
when Griffey's batting average was over .300. This show of
disrespect happened in 1975. Hmmmm. ... Orioles manager Ray Miller,
fed up with his bullpen, is ready to dump veterans Norm Charlton
and Terry Mathews. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have benched Joe Randa and are going with rookie Gave
Alvarez at third base. He was acquired from the Arizona
Diamondbacks in November and had 20 homers and 58 runs batted in at
Triple-A Toledo. ... Paul Molitor went on the disabled list for the
14th time in his career when a Matt Karchner pitch nailed him in
the left rib cage. Said Molitor, ``I'm just trying to figure out
why those kinds of things don't happen to \RCal\S Ripken. Then
again, he'd probably be playing tomorrow. He'd probably hit
left-handed.'' ... The St. Louis Cardinals, desperate for pitching,
asked about Oakland left-hander Kenny Rogers but were told he
wasn't available. ... Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve of Arlington
has been invited to the All-Star game to compete in the rookie home
run derby, but said, ``I'm terrible in those things. I'm a combined
0-for-20. I did one in Huntsville \RDouble A\S and one in high
school.'' ... Phillies manager Terry Francona called Atlanta
manager Bobby Cox last week to talk about the All-Star Game and
lobby on behalf of his players. He forgot that Florida's Jim
Leyland will manage the team. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies lack the pitching needed to stay in the wild-card
race, but this team is making progress, mainly because of two
off-season trades. They dealt second baseman Mickey Morandini to
the Cubs for center fielder Doug Glanville (.316) and sent
shortstop Kevin Stocker to the Devil Rays for Bob Abreu (.329). ...
The Padres' ability to handle injuries has given them an edge over
the Giants. The Padres went 10-3 while Tony Gwynn was sidelined
with injuries while the Giants are 5-10 without second baseman Jeff
Kent, who may be gone for at least three more weeks.

BOB HOPE'S PROPERTIES BLANKET L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the years after Bob Hope and Bing Crosby filmed
their classic ``Road'' pictures, the inseparable friends hiked up
to China Flat, a rugged bluff overlooking the suburban San Fernando
Valley, Calabasas and west to Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Beverly Hills of tomorrow,'' Crosby boldly
predicted to his golfing buddy that day.
</P>
<P>
   Trusting Crosby's instincts and his own, Hope bought some of
that land. And as his career grew, he continued to buy and buy and
buy. Land near the ocean. Land in the Valley. Land that was empty
and flat. Mountainous land with goats and California walnut trees.
The way some people collect stamps or rare coins, Bob Hope
collected property.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been very careful in spotting property,'' his
daughter, Linda Hope, said in an interview last week. ``He's always
had a real good nose for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Long a place where Hollywood's famous have chosen to live, the
Valley and outlying areas also are where many entertainment figures
have chosen to invest, and among them Hope is one of the first,
best-known _ and one of the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when the Valley was farmland and chaparral, Hope
gobbled up huge swaths, always with an eye for a profit. The
95-year-old comedian has since sold much of his holdings, except
the Toluca Lake estate he has owned since 1939. Yet even today,
Hope's fingerprints remain all over the Valley because of astute
decisions he made decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive list of what Hope has bought and sold over the
past six decades is impossible to reconstruct, but his real estate
dealings have included Jordan Ranch, a 3,050-home development being
built in neighboring Ventura County; part of Universal Studios, a
deal that made him a 600 percent profit; a sludge farm in nearby
Las Virgenes; and a nature preserve in Thousand Oaks, in Ventura
County.
</P>
<P>
   For a short period, an entire community bore his name. There
still is a street in Burbank named after him. And down the road he
owns a small plot on which his wife has talked about building a new
museum for the veteran entertainer and other famous comedians. With
an assessed value of $1.8million, it might be the most valuable
Christmas tree lot in America.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Santa Clarita, Hope once owned property that's now
the site of the Friendly Valley Recreational Association, a
1,247-home senior residential community.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy also includes hundreds of acres of some of the most
beautiful open space. The irony is that Hope's priority was
business, not the environment. When Hope looked at empty land, he
tended to see golf courses and expensive homes. But by the time he
decided to liquidate much of his real estate portfolio, interest
groups wouldn't permit development without significant concessions
_ usually in the form of huge swaths of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Las Virgenes Valley has a certain beauty and
integrity,'' said Dave Brown, a former chairman of the Calabasas
Planning Commission. ``That probably wasn't Bob Hope's intention,
but that was the effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope's interest in the region began with his decision in 1939 to
buy the Toluca Lake home. It wasn't because he appreciated the
beauty of this still-idyllic section of the Valley, however. Linda
Hope said her father settled there for a simple reason: He liked
the Lakeside country club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the proximity to Lakeside _ and it was near Bing's
place,'' she said. ``They could get off work quickly and head over
to the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hope's career grew, so did his real estate portfolio. The
task of seeking out buyable land fell largely into the hands of his
older brother, Jim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would call me and say, `There's a couple of hundred acres
on so-and-so and so-and-so,''' Hope recalled in a 1993 interview
with the Daily News. ``And I'd say, `How much?' He'd say, `$250 an
acre.' And I'd say, `Buy it!'''
</P>
<P>
   Hope remembered buying a 35-acre chunk of land in North
Hollywood for $16,500. He later sold it to Universal Studios for
$1million.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable Hope holding was Corriganville _ or Hope Town,
as some people still call it. The land used to be the Corriganville
Movie Ranch, a famous set for western films and later a tourist
attraction. Hope bought it in 1966 when it fell on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   He renamed it Hope Town, but closed it after a year. Decades
later he sold it for $4.6million to a developer who planned a Hope
Town subdivision. Another developer took over and the subdivision
went through. The name, however, didn't stick.
</P>
<P>
   Several public agencies later acquired a piece of the land, and
in May a new Corriganville Park officially reopened. Nature trails,
a camping area and a revitalized western movie set are all future
possibilities for the land, said Michael Kuhn, senior planner in
Simi Valley, in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the acres of land Hope has owned, one of the most
intriguing pieces is a weed-covered parcel the size of a parking
lot. Sitting across the street from NBC's ``Tonight Show'' studio,
it is one of the few parcels of Los Angeles County real estate Hope
still possesses.
</P>
<P>
   For years there's been talk of putting a Hope-related museum on
the site, which sits on prime commercial real estate. Linda Hope
says the family is talking to museum consultants about creating a
shrine to prominent 20th-century comics. A restaurant and
improvisational theater also are possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lot lies vacant, except for pumpkin sales on
Halloween and Christmas tree sales during the holidays. It's been
empty for decades, and residents near the NBC studios like it that
way. It serves as a buffer between the tourist-crammed studio and
the homes of the industry's blue-collar types.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps them over there and us over here,'' said Tim
Callahan, 28, an audio engineer for a post-production company.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Hope's most vast holdings were in the scenic, mountainous
terrain in western Los Angeles and eastern Ventura counties _ land
filled with oak trees, goats, bobcats and monkeyflowers.
</P>
<P>
   One such piece is the Micor site, named for a company that
wanted to develop it. As with some of his other holdings, Hope
figured it would become a ritzy development. Instead, it will
remain mostly open space.
</P>
<P>
   Hope owned most of the land and sold it roughly a decade ago to
a young, energetic developer. Among the people who invested money
in the project through their business managers were actress
Meredith Baxter, polio vaccine inventor Jonas Salk and actor George
Wendt, who played Norm on the TV show ``Cheers.'' The plan was to
turn the area into a gated community with million-dollar homes.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental group sued, the developer went bust and three
public agencies bought up 690 acres for $4million. Richland
Calabasas Ltd., which acquired the remaining 225 acres for
$3million, has filed a lawsuit demanding the right to push forward
with plans to build 200 luxury homes of the ``million-dollar-plus
variety,'' said Steve Thurtle, the company's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, the 690 acres of public
land will remain as a trail-lined natural preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Hope also owned the adjacent land, now the site of a sludge farm
and composting facility. The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District
took the land in 1983 through condemnation proceedings.
Unfortunately for the water district, &UR;  &LR; the law requires a jury to
decide the land's value. When Hope showed up in court, his mere
presence created such a sensation with jurors that the judge
politely asked him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Hope roughly $6.5million, which according to
one magazine article was double the land's appraised value.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the developers who bought Hope's land have been less
successful than others. The Zuckerman project in particular has had
a run of bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, developer Robert Zuckerman paid Hope $9.25million for
207 acres where he planned to build a shopping center and 75
large-estate homes. In the past decade, the proposal has gone
through at least 50 versions. The developer and the county still
haven't agreed on a final one. Residents fear congestion and want
to preserve the bucolic hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked on a more political project in my entire
life,'' said Jeff Kaplinski, the developer's project manager.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Currey-Riach development has met with much better
luck. The project was born in 1980 when developers paid Hope
$10.3million for the land. The funnyman sold it as part of a
rolling, 10-year plan to unload most of his real estate holdings,
said Erwin Boychenko, Currey-Riach's vice president of finance.
</P>
<P>
   The land, now part of Calabasas, contains 462 single-family
homes, 600 apartments and 282 condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of all Hope-related developments is Ahmanson Ranch.
And it also is one with a particularly tortured history.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura County project has its genesis in Hope's dream of
selling Jordan Ranch, his 2,300-acre holding near the Simi Hills,
to developers who would turn it into a Professional Golfers'
Association course. Several years, lawsuits, public hearings and
environmental protests later, the project has evolved into a plan
to build a massive development farther to the east _ also on land
once owned by Hope.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the project moved closer to realization when
developers closed a deal to buy two ranches from Hope, one near
Simi Valley and the other near Malibu. No sale price was disclosed,
but estimates have placed the combined value of the two parcels at
$30million.
</P>
<P>
   Developers envision a $1billion mini-city with 3,050 homes, two
schools, two golf courses and a 300-room hotel. Under the deal,
thousands of acres will remain open space under the control of the
Santa Monica Mountains Conservacy.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Ranch, meanwhile, is now preserved as public parkland. In
1993, the conservancy paid Hope $16.7million for the land and gave
it to the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hope's real estate sales have generated millions of
dollars, he's given some land away for free. One 320-acre piece in
Thousand Oaks is called the Hope Los Robles Open Space. Hope
donated it in 1976 to the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who hikes the oak-grove-covered trails _ a habitat for
deer, coyote, gray foxes and badgers _ should say a silent thanks
to the famous funnyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say his perspicacity in picking the most beautiful
lands that cry out to have park signs on them is remarkable,'' said
Rorie Skei, who chairs the agency. ``He had an eye for beautiful
property, that's for sure.''

BRAZIL TAKES THE OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ At least one Western leader knows how to pick a winner.
Fidel Castro recently said he favored Brazil to win the World Cup,
prompting a Portuguese newspaper to speculate that President
Clinton would be cheering for Chile Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Clinton would have felt the disappointment of millions of
Chileans, who had hoped their team could pull off an upset but
watched Brazil win, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   This game was supposed to be a scoring duel between some of the
highest-priced strikers in the world: Brazil's Ronaldo and Chile's
Ivan Zamorano, his teammate at Inter of Milan, and Marcelo Salas.
But the match was decided on scores by Cesar Sampaio, a defensive
midfielder who has scored as many goals as Ronaldo in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sampaio's offensive production opened the game, and Ronaldo
scored twice, and hit the post and crossbar in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which will meet Denmark or Nigeria in Nantes Friday,
appeared much more committed than it had in a 2-1 loss to Norway.
That was partially the result of a return to the regular starting
lineup, but mostly because of a team meeting that restored Dunga to
the role of motivator/organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga seems determined to be a part of the first team to win
repeat World Cups since the legendary Brazilian teams of 1958 and
'62. He had been urged to be more diplomatic after berating Bebeto
during a 3-0 thrashing of Morocco in Nantes June 16, but his
passivity contributed to the Norway failing.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga was more vocally aggressive in this contest. And, he
contributed to the first goal with a curling free kick.
</P>
<P>
   Sampaio's second World Cup goal was similar to his first, scored
in the third minute of the tournament against Scotland. Sampaio
slipped through a mass of players to head in a Dunga kick in the
11th minute. Brazil's aggressiveness had paid off, as Rivaldo was
pulled down by Fernando Cornejo to set up the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit nervous at the start, but once we settled down
the team showed its experience,'' said Brazil coach Mario Zagallo.
``Then the goals came.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't stop until the final.''
</P>
<P>
   Chile continually sent high crosses toward Salas and Zamorano.
But Brazil limited those chances by controlling possession and
attacking patiently, rather than retreating onto defense with a
siege mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, who was to have become more involved in the offense,
seldom found room until the second half. But he played an important
part in the second goal, capitalizing on an errant pass by Cornejo,
who immediately fouled him on the right side, 30 yards from goal.
Roberto Carlos's 27th-minute free kick rebounded off Rivaldo,
standing next to the Chilean defensive wall, and went to the left
of goal to Bebeto, who rolled a perfect pass across the top of the
penalty area for Sampaio to blast a low shot into the left side of
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil soon clinched the victory. Goalkeeper Nelson Tapia tried
to cut down Ronaldo's angle, but cut down Ronaldo, who drilled the
penalty off Tapia's left hand in the 47th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo demonstrated the Brazilians' increased motivation when
he departed on a stretcher while French referee Marc Batta held a
yellow card over his body, four minutes into injury time, after a
collision with Miguel Ramirez near the halfway line.
</P>
<P>
   MetroStars' midfielder Marcelo Vega and Toluco's Fabian Estay
entered in the second half as Chile rallied. Zamorano headed off
goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel's chest. Salas took the rebound on the
first bounce and headed in midway through the half.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronaldo scored again less than a minute later after Denilson
drew the defense and laid off to the right. Ronaldo held the ball
until Tapia committed, then shot low to the far corner.
</P>
<P>
   Chile should consider its first fi-nals appearance since 1982
successful, but, except for Zamorano, the team exhibited little
confidence, even noting that South Americans consider Brazil
practically unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we can say this is the end of a dream, not of a
nightmare,'' said Zamorano.

LOCKOUT LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Paul Pierce will have a party Monday in southern
California to celebrate his upcoming rite of passage to the NBA.
Ordinarily, he'd board a plane the next day for Boston to see the
city, meet the press, hold up the uniform for the obligatory photo
shoot, and walk the soon-to-be hallowed floors of the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to have to wait a while to see Paul Pierce in the
flesh. While a lot of reasons factor into the decision not to come
east, there's one that supersedes all others. Pierce would no
sooner arrive here than he'd be forced to turn around and go
elsewhere. That's because at midnight, Tuesday, the Stern Curtain
will descend on the NBA and Paul Pierce will be as accessible to
the Boston Celtics as J.D. Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   We're already bored by the details of the impending lockout.
Imagine how boring it is to write about it and try to make it
interesting. There's a hard cap, a soft cap. There's the Larry Bird
exception and the Early Bird exception. The owners want protection
against themselves. The already obscenely rich players want more
for themselves. Where have we seen this before?
</P>
<P>
   There is one issue that hasn't been raised, however, which is at
the bottom of the whole, unseemly mess: the guaranteed contract.
There's absolutely no reason why the NBA should continue this
absurd practice of guaranteeing virtually every single contract.
There's also no chance that the players will settle for anything
less.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that the NBA could take a cue from the NFL,
but it could and should. Less than one percent of NFL contracts are
guaranteed. Players get their money in signing bonuses, but if they
don't perform, they're gone and their salary comes off the books.
</P>
<P>
   Why should NBA rookies get 3-5 years guaranteed money when
there's no guarantee they can play? Why should Rick Pitino or any
other coach be handcuffed by guaranteed contracts for players who
can't play, won't play, or want to be elsewhere, but can't be
moved?
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of guaranteed contracts won't do anything but make
the players earn their money _ which will be there to be dispensed
_ while giving management flexibility to make changes. Somehow,
despite not having guaranteed deals, NFL players perform, get paid
handsomely, live comfortably, and life goes on. In the meantime,
when someone like Bill Parcells arrives and doesn't like what he
sees, he can make the changes he feels he needs to make.
</P>
<P>
   If you establish a hard cap at a percentage of revenues about
where it is now or slightly higher, establish a minimum that every
team must spend, and allow management to create cap room by waiving
players with non-guaranteed deals, you'd see a few things. There'd
be fewer teams able to use the cap as an alibi. There'd be more
player movement. There'd be accountability at both ends.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it won't happen. The union won't concede that having
players earn their money _ as oppose to having it handed to them
based on potential _ is a valid concept. It will point to the
average career being so short, leaving the players not much time to
make money. What the union will ignore is that the players who
deserve to be in the league do stick around and do get theirs. It's
the other ones who freeload off the system _ and you don't have to
go far down any roster, especially Boston's, to identify who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   The owners appear to be as determined as ever to right the ship
that they are responsible for almost sinking. Come Wednesday, the
battle begins in earnest. Guarantees or games, which do you want?
That's what the owners should ask.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas entourage flew out of Texas Thursday, destination
Germany. There,  &UR; Don  &LR; and  &UR; Donnie Nelson  &LR; and owner  &UR; Ross Perot
Jr. &LR;  will start the courtship of  &UR; Dirk Nowitzki &LR; . How do you say
``full-court press'' in German? Pitino was confident he could have
had Nowitzki in a Boston uniform this fall. And there are signs
that Nowitzki, who was thought to be a lock to play in Europe for
two more years, may be rethinking his position. ``The kid was
thinking of coming over here to college, so it's not like he's
reluctant to leave,'' said Celtics general manager  &UR; Chris Wallace &LR; .
``I think they have a chance to pull it off. They can sell
( &UR; Steve &LR; )  &UR; Nash &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a new arena, the NBA, and Donnie has to have
some rapport with him. The question (Nowitzki) has to ask himself
is, `Do I want to be in Bologna next year? Or Milan? Or Dallas?'
You have to have a degree of faith in these things.'' Don Nelson
conceded prior to departure that the lockout might hurt his
chances. Donnie Nelson said he thought the whole thing was ``a coin
flip.'' ... The Mavericks got ripped by some for more of Nellie's
roster reshaping. But how is Dallas not better with Nash and, soon,
Nowitzki? True, the Mavs gave up their own first-rounder next year,
but Nash alone may be worth that. However, if they do stumble, the
Suns will be the ultimate winner, getting a top pick for someone
they couldn't keep. Phoenix also has Milwaukee's first-round pick
next year, not to mention a substantial pile of cash to use in free
agency, whenever it comes ... Speaking of the Bucks, the longer
things go, the more it seems that  &UR; Chris Ford  &LR; has, for now,
survived. We hear that there is an option clause in his deal that
kicks in next Jan. 1, which means the team had better get off to a
decent start ... The Jazz wanted nothing to do with this draft,
turning aside the 13th pick and then trading  &UR; Nazr Mohammed  &LR; to
Philly after drafting him 29th. Utah wants to keep its free agent
stash intact. The Mohammed deal is lottery-protected for the Sixers
well into the next century ... Speaking of the 76ers,  &UR; Larry Brown
 &LR; is well on his way to constructing his ideal: a college team. He
has on his roster a handful of 19-year-olds, either in age or in
mind, including  &UR; Derrick Coleman  &LR; ... The Celtics were under
intense pressure from agent  &UR; David Falk  &LR; to draft Mohammed at No.
10. Mohammed is tight with Falk client  &UR; Antoine Walker  &LR; and Walker
also was hoping to see his former UK teammate in Boston. It didn't
happen, of course, and it was all the more amusing to several
general managers to see Mohammed tumble all the way to 29. It
wasn't a great night for Falk. He had earlier tried to steer  &UR; Mike
Bibby  &LR; to the Clippers at No. 1 and that didn't work, either. But
he did get  &UR; Raef LaFrentz  &LR; to Denver at No. 3 and  &UR; Michael Doleac
 &LR; to Orlando at No. 12 ...  &UR; Jerry Reynolds &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Kings' director of
player personnel, said he feels that  &UR; Jason Williams  &LR; was the best
point guard in the draft. Better than Bibby? ``Absolutely,''
Reynolds said. ``Time will tell, of course, but that's how we feel
now.'' And what about Williams's many, er, distractions off the
court (is it any coincidence he went to the same high school as
wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss &LR; ?)? ``There are risks, we know that,''
Reynolds said. ``But this is a lively, explosive, talented guy. We
don't have any problem with him when the lights go on at 7:30. It's
what happens when they go out. We don't see any risks on the floor.
All the risks are off the floor.'' ...  &UR; Dino Radja  &LR; has until
Wednesday to decide if he's going to opt out of his contract in
Greece. ``We still have not decided what we are going to do,'' said
 &UR; Marc Fleisher &LR; , &UR;  &LR; his agent. Given the uncertain summer in the NBA,
returning to Greece might be the safest option ... How would you
like to have been  &UR; Pete Babcock  &LR; last Wednesday night? He gets a
call informing him one of his players is about to be indicted on
drug charges. We hear he wasn't told which player it was. It turned
out to be  &UR; Cadillac Anderson &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don Casey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former Celtics assistant, was in Detroit last
weekend talking to  &UR; Alvin Gentry  &LR; about joining the Pistons' staff.
Gentry is willing to give Casey two years, while his Jersey deal
has a year to run. Casey isn't eager to relocate again _ though
it's nice to be wanted _ but there are a couple uncertainties that
may make it unavoidable. First, coach  &UR; John Calipari  &LR; has an
opt-out clause in his deal that kicks in next summer. Second, there
is again talk about the team being sold. The latest proposal is to
move the club to Newark when the Meadowlands lease expires in a
couple years. However, the deal's drop-dead date apparently is
Wednesday. The prospective new boss is a deep pockets guy named
 &UR; Ray Chambers  &LR; ... All the jokes about proximity to the Diamond
District notwithstanding,  &UR; Marcus Camby  &LR; has one year to reclaim
what was thought to be a can't-miss NBA career. He got his wish to
leave Toronto _  &UR; Dee Brown  &LR; and  &UR; Chauncey Billups  &LR; have to be
envious _ and will have some teammates in New York who are
accustomed to doing things a certain way. If Camby doesn't turn it
around, he could become the  &UR; Joe Smith  &LR; of the free agent Class of
1999. The move makes a lot of sense for the Knicks, who were
exposed on the inside by the Pacers. As for Oakley, he was a big
presence on that team. You have to think he's elated to be going to
Toronto, eh? The Raptors could be even worse next year ... Wallace
believes the Lakers got themselves a real player in the second
round with the selection of Cincinnati's  &UR; Ruben Patterson &LR; . ``He
was one of the few small guys we worked out,'' Wallace said, ``and
I think he's a flat-out player. The Lakers got themselves a good
one.'' LA also got  &UR; Tony Battie  &LR; and  &UR; Tyronn Lue  &LR; for  &UR; Nick Van
Exel &LR; , &UR;  &LR; which means something has to give.  &UR; Elden Campbell  &LR; is
available, and probably will go somewhere, despite his ridiculous
salary ($7 million a year). Why any team would take on that
contract, given what we all know about Campbell, is mystifying ...
As for the high schoolers, Wallace was surprised, but not totally
shocked, to see  &UR; Rashard Lewis  &LR; slide to Seattle in the second
round. Lewis was thought to be a first-round lock, possibly a
top-15 selection, and the Celtics had him in for a workout. The
consensus was that Lewis was not aggressive enough, that he
projected as, well, someone who might not be ready for the NBA.
Gee, what a revelation. As Reynolds put it, ``I don't think the
kid's good enough to play for Duke, let alone an NBA team.'' The
NBA and the NBA Players Association could put an end to this
silliness by adopting an age limit of 20 for all players, foreign
and American.  &UR; Al Harrington &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who went 25th to Indiana, becomes
the first player to be drafted whose date of birth is in the, ahem,
1980s. Lewis and  &UR; Korleone Young &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the other high schooler who
went in the second round, were born in the 1970s ... Possible
second-round sleeper:  &UR; Bruno Sundov &LR; , &UR;  &LR; an 18-year-old Croatian
center selected by Dallas. He's listed as 7 feet 2 inches, 220
pounds, and is being coached by the same man who coached  &UR; Toni
Kukoc &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Radja, and  &UR; Zan Tabak  &LR; ...  &UR; Popeye Jones  &LR; not only has
dropped almost 40 pounds, but he also has seen his body fat lowered
from 30 percent to 13 percent. Don't worry, though. He's not going
to turn into another  &UR; Walter McCarty &LR; . One of Popeye's undeniable
assets is his sizable rear end, which he used to great advantage in
Dallas getting position. He still has that. The Celtics would like
to see him at 250 when the season starts and he re-signs with the
team. The more you hear Pitino talk about not having enough money
to spend on free agents, the more you suspect he's seen the light
and will bring back Jones and, possibly, Tabak.  &UR; Matt Geiger  &LR; isn't
going to excite anyone and isn't worth the money. Pitino's got four
of his five bases covered (for now, anyway) and can get by with his
multiple centers until something better and affordable comes along
...  &UR; Keon Clark &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whom the Celtics would have taken at No. 10 had
neither Pierce nor Nowitzki been there, could well have been a
top-five pick were it not for his checkered resume. That's what
Wallace believes. Clark had an outstanding workout for Boston, and
don't be surprised if the Celtics try to work something out with
Orlando to acquire the UNLV shot-blocker.

PARCELLS'S PICKOFF MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ New York Jets coach Bill Parcells always used to
assert that ``I go by what I see.'' Apparently he's developed a new
way of looking at things since he left New England.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is a guy who hates turnovers the way Dunkin' Donuts
hates turnovers. He thinks of turnovers the way Brueggers Bagels
thinks of turnovers. In other words, he has no use for turnovers
unless his team is causing them.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's how it was until last week, when he went out and
hired the king of turnovers, free agent Vinny Testaverde, to
compete with Glenn Foley for the Jets quarterback job this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Neil O'Donnell was not surprising after he
continued to refuse to rework his contract down from the $3,654,800
he was paid to finish last year as a benchwarmer. That number was
the fourth-highest paid to any player in the AFC in 1997 when base
salary and prorated signing bonuses are factored together, and it
simply could not be justified if he was going to again back up
Foley, which he seemed destined to do. So, business-wise, his
release made salary cap sense. These days that sometimes counts for
more than common sense, because, frankly, what other explanation is
there for signing Testaverde to replace O'Donnell?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Testaverde was a salary cap bargain at $1.5 million plus
incentives, and certainly he had some big individual games against
Parcells's teams in the past, but three games against a guy is not
the same as 16 weeks with a guy, as Parcells learned the hard way
in the case of Marion Butts, for example. What one wonders, then,
is did Parcells forget that this is the same Vinny Testaverde who
has thrown more career interceptions (183) than touchdown passes
(175), or was he blinded by his personal experiences, forgetting it
was against Parcells's own weak-link defenses that Testaverde took
advantage of and now will not have the opportunity to attack?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Testaverde was a Pro Bowl quarterback two years ago in
Baltimore, when he passed for 4,177 yards and 33 touchdowns, but
his team still didn't win so it was all only numbers _ something
Parcells abhors unless the numbers are in the win column. Last
season, in fact, Testaverde couldn't keep his job because he
couldn't keep up those numbers, passing for just 2,971 yards and
only 18 touchdowns. That is why he was put on the market as a
post-June 1 salary cap casualty after Jim Harbaugh was imported
from the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Looked upon in purely economic terms, then, swapping O'Donnell's
contract for Test-averde's makes sense because it saves the Jets
$2.75 million, but if Jet fans think O'Donnell was in Parcells's
doghouse, wait until they try to find Testaverde after a couple of
those three-INT games. You lookin' for Vinny? Try the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had to do something, however, after he let his
relationship with O'Donnell deteriorate into a sideline shouting
contest and an odd decision to go with an untested kid, Ray Lucas,
in the biggest game of the year last season rather than let
O'Donnell _ who was actually playing well in place of Foley in a
season-ending game the Jets had to win to make the playoffs _ do
the throwing. That ended whatever chance there was to convince
O'Donnell to take a financial hit for the team during the
offseason, because Parcells had publicly embarrassed and humiliated
a proud player who was only three years removed from having
quarterbacked the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even Parcells seemed to concede that to ask a player to take a
pay cut to help a man who had humiliated him (and some say cost the
Jets the playoffs in a fit of pique) was probably asking too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in part of the way this has gone on because I
do have a high regard for him personally,'' Parcells said when
announcing the two moves. ``If someone came in and tried to cut my
salary, I probably wouldn't like it either. He's been a good
quarterback in this league. But looking at the big picture for us,
I just felt that this was a better fit.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll feel that way until the first time Testaverde throws three
to the Miami Dolphins. Then he'll just throw a fit.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the hand he has dealt himself. And he had to do
something fast because his chosen one, Foley, has been unable to
stay healthy either at Boston College or with the Jets. Foley does
not have a complete-game victory to his credit in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's injury record, coupled with his limited experience, told
Parcells the obvious _ he still needed a veteran presence even if
it wasn't O'Donnell, and Testaverde was the best available option.
Some might say, at this late date, the only available option.
</P>
<P>
   So now he's got him. He may even have him on the field this
fall, because in a fair fight in training camp, Testaverde might
very well play significantly better than Foley. He hasn't thrown
for 29,233 yards in 11 seasons without having both ability and
durability, and given a chance to showcase that, he could easily
make clear who the better quarterback is.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does, Parcells will then face another dilemma. Does he
turn a blind eye to what he sees or does he go by what he sees, as
he always claims he does? Does he try to save face or does he go
with the king of turnovers, knowing that after 11 seasons of
throwing the ball to the wrong team at the worst of times, you can
count on one thing from Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   You can count on him doing it again when the pressure is on.
</P>
<P>
   When he does, Neil O'Donnell may start to look like Johnny
Unitas to Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   Difficult as it may be to fathom Parcells's willingness to bring
on Testaverde, what has just transpired in Atlanta will put it in
better perspective. With  &UR; Mark Rypien  &LR; contemplating retirement
because of illnesses to both his young son and his wife, the
Falcons last week worked out 44-year-old  &UR; Steve DeBerg  &LR; as a
possible backup. DeBerg has not played in the NFL since 1993, but
starter  &UR; Chris Chandler  &LR; has suffered with injuries through most of
his career and last season was no different. Atlanta was 7-3 in
games Chandler started and finished, and 0-6 in ones he didn't. So
with Rypien now a question mark despite having signed a two-year,
$1.85 million deal in the offseason, something had to be done, and
with the quarterback ranks depleted, it was worth considering the
 &UR; George Foreman  &LR; of quarterbacks. DeBerg seems unlikely to end up
in the NFL this fall, but just the fact that Falcon coach  &UR; Dan
Reeves  &LR; would look at him makes clear the problem Parcells and
anyone else looking for a quarterback at this late date is facing.
It's also why O'Donnell figured he could get away with playing
hardball with the Jets. In the end, O'Donnell knows he'll end up
playing football with someone ... A Las Vegas mystery woman's bid
to buy the Minnesota Vikings has been rejected as not really
legitimate, but  &UR; Shruti Misra &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a 31-year-old businesswoman who
claims vast real estate holdings in California, Nevada, and Mexico,
has raised her bid from an original $180 million to $225 million,
with reportedly $195 million of it in cash. Vikings attorney  &UR; John
Mooty &LR; , however, claimed that because of the debt a new owner would
have to assume, Misra's offer was really worth only about $150
million. But Misra may yet make a third offer by the July 1
deadline for submitting proposals. Among those expected to make
offers for the Vikings is  &UR; J. Bruce Llewellyn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a cousin of  &UR; Colin
Powell &LR; , the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Llewellyn,
chairman of the board of Philadelphia Coca-Cola, would become the
first black to own controlling interest in a professional sports
franchise in the United States if his bid is successful. Joining
him as an investor is former Vikings general manager  &UR; Mike Lynn &LR; .
Llewellyn met with NFL commissioner  &UR; Paul Tagliabue  &LR; last week
before taking sick in New York and being hospitalized for tests.
That resulted in his having to cancel a planned session with the
Vikings' 10-man ownership group. The 70-year-old Llewellyn is
likely to be competing against Timberwolves owner  &UR; Glen
Taylor &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Viking part-owner and general manager  &UR; Roger
Headrick &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who earlier lost a bid to buy the team when author  &UR; Tom
Clancy  &LR; offered money as fictional as his books, as well as San
Antonio Spurs owner  &UR; Red McCombs &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who also bid before ...
Whispers out of Chicago are that running back  &UR; Rashaan Salaam  &LR; will
be released after reaching an injury settlement on his contract.
The former Heisman Trophy winner rushed for 1,000 yards as a rookie
in 1995 but by last season was slowed by a severely broken fibula.
When Salaam is released, it will mean both of last year's starting
backs are gone because free agent  &UR; Raymont Harris  &LR; also will not be
back. The new backfield is likely to be No. 1 draft choice  &UR; Curtis
Enis  &LR; and  &UR; Darnell Autry &LR;  ... Speaking of the Vikings, their offer
of a four-year, $22 million contract to wide receiver  &UR; Cris Carter
 &LR; is likely going to be rejected or modified. The five-time Pro Bowl
selection would become the highest-paid receiver in football, far
surpassing this season's top free agent signing of  &UR; Yancey
Thigpen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who agreed to a deal with the Tennessee Oilers that will
pay him an average of $4.2 million. Carter is seeking a contract
averaging around $6 million instead of the $5.5 million Minnesota
put on the table last week. While all this is going on, Detroit's
perennial All-Pro,  &UR; Herman Moore &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is calmly watching, knowing the
Lions are likely to rework his deal again, as they have three times
already. Since he is arguably the premier receiver in football,
Moore knows where he should end up, but he'll wait until Carter is
done setting the market before trying to go deep again.

   Pity poor San Diego Chargers rookie quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf &LR; . His
new employers seem to be taking a bit too seriously his ability to
serve as both The Savior and The Franchise. Leaf may eventually be
every bit the quarterback  &UR; Drew Bledsoe  &LR; is, but this season he'll
be throwing to a corp of receivers who couldn't be blamed if they
need to ask directions to the end zone. Of the Chargers' five young
wideouts, only two have ever scored an NFL touchdown. That doesn't
include old warhorse  &UR; Webster Slaughter  &LR; (555 career catches for
8,018 yards and 44 touchdowns), who was added to the mix this
spring despite not playing a down since 1996. With former Pro
Bowlers  &UR; Tony Martin  &LR; and  &UR; Eric Metcalf  &LR; traded in the offseason,
the Chargers lost 892 receptions and 73 touchdowns and will be
replacing that with  &UR; Brian Still  &LR; (30 career receptions in two NFL
seasons, 466 yards, no touchdowns) and rookie second-round choice
 &UR; Mikhael Ricks &LR; , &UR;  &LR; if head coach  &UR; Kevin Gilbride  &LR; sticks to his
early position on the matter. The Chargers also have  &UR; Tyrone
Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; acquired from Atlanta, who has 45 career catches for 523
yards and one touchdown, slot receiver  &UR; Charlie Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has 73
receptions in two seasons for 947 yards and five scores, and
second-year man  &UR; Latario Rachal  &LR; (zeros all the way) ...
Considering that the Chargers also have no No. 1 pick until 2001,
this resurrection could take a while ... It's no surprise that
Dallas's nine-year veteran defensive end,  &UR; Tony Tolbert &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was not
happy to learn he was being released for salary cap reasons. The
Cowboys saved $2.487 million on their cap and hope to re-sign
Tolbert for a significant pay cut. He is not, at least at the
moment, much inclined to accept even that, though he's coming off
double knee surgery that has the team concerned he may not be the
player he once was. If Tolbert does not return after starting 144
straight games, Dallas is faced with starting rookie  &UR; Greg Ellis
 &LR; and young  &UR; Kavitka Pittman  &LR; at defensive ends, a tandem with one
career sack. Considering that, Tolbert said last week in Dallas,
``Do you think Kavitka and those guys can get the job done?''
Apparently Tolbert doesn't ... Ex-Dallas middle linebacker  &UR; Robert
Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who played on the Cowboys' three Super Bowl teams, may be
headed to the strong side slot in Miami.  &UR; Zach Thomas  &LR; is a fixture
in the middle and the strong side was trouble last year, with
 &UR; Anthony Harris  &LR; and  &UR; Dwight Hollier  &LR; both manning it at different
times ... Remember  &UR; Carlton Haselrig &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former practice squad
player who developed into a Pro Bowl guard in 1992 and then lost
himself in drugs and alcohol? He's back in a football uniform in
Pittsburgh. It's just not a Steelers uniform. Last week Haselrig
called the semi-pro Pittsburgh Colts and asked if they could use
him. The Colts agreed to pay his health insurance but no salary,
and Haselrig will take over at both guard and middle linebacker.
The Colts play in the semi-pro National Football Federation, a
league that will have former West Virginia star  &UR; Major Harris  &LR; at
quarterback for the Huntingdon (W.Va.) Hawks.

BRITONS FEELING GIDDY ABOUT RARE DOUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Play it again, Sam!
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that's the theme at Wimbledon where Sam and Tim are the
leading man and lady, sort of the Ilsa and Rick of the local tennis
drama. Especially since the kid from the real Casablanca, the
dazzling shotmaker Hicham Arazi, has, alas, been beaten by a Swede,
Magnus Larsson, and deported with the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Casablanca'' was an all-time feel-good flick, Saturday was
a jolly good happy-ending day for the homebodies, who don't have
many of them around here. Even though the English conceived tennis,
founded Wimbledon and used to win all the titles, their day is as
gone as Bergman and Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   As time goes by, however, sparks and embers of empire do appear
as Saturday when Sam and Tim _ that's Samantha Louise Smith and
Timothy Henry Henman _ busted into the fourth round. Landing safely
among the last 16 survivors, carried over to the second week _
that's promised land stuff for a Limey. Sure, it's merely
three-sevenths of the way to titles they won't win, but it's one of
those small, satisfying triumphs like Susan McDougall getting out
of chains. A similar English double was recorded as recently as
1977 by Virginia Wade, the last native to seize the championship,
and Mark Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Henman has made his ripples in this puddled tournament _ closed
down early again by torrents _ as a preppy-looking 23-year-old
quarterfinalist the last two years. It wasn't startling that he,
ranked No. 18, beat No. 34 Black, the diminutive great white hope
of Zimbabwe, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5, on Centre Court. Byron Black, the
doubly double-handed skitterer from a Harare avocado plantation,
had all of England in a tea time TV tizzy as he served at 5-3,
about to take it into a fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   But Henman stiffened his upper lip and forehand to carry the
day, adding to the homeland's joy at progressing in the concurrent
kickball tournament in France Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you think you'd be letting the country down if you didn't
do as well as the football team?'' an English reporter actually
asked him. Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   You would have thought, though, that the England eleven was
facing Argentina over on uproarious Court 2 where banners and
bluster saluted the determined Miss Smith _ ``call me Sam, please''
_ in her successful assault on a champion, No. 7 Conchita Martinez,
2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   While Smith is the No. 1 tennis player in England, this
translates to being the best golfer in Tibet. In the world she's
No. 94, so it was a totally unexpected result from a totally freaky
lady in her line of work. Henman may come from a university town,
Oxford, but Smith, 25, came in with a university degree, from
Exeter.
</P>
<P>
   Legit. No mail-order diploma. An honors graduate from one of the
land's finer schools. In women's tennis, largely staffed by grammar
school dropouts, Lindsay Davenport's high school diploma makes her
seem an Oxford don. So how is Smith regarded? Like Einstein in
drag?
</P>
<P>
   She majored in history, a bad subject for her at Wimbledon,
where she had accumulated all of two sets in five previous tries.
``But I'm coming along more solidly all the time,'' she says, ``and
I hope this inspires a lot of kids. I was inspired when I came to
Wimbledon on a school trip when I was 9. It was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always watched the (nightly BBC-TV) highlights show, and
now,'' her green eyes gleam, ``I'll be on it. Yes, I'll be
watching.'' And she'll be seeing her face and exploits plastered
all over London's numerous Sunday papers.
</P>
<P>
   The money? She'll get a minimum of $40,160, equaling her entire
1997 take. ``It's such a lot. I can't imagine what I'd do with.''
</P>
<P>
   Named to the British Olympic team in 1992, Smith was knocked out
by hepatitis. Weakened for a time she felt, ``If I couldn't play
tennis, I could put my time to good use going to university. I'm
glad I did. I think it was good for me as a person, and eventually
for my tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I'd done before this was qualify for the US
Open last year. But then I ran into Conchita (Martinez) in the
first round. It was such a shock. I was overwhelmed (6-1, 6-0).
Never played such a good player before. I couldn't handle her spin.
I felt like a beginner.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the title-round victor over Martina Navratilova in
1994, jumped to a 4-1 lead Friday, but Sam was saved by rainfall.
``I think Conchita took me lightly when we resumed today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready. I didn't feel I was there,'' says Martinez,
who had no idea she'd be given a splendid fight and ignominious
last rites by this skinny foe in the dreaded cemetery of the
illustrious Court 2. As union jacks and English flags blazing with
the scarlet crosses of St. George billowed, and the crowd screamed
for her blood, Conchita was laid away by Sam's studious touch with
groundies and volleys.
</P>
<P>
   Conchita got smoked, but nothing like Todd Martin and Todd
Woodbridge, chased from Court 18 by a fire in an adjoining
apartment building. Although rain-outs are common at the Big W,
this was the first smoke-out.
</P>
<P>
   Look-alikes Sam and Tim, their brown hair cropped similarly, are
more uncommon in English terms: three wins apiece. Many a champagne
glass was lifted to them across the country Saturday night with:
``Here's looking at you, kids!''
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the start of a beautiful blendship?

BOSTON GETS DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BRUINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last year's National Hockey League draft was greatly
anticipated in Boston as the Bruins welcomed the No. 1 overall
pick, Sault Ste. Marie star Joe Thornton, to the fold. Sergei
Samsonov followed at No. 8 and while Thornton was brought along
slowly, Samsonov made an immediate impact on his way to winning
rookie of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's draft had a more low-key feel for the Bruins, who had
to wait until late in the second round to make a selection. Boston
added to its depth on the blue line by taking a pair of defensemen
in Jonathan Girard at No. 48 and Boston College's Bobby Allen at
No. 52, a compensation pick for Toronto signing Kevyn Adams, the
Bruins first-round pick in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins' assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said the club
had both players projected as late first-rounders and they had
considered making a deal to move up to snag Girard and Allen.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the staff was very impressed with Girard's
skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a skilled, effortless skater,'' said O'Connell. ``If
there has been a knock it's been that he's 5-11. But he's as
skilled a defenseman as I've seen in the (Quebec) League and he can
skate.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the Bruins liked Allen's anticipation, which is
why they coveted him. O'Connell views both being a couple of years
away from playing in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   While Girard said he wasn't at all nervous waiting to hear his
name called, Allen confessed to being very jittery while sitting
with his parents and 12 family members who made the trek to Buffalo
for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tremendously nervous,'' Allen said. ``It's not easy
sitting in the stands and waiting for an organization to decide
your future. Being picked by the Bruins was a huge surprise. I
couldn't write a better script. I had so many hopes about being
picked by my hometown team. I'm not nervous now at all. The best
part was seeing the look on my parents' faces. They sacrificed a
lot. It's been a lot of hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a resident of Hull, said he was interviewed twice by the
Bruins and while he got a sense they were interested, he wasn't
certain that's what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inexact science,'' he said. ``I got a feeling they
were confident in my ability but I couldn't pick out what team was
going to pick me. But this experience has been everything I thought
it would be. I figured I'd go a little earlier than I did but to be
picked by Boston, I didn't mind waiting a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was the top-ranked New Englander by Central Scouting. The
Cushing Academy graduate, who turns 20 in November, was ranked 29th
among North Americans at the midpoint and wound up at 34. In his
freshman year at The Heights, he was named to the Hockey East
all-rookie team, was the Eagles' second-highest scoring defenseman
with 7 goals and 26 points in 37 games. He missed the World Junior
Tournament in Finland because of a separated shoulder and reinjured
it in the third period of BC's 3-2 loss to Michigan in the NCAA
title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder is no problem,'' said 6-foot-1-inch, 198-pound
Allen. ``It's actually probably a lot stronger than when I hurt
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a lefthanded shot and former Globe All-Scholastic, plans
to return to BC for his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can count on that right now,'' he said. ``When I
play pro all depends on my development and on what the organization
wants to do. I think being picked by Boston will actually help my
development. And it makes the situation that much sweeter that they
give college guys a chance to break into the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a knock on Allen, it's his lack of physical play.
Scouts agree he has excellent mobility, a hard shot, is a smart
player, and is effective at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said his physical play didn't come up in his meetings with
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never mentioned it,'' he said. ``I can bang with the
bigger guys. I don't back down. I'll sit down and talk with (the
Bruins) and see what kind of player they want me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Girard, 18, a righthanded shot, catapulted from a Central
Scouting ranking of 86 midway through the season to 42d. The
Joliette, Quebec, native, who played for Laval in the Quebec
League, was the league's fourth highest-scoring defenseman with 20
goals and 67 points in 64 games.
</P>
<P>
   Central Scouting considers the 5-11 1/2, 192-pound Girard very
agile with exceptional lateral movement and a player who dominates
in the defensive zone. He's an accurate passer with a booming slap
shot and is excellent in the transition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they picked me because of my ability in the offensive
zone,'' said Girard. ``I think defensively my play is stable, but I
need to work on my play in the defensive zone. My skating and my
passing need to improve, but I improved a lot last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Girard said he plans to come to training camp and will then get
a gauge of what he needs to work on. He is most looking forward to
a trip to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been there,'' he said. ``All I know about it is
Raymond Bourque and the coach (Pat Burns). It was a young team and
they played together and had a good season. I'm real excited. I
just want to work hard and do my best in training camp.''

DODGER BLUE IS FADED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ For those who think that ownership of a major league
franchise carries with it the burden of tradition, remember the
Dodgers. And remember how easily an image built on close family
ties and organizational success can be shattered almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months after the changing of the guard from the
Walter/Peter O'Malley tradition that first began in 1950 came the
Big Purge. Five key figures were replaced _ general manager Fred
Claire, manager Bill Russell, and coaches Reggie Smith, Mark
Cresse, and Glenn Gregson. A shakeup of this magnitude isn't
supposed to happen in Dodger country _ be it in Brooklyn or Los
Angeles. But it did last week, with less than half the season
played.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, 62, had 2 1/2 years left on a new contract, and was no
doubt being blamed as much for the team's sub-.500 start as for his
failure to pull off a trade for Seattle's Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was asked to win with only one prime-time starter, Ramon
Martinez, who is now out for the season with a torn rotator cuff.
New GM Tommy Lasorda had to retire from managing because of the
stress. Can being a general manager in today's baseball _ and the
accompanying financial mess _ be any easier?
</P>
<P>
   Russell was replaced by former Red Sox shortstop Glenn Hoffman,
who is a good guy but has never managed in the majors. He moves up
from Triple A Albuquerque, where he was in his second season at the
helm.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, another former Red Sox, had declined an offer to manage
the Dodgers in the winter of 1996. Too much politics, he said at
the time, and he was right. The Fox move proves that even highly
regarded coaches aren't immune. Smith was offered Hoffman's job at
Albuquerque or the role of hitting instructor, which he held in the
early 90s. He declined both.
</P>
<P>
   What does this all mean? Are we to assume this is an old-
fashioned house cleaning, akin to that of the Florida Marlins,
albeit at a higher level? Or should we assume that the Dodgers are
no longer interested in the values that made the franchise unique
after the arrival of Jackie Robinson in 1947? The new owners at Fox
Corp. want success, to be sure. And now they've let it be known
they will not tolerate failure. Any baseball man will tell you
that's a faulty premise. Baseball is a game built on failure over a
162-game season. You wonder if the Fox people truly understand the
damage they have done.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody ought to tell them this isn't pro football, where you
can spruce up a franchise with cheerleaders and nightly
commercials. Baseball has its own rhythm, based as much on
intangibles as it is on gate receipts and wins and losses. For
better or worse, and this is especially true in California, it's a
game for the people, many of whom might never make it to beautiful
Dodger Stadium. They grow up with players and managers, then watch
them grow old ... like themselves. It remains to be seen if the Fox
people care as much about them as they do the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Fox hasn't really indicated what its plan is for the Dodgers,
beyond expanded exposure into the Pacific rim. But there is a lot
of speculation that the long-term goal is to ``out-Fox'' media
rival Ted Turner and, while at it, to outmaneuver the Disney clan
down the road at Anaheim, where they haven't stopped pushing since
they rode Cowboy Gene Autry out of town.
</P>
<P>
   What is more important? That the Dodgers put a winning team on
the field at all costs, or that they try to win while maintaining
their tradition? No need to answer. The trades that sent Mike
Piazza and Todd Zeile to Florida, and Hideo Nomo to the New York
Mets, spoke volumes. The deals leave a bad taste. As a point of
fact, the final elements of the six-player deal with Florida were
negotiated by Fox executive Chase Carey after Claire had
established the parameters.
</P>
<P>
   If you understand the Red Sox' history of failure, then you have
to appreciate what ``Dem Bums'' have achieved, and why this somehow
doesn't feel right. Over the last 54 years, the Dodgers have
finished first or second 36 times. The team has won nine Western
Division titles, 15 National League pennants, and six world titles.
In the 1950s, they became America's team long before the term was
invented.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, they opened up the West for baseball with
more impact than the California Gold Rush. They won two Series in
the '80s (1981, '88) before a drought in the 1992 season (63-99)
exposed the franchise as being weak at the core. Ironically, it was
at that point that the Dodgers produced the next five rookies of
the year _ Eric Karros (1992), Piazza (1993), Raul Mondesi (1994),
Nomo (1995), and Todd Hollandsworth (1996). But one thing was
different. While the Dodgers preached they had the best
organization in the land, they came up short when it came to
results.
</P>
<P>
   Great players win awards, and the Dodgers had a handful. But it
takes great teams to win championships, and the Dodgers have hardly
produced those. They didn't underachieve; they just weren't better
than everybody anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Claire understood the Dodger plight. The team adopted an
international flavor, with stars from the Caribbean and Japan and
Korea, in an attempt to open its horizons as well as maintain the
tradition. It was probably wishful thinking that the Fox people
would wait for all of this to develop. It will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Damn the tradition and full speed ahead, Fox says. So be it.
There was no saving Claire, who, despite a significantly lower
payroll in the last four years, had teams that won. The Dodgers won
the NL West in 1995, went to the playoffs as the wild card in 1996,
and were in the race last year until the final week. In Boston,
we'd love it. But we understand tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the right move to change horses at midstream. It's
cold and corporate, but it's the way things are done these days.

   Lost amid the Dodger turmoil was the death last week of their
longtime general manager,  &UR; Al Campanis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who died of coronary
artery disease at age 81. At his funeral, it was stressed by
Lasorda and others that Robinson's onetime roommate should be
credited for advancing the cause of blacks and Latins in
professional baseball. But his legacy will forever be tainted by
racial remarks made on ABC's ``Nightline'' in 1987 when he asserted
that ``blacks lack the necessities'' to be managers and and
front-office executives. The remarks shocked a nation and made
Campanis appear crude and stupid. He was neither. He was just a
baseball man who made a bad judgment and paid the ultimate price
for tarnishing what was then called a proud ``tradition'' of equal
opportunity. Campanis died last Sunday, the same day the man who
had to fire Campanis _ Claire _ was fired for not making those
traditions work for the team's new owners. What goes around ...
Midseason trades leave most players numb, and when the Tigers'  &UR; Bip
Roberts  &LR; learned he had been dealt to the Oakland A's, he was no
exception. But he got over it in a hurry. ``At first, it didn't
register,'' said Roberts, 35. ``But then it just sunk in. It was
like, `I get to go home!''' Roberts went to Oakland's Skyline High
School and grew up watching the likes of  &UR; Bert Campa &LR; - &UR; neris &LR; , &UR; Joe
Rudi &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Sal Bando &LR; . ``I dreamed of playing there and doing
something special,'' he said. ... The rift between Reds hitting
instructor  &UR; Ken Griffey Sr. &LR;  and the team's front office last week
was brief but insightful. Griffey staged a one-day walkout last
Monday, based mostly on complaints ranging from how he'd been
treated by the organization over the years to the perception that
he was to blame for the club's weak offense and a general lack of
communication with other members of the Reds' staff. Griffey became
particularly incensed when he reported to work and saw other
coaches tutoring young players on the field. ``It's been
festering,'' he said of his decision to leave. ``All people had to
do was communicate with me.'' General manager  &UR; Jim Bowden  &LR; and
manager  &UR; Jack McKeon  &LR; issued a statement that said Griffey's
concerns had been satisfied for now. Griffey escaped a fine.

TRINIDAD TRYING TO PUNCH OUT KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Don King's empire continued to crumble last week
while he spent his days in a federal courthouse in New York
fighting to keep himself out of prison and his nights trying to
hold together a boxing stable that lost another thoroughbred
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated International Boxing Federation welterweight champion
Felix Trinidad filed suit against King Thursday and then signed an
eight-fight deal with rival promoter Dino Duva and HBO that will
likely commence with a November unification fight with World Boxing
Association champion Ike Quartey. Trinidad joined Mike Tyson, Terry
Norris, Orlin Norris, Julio Cesar Chavez, and Frans Botha among
other fighters now suing to leave King or already having left his
beleaguered promotional company, claiming their contracts were
either invalid or had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, who had been shopping his services to various
promoters for months, claims that his four-year deal with King
ended June 11. King is expected to countersue, claiming that the
contract remained in force because of a clause that says the deal
would extend two years if Trinidad became a world champion.
</P>
<P>
   King will argue that the clause applied to every one of his
title defenses. Trinidad's attorneys will counter that it applied
only to any new titles he won after the new contract went into
effect. In that regard, Trinidad had been set to fight for the
junior middleweight title but suddenly backed out a few months ago.
It is now clear he did that because to win a new title would have
activated the extension clause.
</P>
<P>
   Although Trinidad's decision seems likely to tie up him and King
in court for months, he is free to fight in the interim with money
held in escrow until the dispute is settled. That would free up a
logjam in the 147-pound division that has prevented natural
mega-events like Trinidad-Quartey and fights for either with World
Boxing Council champion Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Those bouts could help revive the sport, which has suffered
since the suspension of Tyson's license without a major event.
Attempts to make a heavyweight unification fight between Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis broke down earlier this year over money,
and all efforts to match De La Hoya in a unification bout with
Trinidad or Quartey also have proven fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   But De La Hoya has begun to agitate his promoter, Bob Arum, to
make such a match, and Arum finally reacted last week when he upped
his original $3.5 million offer to Quartey to $4.5 million. But he
was too late. By then, Quartey and Trinidad had signed an agreement
for a November match, and it is unlikely that Quartey would try to
break that agreement to fight De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Because Duva also controls top-rated welterweights Pernell
Whit-aker and Jose Luis Lopez, De La Hoya could find himself
without a shot at Trinidad for another year, because Trinidad's new
deal with HBO provides for only one pay-per-view fight. The other
seven are to be on HBO's free cable program, ``World Champonship
Boxing,'' which is no home for a major fight like De La
Hoya-Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely Trinidad will get several of those fights out of
the way against Quartey and perhaps Lopez or Whitaker before
fighting De La Hoya, because such fights would not only earn him
millions but would also increase his leverage in any negotiation
with the Golden Boy, who Arum has said would deserve 70 percent of
a deal under present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   That would cease to be the case, however, if Trinidad gained
strong exposure on HBO and defeated big names such as Quartey,
Lopez, and Whitaker. Judging by what Trinidad had to say at a New
York press conference announcing the new deals Friday, that seems
to be his handlers' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know all these big fights will come,'' said Trinidad
(33-0, 29 KOs). ``I want to send a message to all of them. When
their time comes, no more excuses. Let's get in the ring. I'll be
waiting for you, one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   That is good news to HBO, which has not had a major fight on its
network for more than a year, a circumstance a Quartey-Trinidad
match would instantly rectify.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can make Trinidad-Quartey and offer it on HBO, why
not?'' said HBO vice president for programming Lou DiBella. ``We
want to see Oscar get all the major fights he can, but we're not in
the Oscar business. We're in the pay television business.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum accused HBO of working against him and his effort to make a
Quartey-De La Hoya bout, claiming that the cable service's interest
in Quartey-Trinidad was blocking De La Hoya from getting the bout.
There may be some truth to that, because Duva could not have
afforded to sign Trinidad without the eight-fight HBO deal that
accompanied, which Duva claims could be worth $100 million to the
IBF champion.
</P>
<P>
   But what is more important is that Trinidad's decision freed him
from continuing to wallow in the kind of nonevents he has so often
been involved in with King, who last paid him $1 million in April
to defend his title against a nonentity named Mahenge Zulu in
Puerto Rico. By contrast, De La Hoya made nearly $4 million to
fight a similar opponent, Patrick Charpentier, two weeks ago in El
Paso on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   For once, though, the biggest winner should be American fight
fans, who will get a big fight in November involving Trinidad and
Quartey and soon enough have reason to believe the winner will step
in against De La Hoya in the kind of major event the welterweight
division has not seen since Sugar Ray Leonard first fought Thomas
Hearns 17 years ago.

   Chavez's dismal performance against light-hitting  &UR; Ken Sigurani
 &LR; Thursday night at Foxwoods didn't do anything to make you feel his
Sept. 18 bout with De La Hoya will be anything but a repeat of
their first meeting. Chavez lost the first two rounds and then had
a serious cut opened over his right eye before he went wild at the
sight of his own blood and stopped Sigurani in Round 3. Although
that provided Chavez with his 101st career victory against two
losses and two draws, it did nothing to erase the memory of a
bloodied and badly beaten Chavez being destroyed by De La Hoya when
they first met over a year ago. Chavez has grown old gracelessly,
turning from a once-fearsome fighter into a constant complainer and
excuse maker when things don't go well. And, worse, he has turned
into an old man whose reflexes are gone and whose face simply
cannot take being hit any longer. In at least a half dozen of his
most recent fights, Chavez has come out cut or badly bruised, and
that included Thursday night's bout, when he left the arena
immediately to have an inch-long cut repaired by a plastic surgeon.
Arum insisted the cut would not delay the De La Hoya fight and it
probably won't, but that's not good news for Chavez despite his
still-present bravado. ``I think a lot of people think I'm
finished,'' Chavez said. ``They think I have no chance to beat
Oscar De La Hoya. That's good. Sept. 18 will be the surprise of the
year.'' The surprise will be if Chavez isn't a bloody mess when it
concludes. Yet Chavez can see none of what is coming. He is blind
to it all, believing he is still the Chavez he once was and that De
La Hoya is none of what people think. ``I used to like the kid,''
he said of De La Hoya. ``He looked like a respectable kid. But
after he beat me, I think it went to his head. He started talking.
He can talk all the (expletive) he wants. The majority of the
fighters he fights are worth nothing. I don't have any respect for
him as a boxer. The fighters I fought long ago would have knocked
him out.'' Perhaps, but the fighter he's going to fight Sept. 18
won't ... Arum said Chavez will receive the $250,000 knockout bonus
he'd been promised if he stopped Sigurani, even though the bout was
a TKO and not a knockout ... Chavez has a fight of another kind on
his hands after being arrested in Mexico on tax charges Friday.
Chavez's attorney,  &UR; Luis Medina &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said the arrest is apparently
related to a 1996 arrest warrant on tax evasion. That case seemed
to have been settled, but Medina said Chavez's representatives had
not received a formal certificate of the settlement from the
Treasury Secretariat ... ...  &UR; Shelley Finkel  &LR; said in Las Vegas
this week he has advised Tyson to apply for reinstatement of his
boxing license next month. Tyson was suspended indefinitely for
twice biting Holyfield last June, but is eligible to apply for his
license as of July 9. There was some speculation he would wait
several months after the initial date, but it now seems likely he
will seek reinstatement next month and aim for a fight in November
... Former heavyweight champion  &UR; Bruce Seldon  &LR; is facing 364 days
in jail and five years' probation after pleading guilty to smoking
pot wth a 15-year-old girl and having ``sexual activity'' with her.
Seldon's attorneys are trying to work out a deal in which he can
serve his time in house arrest rather than returning to the prison
cell he once occupied as a teenager after he was convicted of armed
robbery. Seldon has not fought since he was destroyed by Tyson in
109 seconds Sept. 7, 1996 ... Arum's dream of making  &UR; Buster
Douglas  &LR; Tyson's first opponent on the latter's latest comeback was
turned into a nightmare by  &UR; Lou Savarese  &LR; Thursday when he
destroyed Douglas in one round. Arum claimed he had options on
Savarese, but it turns out he has only a right of last refusal.
Don't be surprised if you see Savarese in with Lewis in 6-9 months
...  &UR; Yory Boy Campas's  &LR; shot at a big payday with De La Hoya
disappeared in the midst of Trinidad's move against King. He now
will not fight De La Hoya in November, as Arum originally planned.
``Campas is out for November,'' Arum said. ``If we can't do Quartey
then we'll do  &UR; Oba Carr  &LR; or ( &UR; Frankie &LR; )  &UR; Randall &LR; .''... Although
their fight has already been announced at a large New York press
conference,  &UR; Roy Jones Jr.'s  &LR; and  &UR; Lou Del Valle's  &LR; people continue
to argue over details. Jones's camp is insisting that an immediate
rematch clause be in the contract in case he loses and that Del
Valle agree to only 40 percent of the take from a rematch even if
he wins. Del Valle's promoter,  &UR; Cedric Kushner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said he would
agree to the 60-40 split, acknowledging that even in defeat, Jones
would be the bigger draw, but he is refusing the immediate rematch
clause ... Showtime is hoping it can stage the postponed
Holyfield- &UR; Henry Akinwande  &LR; heavyweight title fight in New York in
August.

   Women boxers from the United States and Canada will fight in the
first international amateur women's meet ever held in the United
States July 10 at Lackawanna County Stadium near Scranton, Pa. USA
Boxing will run the event, using the eight winners from the
national championships to represent the US. USA Boxing says it has
900 female members ... The Fighting Foul Pole,  &UR; Andrew
Golota &LR; , &UR;  &LR; fights  &UR; Corey Sanders  &LR; (16-5) July 21 in Atlantic City
for chump change with an eye toward a bigger payday. Golota (30-3)
has won two walkover matches since being stopped in one round by
Lewis last year, and if he can defeat Sanders, he has already
agreed to a match with 39-year-old former champion  &UR; Tim Witherspoon
 &LR; (46-7) Sept. 4 at Wroclaw, Poland, for $450,000. Acknowledges the
aging Witherspoon, ``Things are very different for me right now.
I've had my ups and downs, my sads and goods. I'm going to just
train the hardest I've ever trained.'' Witherspoon said his biggest
concern would come after the fight. ``If I knock out Andrew, what
the people gonna do? When I knocked out ( &UR; Frank &LR; )  &UR; Bruno  &LR; in
London, I didn't think I'd get out of there alive.'' ...
Cruiserweight  &UR; Ramon Garbey  &LR; faces  &UR; David Izegwire  &LR; on the July 21
undercard of Golota-Sanders.

IRL, NHIS WILL LIKELY PART WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOUDON, N.H. _ Tony George smiled coyly Saturday afternoon
when asked if his blue-and-white windbreaker, emblazoned with the
slogan ``The Magic Mile,'' was his symbolic show of support for New
Hampshire International Speedway. ``Actually,'' said George,
president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway and founder of the Indy
Racing League, ``I forgot my jacket back home at Indy and I got
cold when it started raining. So I went over (to the gift shop) and
bought one for me and my son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paid full retail, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It will likely make a perfect parting gift. When the New England
200 is staged Sunday at NHIS, it will mark the end of a three-year
contract between the IRL series and NHIS owner Bob Bahre. And,
given the event's sagging attendance and diminishing revenue, it's
quite likely it will be the last time NHIS stages such a race.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after IRL qualifying was delayed by rain, the sun
finally poked through enabling practice to get underway. However,
there remained clouds of doubt over the IRL's future at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bahre expressed some concerns about extending the
contract with the series at his one-mile oval. ``I thought it would
work out better, but it hasn't been any better,'' he said,
referring to the decision to bolt from the Championship Auto Racing
Teams schedule and join the IRL as a charter venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Bob today and, obviously, there's a lot of
speculation around the garage area, which you might expect on a
rainy Saturday afternoon,'' George said. ``But we're on the track
running as we speak and we're looking forward to a good race
tomorrow. Hopefully, a positive result will make for some positive
discussions regarding the future.''
</P>
<P>
   George indicated those discussions would likely take place next
week. However, if the relationship is to continue, it is clear the
IRL and NHIS will have to work out a way to improve attendance,
which has declined from 24,000 two years ago to 22,000 last year.
Moreover, because he was unable to acquire a title sponsor, Bahre
indicated he stood to lose as much as $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any solutions for making the IRL more viable at
NHIS, George said, ``I do, but I don't know how viable they are. I
think that I want to sit down with our people and various promoters
and discuss them. I wish I had a little more P.T. Barnum in me, but
I don't really believe that I do. I think there are others who have
a flair for that kind of promotion. I think there's a practical
side of me that believes if you put good minds to work on trying to
develop solutions, that any problems can be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are the chances NHIS will remain on the 1999 IRL
schedule?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to comment on that question at this point
in time,'' George said. ``I think, in due course as we try to put
our schedule together for next year, we'll certainly have
discussions _ soon _ because we obviously want to release our
schedule. It has to be a decision that we reach jointly, and one
that both parties feel comfortable with announcing. We both have
agreed that our main focus is putting on an event (today) and
that's where we're at.''

<P>

   Winston Cup points leader  &UR; Jeremy Mayfield  &LR; finally got into the
winner's circle last weekend by steering his Mobil 1 Ford
Thunderbird to victory at the Pocono 500, his first career triumph
on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. In doing so, Mayfield, a native
of Owensboro, Ky., passed boyhood idol  &UR; Darrell Waltrip  &LR; for the
lead and held off two-time Winston Cup champion  &UR; Jeff Gordon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the
race runner-up. ``To pass Darrell Waltrip for the lead for my first
win and to have Jeff Gordon behind me and  &UR; Dale Jarrett  &LR; behind
him, that's a lot of heavy hitters,'' said Mayfield, who will
attempt to extend his 36-point lead over Gordon (2,208 to 2,172) in
Sunday's Save Mart/Kragen 350-kilometer race at Sears Point Raceway
in Sonoma, Calif. ``But Darrell, that's pretty wild. For someone
who inspired me to want to win and want to become who I am  &UR; today &LR; ,
that's pretty neat.'' ... Winston Cup driver  &UR; Ricky Craven  &LR; of
Newburgh, Maine, took a significant step in his recovery from
post-concussion syndrome, which has kept him sidelined since March
9, when he tested his own Busch Grand National car last week at
Watkins Glen, N.Y. ``I reestablished the hunger that maybe didn't
exist three months ago,'' said Craven, who is aiming for a comeback
to the Winston Cup circuit at NHIS for the Jiffy Lube 300 July 12.
``I'm looking to return to the focus and level of concentration I
had before. We tested for about 40 laps. It was a one-day test, but
it was really important for us.'' ... CART driver  &UR; Robby
Gordon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was formerly employed on the NASCAR circuit with Team
Sabco before he was discharged by team owner  &UR; Felix Sabates &LR; , &UR;  &LR; will
return to Winston Cup racing this weekend behind the wheel of a
Caterpillar-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo fielded by American
Equipment Racing owner  &UR; Howard (Buzz) McCall &LR; . ``To say I'm excited
about the opportunity to drive the 96 CAT car and throw my hat back
in the NASCAR ring is an understatement,'' Gordon said. ``A lot of
people had to give the approval for this to happen, and I don't
plan on letting anyone down. I told the team to bring a few extra
sets of wheels because I plan to drive them off the car.'' ...
NASCAR president  &UR; Bill France Jr. &LR;  was the keynote speaker at the
Associated Press Sports Editors convention in Richmond Thursday.
France speculated that the series, which has grown to a rec-ord 33
events, may split before it expands again, but not anytime in the
near future. ``We don't think right now that the parts would be
worth as much as the whole,'' he said. ``If we grow too fast, I
don't think we're smart enough to handle it, to keep our arms
wrapped around it and not let things go.'' France did joke that if
he were an NBA owner, ``I'd make the players wear long-sleeve
shirts and pants with logos all over them. Can you imagine  &UR; Dennis
Rodman  &LR; selling space on his uniform?''
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After recording his first CART victory in Portland, Ore., two
years ago,  &UR; Alex Zanardi  &LR; returned to the scene of his momentous
triumph and duplicated the feat by winning last week's
Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200. It was Zanardi's second win in a row and
fourth of the FedEx CART Championship series for the Target/Chip
Ganassi Racing team, giving him a whopping 38-point lead over  &UR; Greg
Moore  &LR; in the PPG Cup standings. Moore wiped out in a Turn 1
accident that collected the cars of Newman-Haas teammates  &UR; Michael
Andretti  &LR; and  &UR; Christian Fittipaldi  &LR; as well as Team Kool driver
 &UR; Paul Tracy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was already under probation for wrecking
Fittipaldi in Detroit. ``I passed two or three cars as I went down
to the inside of the track,'' Moore said later. ``I misjudged how
deep I went in before the Festival Curves. I made a mistake and I
feel bad for Christian and Paul.'' Said Fittipaldi: ``We are going
through a very tough time and just want to finish some races. It's
easy for Greg to say he is sorry after the fact, but here I am out
of the race. He just came over the grass out of control into me. An
apology is good between drivers, but it unfortunately doesn't
change the end result.''

SOME OF CHARM GONE FROM GOLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The absence of Silver Charm, caused by a fever, has
diminished the importance of Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold
Cup, but the meeting between handicap champion Skip Away and the
talented Gentlemen should be interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, last year's 3-year-old champion, was withdrawn
from the much-anticipated showdown with Skip Away Wednesday after
he developed a high temperature. Trainer Bob Baffert indicated that
the big gray will be out for at least a month, putting a
confrontation in the $1 million Pacific Classic Aug. 15, also
scheduled to feature Skip Away, in jeopardy as well. It could be
that the earliest Silver Charm-Skip Away meeting would be in the
Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took blood and it showed that he did have a bug,'' Baffert
said Thursday. ``We'll have to give him five days off. The workout
(Silver Charm ran five-eighths in :58 3/5 at Santa Anita Tuesday)
probably brought it out. It's not a killer bug, but I can't run him
now for at least 30 days. When you lose five days with him, it's
like losing two weeks with any other horse. I'll have to sit down
with (owner) Bob Lewis and figure out a plan for him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Gold Cup has eight horses entered, with Gentlemen
and Puerto Madero, both owned by Hollywood Park chairman R.D.
Hubbard, forming a powerful coupled entry. Floriselli, Bagshot,
Budroyale, Don't Blame Rio, and Mud Route, the last a horse with
ability trained by Ron McAnally, round out the field. All will
carry 124 pounds over 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens now that Silver
Charm is out, beat Skip Away in the Pimlico Special last year and
went on to win both the Gold Cup and the Pacific Classic. At that
point, the Argentina-bred horse trained by Richard Mandella was a
top contender for both Horse of the Year and handicap champion
honors. However, he ran fifth in the Woodbine Mile on the grass
Sept. 20, with a throat problem blamed for his poor performance. He
subsequently developed a fever and missed the Breeders' Cup at
Hollywood Nov. 8, which kept him from winning any Eclipse Awards,
although he still received strong support.
</P>
<P>
   Now age 6, but with only 19 career starts, Gentlemen returned to
the races with an easy victory in the San Antonio Handicap Feb. 7,
but a month later he bled and finished last in the Santa Anita
Handicap. The Gold Cup marks Gentlemen's latest comeback, and,
along with Puerto Madero, who ran a good second to Skip Away in the
Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs May 30 and who will again
be ridden by Kent Desormeaux, he should at least make Skip Away,
who will have the services of Jerry Bailey, work for his seventh
straight victory.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   How big is Baffert?
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the leading rider in the country, announced June 12
that he was going to switch his tack to New York for the Saratoga
meeting, which begins July 29, then would stay on for the Belmont
fall meeting. This caused quite a stir in the Big Apple. However,
nine days later, Stevens's agent,  &UR; Ron Anderson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; announced that
the jockey was instead staying in California and would ride the Del
Mar meet, which commences July 22. Why? Because Baffert gave
Stevens first call to ride every horse in his barn.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who had narrow misses in the Triple Crown the last two
years, losing the Belmont Stakes in close finishes with both Silver
Charm and Real Quiet, is the latest trainer to be elevated to the
``genius'' category, and eager owners have swamped him with
2-year-olds. ``We've been offered a position to ride a lot of good,
young horses at Del Mar and we're going to stay put and just
continue on here,'' said Anderson. ``We've been approached by Bob
Baffert with a whole bunch of young horses, which he anticipates
developing into good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, getting to ride Baffert's entire barn means that
Stevens can guide Real Quiet, hero of the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness before losing the Belmont by a nose to Victory Gallop,
ridden by none other than Gary Stevens. If you're asking, ``Does
this mean Desormeaux was fired following his magical mystery tour
aboard Real Quiet in the Belmont?'' the answer is ``yes,'' but he
was allowed to keep his dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 45 2-year-olds; 25 of them look awesome,'' said
Baffert. ``I'll need more than one rider (meaning, he'll still use
Desormeaux, whose career he was credited with reviving). I started
talking to Gary at the Preakness. He has first call on all my
horses. If that means Gary wants to ride Real Quiet, then he'll
ride Real Quiet. Gary can get out of the agreement anytime. It's
just a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens may have to chose between Real Quiet and Victory Gallop,
and many feel Victory Gallop is the better of the two, for the $1
million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Aug. 9. Surprisingly,
 &UR; Elliott Walden &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who trains Victory Gallop, thinks that Stevens
will stay with his charge. ``I talked with Anderson on Wednesday
and he basically told me that Gary is Victory Gallop's rider,''
said Walden. ``I say that with confidence but not 100 percent
confidence. He told me he doesn't anticipate making a change, but
anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden shouldn't count on Stevens riding for him. Baffert is
just too big.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House, who defeated Silver Charm in the Santa Anita Derby
last year, then ran 3-2-3, respectively, in the Triple Crown races,
drilled 7 furlongs in a bullet (best of day) 1:25 2/5 at Hollywood
Park Wednesday as he continues to work well toward his 4-year-old
debut in the Bel Air Handicap July 11. Free House has not raced
since running last in the Super Derby at Louisiana Downs last
September. He had been on the shelf with muscle soreness ... Deputy
Commander, who won the Travers Stakes and Super Derby last year and
also finished second to Skip Away in the $4 million Breeders' Cup
Classic, was recently retired after suffering a suspensory tear in
his right front leg in the Californian Stakes May 31 ... Lil's Lad,
one of the top Triple Crown contenders before chipping his left
front ankle in the Blue Grass April 11, is back in training and
pointing toward a comeback race at the end of the Saratoga meeting
... Black Cash, a promising sort who finished fifth in the
Preakness, has been suffering from a lung infection but may be back
in time to make the Jim Dandy at The Spa Aug. 9 ... Orville N
Wilbur's, considered the fastest 3-year-old in California earlier
this season, will be given a vacation on the West Coast after
refusing to train after being shipped to Belmont Park to run in the
Riva Ridge Stakes June 6.

DODGERS' VALDES PITCHES A GEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If there is a second act in the Dodgers' 1998
season, Ismael Valdes might be the perfect man to play the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who has struggled during most of the Dodgers' difficult
year, took a perfect game into the eighth inning Saturday night and
settled for a one-hit 2-0 shutout over the Pittsburgh Pirates in
front of 37,821 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (6-7) was barely challenged until Kevin Young lined a
sharp single to center on the first pitch of the eighth inning.
Valdes then retired the final six batters to give the Dodgers their
second consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the perfect game in the eighth inning,''
said Valdes, who finished with seven strikeouts in his eighth
career complete game. ``No matter what I did, it was a perfect game
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who took a no-hitter into the seventh inning just three
weeks ago against Oakland, threw the 26th one-hitter in Dodgers
history. The last was Aug. 5, 1995 by Hideo Nomo, a 3-0 victory at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to throw strikes inside and out,'' Valdes said.
``Young hit a slider on he outside corner, and he hit it good.
Everybody wants to throw a perfect game. If it is my destiny, I
will have my perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   All Valdes needed was a bases-loaded single by Raul Mondesi off
Pirates starter Francisco Cordova (6-6) with two outs in the sixth.
Mondesi also came up with the bases loaded in the first but
grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside to the victory was that division-leading San
Diego also won, keeping its lead over the third-place Dodgers at
13{ games. Second-place San Francisco also won, staying seven games
in front.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Dodgers, an overpowering Valdes means hope in the
second half. In his past four starts, including the June 10 two-hit
shutout against Oakland, Valdes has allowed just four earned runs
in 301/3 innings for a 1.19 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't have much more luck than the Pirates against
Cordova. He allowed only four hits and two runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   After the bases-loaded jam in the first, Cordova retired 13
consecutive batters before Eric Young opened the sixth with a
double to left, extending his hitting streak to a season-high 11
games. One out later, Gary Sheffield was intentionally walked and
Eric Karros drew a base on balls to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   This time Mondesi came through with a sharp single to left that
scored Young and Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cordova threw an excellent game,'' Valdes said, ``but someone
is going to win and someone is going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes only allowed two balls to the outfield, a fly to right by
Lou Collier in the third and soft liner by Jason Kendall to end the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best we've seen of him,'' said Pirates manager
Gene Lamont, whose team got 10 hits and four runs in five innings
against Valdes on April 30. ``The second time around, he threw
breaking balls. He had real good control of them.''.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an erratic season, Valdes had a similar game three weeks
ago against Oakland, a two-hit 2-0 shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Against the A's, Valdes walked the leadoff batter in the third
but did not allow a hit until Matt Stairs singled up the middle
with two outs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave up a single to Mike Macfarlane with two outs in the
eighth and nearly lost his shutout in the ninth when left fielder
Roger Cedeno misplayed Scott Spiezio's liner for a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   And like his matchup with Cordova, Valdes had an opponent on his
game. The A's Kenny Rogers allowed two hits and no earned runs in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   That was Valdes' first two-hitter since Sept. 17, 1995 against
St. Louis and his first complete game since Sept. 23, 1995 at San
Diego, a span of 77 games.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes won 13 games that year and went 15-7 in 1996. But his
career began to falter from there, going 10-11 last season even
though he was fourth in the National League with a 2.65 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates began to question his grit on the mound, and Karros
criticized Valdes to his face. With the team's slow start, Valdes
was a target for more criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He is 2-6 with a 5.23 ERA on the road. But at home he is 4-1
with a 2.51 ERA. &QL;

HOMER BREAKS D-BACKS  
 RODRIGUEZ'S BLAST IN 9TH CLINCHES IT FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks' first season reached its 81-game
halfway point Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the question, is their glass half empty or
half full?
</P>
<P>
   After a 6-4 interleague loss to the Seattle Mariners at Bank One
Ballpark, the answer is half empty. More than half-empty.
Two-thirds empty, to be exact, because their record stands at
27-54.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was a microcosm of the season _ Andy Benes
pitching well at times but not throughout, errors in the field,
baserunning blunders and the inability to get the big hit at the
crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some mistakes, and they probably cost us,''
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   So the second half begins today with the team searching for a
way to find more victories and the respectability that comes with
it. It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (34-47) and the Diamondbacks traded solo home runs by
Russ Davis and Yamil Benitez for a 1-1 tie at the end of the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez made it 2-1 in the fourth when he drove home Matt
Williams with a single off Seattle left-hander Jeff Fassero (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Benes (6-8) managed to hold the lead until the
sixth inning, when the Mariners scored an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora led off the inning with a line-drive single to center.
Arizona center fielder Devon White let the ball go under his glove
for a two-base error. Cora went on to score when Alex Rodriguez hit
a slow roller in front of Williams at third base. Rodriguez beat
the throw and moved to second as Williams' throw bounced past first
baseman Travis Lee for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Benes was pitching at full strength at that point was up
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   When he batted against Fassero in the fifth, he popped out to
David Segui at first but hit himself in the left ankle with his
backswing. Benes said it stung but that it didn't affect him.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 4-2 lead in the seventh when Dan Wilson and Rob
Ducey hit back-to-back doubles and Ducey later scored on a single
by Cora. Ducey had been caught in a rundown between second and
third on a bunt attempt in front of the mound by Fassero, but
escaped when Williams missed the tag and he wound up at third.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks pulled to within 4-3 in the eighth, and
probably should have tied it or perhaps even taken the lead, but
couldn't get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez drove in his third run of the game with a single, and
the Diamondbacks loaded the bases with two outs. But second baseman
Tony Batista grounded into a fielder's choice to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 48,488 _ the Diamondbacks' 15th sellout of the
season _ sensed the team was still in the game in the ninth, but
the Mariners dimmed their hopes when pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill
hit a shallow single to left field with one out and scored on
Rodriguez's opposite-field home run to right, his 27th of the
season. The shot came off right-hander Bobby Chouinard, who had
replaced Benes after the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   That brought on big right-hander Heathcliff Slocumb to face
Arizona in the ninth. The Mariners' bullpen had been less than
stellar to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Slocumb walked pinch-hitter Andy Fox to lead off the inning, and
David Dellucci drove Fox home with an opposite-field single to left
to make it 6-4. Slocumb escaped trouble and earned his third save
of the season by getting Williams to ground into a 5-4-3 double
play to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   After shutting out Texas for eight innings on Monday night in
Arlington, Benes said he felt good on the mound, striking out a
season-high eight and walking just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their guy (Fassero) threw a great game. You have to tip
your cap to Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I pitched well for the most part and have been
recently. Buck expects it, Mark (Connor, pitching coach) expects
it, my teammates expect it and I expect it. I expected to win, but
unfortunately, it didn't happen.'' &QL;

MENTAL MISTAKES COST D- BACKS  
 2 ERRORS ON SCORE BOARD DON'T TELL WHOLE STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The scoreboard showed the Diamondbacks made two errors
in their loss to the Seattle Mariners on Saturday night at Bank One
Ballpark. That was the official total. Unofficially, the damage was
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Mariners' runs, two might have been prevented. Meanwhile,
the three Diamondbacks runs could have been expanded upon. Did any
of that make a difference in a 6-4 game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some mistakes that probably cost us,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   For five innings the Diamondbacks demonstrated the how-to
section of the manual. Starter Andy Benes was sharp and the team
was solid. The rest of the game was on what to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The error column on the scoreboard doesn't always indicate how
you play, good or bad,'' said Showalter. ``Tonight we made some
mental errors that cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the Seattle sixth, Joey Cora hit a sinking liner to
center field. Had Devon White let the ball bounce in front of him,
Cora would have been held to a single. White knows something about
defense and has seven Gold Gloves to prove it. But he decided to
attempt a shoestring catch. The ball skipped under his glove and
Cora ended up at third, from where it was much easier to score on
Alex Rodriguez's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams threw the ball away on the play, but
Benes cracked down, striking out Ken Griffey Jr, getting David
Segui on a deep fly to center and, after walking Jay Buhner,
striking out Russ Davis, who had homered in the second for the
first Seattle run.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh with the game tied at 2, successive doubles by
Dan Wilson and Rob Ducey put Seattle up, 3-2. Pitcher Jeff Fassero
laid down a bad sacrifice bunt. It went directly to Benes, who had
Ducey dead off second base. Benes ran at Ducey and faked a throw to
second, then fired to Williams at third. Ducey retreated to second
base. Williams threw to shortstop Jay Bell, which caused Ducey to
change direction. Bell then threw back to Williams, but Ducey
already was running past. He avoided the swipe tag and ended up on
third.
</P>
<P>
   And Fassero was on second. So instead of the Diamondbacks having
a runner on first (Fassero) and one out, it was second and third
and none out. Ducey scored on Cora's single, making it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to lay any individual blame, Showalter said, ``We
created a little too much cushion,'' in allowing Ducey to make it
to third.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he didn't know what went wrong, and Bell wasn't
around to take questions. That left it up to Benes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you execute the rundown is to make the runner commit
one way or another,'' he said. ``I take responsibility because the
guy (Ducey) was in the middle of the diamond. But, as a starting
pitcher, you're not used to running and throwing the ball. Nine
times out of 10 we get the guy out. Tonight, we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two, the Diamondbacks scored a run in the eighth.
But they might have had more. David Dellucci led off with a single
and Williams singled to put runners on first and third with none
out. Travis Lee then topped a ball in front of the plate. Dellucci
broke for home, changed his mind and was thrown out trying to get
back to third.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tying run no longer was 90 feet from home plate. Yamil
Benitez eventually drove in Williams for his third RBI of the game,
but that was it.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

   &UR; ALREADY DEAD: A CALIFORNIA GOTHIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Denis Johnson. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In this creepy novel populated by a large cast of petty crooks
and wack jobs, an alcoholic marijuana grower facing the twin
threats of disinheritance and retaliation for a cocaine deal gone
bad cooks up a wild scheme with a Nietzsche-quoting drifter. ``Once
Johnson gets his hooks into you -- it takes about two sentences --
it's ... pretty much impossible to stop reading,'' David Gates
wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICAN SCRIPTURE: MAKING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Pauline Maier. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This feisty and highly original study, selected as one of the
best books of 1997 by the editors of the Book Review, presents the
Declaration of Independence as the embodiment of the American mind
and Colonial experience rather than as a product of Thomas
Jefferson's pen or the expression of some philosophy of natural
rights. By placing the document in the context of 90 previous
declarations issued throughout the colonies, the author ``offers
Americans a fresh perspective on their most treasured national
relic,'' Richard Alan Ryerson wrote here last year.  &UR; ANGEL IN THE
WHIRLWIND: THE TRIUMPH OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION &LR; , by Benson
Bobrick (Penguin, $15.95), reminds readers that the Revolutionary
War was full of amazing stories and characters -- led by a
heaven-sent hero (George Washington) and a world-class villain
(Benedict Arnold). Bobrick ``has studied his subject deeply and
writes about it with real understanding and verve,'' Frederick
Allen said in these pages in 1997. In  &UR; THE LONG AFFAIR: THOMAS
JEFFERSON AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 1785-1800 &LR; , by Conor Cruise
O'Brien (University of Chicago, $15), an Irish author locates a
strain of visionary violence in Jefferson's near-religious defense
of the Revolution. In 1996, Richard Brookhiser said this ``cranky
and sweeping'' narrative ``goes a long way to show that the bust
has shoulders of clay.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITTAKER CHAMBERS: A BIOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sam Tanenhaus. Modern Library, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The accuser of Alger Hiss gets sympathetic, but not
hagiographic, treatment in this copious biography, which sheds new
light on its famously enigmatic protagonist, especially his
post-Hiss existence. Last year in the Book Review, Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. called this a ``serious and absorbing work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEDICINE MEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alice Adams. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The author demolishes the divine right of American doctorhood by
having her 40-ish heroine wonder whether her crushing headaches are
an allergic reaction to her physicians -- all of them men. Last
year our reviewer, Deborah Mason, lamented the unrelenting
doctor-bashing but said the novel ``in many ways ... is
representative of the bracing frankness and tart ironies of the
Adams oeuvre.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; SUPERIOR WOMEN &LR; 
($14), a melancholy group portrait that follows five mismatched
Radcliffe girls -- rich, poor, fat, thin -- through four decades of
growing disappointment and crises of midlife and identity. In 1984
in these pages, Lois Gould admired Adams' ``elegant, rhythmic
style'' and ``fine, wry logic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST GIFT OF TIME: LIFE BEYOND SIXTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn G. Heilbrun. Ballantine, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Turning 70, a feminist pioneer and scholar looks back on the
unexpected pleasures, friendships and rewards of her 60s. This
buoyant collection of revelations and reflections is ``like a
letter to a friend, the kind you don't lie to,'' Rebecca Pepper
Sinkler wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRACES: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ida Fink. Translated by Philip Boehm and Francine Prose.
Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These spare, lucid tales about everyday life among the Jewish
bourgeoisie in Nazi-era Poland mix normalcy with terror, revealing
the avid need of accountants, housewives and piano students to live
fully even in the shadow of death. ``Fink's gift is for the
delicate miniature, the oblique detail that freezes the reader's
heart,'' Fernanda Eberstadt said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUR GUYS: THE GLEN RIDGE RAPE AND THE SECRET LIFE OF THE
PERFECT SUBURB &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bernard Lefkowitz. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This disturbing account of the highly publicized rape of a
mentally retarded girl by a group of teen-age athletes suggests
that similar crimes are being committed across the nation and that
much of the fault lies in America's cult of the sports hero. Last
year in the Book Review, Russell Banks called this ``a calm,
methodical, painstakingly researched book ... that should be read
by parents and educators alike.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KOWLOON TONG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Theroux. Mariner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A British mother and her 43-year-old son living in Hong Kong
confront the imminent ``Chinese take-away'' with passive rage and
resentment in this novel. ``Theroux's astringent misanthropy and
narrative momentum are powerful propellants,'' Thomas Keneally
wrote here in 1997. Many of the 60-odd tales in Theroux's
 &UR; COLLECTED STORIES &LR;  (Penguin, $15.95) are inhabited by ordinary
no-nonsense people who find themselves immersed in Gothic
goings-on, or solitary narrators whose anonymity is threatened by
outside forces. ``Theroux displays ... a remarkable ear,'' William
H. Pritchard wrote here last year. ``He ... inhabits his sentences
in a rewardingly comic way.''

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As President Bill Clinton toured the Great Wall of
China on Sunday, neighboring India slammed his attempt to use
weekend summit talks with the Chinese government to cool the
Pakistan-India nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``India categorically rejects the notion of these two countries
arrogating to themselves joint or individual responsibility for the
maintenance of peace, stability and security in the region,'' said
an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   India, which exploded five underground nuclear test devices in
early May, vented its anger at a ``presidential joint statement on
South Asia'' issued Saturday by Clinton and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians seemed outraged by a passage urging India and
Pakistan to ``adhere immediately and unconditionally'' to the
international nuclear test ban treaty, and to refrain from turning
their nuclear test devices into deployed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach reflects the hegemonistic mentality of a bygone
era in international relations and is completely unacceptable and
out of place in the present-day world,'' said the Indian response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is most ironic that two countries that have directly and
indirectly contributed to the unabated proliferation of nuclear
weapons and delivery systems in our neighborhood are now presuming
to prescribe the norms for non-proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   India's unusually harsh statement was issued first in New Delhi
late Saturday and then echoed Sunday in a second statement by the
Indian embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which exploded five nuclear devices of its own in late
May, did not formally respond to the Indian statement.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions turned into violence Sunday on both sides of a
430-mile-long U.N.-supervised cease-fire line that divides Indian
and Pakistani sectors of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani military officials charged that Indian mortar fire
across the cease-fire line killed 11 people, including a
two-year-old boy. Indian police reported that 13 people were
injured by a bomb of unknown origin on the Indian side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained silent on the Indian flare-up as he rejoined
the Chinese president Sunday night for a private dinner at the
Communist Party's Zhongnanhai leadership compound off Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, accompanying the
president in Beijing, said the Indians are behaving as though
``everyone is out of step with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had better stop dismissing statements like this because
they are dismissing what is a very evident signal from the rest of
the world that what they are doing has not gained them stature,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On this sweltering Day Four of his nine-day China excursion,
Clinton seemed to be going to considerable lengths to avoid saying
anything controversial, especially about his Chinese hosts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chongwenmen Protestant church Sunday morning, the
President and Mrs. Clinton and their daughter Chelsea sat on the
front row through the service. Then Clinton rose to a podium and
spoke for two or three minutes, praising the growth of Christianity
in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith
in China, and we rejoice to hear Reverend Shi (Zesheng) cite the
numbers of churches and other places of worship where people are
practicing their faith today,'' Clinton told the congregation,
referring to the minister's earlier comment that China has 12,000
churches and 25,000 places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton and his aides earlier said he would address the
issue of religious freedom in China, he did not mention the issue
of religious oppression.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley explained later, ``It was
extremely hot in the church and the pastor made a wonderful
ceremony that went on for quite a long time, and so under the
circumstances the President decided to drastically shorten his
prepared remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Sunday was a first-class touring day for the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   They ventured through the Forbidden City in the center of the
capital and walked along the Great Wall at Badaling, an hour from
downtown Beijing. Both places, which routinely draw thousands of
tourists daily, were closed to the public for the Clintons' visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there to say? It's an amazing place,'' said Clinton as
he walked along a cobblestone courtyard in the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   Then after walking along the top of the Great Wall, Clinton
stopped to write in a visitors' book: ``Thank you for showing the
Great Wall to me, my family and our American party. It was ever
more magnificent than we thought it would be. William J. Clinton.''

 &HT;    HOW SHANGHAI BECAME A CITY OF THE 21ST CENTURY
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON; CHINA-YOUTH-$ADV29.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ A precis of how Shanghai grew:
</P>
<P>
   1000-1800 A.D. _ Port. Shanghai expands from an obscure village
into a quiet fishing port because of its favorable location 12
miles from the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   1842 _ Concession. After defeating Chinese imperial armies in
the Opium Wars, Britain imposes the Treaty of Nanking. The British
occupy the choicest sector of Shanghai as a mini-colony known as a
``concession.'' The Americans, French and Japanese soon build their
own concessions.
</P>
<P>
   1900-1935 _ Sin. Shanghai is the richest, most elegant and most
decadent city in Asia. Western businessmen and rich Chinese cavort
in 688 brothels, some the size of factories. Opium dens operate
with impunity. An upper crust of Westerners plays billiards in the
Shanghai Club on the waterfront and bets on thoroughbreds at the
Race Club.
</P>
<P>
   July, 1921 _ Stirrings. Shanghai's wretched slums incubate the
Chinese Communist Party. Mao Tse-tung and 12 other representatives
of Communist cells meet over tea in a house off Huaihai Street to
form a national communist party.
</P>
<P>
   1926 _ Protest. Marshal Sun Chuanfang begins a campaign to evict
the British, French, American and other concession-holders from
their Shanghai enclaves. He calls the concessions a ``humiliation''
because they are ``a long-standing reminder of our loss of
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   1937-1945 _ Decline. Under Japanese occupation, Shanghai
withers. Silt clogs the port and nearby Huangpu River because no
one dredges it for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   May 1949 _ Takeover. Mao's troops march into Shanghai. They
impose steep taxes, destroy some of the worst slums and send off
hundreds of prostitutes known as ``sing-song girls'' for
``re-education.'' The fleeing Nationalist Chinese forces carry off
Bank of China's gold reserves to Taiwan, leaving Shanghai's
treasury empty.
</P>
<P>
   July 1985 _ Rebound. Former English teacher Jiang Zemin, China's
future president, is appointed Shanghai mayor by Beijing communist
authorities. He cultivates a populist image and brings in foreign
investment. Shanghai's economy grows by 110 percent in 1986. Jiang
is promoted to China's Politburo in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   April 1990 _ Takeoff. Ten months after the Tiananmen Square
massacre, Beijing decides to pour massive resources into Shanghai
to turn the city into an ultra-modern high-tech port. A
150-square-mile special zone on the Pudong peninsula is accorded
tax and customs privileges to draw in foreign banks and
manufacturers. Shanghai's economy starts to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1997 _ Bursting. By some estimates, 20 percent of the
world's construction sites are in Shanghai. Five years ago, the
city had one 20-story building. Now it has 966, and dozens more are
under construction.

 &HT;    CHINA HARVESTS A NEW BREED OF YOUNG GRADUATES
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV29.

<P>
   BEIJING _ China's new graduates are a rare tribe -- more
informed, more free, more pampered and more job-pressured than any
generation since the 1949 communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They herald a new round of university students unbowed by the
burden of their country's tumultuous recent past, as they take
their turn at molding its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for us students is to enrich ourselves. On
one hand to enrich ourselves with knowledge, and on the other to
broaden our visions,'' said Wang Qi, an earnest 22-year-old
graduating from Beijing University, where she majors in Japanese
language studies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to find students at Beida, as China's most
prestigious, 100-year-old university is nicknamed, speaking of
heavy personal responsibilities to China's future.
</P>
<P>
   That is, when they aren't mesmerized by the NBA Finals or the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At Fudan University in Shanghai, another distinguished school in
a more free-wheeling cosmopolitan setting, senior English major
Shen Yi Ming takes a breezier approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like rolling stones. It's easy to move from job to
job,'' said Shen, 22, a top student who starts working at the Bank
of China this summer. ``Shanghai will be a financial center. I'm
going to play some role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, no one can say just how this tranche of young Chinese
will progress through careers and family. It is a generation that
has no precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Beida's gated campus -- strictly closed to outsiders
since its students began the 1989 democracy movement that ended in
blood at Tiananmen Square -- the world's ways are breaking through.
Students are hooked on the internet, play the Shanghai stock market
and expect to own an apartment one of these years. Intrigued by
foreign technology and management techniques, they say they have no
time for anybody's political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were not even born when the death knell rang in
1976 for Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese leader who twice led into
pandemonium and destruction the country he had revolutionized. They
missed the Cultural Revolution that finally gasped to a full stop
with Mao's death, though their parents were among its most direct
victims.
</P>
<P>
   And they grew up with the late leader Deng Xiaoping's policies
of economic reform and openness. These doctrines they were
spoon-fed in current affairs classes were policies their elders
never envisioned and still may not fully comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Another impact is China's ``one-child'' policy that began 18
years ago and left many of them sibling-less, the ``Little
Emperors'' whose families count on them both ``to do good and do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more like them will follow; one-third of China's
population is under age 16.
</P>
<P>
   Despite national growth rates hovering around 8 percent a year,
China's young graduates see gathering clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Guo Xueliang, 20, is in a two-year program of politics and
administrative management at Beida that used to feed civil servants
to China's far-flung bureaucracy. Has she been walking the halls of
the ministries looking for work?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. I have passed the exam of qualification for public
service. But I'm not likely to work for the government,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guo is holding out for a private company, because the future of
state jobs looks shorter by the week under bureaucratic downsizing
and bankruptcy of unwieldy state industries.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The official China Daily newspaper reported this month that 80
percent of this year's graduating students have found jobs, which
might be an impressive success rate elsewhere. But this is a
country that used to assign every single graduate to a job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year graduating students have been totally
untethered to fend for themselves in the job market. And this
bumper crop of 1.06 million graduates is 17 percent larger than
last year -- the biggest since the People's Republic of China was
founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Beida is China's Harvard, Fudan University its Yale. What keeps
these young Chinese optimistic is knowing they are trained for the
new jobs opening up, while the laid-off workers -- often their
parents -- don't have a clue to making it in the high-tech,
high-finance world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our state-owned enterprises don't pay attention to
management,'' said Chen Feng, 28, an MBA student at Beida. ``So we
are very likely to go to foreign-funded enterprises. In this aspect
foreign enterprises are 100 years ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not want to work for the state, but the young people
who will be the cream of Chinese leadership by 2025 are extremely
patriotic. These students, even when interviewed outside the
presence of journalist-watching monitors, professed not to
understand the flap in America over Clinton visiting Tiananmen
Square, the symbol of democracy's crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe China is not the same today. Maybe the economy is
different. The economy was partly the cause of the politics (in
1989),'' said Chris Yu, 22, a Fudan student who chose the name
``Chris'' for her new job with the Deloitte Touche accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more likely for young people today to care more
about their career, their job and making a contribution to their
country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They have hard work ahead. Lay-offs and the one-child policy may
make them the sole supporter of their parents before they even
begin their own families. But for now they are still in their final
student days and follow universal student ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim now is to enjoy life thoroughly,'' said Fudan's
irreverent Shen, ``and have no regrets about university days.''

CLINTON AND JIANG CHANGE THE U.S.-CHINA ATMOSPHERE 
</HEADLINE>

 By ORVILLE SCHELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton, while bantering with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, looked out over the assemblage of
international press and high-ranking Chinese and U.S. officials and
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``And let me say something that will perhaps be unpopular with
everyone.'' The room fell absolutely silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent time with the Dalai Lama,'' he continued
insouciantly. ``I believe him to be an honest man, and I believe if
he had a conversation with President Jiang, they would like each
other very much.''
</P>
<P>
   A collective gasp of incredulity was followed by an
uncharacteristic burst of nervous laughter, and then a round of
enthusiastic applause.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident that something very unusual had just transpired.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours earlier on Saturday, Clinton's policy of
``constructive engagement'' seemed on the verge of crashing and
burning in a nightmare of recriminations by both Republicans and
some of his fellow Democrats that he was selling out to ``the
butchers of Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the Western edge of Tiananmen Square, as he and
Jiang reviewed a goose-stepping, bayonet-toting Chinese military
honor guard and howitzers began booming out a 21-gun salute near
the very monument where students had headquartered themselves
during the 1989 demonstrations, it was difficult to imagine how the
grim-faced Clinton was going to extricate himself from such
evocatively negative imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as he walked up the granite steps into the Great Hall,
past the place where the students had kneeled with the petition of
a redress of grievances raised in supplication above their heads,
Clinton looked rather like a wild animal frozen helplessly in the
headlights of an on-rushing vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a mere three hours later, as Clinton and Jiang appeared
together to make joint statements and answer questions, the mood
had almost completely changed.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were flashing each other relieved smiles,
and Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and Beijing reporters were
watching with rapt attention as subjects long taboo in this shrine
to Communist Party orthodoxy _ human rights, Tibet, arrests of
dissidents and more _ were discussed with a frankness and
directness unprecedented in America's often tortured relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   As those of us in the press corps milled around afterward,
trying to assess what we had just heard, we were further stunned to
learn that the entire event had been broadcast live over Central
Chinese Television to China's 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody familiar with China who had sat through endless
uninspired and rigidly scripted briefings and exchanges that have
usually passed for ``big leader'' dialogue could be anything but
amazed by the frankness with which these two leaders were virtually
debating with each other.
</P>
<P>
   What the exchange seemed to suggest was that the People's
Republic was edging up to an important watershed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, attempts to discuss such sensitive issues had
usually provoked indignant allegations that the United States was
``interfering in the internal affairs of China'' or was ``hurting
the feelings of the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jiang's forum suggested that the Chinese leadership was
struggling to enter a new era in which it would not only attempt to
proclaim a great power, but in which its leader would begin to
deport himself like one.
</P>
<P>
   A single robin hardly heralds springtime, and China continues to
be beset by numerous, daunting economic problems that could easily
balloon into grave political upheaval jeopardizing the present
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jiang's apparent new confidence and the new-found
camaraderie with Clinton hint that the White House policy of
``constructive engagement'' could be leading to a closer engagement
between the two countries on issues of agreement. This enhanced
level of comfort also could help each side raise sensitive and
long-embargoed issues that have bedeviled ``the relationship''
without raising fears of causing a loss of face and derailment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this summit accomplished no specific breakthrough,
no one who has been watching China over the past several decades
could fail to mark the occasion as anything but an event of
significance.
</P>
<P>
   What we will all be watching, over the weeks to come, is whether
this change in atmosphere will help lead to a resolution of some of
the issues that have kept the Sino-U.S. relationship from entering
a truly ``normal'' phase.

   CHINA-CLINTON-O629 _ BEIJING _ As President Bill Clinton was
trodding the Great Wall Sunday, neighboring India slammed his
attempt to use his weekend summit talks with China to cool off the
Pakistan-India nuclear testing crisis. ``India categorically
rejects the notion of these two countries abrogating to themselves
joint or individual responsibility for the maintanance of peace,
stability and security in the region,'' said an Indian Foreign
Ministry statement. It was issued first in New Delhi late Saturday
and then echoed Sunday in a second statement by the Indian embassy
in Beijing. India, which exploded five underground nuclear test
devices in early May, vented its anger at a ``presidential joint
statement on South Asia'' issued Saturday by Clinton and Chinese
president Jiang Zemin. (Albright/Kunstel , Cox News Service).

   MCDOUGAL-LEGAL (Undated) _ The look on her face was sheer joy as
Susan McDougal savored the freedom granted her last week by a
federal judge in Arkansas. But she will have little time to
celebrate or relax. Ms. McDougal is scheduled to be summoned to
another courtroom to face another prosecutor on July 13. And this
time the charges she faces have nothing to do with politics,
Clinton, or Whitewater, but with one of the most famous names in
classical music. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS-POLITICS (Undated) _ With a federal monitor
complaining that he cannot supervise the teamsters' presidential
election because Congress has cut off his funding, Republicans in
Congress are finding themselves in a pickle. Not only do
congressional Republicans appear to be blocking a monitor whose job
is to prevent election corruption in a union synonymous with
corruption, but the funding cutoff is alarming James P. Hoffa, the
front-running candidate who is considered friendlier to the
Republicans than the union's current leaders. By Linda Greenhouse.

increasingly important. Farber and a handful of others are known

WHILE SHAREHOLDERS WILL DO WELL, TCI'S CHAIRMAN WILL GET VERY
RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a mere eight days of negotiations, John Malone, the wily
chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., struck a good deal for
shareholders _ and an even richer deal for himself by agreeing to
sell his company to AT&AMP;T Corp. for $31.8 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal announced last week, the class B
shares of TCI stock, known as supervoting shares because they carry
10 votes each, will get 9.7 percent more per share in AT&AMP;T stock
than TCI's class A shares will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Malone owns an estimated 30 million class B shares, or more than
half of the outstanding 50 million class B shares, compared with
just 1.5 million class A shares, a fraction of the 472 million
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could be forgiven for not noticing just how rich
Malone's premium is because an AT&AMP;T official on Friday could not
say how many class B shares Malone owned or how many were
outstanding, and even TCI officials said they were unable to supply
definitive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There's more for Malone, who is retaining virtual control of
Liberty Media Corp., TCI's cable programming company, which will
have a much stronger financial base. The deal allows Liberty to
sell a handful of key assets to the parent company, retain the cash
from those sales and avoid any capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   And if Liberty is ever sold, Liberty's shareholders, led by
Malone, will get the profit, not AT&AMP;T shareholders. Once again,
Malone is rolling in Liberty's supervoting B shares.
</P>
<P>
   How did Malone pull it off? AT&AMP;T wanted TCI's cable systems, and
it was willing to pay mightily for them.
</P>
<P>
   Based on AT&AMP;T's closing price on Friday, Malone will receive
$48.42 in AT&AMP;T stock for each class B share, or $1.4 billion. Each
class A share will be bought for $44.02.
</P>
<P>
   Making the deal even sweeter for Malone is his right to buy 14
million more class B shares from the estate of TCI's former
chairman, Bob Magness. Malone can buy at the market price any time
before June 30, 1999. The status of these 14 million shares
contributed to the confusion on Friday about the number of class B
shares outstanding. Malone is believed to have bought six million
of those shares already.
</P>
<P>
   If Malone does wind up with 38 million class B shares, he would
get $167.2 million more from the AT&AMP;T deal than would the holders
of a comparable number of A shares. Little wonder then, that
although the class A and B shares traded at roughly the same price
before the deal, by Friday's close of the stock market, the class B
shares were priced at $42.375, while the class A shares were
selling for only $38.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Neither AT&AMP;T nor TCI wanted to tamper with the structure of TCI,
which is a holding company with three separately traded units: TCI,
the cable company, Liberty Media, the programming company, and TCI
Ventures, which owns stakes in Internet, international cable and
local phone businesses. Breaking up the units would have resulted
in huge capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T did not want to buy Liberty or TCI Ventures. So AT&AMP;T
agreed that Liberty would continue to trade separately from the
parent company as a tracking stock but that TCI Ventures would be
absorbed, a slight move toward simplification. Tracking stocks
reflect the performance of a group of assets technically owned by a
parent company _ in this case TCI, soon to be AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberty assets will be controlled by Liberty
shareholders. Malone, again through supervoting class B shares,
controls Liberty. One advantage of a tracking stock is that its
underlying assets can be swapped with assets in the parent company
without incurring taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Using this provision, Malone is transferring to AT&AMP;T several
assets under the control of Liberty and TCI Ventures, including a
stake in Teleport Communications and At Home Corp., for $5.5
billion in cash. AT&AMP;T had previously agreed to buy Teleport with
stock. It also agreed to buy Liberty's stake in At Home in cash.
The new Liberty will now get cash in both deals and avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is that he has exchanged $5.5 billion of assets tax
free _ which is part of the beauty of the whole tracking-stock
issues,'' said Alan Gould, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison.
``They convert these low tax-based assets and sell them at full
private market value, tax free. They had a very low tax basis in
both Teleport and At Home,'' meaning an ordinary transaction would
have led to a sizable gain.
</P>
<P>
   Malone in return gets a war chest for his use at Liberty. Though
Malone has said that Liberty will probably generate losses because
of its leasing deals, he has a history of building asset value and
then selling those assets at a markup.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks have some liabilities. Should AT&AMP;T lose money,
its creditors could look to Liberty to make up the difference. But
Malone, who over the years has made his fortune selling assets, is
betting he will be able to do it again with Liberty. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ As the Justice Department was readying its
antitrust suit against Microsoft this spring, the company hired a
dozen powerful lobbyists, choreographed rallies and news
conferences and issued sharp denunciations of the government. In
short, it waged the technology industry's equivalent of a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when the Federal Trade Commission was preparing its
antitrust suit against Intel this month, the company offered a
simple, polite statement: ``We are cooperating with the government
and will continue to cooperate. They are just doing their job, and
we respect their right to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the federal government filed its suit against
Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessor chips,
the company has remained largely silent, unwilling to offer
anything more than the most rudimentary public defense. And while
Microsoft representatives have been aggressively lobbying Congress
and the administration, Intel's are nowhere to be seen _ except at
the trade commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from them at all,'' said a senior
Congressional aide, who would normally be a target of lobbying on
antitrust issues. ``I just cleaned out my in-basket, and there's
nothing from them there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mulloy, the company spokesman who management decided would
be Intel's sole voice on the subject, explains the silence this
way: ``We don't think it benefits either side in this case to
conduct a debate in the public forum.''
</P>
<P>
   But background discussions with other Intel executives and
interviews with analysts who track the company closely suggest a
more complex set of motives. For one, they say, Intel's leaders
believe that Microsoft's aggressive public-relations blitz
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe Microsoft hurt themselves as much as they
helped,'' said Michael Slater, editor of The Microprocessor Report,
an industry newsletter. ``Microsoft came across as basically
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, a technology analyst with Cowan &AMP; Company, said,
``They took their cue from Microsoft and realized that the more
exposure they get, the less good it is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Intel executive agreed. Just after Microsoft staged a
rally of sorts in New York in early May, at which the company's
chairman, William H. Gates, and other industry executives exhorted
the government to stay out of the software business, this executive
asked with a dismissive chuckle, ``Can you imagine Andy doing
that?'' Andy Grove, Intel's chief executive at the time, is widely
admired in the computer industry for being a fierce but gracious
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   No one contends that Intel's leaders are humble, self-effacing
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The egos at the top of Intel are every bit as large as the
egos at the top of Microsoft; they feel just as self-righteous,''
said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, an
industry research company.
</P>
<P>
   But the company shows little of that to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's not a company that likes to talk about anything but
product,'' Slater said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intel's lawyers say they view the outcome of the trade
commission's suit as crucial to the company's future. The
government accuses Intel of threatening and injuring three computer
manufacturers as a means of coercing them to turn over patented
technologies by withholding technical information about Intel's
latest chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company insists that it must maintain full control over its
patented technologies and therefore will take the case all the way
to the Supreme Court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts and Intel executives noted that the company
faces even greater threats beyond the scope of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to deal with a real upheaval that has never
been seen before in the PC business _ pricing challenges'' in the
sub-$1,000 personal computer market, Peck said. There, Intel's
competitors are making real inroads, and the company's stock has
been in a prolonged slump. It closed Friday at $76.1875 a share,
down more than 25 percent from its 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the other challenges they face now,'' Peck said, ``this
doesn't have the highest priority. Besides, I don't think Intel
wants to be the test case, the litmus test for intellectual
property cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy says only, ``We have made a decision to litigate this in
the courts.'' And 10 days ago, the company did file a motion with
the court, arguing that the companies named in the suit _ Compaq,
Digital Equipment and Intergraph _ were customers, not competitors,
and therefore not subject to harm under federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy does take issue with the notion that Intel's strategy is
a direct reaction to Microsoft's approach.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that Intel issued a press release on Sept. 24,
announcing that the FTC had notified the company that it had opened
an investigation _ several weeks before the Justice Department
filed its suit against Microsoft. And that early release was just
as low key as the more recent statements and remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company said it will cooperate fully with the FTC in its
investigation,'' the release said, and then concluded with a bit of
what turned out to be undue optimism: ``In 1993, after a similar
investigation, the F.T.C. concluded that no further action was
warranted, and the investigation was closed. Intel expects that the
current investigation will come to a similar conclusion.''

PATENTS: CELL INSERTS MAY ONE DAY GROW NEW ORGANS, AVOIDING
TRANSPLANTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Calif.) (fb) 
By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it may sound like science fiction to suggest that human
cells can be inserted into the body and engineered to grow into new
organs, two Boston institutions have won a series of patents for
exactly such technology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Children's Hospital of Boston won three patents this month that
medical scientists hope will someday mean that patients in need of
a transplant can grow their own healthy new hearts, kidneys, livers
or other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the invention has the potential to revolutionize organ
transplanting, shortening waiting lists and controversy over organ
supplies, that day is by no means around the corner. The company
that licensed the three patents says it is just now preparing for
clinical trials using the new technology to grow tissues like
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try and show proof of principle in efficacy in
structural tissues first _ skin, bone, muscle,'' said Gail K.
Naughton, president of Advanced Tissue Sciences in La Jolla, Calif.
``Once medicine sees utility for these tissues, we'll go into more
complicated organs whose major functions are not structural but
systemic. The liver not only detoxifies, but makes all the protein
in the body, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has long depended on tissue grown outside the body _
known as ex-vivo engineering _ for transplants of cartilage, blood
vessels and skin. Skin grown in a laboratory is commonly grafted to
burn victims. But skin is generally considered easy to implant.
Other tissues can be grown in a laboratory, but the ex-vivo results
are much harder to transplant to a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of in-vivo is it offers the ability to actually
treat the patient based on their condition in a way that is most
advantageous to them,'' Naughton said. ``Say you have a skeletal
muscle defect and you're missing a large part of the muscle. A
skeletal muscle has to have a certain orientation, the fibers run a
certain way, and you don't want any scarring there. It's difficult
to grow a muscle outside the body to mimic the exact type of
structure, fibers and orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you put the cells inside the muscle, they can rely on
the body's own chemical signals for the pattern of the tissue, as
well as the physiological forces around the muscle, to prompt the
proper orientation and growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The three patents describe a process of growing tissue that
begins in a laboratory. Human cells are seeded on a
three-dimensional, biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolding
built from ordinary surgical suture material. Naughton said her
company usually used a dissolving suture material called
polyglycolic acid because the rate at which it dissolves can be
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crux of the discovery is if you put the cells in the right
three-dimensional orientation and the right distance apart, they
are able to get oxygen and nutrients and they then form a tissue,''
she said. Tissue grown outside the body needs bioreactors to pump
nutrients and oxygen into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new patents take advantage of the ability to use the blood
and oxygen supply in the body,'' Naughton said, ``so as long as you
use the right dimension of scaffolding, the cells get immediate
oxygen and nutrients supplies from the surrounding tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds simple, but it's taken decades to find the right
pore size and the right rate of scaffolding dissolving,'' she
added, ``so that as it dissolves it is replaced by the new tissue.
Otherwise, the cells die.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the cells are seeded on the scaffolding, the tiny mesh
structure is implanted into the body in the spot where replacement
tissue is needed. Then it incubates and grows into tissue,
replacing diseased tissue until it is contiguous with and
indistinguishable from the patient's own, healthy tissue. Naughton
cited one hypothetical example, of a baby born with a
malfunctioning liver, and said it would take four to six weeks for
the baby to grow enough new liver tissue to solve its problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say a child is born with a metabolic disorder _ he's missing
an enzyme,'' she said. ``Right now we can grow liver tissue outside
the body, but incorporating it into the body is a very, very
difficult because the liver is a very complicated organ. But if we
grow the cells in-vivo, inside the child's own body, the blood
flow, hormones and growth factors of the child's own liver will
help those cells grow into a new liver and that new liver will
replace the enzyme. The child doesn't need an entire new liver to
get those enzymes.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a treatment would only work if a patient had time to
wait for new tissues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is that if a patient is in an emergency situation
and needs to put a whole tissue on the body, then growing it
outside the body makes sense,'' Naughton said. Skin for burn
victims, for example, is grown in a laboratory so it will be
readily available. ``If you have more time and the success of the
transplant relies on how the implant orients itself with the rest
of the patient's body, then using these new patents makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Tissue Sciences has conducted animal trials using the
new patents to grow pancreas, gastrointestinal tracts, bone,
ligaments, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and livers. The company
hopes to begin clinical trials with human cells soon, and
ultimately to create a technology that will allow doctors to
implant cells that will grow into parts of or whole new organs.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton said she expected surgeons would someday remove part of
a liver riddled with cancer and prompt the body to grow a healthy
replacement, or implant a scaffolding bearing heart cells next to a
diseased heart and simply wait for a whole new heart to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not science fiction,'' she said. ``What we've seen in
tissue engineering in the last few years that people might have
called science fiction has rapidly become science fact. Once we
have the scaffolding, it's no longer science fiction to see these
other possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Vacanti, a pediatric surgeon at Children's Hospital of
Boston, and Robert S. Langer, a polymer chemist at MIT, won patents
5,759,830, 5,770,193, and 5,770,417.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

COMPUSA: REVISING COMPUTER RETAILING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Texas) (fb) 
By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDISON, Texas _ By a few minutes before midnight, a line
outside CompUSA's flagship store in this Dallas suburb stretched
past the training center entrance next door, the GNC nutrition
store, the Subway sandwich shop, the Packaging Store, the Elegant
Salon, the Converse Shoe Factory and Pam's Hallmark store.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had muted its mighty hype machine for the release of
Windows 98. But CompUSA, having just agreed to pay $275 million to
buy its chief rival, Computer City, from Tandy, was out to prove
that the computer retail store was not about to go the way of the
ice house.
</P>
<P>
   Its radio and newspaper advertisements offered the first 10
people in line a 266 megahertz computer for $98, and there were
special deals on modems, hard drives and so forth for those farther
back in a queue that began forming at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But how many in that line would buy a computer from CompUSA at
regular prices?
</P>
<P>
   Among the first 10 in line were Frank Callahan, a retired
regional sales manager for Raleigh Bicycles, and his wife, Janet.
Two years ago, when they bought their last computer, they came to
CompUSA to comparison shop. But they ordered their machine from IMS
Computers, a local assembler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get what we wanted built by IMS much cheaper,'' Janet
Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA's Packard Bell, Compaq and Acer models offered less
value and flexibility. ``Here, we had to take what was in the
package,'' Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Against competition from no-name direct marketers and shops like
IMS and big-name direct marketers like Dell Computer, CompUSA's
challenge is to keep the computer store alive even as it
diversifies into corporate sales and services.
</P>
<P>
   To attract customers like the Callahans, CompUSA again began
offering built-to-order computers last September under its own
brand name. Because the chain's previous effort to build its own
computers flopped a few years ago, this time it tried to avoid
accumulating a parts inventory _ whose value drops, on average, 2
percent a week _ by having contractors build the machines. But
since the contractors have not been able to keep up with demand,
the company says it will again start building computers.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA's chief executive, James F. Halpin, a blunt, brusque
400-megahertz type of guy in an industry where last year's business
model is usually as outdated as last year's computer, came in and
saved the company in 1994 when it was on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry has become even more competitive in the last
four years. Falling computer prices, strong competition and
diversification costs caused CompUSA's first-quarter profits to
fall 22 percent compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier, to $25.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company-wide, sales rose 14 percent, to $1.45 billion, but for
the 122 stores that have been open a year or more, they rose just
1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As computer buyers become more informed and confident, direct
marketers like Dell and Gateway 2000 are growing faster than
computer superstores like CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin concedes that Dell and other companies that take orders
on line or over the phone offer more megahertz for the money. ``Our
major vendors haven't been able to give us machines that compete,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While superstores as a category sold 3.1 million computers last
year _ an increase of almost a million in two years _ direct sales
rose by than 2 million, to 5.5 million units.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Direct markets are gaining a further advantage as more customers
shop on the Internet. Dell, which had sales of just $1 million a
day on its World Wide Web site in March 1997, was up to $3 million
a day by Christmas and is now billing $5 million a day on line _
more than 13 percent of its total sales.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA also recently began selling over the Internet, but the
popularity of computers selling for less than $1,000, at slim
profit margins, is squeezing revenues. Dataquest, a market research
company in San Jose, Calif., expects computer sales to rise 16
percent, to 35.2 million units, this year, but revenues to rise
only 3 percent, to $69.5 billion. The average price will fall to
$1,974 this year from $2,223 last year, Dataquest predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin portrays lower prices as an advantage because they expand
the market. Over the last two years, he said, the average family
income of computer buyers has fallen from $75,000 to less than
$50,000. ``Computers have become affordable to the middle class,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts called the Computer City acquisition a bargain,
pointing out that it eliminated a chief rival and afforded CompUSA
inexpensive expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harrington, editor of Computer Retail Week, sees the
Computer City acquisition raising CompUSA's profit margins, but
wonders if the company is trying to do too many things at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't fully integrated all the businesses they've
started,'' Harrington said. ``A bleeding Computer City on its back
is really going to test the company to the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though CompUSA announced that it would close some Computer City
stores, keeping the remainder staffed with qualified salespeople
could be a challenge. At one nearby Computer City store,
salespeople said that under Tandy, commissions had often doubled or
tripled their daily earnings. If CompUSA pays them like it pays its
own salespeople, who work without commissions, ``We're going to
leave,'' said one Computer City salesperson as others nodded.
</P>
<P>
   But in a field littered with wounded rivals _ Computer City has
been a steady money loser _ CompUSA and Halpin still appear to have
the best shot at revising the formula.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight last Thursday, Halpin was seen surveying the
600 or so customers storming through the doors of his San Francisco
store. ``I'm pumped!'' he was heard bellowing. ``It's like election
night. The votes are coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has positioned Windows 98 as minor upgrade, but Halpin
describes it as a spark for the whole computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I installed it on my daughter's computer at home,'' he
recounted. ``I asked her how she liked it. `Awesome,' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case shoppers are less impressed, CompUSA is moving
beyond brick-and-mortar stores. ``We sell computers any way a
customer wants to buy them,'' Halpin said. ``We can deliver and
install from one PC up to 2,000. We want to train you. We want to
service you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Addison store's back offices include a sales operation where
each workday 28 salespeople ring up businesses and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, challenges grow in the consumer end of the business.
Despite a towering kiosk trumpeting CompUSA's built-to-order
computers, few of the customers who showed up at the Addison store
on Thursday seemed aware of this option. With its own label, the
company says it can beat even Dell's prices on such systems _ a
contention Dell disputes _ but it will have to convince the many
current CompUSA customers who say they visit the stores mostly to
see what's new, maybe buy some cables or software before heading
elsewhere to buy a computer.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many shoppers are increasingly able to outsmart
the best marketing schemes.
</P>
<P>
   As Lisa Adams and Howard J. Huang, Dallas medical students,
stood in a checkout line, they described what seemed like an offer
of free _ or better than free _ computer memory modules: 16
megabytes of memory for $38 with a $40 mail-in rebate, but with
only one rebate per customer. They explained, however, that the
memory could only be installed in pairs. One rebate on two memory
chips made the price higher than that charged by other marketers on
the Internet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're counting on you to buy the other one,'' Huang said.
``Smart marketing trick.''
</P>
<P>
   But not smart enough. Huang and Ms. Adams were each buying one
16-megabyte module and pooling their rebates. They got 32 megabits
of free memory for Adams' computer _ truly for free. &QL;

   When Dorothy Otnow Lewis was a little girl, she was one of those
bright, lonely children who are picked on by their peers for being
vulnerable. Like anyone, she would sometimes fantasize violent
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she would never go beyond mere daydreams, but she
would wonder what made her different from the people she heard
about who acted out their fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   As she recounts in her compelling study of violence, ``Guilty by
Reason of Insanity: A Psychiatrist Explores the Mind of Killers,''
this question set her on a career course that led her first to
attend medical school to become a psychoanalyst, then to create a
clinic to study violent children, then to team up with a
neurologist to interview killers on death row and eventually to
write the present book, in which she reveals why certain people
step over a line and commit the depraved acts that normal people
only think about.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis was searching for born killers, people who deserved to
die for their misdeeds. But what she says she found instead were
killers whose brains and minds had been horrifically abused.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Lee Anne Jameson, a 13-year-old who asked to be
excused from school because of a bad feeling she was having and
after being refused suddenly stabbed her best friend to death with
a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Marie Moore, a 52-year-old who had become
sexually enslaved by Tony, a 14-year-old, and who had tortured and
murdered Belinda Weeks, another teen-ager. Most appallingly, there
was Johnny Frank Garrett, a 17-year-old who had sneaked into a
convent one night and raped and murdered an elderly nun.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases and others, Dr. Lewis says, she and her colleague
gradually discovered that the killers were doing to others as had
been done to them. They found that each was brain-damaged and had
suffered terrifying sexual abuse. Each had acted unconsciously
without any rational knowledge of what he or she had done.
</P>
<P>
   She argues that each was insane by any reasonable definition.
Yet in the cases where these killers had been convicted and
condemned to death, courts hearing the results of the author's
examinations refused to concede mitigating circumstances and grant
clemency. The killers were treated as if they knew what they were
doing.
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying passages in Dr. Lewis' book deal with what
she describes as the unearthing of multiple-personality disorders,
which for a long time, she says, she had trouble recognizing simply
because their diagnosis was unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   But as she gradually learned to ask the right questions, she
says, she was able to tease forth the alternate identities her
subjects had created to take on their pain in moments of suffering
like being raped as little children by their parents or like having
their naked buttocks placed on a red-hot stove.
</P>
<P>
   It was these so-called alters, like ``Billy'' in Marie Moore and
``Aaron Shockman'' in Johnny Garrett, who were able to describe the
murders their hosts had committed and to admit their own direct or
indirect complicity in them. Yet juries hearing Dr. Lewis'
testimony in these cases were not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty by Reason of Insanity'' is a bit of a cheat in that it
leads the reader to anticipate examinations of Ted Bundy, the
serial killer, and Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's murderer, both
of whom Dr. Lewis has interviewed, but then fails to deliver them,
possibly for legal reasons. The book also rambles somewhat and here
and there repeats itself.
</P>
<P>
   But in its most pointed passages it cogently questions the
responsibility of mentally damaged people for their crimes and asks
whether the death penalty, particularly for children, is ever
justified. Clearly, Dr. Lewis believes that it is not.
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, a professor at
New York University School of Medicine and a clinical professor at
Yale University Child Study Center, she has made it her mission to
find an example of a remorseless killer deserving of capital
punishment. But so far as her book documents her search she has
consistently failed.
</P>
<P>
   She finds no individuals able to kill repeatedly whose ``only
psychopathology, if you could call it that, is a lack of empathy
for other human beings.'' Even her interview with a professional
executioner reveals in its evidence of childhood abuse and patterns
of psychotic thinking another example of someone unconsciously
doing unto others as was too early done to him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for all its eloquence and power the somewhat
limited sampling of this book fails to dispel one's images of
deracinated street-gang members, culture-loving death-camp
commandants, professional hit men killing only for ``biz-i-ness''
or sociopaths like the fictional Hannibal Lecter who are supposedly
to the murder born.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly these are only literary fantasies; I am happy to say I
have never met one in person. But their lingering presence in one's
imagination may explain why juries have had such apparent
difficulty listening to Dr. Lewis' pleas for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   As she laments in her conclusion, ``In a given murder, our
desire to learn its causes, and the time we are willing to spend
doing that, are inversely proportional to the grisliness of the
crime and the pleasure we anticipate deriving from the execution.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Dr. Lewis powerfully revives the old liberal
belief that no excessively violent crime is committed without a
good reason. And she makes a strong case that capital punishment is
little more than another link in a chain of criminal retribution.
</P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a white board in the newsroom of TheStreet.com, an
investment news service published on the World Wide Web, staffers
keep a running list titled the ``self-importance meter.'' The
entrants vary, but, inevitably, somewhere in the ranking is the
name James J. Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer happens to be the service's co-founder, as well as one of
its marquee columnists. He writes three daily bombastic missives,
dispatched via e-mail to 18,000 subscribers, under the rubric
``Wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   His reach extends well beyond the computer terminal and this has
made Cramer a kind of Zelig of the information age, cutting across
all media and raising the issue of his own involvement in the
market as the manager of a $350 million private investment firm.
Cramer, 43, appears as a commentator on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' as a guest co-host on CNBC and in print with regular
columns in GQ and The New York Observer; he also has alliances with
online ventures including America Online and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Internet, he said, that provides immediacy to match
his freneticism, and that of the financial markets he covers.
``I've been waiting for this medium to be built all my life,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the offices of his investment fund on Wall Street, he
monitors the markets from a bank of computer terminals that proffer
data and news, zipping off e-mail between trades in an environment
which makes a typical newsroom appear sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not capable of thinking of anything in terms other than
stocks,'' he said. He described a meeting with an executive at
Disney, which owns ABC and whose Web site TheStreet.com supplies
with financial news and for which he recently did a television
pilot. ``All I could think about was, ``Disney's stock is down
today,'` he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer is betting on the notion that the rapid ups and downs of
the stock market make for compelling Internet fare, matching the
rapid-fire pace of the new medium. Cramer is hoping that the
growing sector of home investors, as well as the financial
professionals, who comprise 60 percent of the customers who pay
$9.95 a month for his wisdom, will translate into a publishing
success.
</P>
<P>
   Those who follow the world of online business news said it would
be a difficult market to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a huge number of competitors and some of them are
extremely well funded, everything from The Wall Street Journal
Online, to brokerages that are looking at ways of putting content
on line,'' said Mike Gazala, an analyst with Forrester Research in
Boston. He expressed doubt that TheStreet.com, with a staff of 30
and little brand recognition, could amass a large enough audience
to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Jim Cramer, I don't think there's much there,'' Gazala
said. ``If you took away Jim Cramer, you wouldn't have too many
people visiting that `street.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cramer remains the allure. Recently, he and his
co-founder, Martin Peretz, the owner and editor-in-chief of the New
Republic, received $10 million in venture capital financing from a
syndicate led by the investment firms Flatiron Partners, Chase
Capital Partners and Softbank Technology Ventures, who are now
minority stakeholders in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important trend,'' said Jerry Colonna,
co-founder of Flatiron Partners, of the quest for investment
information on line. He said that Cramer's cantankerous and
shoot-from-the-hip style of presentation was a major reason for the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, editor of TheStreet.com, conceded that Cramer's
involvement as manager of an investment firm presents an editorial
challenge. Some prospective employees have been concerned, he
conceded, that Cramer's dual life as a money manager and journalist
sullies the credibility of the financial news service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people we've tried to hire who said they're not
comfortable with the perception,'' Kansas said.
</P>
<P>
   When he first conceived of TheStreet.com, Cramer said, he
approached the Securities and Exchange Commission to ask advice on
how to set up the business to avoid conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of conflicts of interest is not a new one for Cramer.
In 1995, while a contributor to Smart Money magazine, Cramer was
widely criticized for an article that he wrote recommending the
stocks of several small companies in which he owned large stakes.
The article did not make note of those holdings. As a result of the
incident, Smart Money changed its policies, restricting
contributors from writing about stocks in which they own large
positions or which are thinly traded and adding disclosures about
the stock holdings of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   At TheStreet.com, rules were instituted under which Cramer would
not have any editorial control beyond his column. All his columns,
writings and television appearances are accompanied by disclaimers
of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean he skirts controversy, however. In January
1997, Cramer, through his fund, bought up 1.1 million shares of Dow
Jones stock, and was one of three big stockholders using their
investment to push the company to sell off Telerate, its financial
information business. He sold off most of his shares five months
later when it became clear they would not. (Cramer said he took
great pleasure in the fact that Dow Jones ultimately did sell
Telerate earlier this year.)
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas, the scrutiny of the medium in which he publishes is
a bigger issue than critics of Cramer's possible conflicts. ``To
me, the mainstream medium likes to harp on the potentially scary
issues relating to the Internet. We have to work very hard to rise
above that.''

   SCHWAB CHOOSES BBDO NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. has awarded its consolidated
brand advertising account for financial services to BBDO New York,
part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. Billings were
estimated at $40 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``BBDO's consistent track record with building brands like
General Electric and Visa convinced us they would be the right
partner,'' said Len Short, executive vice president for advertising
and brand management at Schwab in San Francisco. The assignments
being consolidated at BBDO New York had been handled by several
agencies, he added, like Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in San Francisco, part
of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and
Montgomery North in San Francisco, a spinoff of Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP;
Partners in New York that closed in December.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a brief review, Short said, that had
been narrowed to BBDO New York; Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in San
Francisco, owned by True North Communications; the Venice, Calif.,
office of TBWA Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of
Omnicom, and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Suissa Miller Advertising in Los Angeles _ which was named last
month to handle Schwab's core brokerage account, including ads for
trading and online services _ will continue with those assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Another brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., may conclude a
review on its account, with billings estimated at more than $70
million, sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   THREE ADS FOR NIKE WIN THE GRAND PRIX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three humorous commercials for Nike by Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco took top honors in the
competition for television and cinema work, winning the Grand Prix,
at the 45th annual International Advertising Festival in Cannes,
France.
</P>
<P>
   The spots, aimed at young skateboarders, present vignettes in
which athletes pursuing mainstream sports like golf, tennis, and
running are harassed and heckled _ treated, in other words, as
skateboarders often complain they are.
</P>
<P>
   Goodby, Silverstein, part of Omnicom Group, is one of two lead
agencies for Nike along with Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. The
timing of the honor was interesting because it came after
Advertising Age and Adweek published articles about the tug-of-war
between the two agencies for Nike's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 gold awards, called Lions, presented on Saturday,
American agencies won 12. Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis won
three for three commercials for Miller Lite beer, sold by the
Miller Brewing Company unit of the Philip Morris Companies. The
Venice, Calif., office of TBWA Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA
Worldwide unit of Omnicom, won two: one for a commercial for the
Weather Channel, owned by Landmark Communications, and the other
for a commercial for the Play Station National Hockey League game
sold by Sony Computer Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Renzo Rosso, chairman of Diesel SpA, the Italian clothing
company whose tongue-in-cheek campaign won the Grand Prix in 1997
for television and cinema spots, accepted the award for advertiser
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ACCOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seagate Technology Inc., Scotts Valley, Calif.,
expanded its relationship with its corporate brand agency, Foote,
Cone &AMP; Belding, San Francisco, part of True North Communications,
by awarding the agency additional duties for disk drive and tape
drive products. That account, with estimated billings of $12
million, had been handled by van Bronkhorst Group, Santa Clara,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard International Inc., Purchase, N.Y., to GSD&AMP;M, Austin,
Texas, a unit of Omnicom Group, to handle its Internet advertising,
which had been handled by Thunderhouse, a division of
McCann-Erickson World Group, New York, part of the Interpublic
Group of Companies. Billings were estimated at $5 million. GSD&AMP;M
already handles media services for Mastercard.
</P>
<P>
   MISCELLANY
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kerr Kelly Thompson/Earle Palmer Brown, Greenwich,
Conn., a unit of Earle Palmer Brown, was renamed Earle Palmer
Brown.

SUDDENLY A RUCKUS AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When America Online rebuffed AT&AMP;T's merger flirtations last
month, it could hardly have known that the long-distance giant
would soon marry what may be the online service's most potent
long-term enemy: the At Home Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, in which AT&AMP;T will get a 42 percent interest as part of
its $31.8 billion acquisition bid for Tele-Communications Inc. last
week, markets a high-speed Internet service over cable television
wires. It is hardly a force today, with only about 100,000
subscribers. America Online says it has 12 million customers, more
than half of the homes in the United States that have online
access.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a new front is opening in the Internet wars with the
development of so-called broadband services like At Home that offer
transmission speeds 20 to 100 times as fast as traditional modems.
That is fast enough to offer rich graphics, live video feeds and an
end to the finger-tapping waiting that most online users endure
today.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the most visible battles in the broadband world are
among various technology providers _ for example, between
cable-modem systems and a new standard of high-speed Internet
access over telephone wires called digital subscriber lines. And
the cable industry itself is divided: One group backs At Home, and
another supports Time Warner's cable-modem service, Road Runner.
</P>
<P>
   But a much more intense clash is brewing over whether access to
broadband lines will be open to America Online or any other online
service or will be closed to all content except that chosen by the
system operator, just as cable systems now choose which channels to
carry. Not surprisingly, both At Home and Road Runner want to use
their wires to promote their own online news, information and
entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? For the same reason that media giants like
the Walt Disney Co. and General Electric's NBC have been buying
Internet directory services: It is clear that whoever controls the
front door that people use to start their Internet surfing _ a
``portal'' in industry jargon _ will control the biggest share of
advertising and shopping revenues. And whoever sells the connection
to the Internet, as America Online and At Home both do, controls
the portal.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal was announced, America
Online's chairman, Steve Case, issued a statement challenging At
Home's exclusive deal to provide high-speed programming over TCI's
cables and challenging AT&AMP;T to let his service offer high-speed
cable-modem access under its own brand.
</P>
<P>
   This did not sit well with At Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought that AT&AMP;T or TCI will become a dumb pipe and turn
over the portal service to AOL is just ridiculous,'' Thomas
Jermoluk, At Home's chairman, said in an interview last week. ``AOL
is paranoid about keeping exclusive control of the portal. But in
the new broadband world, the facilities provider wants to
participate in the revenue stream when users see ads and buy
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are compounded for At Home, which has a minority of
its shares trading publicly. The company has shot up to a value of
$4.2 billion despite huge losses because of the perceived potential
of its exclusive contracts with TCI and other cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, even if At Home controls the first screen its users
see, any At Home user with only a modest technical ability could
use the cable modem to gain access to America Online or any other
Internet service at high speeds. That is no different than the
ability of a current America Online user to jump right to Yahoo or
any other Internet site. But experience shows that that most people
do not tinker with default settings; they use whatever pops up on
the first screen they see.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, however, does not want simply to depend on inertia. It
has been developing attractive content that takes advantage of its
service's speed. Its news and information screens, for example,
have much bigger, brighter color graphics than other Web-based
services. And it offers a wide range of short video clips from
sources like CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk says that one measure of the drawing power of these
flashy offerings is that half of At Home's first customers were
America Online members and that most of them dropped the online
service once they got used to the cable offering. His conclusion:
America Online will have to give up its dream of being the
exclusive portal in a broadband world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the access to the home,'' he said. ``If AOL wants to
get there with broadband, they will have to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pittman, America Online's president, insists that despite
the protests over the current cable lockout, he is not worried. To
start with, it is very early in the game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is just not ready for prime time,'' Pittman said. As
much as consumers may want faster access, broadband will not take
off, he said, until its price comes down from the current $40 a
month and customers can hook themselves up easily without
technicians visiting their homes, as the current technology
requires.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Pittman argues that for the foreseeable future,
the most likely prospect for broadband services is someone who is
already on line at slower speeds. Thus, America Online offers the
biggest pool of broadband prospects in the world. So the cable
companies and the phone companies will all eventually trip over
themselves to cut deals with the online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, economics always win,'' he said.
``Since we have so many subscribers, we have big buying power
already.'' Moreover, Pittman argues that AT&AMP;T's strategy of selling
telephone, cable and Internet services in one package will
ultimately prove ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about bundling, but what's missing is someone to
sell the bundle,'' he said. ``The only thing TCI can sell is cable
TV. AT&AMP;T has 80 million customers, but it was only able to get 1
million customers for Worldnet,'' the Internet service AT&AMP;T
introduced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interactive relationship with our consumers,'' he
added, ``so when we started offering long distance we converted 1
million lines in six months.''

CLINTON VISIT AND SPEECH DELIGHT WORSHIPERS AT A BEIJING CHURCH
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-LAMA, CHINA-HILLARY, CHINA-TAIWAN,
CHINA-U.S.) 
 (fb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton's visit and short speech to a
crowded Protestant church in Beijing on Sunday morning may not have
converted many Chinese across this nation of 1.2 billion _ his
attendance at the services was not even mentioned on the national
television news Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But it was certainly appreciated by more than 2,000 members of
the Chongwenmen Church, who lined up as early as 6 a.m. to get
seats for the 9:30 service. Many of them emerged from the ceremony
_ complete with Bible readings, hymns, a sermon by one of the
Chinese pastors on ``unity'' and, on Sunday, brief comments by a
visiting American president _ with the hope that Clinton's visit
would somehow advance the cause of Christianity in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coming here today is very encouraging to us,'' said Hu
Guorong, a 33-year-old businessman, who said he became a Christian
two years ago ``by the work of the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Wenxiang, a middle-aged man who has attended this church
for the last eight years, said: ``We expect that this visit will
help spread Christianity in China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and his wife are like brothers and sisters
to us,'' his wife added.
</P>
<P>
   Before they headed home through the narrow alleys surrounding
the steeple-less gray-brick church, a group of excited, curious
worshipers cornered an American reporter, ignoring the scores of
plainclothes policemen who milled, watching and listening, through
the departing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does President Clinton go to church every Sunday?'' they
wanted to know. ``Are all the members of his family Christians?''
``Is he a Baptist or a Methodist?''
</P>
<P>
   This church, like virtually all government-approved Protestant
churches, is nondenominational, part of a hybrid ``patriotic''
church founded after the Communists, who are officially atheist,
took control of China in 1949. Like the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, which does not recognize the leadership of the pope,
it is supposed to be independent of foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very moved by the fact that President Clinton is a
Christian,'' said Zhang Shuhuan, a middle-aged woman. ``As far as
we know, many heads of state are not Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   As the comments of many worshipers suggested, Christianity in
China today is at once thriving and constrained, and even many who
attend the approved churches may sometimes feel a bit beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   Since the extreme persecution of religion during the Cultural
Revolution of 1966 to 1976, the Communist government has permitted
the rapid growth of the official Protestant and Roman Catholic
churches. Under the rules, personal worship is free but public
evangelizing, outside church walls, is banned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, outside experts believe the number of Protestants in
China may now surpass 20 million and the number of Catholics total
10 million, including those in legal and illegal churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Chongwenmen Church in east-central Beijing is the largest of
eight officially sanctioned Protestant churches in Beijing, which
together serve tens of thousands of members.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also numerous small, illegal ``house churches'' in
this city, as around the country, where Christians who reject
government controls, often Evangelical Protestants, gather. These
groups, along with Catholics who insist that the pope is their
leader, often face police harassment, fines, or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is said to have pressed the case for more religious
freedom with President Jiang Zemin, but in his comments at the
church on Sunday he was circumspect. He expressed pleasure at the
reported growth in numbers of Christians here and said: ``I believe
our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world
of different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chongwenmen Church this Sunday, like every Sunday, only
800 people, fewer than half those attending, could sit in the main
hall. Hundreds crowded into a side chapel, and another thousand sat
in the basement, watching the services on closed-circuit
television.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of churches around the country is steadily
growing, it has not kept pace with the rise in believers, and
overcrowding is common. The government closely controls the
construction of new facilities, arguing that there are not enough
trained pastors to staff them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope President Clinton will urge our leaders to build more
Christian churches in Beijing,'' said He Jiazhen, a 70-year-old
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 70, about the same age as President Jiang Zemin,'' she
continued. ``I pray all the time, hoping that Jiang Zemin will be
converted,'' she said. ``If everyone in China were Christian, then
China would live in peace.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the winter, Wally Lamb typed the last period of
his aptly named manuscript, ``I Know This Much Is True.'' He
slumped to his knees, touched his forehead to the floor and, he
recalled, tearfully thanked ``whatever had allowed me to finish the
story without killing me first.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time his novel hit the nation's bookstores this month,
Lamb, a best-selling author, had recruited a freelance editor,
hired a personal copy editor and turned the work over to his editor
at a top publishing house who was so preoccupied with other sales
and marketing duties that she confessed she longed to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all become a big, fat, screaming, mean, vicious, greedy,
rude and crude fest,'' said Judith Regan, Lamb's editor and
publisher at Regan Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. ``So little
of your time is spent doing creative work that I'm seriously
considering leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, an editor's sharp pencil can be a luxury in the
consolidating industry of large trade publishing houses, which
through the 1990s have undergone a significant contraction in their
editing staffs. These are the editors who shape, tighten and polish
American literature and the copy editors who detect grammatical
gaffes and rescue writers from creative spelling.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, the work force of book publishing professionals
in New York, who are largely editors, has declined by 16 percent,
to 2,714 from 3,218, according to data from the federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the number of books published in the
United States has surged, and so have the complaints about the
quality of books carefully bound for posterity with dangling
modifiers, typographical errors and misspelled words.
</P>
<P>
   With publishing cycles compressed, leaving less time for
editing, and editors distracted by other corporate duties like
acquiring new titles, writers are increasingly recruiting hired
pens _ independent editors who sharpen text or copy editors who
correct grammar, inconsistencies and spelling errors for fees
ranging from $1,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see every level of error: typographical, syntactical,
factual and lack of internal consistency,'' said Elizabeth Sifton,
a veteran editor at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, who worries that
old-fashioned practitioners of the art of editing are coming to be
regarded as woolly mammoths.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of editing standards in American literature is an
enduring lament, one that tainted even Maxwell Perkins, the
celebrated editor of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In
1920, he published ``This Side of Paradise'' with so many errors
that a newspaper columnist made a parlor game of spotting mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   And some publishers speculate that today's complaints are simply
a subtext for deeper fears in an industry that has been roiled by
consolidations like the merger of Random House and Bantam Doubleday
Dell by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and the breakup
and sale of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education division to Pearson PLC of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rubin, the president and publisher of Doubleday, said
that some prominent authors resist editing, which affects the
quality of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that clearly we're in a period of momentous change on
various levels, and I think people are terrified of change,'' he
said. ``And when they start whining, they're throwing editing into
it. In some cases they're justified, and in some cases they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The staffing level of editors is not a topic that large
publishing houses dwell on, with few ever publicly revealing
cutbacks. For example, Bantam Doubleday Dell does not disclose
employment figures. Stuart Applebaum, a company spokesman, said he
could not recall a period of deep reductions among the industry's
ranks of editors and suggested that the editing staff might
actually have expanded at his company with the creation of a new
publishing imprint.
</P>
<P>
   That view, however, is not shared by many writers and agents.
Although complaints about editing may be as old as clay tablets,
there is a new edginess, which has inspired counterstrategies.
</P>
<P>
   Authors with a yearning for the romantic ideal of an editor as a
confessor and critic are recruiting informal editors to shape up
their manuscripts before submitting them to publishers _ a
defensive effort to prevent early rejection or late cancellation
for unsatisfactory work.
</P>
<P>
   Literary agents are also beginning to offer the services of
in-house editors or are urging clients to hire their own editors.
And the top publishing houses are continuing their practice of
contracting with independent editors when their employees are too
busy to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Speeded by computer technology, manuscripts that were more
leisurely published in a standard nine months after submission are
now edited, corrected and printed in as little as four to six
months. (Authors are encouraged to submit manuscripts on computer
floppy disks, which accelerates the process.) Editors are expected
not only to improve prose but also to acquire books and shepherd
titles through meetings on marketing, sales and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more pressure,'' said Peter Gethers, an editor at
Random House who just started the company's Library of Contemporary
Thought series of novella-length books. The window of opportunity
for editing has shortened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every publishing company is on a 3-, 6- or 12-month business
plan,'' he said. ``And so if you get a big book and it's not
perfect, you're being pressured from all sides. It's not that you
can't fix it, but there are others who want it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb, the author, hired a copy editor at the suggestion of his
literary agent, Linda Chester, who estimates that within the last
two years almost 60 percent of her clients have hired their own
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not 100 percent, I bring in an outside editor,'' Ms.
Chester said of the quality of manuscripts. ``Publishers should be
allowing clients to do the best possible work that they can so that
their books can be read for generations, but what's happening is
that publishers are concerned with getting the book out in the
right period to maximize sales.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Complaints about editing come from a range of writers _ from a
best-selling author who is reluctant to talk publicly about her
hired freelance copy editor to a first-time biographer like Bob
Thomas, who spotted 14 errors in the final production stage of his
manuscript, some of which made it into his book about golfer Ben
Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his book, ``Ben Hogan's `Secret': A Fictionalized
Biography,'' had been shifted among at least four editors at
Macmillan before its publication in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still left typos in there,'' he said. ``In the author's
note, there's a word called `skill,'' and it should have been
`shill.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Michael, a former executive editor at Macmillan, did some
of the editing and then departed to take a new post before the book
was published. He is frank with his authors about what they can
often expect in the current publishing climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell authors that there will always be 1 or 2 percent of
errors that get in,'' said Michael, who added that editing had
deteriorated over the years, but so gradually that ``it's like dirt
on your glasses: it starts out a little bit at a time and all of a
sudden you take them off and think, `How could I see?'''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are also taking note of sloppiness. A reviewer at Time
magazine, for instance, helpfully provided the page numbers for
errors in a May critique of ``The Unfinished Presidency,'' Douglas
Brinkley's biography of Jimmy Carter, published by Viking. For
example, the book refers to a Pakistani billionaire who suddenly
becomes a Palestinian billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books are not perfect; authors are not perfect; editors are
not perfect,'' said the editor of the biography, Wendy Wolf, who
added that as more books were published, more manuscripts were
submitted that were not in perfect shape. ``We have neither
infinite time nor infinite budgets, and everybody does their
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers are also weighing in with withering criticism of flaws
that could have been corrected with editing. Some posted reviews of
Toni Morrison's latest novel, ``Paradise,'' on the Amazon.com Web
site complaining about tangled plot lines, undeveloped characters
and confusing passages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morrison was unavailable for comment, her assistant said.
But in a January interview in U.S. News and World Report, she
responded to general criticism about ``Paradise'' by expressing the
desire for more time to ``step back'' during the period between
submitting the manuscript and final publication.
</P>
<P>
   Her publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, speeded up the publication of
``Paradise'' from the spring to last January to take advantage of
heavier holiday bookstore traffic. Her editor, Erroll McDonald,
said that Ms. Morrison's book was one of the special cases
involving speed, but that in his experience most titles were turned
around in the old standard of nine months. The author, McDonald
said, could have made the same comment about more time even ``if
she had nine more months.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents and writers say that editors in contemporary publishing
used to have more time to send detailed letters explaining how to
fix or improve a manuscript. But often they are now too preoccupied
to take this intermediate step, and decisions are simply made to
buy, reject or cancel a manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an author who's struggling with the writing, but the
editor would look at drafts and would provide comments that were
far too general,'' said a literary agent who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. Instead, he said, he ended up charging his author an
extra fee to help with reorganizing and rewriting.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Michael V. Carlisle left his job of 18 years at the
William Morris Agency to open a literary agency for authors. One
feature of his agency is a newly hired in-house editor, Neal
Bascomb, who will work closely with fiction writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiction manuscripts have to hit the target absolutely
squarely,'' Carlisle said. ``Editors are under such pressure. They
are looking to acquire books for a list, to make money, move
forward, to keep their jobs. But by and large, if consolidation
points to anything, it's not to old-fashioned red-pencil editing.
It's to economies of scale and efficiency of product.''
</P>
<P>
   With some authors pining for more intensive editing, several
loose groups of independent editors have formed in New York, and
consultants have also established bases far from the publishing hub
in places like Santa Fe, N.M., and the Berkshires of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Werth, a nonfiction writer, hired a personal editor to
work on his latest book about a medical malpractice case,
``Damages,'' after receiving what he characterized as minimal
editing on his first book, ``The Billion-Dollar Molecule.''
</P>
<P>
   He recruited Chris Jerome, a former magazine editor who runs a
freelance editing service from her home in Ashfield, Mass., and
frequently proofreads manuscripts for Knopf authors like Ms.
Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent the manuscript, and she sent it back with detailed
notes in a 10-page memo,'' Werth said. ``What my New York editors
do is buy books and move them through the process.'' &QL;

NEWSPAPERS ENERGIZED BY STEADY REVENUE GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newspaper industry, the hypochondriac of the information
age, is as healthy as it has been in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The migraine headaches brought on in the mid-1990s when the
price of the industry's basic raw material, paper, jumped by 30
percent for two consecutive years, are but a memory. High-margin
classified advertising is surging, bringing with it a revenue rush
that is energizing the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the early returns indicate that 1998
will be the first year since 1986 that the industry's
ever-more-anemic circulation figures will go up, not down.
</P>
<P>
   And though readers have declining trust in the accuracy of
newspaper articles, investors for most of the last 18 months have
shown increasing faith in newspaper company stocks _ at least until
mid-April, when steady but unremarkable earnings growth made some
analysts nervous about the sustainability of industry profits.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the publishers come to Wall Street this week to present
analysts with their strategies for continuing growth at the annual
Mid-Year Media Review, with the Gannett Co. as host, they might be
pardoned for the pleasure they take in the process. ``Newspapers
always come back,'' said John Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore
Sun, which is owned by Times Mirror. ``And newspapers do make a lot
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   And though it is hard to find a happy hypochondriac, the old
nervousness is being replaced in city after city with a certain
cockiness. Some newspaper partisans, long bruised, now think they
can give as good as they get.
</P>
<P>
   Do William Gates and Microsoft want to devour the classified
advertising business, luring automobile ads into their online
Carpoint service? Let them try. Last year, newspaper companies
including Knight Ridder, Times Mirror, the Tribune Co. and the
Washington Post Co. pooled their resources to back the
Chicago-based Web enterprise Classified Ventures L.L.C.
</P>
<P>
   Do direct mailers want to pull more supermarkets and drugstores
into their orbit? Maybe newspapers, including The Arizona Republic,
seek to go direct mail one better. The Republic, owned by Central
Newspapers Inc., is preparing a series of experiments in delivering
advertisements to subscribers' doorsteps just as direct mailers do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the brave talk, the news industry cannot avoid
the sobering reminders of where it stands among news consumers.
About 80 percent of those surveyed in April by the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press, the Washington-based research
organization, said they regularly watched television news, down
from 81 percent in 1996. How many read newspapers? About 68
percent, down from 71 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When newspaper readers were taken alone, there was a more
telling gap. Younger readers in this generation have much less
interest in newspapers than their counterparts in the 1960s. In
1965, a Gallup poll indicated that, in the 21 to 35 age group, 67
percent of those surveyed had read a daily newspaper the day
before. In 1990, a similar survey by Pew showed that number had
dwindled to 39 percent. This spring, it was 31 percent. Even in the
over-50 group, readership figures are down to 63 percent, from
about 74 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   And some large advertising agencies still find that, for
national ads, newspapers are a cumbersome and expensive vehicle.
Although newspaper revenues from national advertisers like airlines
and Hollywood studios are up over the decade, ``for most national
advertisers, their first choice is television _ and that's getting
more so,'' said Stacey Lippman, the media director at the New
York-based advertising agency TBWA Chiat/Day, which is owned by the
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper industry's standard response is that its readers
are a relatively upscale demographic group compared with radio or
television audiences. The Pew survey bears this out: 60 percent of
those surveyed with family incomes of $75,000 annually read
newspapers; 58 percent watched television news. College graduates
were also slightly more likely to get their news from newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while those demographics are likely to whet advertisers'
appetites, editors like Gregory Favre of The Sacramento Bee, one of
the original papers owned by the growing McClatchy Newspapers Inc.,
are nervous about making too many journalistic decisions based on
such data.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn of the early 1990s coincided with buyouts
among retailers _ which then had no excess cash for advertising _
and competition from companies selling newspaper inserts to
supermarkets and other local advertisers. The bottom line: at least
10 percent of display advertising revenues were lost; they have not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just when things might have started to move back up, newsprint
prices rose by almost 70 percent, peaking in 1995 and 1996, and
forcing another round of belt-tightening and price increases at
newspapers. And since 1995, the various viruses that have killed
dozens of evening papers picked off The Baltimore Evening Sun, The
Norfolk Ledger-Star, The Rochester Times-Union and The Phoenix
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   But if 1987 and 1988 were the golden years for the industry,
1997 was at least gold-plated. Total revenues, according to the
figures compiled by the Newspaper Association of America, were
$51.4 billion _ $41.3 billion (up 11.3 percent over 1996) from
advertising, and $10.1 billion (up about 1 percent) from
circulation. The overall revenue improvement is less dramatic when
inflation is taken into account. In real dollars, 1997 circulation
revenues lagged more than 15 percent behind their 1987 high. Last
year advertising revenues, led by retail display advertising and
classifieds, inched back near 1987 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, psychologically: readers have stopped
deserting. The March report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations
showed widespread, though marginal, gains. The Atlanta
Constitution, owned by Cox Newspapers, and the Minneapolis Star &AMP;
Tribune, recently bought by McClatchy Newspapers, each picked up
more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just three of the the top 25 circulation leaders showed declines
of more than 1 percent: The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune
and The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, in the years from 1994 through 1996, when there
were widespread price increases, overall newspaper circulation
declined at an annual rate of 2 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promotional spending is back,'' said John Murray, the
newspaper association's vice president for circulation and
marketing. ``Your pricing is slowed so you don't have the immediate
losses you'd get with a price increase. Equally important,
newspapers have put much more of a focus on zoning for local news
and on niche coverage _ sections on health or personal finance.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly in cities like Sacramento and Phoenix, where newsrooms
have been downsized over the decade, the focus is local. ``I
believe our major franchise is local news,'' said Favre, the editor
of The Sacramento Bee. ``We spend more of our resources on that
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the industry's generally good news, a paramount concern
is classified advertising. ``Classifieds definitely are driving the
revenue increases that we're seeing,'' said David Alley, The
Republic's advertising director. And what is driving classified
advertising, he said, is the tight job recruitment market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet classifieds are peculiarly vulnerable to the Internet's
capacity to permit one-to-one communications across great
distances.
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors have joined forces with newspapers. The
National Associations of Realtors created realtor.com, a Web site
to hawk its own wares in 1996; now The San Diego Union-Tribune and
USA Today, as well as NBC and America Online are its partners.
Classified Ventures runs the sites apartments.com and cars.com,
which feature ads from 135 daily newspapers. Realfind.com, run by
the newspaper association, has links to more than 300 newspaper
real-estate sections.
</P>
<P>
   But executives like Angus Twombly, the vice president for
marketing and strategic planning at The Portland Press-Herald in
Portland, Me., remain cautious. ``I don't think it's time to be
cocky,'' Twombly said. ``We are having to adapt more in this decade
than in either of the two decades before. Having this flood of
classified advertising is giving us a little flexibility and a
little time, but isn't buying us peace of mind.''

   CHINA-CLINTON-O629 _ BEIJING _ As President Bill Clinton was
trodding the Great Wall Sunday, neighboring India slammed his
attempt to use his weekend summit talks with China to cool off the
Pakistan-India nuclear testing crisis. ``India categorically
rejects the notion of these two countries abrogating to themselves
joint or individual responsibility for the maintanance of peace,
stability and security in the region,'' said an Indian Foreign
Ministry statement. It was issued first in New Delhi late Saturday
and then echoed Sunday in a second statement by the Indian embassy
in Beijing. India, which exploded five underground nuclear test
devices in early May, vented its anger at a ``presidential joint
statement on South Asia'' issued Saturday by Clinton and Chinese
president Jiang Zemin. (Albright/Kunstel , Cox News Service).

   With CHINA-YOUTH-$ADV29 _ BEIJING _ China's new graduates are a

job-pressured than any generation since the 1949 communist
revolution. They herald a new round of university students unbowed
by the burden of their country's tumultuous recent past, as they
take their turn at molding its future. (Albright, Cox News
Service).

10 p.m. EDT, but there is some prospect of getting an advance text
at 8 p.m. EDT. Clinton's speech will be followed by a Q&AMP;A with
Beijing University students, probably about 11 p.m EDT. The Beijing
University speech may or may not be televised in China, we still
don't know.)

   SIERRACLUB _ The Sierra Club, one of the nation's leading

hearts of many incumbents around the country as one of the most

AMONG TASTE-TESTERS, HE'S THE (ICE) CREAM OF THE CROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Harrison gets paid for eating ice cream _ a sweet
occupation he pays for with chubby cheeks and taste buds that need
constant pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, official taster for Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, avoids
coffee, onions, garlic or other strong flavors that might dirty his
palate. He doesn't smoke or drink. A pepperoni pizza on Friday
night is a big deal for this guy.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, however, he's back on the bland wagon, especially if
he's tasting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's family has been in the ice cream business for four
generations. Seventeen years ago, Dreyer's, based in Oakland,
Calif., lured him away from his father's flavoring company to
become their ``flavorologist.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company's official taster, he tests samples at three
different stages of a production run, 60 ice creams per tasting. He
also trains other tasters and sales people and travels the country
educating people about ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   It's a subject he knows well. His great grandfather had ice
cream stores in New York City. His grandfather had a dairy co-op in
Tennessee and his dad owned Dari-Tech, a Georgia company that made
ice cream flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream was always the topic of family conversations. And it's
almost always on the tip of his tongue, from tasting all the way to
national production problems. Yesterday's report that ice cream
prices were rising because of an increase in the price of milk fat
wasn't news to him.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison grew up in Memphis, Tenn., working in his uncle's ice
cream factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned all the nuances at an early age _ what fresh cream
really tastes like and what yeast and mold do to the flavor of ripe
strawberries,'' he says. ``I don't have blood in my veins, I have
40 percent heavy whipping cream.''
</P>
<P>
   A degree in chemistry and a stint with Borden honed his skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to work for your family right away. You want
them to invite you,'' he says of his time at Borden. Eventually he
did go to work for his dad, selling to ice cream makers throughout
the West. Dreyer's was a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got to know me and hired me a couple of years later,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The job isn't all Cookies 'n Cream (a flavor he says he
invented). Harrison keeps a 55-gallon trash barrel at his side when
he tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to swallow to taste,'' he explains delicately.
</P>
<P>
   He first checks the ice cream for eye appeal _ ``it has to look
inviting.'' Then he dips in with his official gold tasting spoon.
Plastic or wood would affect the taste, and silver tarnishes, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He goes into what he calls his ``swirl, smack and spit'' routine
_ swirling the sample around his mouth, smacking his lips rapidly
to warm it up, then spitting it into the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   He says he treats ice cream tasting like wine tasting _ starting
with the vanillas or whites and working his way up through the
``Bordeaux'' of ice creams (mint chocolate chip, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he cleanses his taste buds with warm water. If
that doesn't work, he goes to a salt-free soda cracker. If someone
walks into the tasting room with noticeable perfume or after shave,
Harrison is done for a while.
</P>
<P>
   If a sample doesn't look good, isn't taste balanced (the right
blend of cream, sugar and flavoring), or the texture isn't smooth
and creamy, it is donated to an area food bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all our eggs in one basket,'' Harrison explains. A
snafu could lead to a national recall. That's why he has a back-up
taster in case he has a cold or other illness.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been any national recalls under his palate, but
Bay area food banks did get 500,000 gallons of Dreyer's Grand last
year _ ice cream that was very edible, but not quite up to the
Harrison/Dreyer's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison doesn't just educate people about the product. He also
has a few parlor tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's recently commissioned a study to determine what flavor
preferences divulge about one's personality. Tell Harrison your
favorite flavor, and he'll define you. Like coffee ice cream?
Harrison says you're colorful, a risk taker, an impulsive type.
Prefer Macadamia Nut Brickle? You're conservative, a perfectionist,
a take-charge kind of person who is detail-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   To keep ice cream flavors at their peak, he suggests:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consume ice cream within three days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store away from the refrigerator/freezer door and away from
the ice maker.
</P>
<P>
   _ After dipping, pat plastic wrap over the top of the remaining
ice cream. It helps maintain quality and prevents ice crystals from
forming.
</P>
<P>
   _ For long-term storage (2-3 months maximum), use a deep freeze.

SMOKED SALMON PENNE FOR A TASTE OF ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cast of characters would have been appropriate for a mystery
novel by Agatha Christie or P.D. James.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Anglican vicar and his quiet wife. His animated
conversation usually ended with an explosive giggle, but a stranger
sensed some inner pain.
</P>
<P>
   There was tall, stately Harry the Purser, who had spent a career
handling the finances _ and the first-class passengers _ aboard
ships in the Cunard fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the figure who became known as The Weasel. He was
a little man with a broad, East End London accent. Englishmen of
his age have spent a lifetime standing in queues. Not this man. No
matter where or how he arrived at a buffet line or at a crowded
coffee bar, he quickly and mysteriously insinuated himself to the
front of the crowd and pulled his frowning wife along with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think I didn't notice you weaseling your way into the
queue, you terrible little man!'' The Chief Inspector's voice
occasionally boomed out.
</P>
<P>
   The Weasel would flash a sly smile and say something cryptic
like, ``Ah, now, don't say anything bad on your birthday or you'll
be bad all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the cast had not been assembled on the Orient Express or the
Q.E. II. And no crime had been detected, except for the failure of
Italian waiters to deliver, ``a nice cup of tea'' as quickly as it
was desired. The Brits were touring Umbria, Tuscany and the
Dolomites along with a few Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The vicar did, it turns out, harbor a deep hurt. One of his most
vivid and enjoyable memories concerned a backpacking trip he had
taken on the Olympic Peninsula just after divinity school. But his
hiking days now seemed to be behind him. He was cursed with the
gout and he decried the English stereotype that suggests it
afflicts only those who overindulge in 40-year-old port and
expensive cigars.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting facts we learned was the existence of a
holy relic in a church we visited in Mantua. It was the result of
some skepticism until Pope Pius II visited in the 15th century. The
pope declared the relic genuine because it miraculously cured him
of gout, which is more than it did for the Anglican vicar in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Chief Inspector (actually the retired police chief of
Newcastle) admitted that he watches TV mysteries involving
Inspector Morse and Scotland Yard Cmdr. Adam Dalgliesh. But he said
he really preferred the old ``Hill Street Blues'' even over the
newer American series ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   As for crimes in the Yorkshires, he recounted how amateur
gardeners in his area slept near their gooseberry bushes and leek
beds on nights before judging was conducted at the local fairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes an intruder will sneak up in the night to slash a
rival's prize leek,'' he informed us in a tone that might have been
describing a serial murder.
</P>
<P>
   No gooseberries and few leeks were served to us in Italy. But
dishes like these forgave all crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon Penne
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces smoked salmon
</P>
<P>
   8 thin spears asparagus
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups cream or low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 pound (or 4 cups) small penne pasta tubes
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large skillet with just enough water to cover the
asparagus. Add one-half teaspoon salt and one-half teaspoon sugar.
Bring to a boil, cook 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Let the
asparagus sit in the hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until done to the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   While this is happening, remove the asparagus from the water and
cut into 2-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the water out of the skillet, put the pan on the heat and
add the oil and garlic. Pour in the cream, reduce slightly, then
add the salmon and asparagus. Simmer for 2 minutes, then add
drained pasta to the skillet and moosh everything around. Sprinkle
with cheese plus salt and pepper to taste and this should serve
four.
</P>
<P>
   Liver Venetian
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters pound calves liver, sliced
</P>
<P>
   Flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup cream or evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Season some flour with salt and pepper. Dredge the liver slices
in this mess, then saute in heated olive oil 2 minutes on each
side. Remove to a dish in a 200-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
   Add the butter to the same pan. Then saute the onions until
soft. While this is happening, combine the cream or milk, the
mustard, parsley and lemon juice. Stir this muck in with the onion
and cook another minute.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the sauce over the liver and this should serve two.

INTERNET CITIZENS DEBATE HOW TO FORM ONLINE UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Va.) (ja) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the times that try a cyberpatriot's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jon Postel, who has served as the unflaggingly serene
citizen-sentry of the Internet's address system since he began
keeping track of it on a piece of notebook paper in 1969. But
Postel is weary these days, and a little bit grumpy _ and not
because the Internet has doubled in size yet again in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Postel, a University of Southern California
researcher, has recently been anointed a founding father of the
network's nascent political structure _ a move toward Internet
``self-governance'' that is being propelled by various
governmental, commercial and social forces.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, Postel's work has been supported by a
combination of contracts from the federal government and consensus
by the Internet's ad hoc technical community. But now, as a de
facto delegate to what is shaping up as a constitutional convention
in cyberspace, Postel suddenly finds himself being accused of
seizing illegitimate power, threatened with lawsuits and bombarded
in e-mail wars.
</P>
<P>
   His critics include Jim Dixon, president of Euro Internet
Service Providers Association, a trade group of 600 Internet
companies in Europe. ``You have a small group of people asking that
they be given a large amount of power simply because they've been
there for a long time,'' complains Dixon, noting that Europe wants
more say in how the Internet will be run.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns are shared by many Internet industry leaders
outside the United States, who have made their feelings known to
Postel and the U.S. government via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Postel cannot help but feel besieged. ``I'd rather be doing the
technical stuff,'' he said recently with a sigh. ``But there are so
many questions that need to get answered. How do we form a
representative board? How do we make it international? How do we
find enough agreement to move forward?''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being Postel's private agony, these are among the
questions that are bound to be debated at a meeting near Washington
this week, at another in Geneva later in July and at various other
caucuses, conferences and online sessions this summer. The
partisans of the Net are working toward a Sept. 30 deadline for the
U.S. government to hand over control of a key portion of the
Internet to an as-yet-unformed nonprofit international group.
</P>
<P>
   Even for many Internet users who do not care much about the
specific job at hand _ determining who gets to register whom for
which types of Internet addresses _ the need to create a governing
system for that task has given a sense of urgency and common cause
to representatives from the government and industry, as well as the
libertarian technologists who have historically supervised the
Internet. Though they may have competing goals, all share a belief
in free-flowing communication and in the value of electronic
commerce, which the Department of Commerce recently reported was
growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is sure how it should work, the idea is that a
uniquely participatory medium like the Internet _ one that
transcends national borders and whose fast-evolving technology can
be shaped to fit social policy _ ought to be able to come up with
its own semiofficial political structure. Regulation by more
traditional means, the thinking goes, would stifle electronic
commerce and the free flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are sufficiently high to elicit a recent emotional
appeal from David Farber, a professor of computer science at the
University of Pennsylvania, who is a widely respected e-mail
pamphleteer with nearly 25,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow it, the result will be governance by governments
with all the negatives that holds for the future evolution of the
net,'' Farber recently wrote to his e-mail constituents. ``What do
we do. We could act grown up!! We could coordinate the meetings and
make it appear like we are organized. I wonder if the net
establishment is indeed willing to be grown up, or will they fight
till there is nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   His recent missive was a cry from the heart. ``This is a
defining moment,'' Farber said in an interview. ``If we can't pull
it together on something like this, governments are going to get
together and decide this is too important to their economic health
to leave in the hands of chaos. They'll start writing treaties, and
we'll end up with a very slow mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber is himself an Internet founding father. He was Postel's
thesis adviser in 1969 and assigned his student the task of
cataloguing Internet addresses. That academic exercise eventually
became a full-time job as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,
financed by the Department of Defense. While Network Solutions
Inc., a Reston, Va., company, has had an exclusive government
contract to register addresses under the most popular domains _
``.com,'' ``.net'' and ``.org,'' _ Postel has been responsible for
ensuring that each address corresponds to a unique string of digits
that all of the Internet's computers can recognize.
</P>
<P>
   And now Postel finds himself being swept toward that Sept. 30
deadline _ the date the Clinton administration recently set for
handing over control of the distribution of Internet addresses to
whatever international nonprofit group has formed by then. The
administration's report on the matter earlier this month prompted
the announcement of at least two meetings by competing factions,
with others rumored to be in the works. One, to take place in
Reston, Va., begins on Wednesday. The other, in Geneva, will start
July 21.
</P>
<P>
   With the administration and industry seeming to have more faith
in technology and market forces to regulate cyberspace than
legislation, the effort to supervise Internet addresses has become
the first test of the self-governance movement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The parties with cross-cutting interests include large trademark
holders, who want to limit the number of so-called domains _ the
suffixes on Internet addresses, like ``.com,'' ``.net'' and
``.org'' _ to reduce the opportunities for others to co-opt their
brand names. It is one thing for Coca-Cola (www.coke.com) to make
sure no one is trying to do business as www.coke.org. It might be
far harder to police dozens of domains, to ferret out coke.web or
coke.store, for example. But small businesses and individuals would
like to see more domains created to increase the odds of obtaining
their own preferred addresses. Meanwhile, there are many
entrepreneurs intent on making a profit out of registering domain
names _ and perhaps just as many domain democrats who would rather
see registration be a strictly nonprofit enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the struggle is also between the old-guard
technical wizards like Postel and the new commercial interests that
have begun to assert themselves as the Internet expands. Tamar
Frankel, a law professor at Boston University who has taken a
leading role in organizing this week's conference in Reston, has
been accused by some Internet traditionalists of being an
interloper with no credentials _ or worse, a promoter for Network
Solutions Inc., a unit of Science Applications International Corp.,
which assigns the domain names that Postel helps catalog.
</P>
<P>
   To such criticism, Ms. Frankel replies: ``The issues now before
the Internet are not technical. They are political, they are
structural, they are organizational. What I find is that people who
are tremendously sophisticated in the technical workings of the
Internet are not necessarily knowledgeable in how to create an
organization _ especially one that has no clear model.''
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of academics, industry and government
officials and so-called netizens who are not entirely convinced
that a new electronic order will emerge on its own have begun to
seek a clear structure for the process. On Monday, for example,
Martin Bangemann, the European Union commissioner for industry, is
convening a conference in Brussels for industry representatives to
discuss his proposal for an international charter to coordinate
Internet regulation of electronic commerce. Next month, the faculty
of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of government will discuss the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet overlaps with geographical governments, but it
also floats above them,'' Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School,
said. ``So trying to work out governance is quite difficult, and no
analogy quite fits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Magaziner, a senior White House policy adviser, was the
chief architect of the recently issued hands-off policy on domain
names. ``What we believe is the ideal kind of coordinating
structure of the Internet is not to have an intergovernmental
organization, but to have a number of private nonprofit
international groups that have specific charters,'' Magaziner said.
</P>
<P>
   But so far private industry has made little progress in
self-regulation. Some critics say that even an effective industry
effort would not necessarily safeguard the principles of democracy.
``My fear is that there won't be any accountability,'' said Andrew
Shapiro, a fellow at Harvard University's Center for Internet and
Society. ``Your common Internet user doesn't know diddly about
Internet domain name registration, and those people need to be
represented. It runs the risk of being intensely skewed toward
private, for-profit interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But some proponents of self-governance argue that the
participatory nature of the Internet will allow a bottom-up
approach to decision-making that has little precedent in the world
of parliaments and industrialists. David Johnson, director of the
Internet policy group at the Aspen Institute in Washington, points
to Farber's call for peace as an example of what he calls the
Internet's tendency toward natural ``self-ordering.'' After Farber
sent out his appeal he received vows of cooperation from many
sides. There is talk of a series of meetings around the world, to
which various factions would send delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, one of our senior moral leaders calls on the Net to grow
up and there's already progress in that direction,'' said Johnson,
a lawyer who was influential in drafting the government's
domain-name policy.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on recent research at the Santa Fe Institute and
elsewhere that holds that any complex system, whether technological
or biological, will spontaneously order itself, Johnson predicts
that the Internet will produce its own social order _ one that,
because it arises from the network itself, will have its own
legitimacy. Such an order would not rely on the delegation of state
power to representatives, but rather on contractual agreements
between Internet users who would then be responsible for their own
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people mean by self-regulation a small number of industry
players adopting voluntarily or even under duress some codes that
match what the government could legislate,'' Johnson said. ``What I
think the Net holds out as a possibility is a very different
mechanism.'' &QL;

REBEL COMMANDER SAYS AIM IS TO UNIFY ALBANIANS IN ONE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOGOVAC, Yugoslavia _ A Volkswagen Golf bearing a yellow
license plate issued by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army sped along
the dirt road near this town in the Drenica Hills, snaking back and
forth to avoid Serbian snipers.
</P>
<P>
   The car spun screeching into a small farm village and turned
down a narrow road between whitewashed mud-and-wattle houses. The
rebel officer inside wearing an American army uniform had an AK-47
assault rifle next to him and a Russian sniper rifle across the
back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The car bounced past fields where farmers were stacking their
hay. At a rebel checkpoint, two teen-age girls wearing the black
uniforms and berets of the rebel police and armed with assault
rifles, sat on a bench in the shade of a black locust tree. They
diligently wrote down the make and registration number of each car,
truck and tractor that went by.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was waved forward by young men wearing red arm
bands, and he drove past village children who clutched homemade
wooden weapons and who raised clenched right fists to their
forehead in the rebel salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are changing the salute,'' said the officer, as his car
jostled down the rutted track. ``We want our troops to use the
traditional salute of Western armies.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel army in the Serbian province of Kosovo, which has a
population that is 90 percent ethnic Albania, was dismissed in
January by the American envoy to the region, Robert Gelbard, as a
``terrorist organization.'' The rebel group was described as
recently as a month ago by the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova as ``a creation of the Serb security forces.'' But it has
emerged as the most powerful ethnic Albanian movement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbard's decision to meet rebel representatives in Switzerland
this week implicitly recognizes the force as the province's new
power brokers and signals the waning influence of Rugova, a
committed pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rebels consolidate their hold on about 40 percent of
Kosovo and struggle to unify their command in the ``liberated
zones,'' the outside world is scrambling to discover who leads the
movement, who speaks for it and what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always clear that the rebels themselves know the
answers to these questions. But days of criss-crossing the villages
and back roads under the control of the fighters give the
impression that the Serb nationalist movement that brought Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to power in Serbia a decade ago, and
triggered the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, has found its corollary
in the ethnic Albanian insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels vow to fight until the Serbian authorities, and
implicitly the Serb minority of 150,000 people in Kosovo, are
driven out of the province. They call not only for an independent
Kosovo, but for a greater Albania that stretches into Macedonia and
Montenegro to embrace the ethnic Albanian minorities in neighboring
states. Serbia and Montenegro are the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia. Macedonia is now an independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominously, the rebels say that the time for dialogue with
the Serbs has ended and that they will achieve their aims with
violence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of about five regional command headquarters, based in a
captured police station, is on a remote hilltop in central Kosovo.
On a recent day, a red Albanian flag with its black double-headed
eagle flapped in the breeze on a white metal flagpole. A satellite
dish was positioned on the roof of the red brick single story
building. Rebel soldiers dressed in German army fatigues and
carrying assault rifles guarded the gate and iron fence that ringed
the building.
</P>
<P>
   In the front room, a group of about a half dozen fighters sat
idly surrounded by machine guns, cartridge belts and ammunition
boxes. Rows of assault rifles lay neatly lined up in wooden racks
once used by the Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Drenica region, who would give only his nom
de guerre, Salim Suleman, and who said that he is 28, was dressed
in a short-sleeve, Swiss Army camouflage uniform. He said that he
had worked for several years with Adem Jashari, one of the founders
and leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who was killed in March
when Serb forces attacked the village of Prekaz, an assault that
left more than 80 dead and triggered the current rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Suleman and about four other leaders appear to make up the
command structure of the guerrilla force. No leader appears
predominant. Regional and often local commanders are able to carry
out the war in their zones with a great deal of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say they are organizing local volunteers, as well as
fighters and weapons smuggled over the border from Albania, to
build a force that will drive the Serbs out of the province. They
say that they have no interest in establishing a cease-fire and
that they are unwilling to remove their barricades on main roads to
give American mediation efforts with Serbia a chance, arguing that
they no longer trust the Serbs or the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned from the wars in Croatia and Bosnia that the
outside world cannot solve our problems for us, that we must fight
for our own freedom,'' Suleman said. ``There is a de facto Albanian
nation. The tragedy is that the European powers after World War I
decided to divide that nation between several Balkan states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now fighting to unify the nation, to liberate all
Albanians, including those in Macedonia, Montenegro and other parts
of Serbia. We are not just a liberation army for Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting that has claimed several hundred lives since March
threatens to escalate as the 50,000 Serbian special policemen and
troops deployed in Kosovo position themselves around rebel
enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   An attack on rebel enclaves, which this commander predicted was
``imminent,'' could cause the fighting to spread to other parts of
the province and into the provincial capital, Pristina. Suleman
said that guerrilla units were being moved into ``new areas'' in
anticipation of a Serbian assault.
</P>
<P>
   The commander said that Serbs who wanted to live in ``the
republic of Kosovo'' would be welcome, but only those who respected
``the culture and heritage of the Albanian people.'' He conceded
that Serbian villages, where he said there were armed groups, were
being attacked by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs who have blood on their hands will have to leave
Kosovo,'' he said, ``but the others can stay if they are willing to
be loyal citizens of the state. The Serbian churches and
monasteries will always be respected. Our forces surround a
monastery not far from here and it has not been harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke a woman in a black uniform entered the room and
placed orders for the commander to sign on the table. He picked up
a pen and scribbled his name at the bottom of the sheets. A heavy
gold ring flashed in the sunlight that streamed in through the
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for America and Europe to forget this plan to give
Kosovo some kind of autonomy and help us in our struggle for
liberation,'' he said. ``If the Americans and the Europeans do not
help us we will find others who will. We will never betray our
people.'' &QL;

SUNNY ADE: DANCE MUSIC, EVEN FOR DANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER WATROUS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two hours into King Sunny Ade's show at Tramps on
Wednesday night, Ade and his 17-piece band had played about all
that modern orchestral dance music can do.
</P>
<P>
   There were riffs, by talking drums, or guitars, or pedal steel
guitar, or by the band's chorus. There were stop-time breaks. Ade
layered three or four different types of drums to create waves of
sound. There were solos; Ade sang to the audience, and the people
who had space to dance, danced.
</P>
<P>
   Ade, from Nigeria, doesn't play New York very often, and his
shows are events. At every one, people who went to his first
concert in New York, sometime in the mists of the early 1980s, muse
about the power the music held.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived then, playing an extraordinary and revelatory
show, the cultural makeup of music in New York changed. Suddenly
world music existed; Ade and the effort that Island Records took in
trying to make him the next Bob Marley have plenty to do with the
current local interest in pop music from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Ade has one of the great orchestras working, equal
to the best bands in the Caribbean. On Wednesday night, it chugged
along like an unstoppable and intelligent machine.
</P>
<P>
   The three guitars spewed clanging, metallic riffs that
interlocked with the various drums. The chorus chanted bits and
pieces, or sang long, gently waving lines. Two talking drums,
taking the lead instrument role, plowed up the music. And on tune
after tune, the band members, along with Ade's two female dancers,
shaped their bodies to the rhythms, giving a tactile response to
music.
</P>
<P>
   Ade was in New York to celebrate the release of a new album,
``Odu'' (Atlantic), playing tunes from it and older pieces. He sets
his material up as suites, and each piece had movement, with drum
parts giving way to guitar figures, which gave way to choral
sections.
</P>
<P>
   Tempos changed and new rhythms flashed abruptly across the
music's screen. And during transition sections, new sounds drifted
through the music, like fog through reeds. &QL;

 &HT;    Ex-Marlins swap demolition derby for show biz
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They only thought they were escaping the madness.
</P>
<P>
   And, really, how could they have known they weren't? How could
Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson and Jim Eisenreich
possibly have known that by leaving the Florida Marlins to hook up
with the Los Angeles Dodgers they were going from one strange purge
to another?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers? Purged?
</P>
<P>
   The blue-capped, blueblooded, blue-heaven-on-earth Chavez
Ravine, Dodgertown Dodgers of O'Malley famed family ownership?
</P>
<P>
   The same. And not the same at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because now, for all practical purposes, they're the Los Angeles
Foxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, Bonilla, Johnson and Eisenreich were shipped to the
West Coast just more than a month ago as the Marlins, deep into
destroying their own World Series championship team of 1997, took
sledgehammer to the demolition process.
</P>
<P>
   But two months before that trade, the Dodgers had been sold to
Australian bajillionaire Rupert Murdoch and his conglomerate. And
ever since the Fox Group invaded the Dodgers' henhouse, feathers
have been flying.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting here that the O'Malley family, which
purchased the Dodgers in 1950, had held the longest ownership of a
major league baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   So, even when the O'Malleys announced in January 1997 that the
team was for sale, well, the assumption was any transfer would be
rooted in some kind of stability. Six months later, though, the
Dodgers received permission from the Major League Baseball
Ownership Committee to continue discussions with Fox, and
subsequently reached agreement on a sale on Sept. 4 of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Foxes pulled off the huge swap with the Marlins
featuring, on the L.A. side, slugging coverboy catcher Mike Piazza
and third baseman Todd Zeile coming to Florida. Piazza, of course,
has since left to become a New York Met where one of the new
pitchers happens to be ex-Dodger headliner Hideo Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Bill Russell was fired as manager of the Dodgers
and Fred Claire was bounced as the team's general manager. Both
were 30-year men within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   That's entertainment, folks, and that's Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Claire had much say in things recently, anyway (see:
Piazza trade). Swept into the manager's position was Glenn Hoffman,
accompanied by ex-Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda in Claire's vacated
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who has felt discombobulated on the Dodger fringe since
his own retirement/ouster as field boss in favor of Russell a
couple of years back, found a way back into a position of
influence. Lasorda fits the Fox television profile. He's noisy.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he was willing to do the dirty work when three
coaches were booted Wednesday night. Lasorda's explanation was that
the coaches were offered other positions, which in Fox
corporatespeak translates to a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
</P>
<P>
   It has reached the point,Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros has
been quoted as saying, ``You just go to the park and hope you still
have a uniform to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   About those duds, Eric.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers aren't wearing their white shirts for home games
these days. They're wearing their blue batting-practice jerseys.
The plan is to autograph them and auction them off.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Melrose Place inning-card girls?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Gary and Bobby and Charles and Jim, don't laugh.

 &HT;    Attempt to rehabilitate pedophile priests mostly fails,
sometimes tragically

<P>
   JEMEZ SPRINGS, N.M. _ Highway 4 bends with the river through the
canyon between red-rock mesas with ponderosa pines.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty miles northwest of Albuquerque, the two-lane road finds
this village of 413, a remote enclave of eclectic spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Here, lumbermen and aging hippies have no choice but to share
barstools at Los Ojos, the town's saloon and social wellspring. A
sign above the kitchen reads: ``Save a logger. Eat an owl.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversations are heard in Spanish and the Native American
dialects of Towa and Keresan. The Bodhi Mandala Zen Buddhist camp
is across the road from the tavern.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour away at Los Alamos, scientists in great secrecy
created the atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In Jemez Springs, the Catholic church conducted clandestine
research of its own. For four decades, the church brought some of
its worst pedophile priests here to be treated in the monastery by
the river.
</P>
<P>
   They were given drugs to suppress their sex drives. They were
told to act out their deepest fears in theatrical therapy sessions.
They were counseled. And they prayed.
</P>
<P>
   The church believed it could rehabilitate then reassign its sex
offenders. But much of the work here failed, and with catastrophic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico became ground zero for an explosion of sexual abuse
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the state's children, many of them in the small
parishes of the rural villages and pueblos, were molested by
priests who had been treated at the monastery then released. As
victim after victim came forward in the 1990s, the Diocese of Santa
Fe was driven to the brink of bankruptcy by more than 200 civil
suits and paid out at least $50 million in settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The Servants of the Paraclete, an arcane religious sect founded
in Jemez Springs 51 years ago, carried on the psychiatric treatment
programs in white bungalows by the river until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to blame the people in Jemez for what happened to me,''
said Raymond Arellano, a 39-year-old construction worker. ``They
tried to cure priests that could not be cured. Pedophiles are like
coyotes. Once they taste blood, they have to have more.''
</P>
<P>
   An altar boy in the early '70s, Arellano was repeatedly molested
in the northwestern village of Gallina by one of the priests the
Servants of the Paraclete treated and the church relocated.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Pasternack, an Albuquerque attorney who represented dozens
of molestation victims, has accused the Servants of infecting the
state with sexual predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although New Mexico has only one-half of 1 percent of
America's population, it had 20 percent of America's priest
pedophiles,'' Pasternack said. ``The center existed so that
criminal priests did not have to pay criminal penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   At its peak 25 years ago, the Servants' headquarters was home to
as many as 50 visiting priests at a time. Some suffered from
burnout, depression, mid-life crises or alcoholism. Townspeople
jokingly referred to the monastery as ``The Center for Boozy
Priests.'' Scores of them were known pedophiles to the church, but
not to the town.
</P>
<P>
   They lived in riverfront bungalows beneath the cottonwood trees,
played tennis on the monastery courts, swam in the pool, prayed in
the tall chapel and walked down the sloping highway to Los Ojos to
eat burgers and drink Budweiser with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center was really just a way to hide very sick men and
then recycle them after five or six months,'' said a licensed
psychologist who treated priests in Jemez Springs until 1995. ``You
cannot cure pedophiliacs. I never pretended they could be cured.
But I constantly fought to see they were controlled. No one would
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Liam Hoare, the Irish-born executive director of the
Servants, refused interview requests. But he has said in published
reports that the Jemez Springs center no longer treats psychiatric
patients and now concentrates on holding group retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Bishop J. Keith Symons of the Palm Beach, Fla.
Diocese resigned after admitting molesting five altar boys some 30
years ago. The church said it sent Symons to an undisclosed site
for psychological treatment _ not Jemez Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' replacement, Bishop Robert Lynch, believes the church
has come to a better understanding of how to deal with its abusers.
``We know much more about the problem than we did decades ago,''
Lynch said. ``We didn't know much about this 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lessons that could be learned can be found in what
went wrong in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many pedophiles were treated and released in Jemez
Springs is a lingering matter of dispute. Alan Konrad, an
Albuquerque attorney who represented the center, said in court
papers that only a small fraction, less than 6 percent, of the
center's ``guests'' had problems with sexual attractions to
children. Attorneys for victims maintain the number was much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Green, who now lives an hour away in Placitas, N.M., was
the director of psychodrama at the clinic for 10 years, leaving
when it changed course in '95. She directed patients in group
therapy role playing, using theater to expose subconscious issues.
She said she worked with about 30 pedophile priests during her
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Servants did wonderfully well,'' said Green, who
has a nursing degree. ``Of course there were mistakes that were
made. Nobody's perfect. But I was proud to be part of the dynamic
treatment program we had in the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Green and other former employees of the Servants,
therapists experimented with a drug called Depo-Provera that lowers
testosterone and reduces sex drives.
</P>
<P>
   Green said nearly all the patients were permitted to leave the
grounds and mix with the public. ``This wasn't a prison,'' she
said. ``It was a place for healing.''
</P>
<P>
   A psychologist who worked at the facility in the '90s said the
lack of control over the patients was a great problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pleaded with them to move the pedophiles into a psychiatric
hospital where they could be constantly monitored,'' the therapist
said. ``No one would listen. Pedophiles were allowed to leave the
campus on weekends and drive into the city to look for victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoare, in announcing three years ago that therapy programs were
ending, pointed to numerous lawsuits against the Servants. He said
negative publicity had left the center ``stigmatized as the
pedophile center for the Roman Catholic clergy throughout the
world.'' He admitted the Servants had not cured all their guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the tremendous number of men who were guests of the
Paracletes over the years,'' Hoare said then, ``one cannot say that
all were success stories nor deny that, in good faith, mistakes
were made.'' subhead
</P>
<P>
   The Servants' quiet existence, and that of Jemez Springs,' came
to a traumatic end as the 1990s began and the seeds of old horrors
came to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Victims in mid-life came forward with the same stories. Three of
the most notorious pedophile priests to be treated by the Servants
then dispatched to assignments elsewhere in New Mexico were James
R. Porter, David Holley and Jason Sigler.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was convicted of repeatedly molesting more than 80
children in Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Mexico in the 1960s
and early 1970s. He was treated by the Servants of the Paraclete
from 1967-69 and again in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's signature was a warning to his victims: ``God will get
your families if you tell anyone about this.'' In 1993, at the age
of 63, he was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in prison by a New
Bedford, Mass., judge after one of several criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   Holley molested dozens of altar boys in Massachusetts during the
'60s and was sent by the church to Jemez Springs for treatment in
1971. He was reassigned to St. Jude Mission in Alamogordo, N.M.,
where he molested children in his parish and used them to make
pornographic films. In 1993, an Alamogordo judge sentenced Holley,
then 65, to 275 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sigler was sent to the Servants for treatment in the late '60s
after sexual assault incidents in Winnipeg, Canada, and Michigan.
He was reassigned to a parish in northwest New Mexico, where dozens
of victims would accuse him in the '90s of molesting them as
children. Sigler is no longer a priest and has pleaded guilty on
numerous charges.
</P>
<P>
   Arellano is one of at least 10 former altar boys who have
reached undisclosed civil settlements with the church over Sigler's
abuses. Arellano's younger brothers also were victims of Sigler in
Gallina, a village of 400 three hours northwest of Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter to me whether I got $10 or $100 million from
the church,'' Arellano said. ``I didn't do it for the money. My
whole point was to bring it out in the open and let people know
what was happening. Somebody had to put their feet in there and see
that it was stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   When the cases began surfacing a decade ago, the church first
turned to hardball tactics. During depositions in his case, Sigler
sat across the table from one of his victims as a church lawyer
asked the 30-year-old man: ``When (the priest) touched you, did you
enjoy it?''
</P>
<P>
   The church has profound and uncommon power in New Mexico, where
this year Catholicism is to celebrate its 400th anniversary. More
than a religion, it is a way of life that has its origins in the
Spanish conquistadors and has consuming power over people of the
villages and pueblos, where each adobe home has a statue of the
Madonna in some corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rural nature of New Mexico played a part in making the
problem worse here,'' said Merit Bennett, a Santa Fe attorney who
has sued the church 70 times in molestation cases, half involving
the Servants. ``Priests have more power than any other authority in
these rural places. There is a reluctance to question or report any
weird behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans and people of Mexican ancestry, who for
centuries have looked to the church for leadership and stability in
their lives, were inherently vulnerable to predatory betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Catholic Church here, you're taught that the priest is
your connection with God,'' Arellano said. ``He is the church. And
what he is says is gold.'' subhead
</P>
<P>
   Atop a dusty plateau along the bank of the Rio Grande River,
Archbishop Michael J. Sheehan can look out the window of his office
building and see the city of Albuquerque spread before him.
</P>
<P>
   There and beyond is the Diocese of Santa Fe which he oversees, a
religious domain of 300,000 people in 91 parishes scattered
throughout the far reaches of the state. About 40 percent of the
state's 1.6 million people are Catholic, compared with 26 percent
nationwide. Many of these faithful are also impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan took over a diocese four years ago that was
deteriorating on all fronts _ legal, financial and spiritual. He
replaced Robert Sanchez, the nation's first Hispanic archbishop,
who was forced into resignation after admitting sexual affairs with
a half-dozen young women.
</P>
<P>
   During a deposition in a molestation suit against the church,
Sanchez testified he didn't do more to stop the pedophile priests
in his diocese because he didn't know sexually abusing children was
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The money problems Sheehan inherited were just as astounding. He
warned his fellow Catholic bishops that the Santa Fe diocese might
be the first in U.S. history to go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies claimed they weren't liable to cover many of
the court settlements because the church had been negligent in
failing to identify its sex offenders. All numbers are creatures of
approximation, given the diocese's refusal to give precise amounts.
But the toll of some 200 suits could ultimately exceed $100
million, and more than $1 million already has been paid to provide
treatment for some victims. Critics claim too much has gone to
lawyers to fight suits and too little to treat the abused.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay the bill, Sheehan sold off some pricey church
properties and closed down a retreat house run by Dominican
sisters. He has appealed to each of his 77,684 Catholic households
to give more.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they are. Support for the annual Catholic Appeal
Foundation pledge drive here is running at a record rate, up about
10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the deficits of the spirit, he reversed the
confrontational approach of his predecessors and made it a practice
to call or visit victims and express his remorse. The church says
about 75 victims have received an official apology from Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
   To congregations throughout the diocese, he has delivered the
same sermon with the same message: ``If human beings were really
capable of destroying the church, we would have done so centuries
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' attorney Bennett believes Sheehan has succeeded in
bringing some reforms to the church in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken such a financial hit they have had to
change,'' said Bennett. ``They are screening their people more
closely. I know they have made a real effort to solve their
problems. There are a lot of concerned people in the church who are
legitimately trying to get rid of the pedophiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoare acknowledges the toll on his Servants has been heavy, the
settlements exceeding $10 million. He blames media reports for
amplifying the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil litigation ultimately led to the mortgaging of almost
everything we owned,'' he has written in public essays. ``The
adverse national publicity destroyed the attractiveness of our
secluded facility . . . The media in its reporting did not always
avoid sensationalism and inaccuracy.'' subhead
</P>
<P>
   Hoare is advertising his bungalows on the Internet, hoping to
attract corporate groups to Jemez Springs for retreats.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of this month on England's west coast, in Stroud,
Gloucestershire, where the Paracletes operate another facility
called Our Lady of Victory Trust. For decades, it has treated
European priests for pedophilia as Jemez Springs once did.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Vatican ordered a review of procedures there after
reports that abusive priests who had undergone treatment were
involved in sexual assaults after their release. Five years ago, a
38-year-old priest who was in therapy at Our Lady of Victory
committed suicide by throwing himself under a speeding train.
</P>
<P>
   Hoare told the London Independent the center would no longer be
dealing with sexual abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fashionable or profitable to be treating wounded
clergy,'' he said.

   READER'S DIGEST SELLS ART PIECE BY PIECE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is not easy to part with great art, but Reader's
Digest Association Inc., under financial pressure, is apparently
forcing itself to face facts. In a meeting with employees, the
newly appointed chief executive officer, Thomas Ryder, told his
staff that the company had sold Van Gogh's ``Flowers in a Vase,''
Monet's ``Landscape'' and Georges Braque's ``Sunflowers,'' part of
the enormous collection built up by DeWitt Wallace and his wife,
Lila, when they ran the company, according to a transcript of the
staff meeting,
</P>
<P>
   Ryder did not reveal the prices, but the company later said the
Van Gogh brought $3.7 million at a Sotheby's auction in May and the
Monet fetched $2 million. The Braque was sold privately and no
price was disclosed. Ryder said the company ``is going to be under
enormous pressure _ and we should be _ to be rational about our
ownership of a whole lot of valued art.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has watched its stock sink and has slashed
its dividends as the circulation of its crown jewel, Reader's
Digest, has fallen, is finally biting the bullet. But not very
hard. So far this year Reader's Digest has bought 200 photographs,
though a company spokeswoman would not name a price for them. Still
it sounds like the company is at least giving up some of the high
life and comfortable corporate headquarters for which it was
famous.
</P>
<P>
   It has to. Ryder also told staff members, ``Our cash reserves
have declined by several hundred million dollars in the last few
years. The Easter Bunny will not bring back those resources. We
will not win the lottery. We will have to bring the resources back
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that takes too long, the company, with a bulging art
collection, could always sell off more art. Ryder at least seems
willing to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   FEWER REPORTERS COVER MORE NEWS AT STATE CAPITALS
</P>
<P>
   Tighter budgets and a penchant to offer softer, more
reader-friendly news stories and features has led more and more of
the nation's newspapers to pare their coverage of state government,
according to a report scheduled to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced emphasis on covering the affairs of state
governments comes at a time when television has also pared back its
reporting, and when state governments, backed by Washington, are
exerting more power, enacting more legislation and spending more
money than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which appears in the July-August issue of American
Journalism Review, is the third in a series underwritten by The
Project on the State of the American Newspaper, which is supported
by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the report found, newspaper staffing at
the statehouse level has declined in more than half the states: 27
states _ including Connecticut, New Jersey and New York _ now have
fewer full-time reporters covering state government. Over the same
period, newspapers in 14 states have increased the size of their
reporting staff. Newspapers in nine states have not changed the
size of their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't try and say that more bodies mean better coverage,''
Thomas Kunkel, editor and director of the project, said. ``But this
is an important barometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff cuts at Gannett and Knight-Ridder, the two chains whose
newspapers have the highest circulation in the country, have been
particularly pronounced. The number of statehouse reporters at
Gannett newspapers has been pared by 14 percent, the report found.
At Knight-Ridder, the number of full-time reporters covering state
government has been cut by 16 percent.

<P>
   MEN'S JOURNAL ENCOUNTERS PROBLEMS ON MOUNT RAINIER
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task keeping a magazine's content timely.
</P>
<P>
   In the June-July issue of Men's Journal, a magazine that focuses
on sports, fitness and adventure, the title of an article on
mountain climbing blared: ``Climb Mount Rainier: A Serious
Mountaineering Challenge with Minimal Risk of Headline-Making
Deaths. Call it Everest for Everyman.''
</P>
<P>
   The June-July issue hit newsstands in late May. Flash forward to
June 12, when newspaper headlines around the country reported the
death of a climber who was caught in an avalanche on Mount Rainier.
Four days later, new headlines appeared about the plight of two
climbers who were stranded near the summit of the mountain by a
whiteout.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unfortunate coincidence is probably the best way to
describe it,'' said David Willey, a senior editor at Men's Journal,
which is owned by Wenner Media. There are three months between the
time the magazine's staff produces an issue and when it goes on
sale, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Willey defended the headline and the article, saying
that Mount Rainier, in Washington state, has had the fewest deaths
of any major peak in the lower 48 states. (Rainier is the second
highest peak in the lower 48 states, at 14,410 feet. Mount Whitney
in California is the highest, at 14,495 feet.) If approached with
the proper attitude and preparation, Willey said, Rainier does not
pose a serious threat to the less-experienced mountain climber.
</P>
<P>
   John Krambrink, the superintendent of Mount Rainier National
Park, was more cautious. ``Even on the most popular routes up the
mountain, which people would consider the easiest to climb, you can
face situations where the conditions make it very treacherous,''
Krambrink said. ``We have the most accidents and fatalities on the
popular routes. Rainier is one of the most physical climbs. It
takes tremendous stamina and mental strength.''
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING LEAVES ITS IVORY TOWER
</P>
<P>
   The ivory tower of scholarly publishing is not quite such an
ivory tower anymore. Just ask the top-of-the-line outside
publicists who have been hired for a couple of major university
press titles this fall, books whose 20,000-copy print runs are 10
times bigger than the usual runs. Books that could slip very nicely
onto a commercial publisher's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   These signs show that the upheavals in bookselling and trade
publishing are being felt within academia. So much so that the
Association of American University Presses, meeting in Washington
over the weekend, chose ``Seismic Shifts'' as its theme.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarly mission has not changed, but some of the
publishing realities have. Library budgets for scholarly monographs
have shrunk. Publishing more books that could be sold in retail
bookstores was one solution. But in a bookselling world that is
consolidating, fighting for position is harder than ever. Every
publisher must brandish a few titles that can lead its list through
the chain doors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tina Weiner, the associate director at Yale University
Press, emphasized that every book on her fall list ``is rock solid
in its academic contribution,'' she said it was ``the most
ambitious trade list we've ever had.'' That is coming from the
publisher who has sold 60,000 copies of ``The Encyclopedia of New
York.'' Yale is starting this September with 20,000 copies of ``The
New Encyclopedia of the American West''; at least 15,000 copies of
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's analysis of American government
secrecy, called ``Secrecy'', and in October, a similar number of
``My German Question,'' Peter Gay's memoir of growing up Jewish in
Nazi Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lead titles at Princeton University Press is ``The
Life of Birds'' by David Attenborough, which will have a
50,000-copy print run and accompany a 10-part PBS series, and ``The
Shape of the River,'' an examination of race as a factor in
university admissions co-written by Derek Bok, president emeritus
of Harvard and William Bowen, a former Princeton president.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Lippincott, the director of Princeton University Press,
said, ``I wouldn't want to do too many of these books, because
there's such an element of risk.'' But then, these are risky
publishing times. &QL;

PRIZES CREATED TO HONOR WRITER J. ANTHONY LUKAS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)  (fb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A series of awards has been established in honor of
J. Anthony Lukas, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who died last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will include an annual prize of $10,000, to be given
to a book that covers an important aspect of American social or
political life, and a grant of $45,000 for a work in progress on
similar subject matter. In addition, the organizers of the award
plan a series of annual events for students and young journalists
that will focus on nonfiction writing.
</P>
<P>

DANCE REVIEW: AIRBORNE CREATIVITY FLIRTING WITH PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Elizabeth Streb does not throw her dancers to the
lions. At least she hasn't done so yet. She doesn't have her
dancers engage in gladiatorial combat, either, though one could
almost imagine her deciding to give such duels a try. She has
already created dances that resemble boxing and wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   Streb specializes in extremely demanding, and even exhausting
and potentially dangerous, choreography. Appearing as part of this
summer's American Dance Festival on the campus of Duke University
here, her company, which she calls Streb, proved to be a troupe of
disciplined daredevils. Yet the performance on Saturday night in
Page Auditorium was an ordeal as well as a show.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Streb's choreography derives from gymnastics, and she
emphasizes the arduousness of her acrobatic stunts by amplifying
the stage so that whenever a dancer's body touches a surface,
thunderous noises ring out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop,'' a world premiere, was typical of Streb's efforts. With
cords attached to their bodies, Hope Clark and Matthew Stromberg
plummeted head downward from above the stage, then began to swoop
wildly from side to side, sometimes nearly colliding. It was as if
they had been transformed into human slingshots.
</P>
<P>
   Other dances were based upon similar mind-boggling tricks. In
``Fly,'' a woman tied to a huge lever swung about in the air while
other dancers scurried beneath her. The dancers in ``Look Up'' wore
harnesses that permitted them to walk up and down a wall. Everyone
in ``All/Wall'' slams against the side of a wall in choreography
that threatened to break their bones.
</P>
<P>
   People kept rising and falling on moving platforms in a two-part
dance called ``Across,'' and in ``Breakthrough'' a dancer crashed
through a windowpane. A company representative said that it was
made of stage glass, a synthetic substance used by theatrical
designers that is less unpredictable when it breaks than real
glass. Yet one miscalculated move through this pane could still
have left the dancer in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Streb sent people bounding buoyantly on a trampoline in ``Up''
and on a surface with springs in ``Bounce.'' But joyousness is not
one of her major themes. She thereby differs from some of the
choreographers who in recent years have used acrobatic movements to
suggest that through training people can acquire a sense of
nimbleness, playfulness and grace. Streb's choreography, in
contrast, is dominated by images of pain. Therefore, despite their
intense physicality, her dancers do not celebrate the body. Rather,
they can be related to an American puritan tradition that regards
the body as something to be punished, not glorified.
</P>
<P>
   In only one piece did the choreographic pain serve a genuine
purpose: ``Little Ease,'' a solo in which Streb thrashed about
inside a tiny coffinlike box. By creating a remarkably
claustrophobic sense of imprisonment, she made the work an implicit
protest against oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Streb, who has been dancing ``Little Ease'' since its premiere
in 1985, gave her final performance of it on Saturday. Other
dancers will continue to do it in the future. It remains one of
Streb's few works to inspire a theatergoer to think as well as
gasp.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T chief Michael Armstrong is getting his first taste of the
criticism that can come with remaking a corporate icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a crazy few days,'' he said Friday in an
interview in his Basking Ridge, N.J. office. ``The disinformation,
its incredible. I've never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither had a lot of people in the business world before
Wednesday, when AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest phone company, announced
a deal to acquire the nation's No. 2 cable television company,
Tele-Communications Inc., for $31.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then AT&AMP;T's stock, the most widely held in the nation, has
lost more than 13 percent of its value. Investors are confused and
worried about the full ramifications of the deal; the AT&AMP;T of old
was not so aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief executive, is nothing
if not aggressive. The TCI deal follows AT&AMP;T's agreement in January
to acquire Teleport Communications Group, a competitive local phone
provider, for $11.3 billion. And other bold moves may be in the
offing, including an alliance with a major overseas telephone
company.
</P>
<P>
   Whether investors and competitors view this flurry of activity
as exhilarating, worrisome or downright scary, it should not be
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   After all, on the day he was named the new AT&AMP;T leader eight
months ago in a ceremony that seemed a lot like a coronation,
Armstrong made clear that he would be no mere caretaker of the
company, one of the world's best known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of adrenaline flowing,'' he said that day last
October. ``I don't think I'm going to let that adrenaline stop for
the rest of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   When Armstrong arrived last fall from running the Hughes
Electronics unit of General Motors Corp., AT&AMP;T resembled a
dyspeptic giant, disoriented and grouchy. In an industry that is
one of the world's largest and most dynamic, AT&AMP;T, under the
now-retired chairman Robert Allen, had no visible strategy for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   After joining AT&AMP;T, Armstrong spent three months quietly
assessing his options. He broke his silence in January by
announcing the Teleport deal, which was to be the cornerstone of
AT&AMP;T's expansion into the business-customer side of the local phone
market.
</P>
<P>
   The TCI deal is Armstrong's bid to break into the residential
segment. AT&AMP;T, like MCI Communications Corp., its main competitor
in the long-distance business, has essentially given up on trying
to enter the local market by reselling the phone service of the
local Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   The next and last big piece of the strategy would be
international. Armstrong says that in the next few months the
company will announce a major plan for its global business.
Armstrong offered no specifics, but there is strong suspicion that
AT&AMP;T is forging an alliance with British Telecommunications PLC,
now that British Telecom has seen Worldcom Inc. sunder its deal to
acquire MCI.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London reported Sunday that AT&AMP;T and British
Telecom are in ``advanced negotiations'' for some sort of alliance;
AT&AMP;T declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Before he can drop another bomb on the industry, however,
Armstrong must convince investors of the wisdom of acquiring TCI's
cable operation and combining it with AT&AMP;T's consumer business as a
new subsidiary. So far, such convincing has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, he's doing the right things,'' said Stephanie
Comfort, head telecommunications analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``I think where people are worried is that he's throwing a
lot of dollars around, and there's a lot of transformation that has
to happen. You're basically transforming a company that has had a
traditional value-based investor focus. The perception on the
Street that's building is that he's very good but he's shooting
from the hip a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   While Armstrong denies that he is acting rashly, he freely
admits that he feels compelled to move quickly. He said that after
divesting itself of its local operations as part of the 1984
federal antitrust settlement and then spinning off its computer and
equipment business in 1996, AT&AMP;T has a lot of catching up to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be bold because I'm working against time and the
forces of industry, of change, of technology and of competition,''
he said. ``Had AT&AMP;T over the last 10 years been ramping to this
threshold, terrific. The facts are that AT&AMP;T was accomplishing its
breakup, then its tri-vestiture, so it was consumed with a lot of
things internal. Now we have to be consumed with a lot of things
external, so maybe that's why it comes as a step-function rather
than as evolution.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in the absence of specific details about the company's
technical plans for TCI, and in light of the deal's bewildering
complexity, Armstrong and his chief financial officer, Daniel
Somers, made the unusual move on Friday of holding an impromptu
conference call with financial analysts. Still, the call did not
keep AT&AMP;T's shares from continuing their slide, ending the day at
$56.75, down $1.625.
</P>
<P>
   Armstong said that AT&AMP;T hoped to sell local phone service and
high-speed access to the Internet to 30 percent of TCI's 10.5
million cable customers within five years of completing the
acquisition. Armstrong is also about to start negotiating deals
with TCI's affiliated cable systems to get them to carry AT&AMP;T's
service.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of upgrading cable systems to carry voice and
Internet-style data traffic will be $400 to $500 a line, Armstrong
said. The necesssary technology, however, is not expected to be
ready for perhaps two years. In markets where the company wants to
move especially quickly, AT&AMP;T could deploy technology that more
closely resembles a traditional phone system, at a cost of about
$750 a line.
</P>
<P>
   Once TCI has been updated and integrated into AT&AMP;T's operations
by early next decade, though, the company predicts that the new
venture will enable the corporate parent to report earnings growth
of nearly 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   A big outstanding question is the ultimate fate of Liberty
Media, the television programming unit of TCI. After the deal John
Malone, TCI's chairman, would continue to control Liberty and AT&AMP;T
would have no finanical stake in the unit. Some people on Wall
Street wonder whether the structure of the new AT&AMP;T would allow
Malone to spin out Liberty Media in a tax-free deal after the
AT&AMP;T-TCI merger closes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he had no idea if Malone was planning such a move
and added that it would be illegal for AT&AMP;T and TCI to agree to a
merger with a future spin-off in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you just don't have those sorts of discussions,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he had not yet decided which of TCI's cable
markets would be the first to receive new services from AT&AMP;T. He
would not say what he expected the new services to cost but added
that within metropolitan areas the services would be offered in
both high- and low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   His experience with Hughes' DirecTV direct-broadcast satellite
television products was that high-income households did not
necessarily buy the service more often than families with less
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will sacrifice to enjoy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that goes for shareholders as well as customers remains
to be seen, but Armstrong continues to radiate confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience, and maybe also history's experience,'' he said,
``is that you're remembered more for how it ends up as to how you
got there.'' &QL;

REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO BLOCK FUNDS FOR TEAMSTER ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a federal monitor complaining that he cannot supervise the
Teamsters' presidential election because Congress has cut off his
funding, Republicans in Congress are finding themselves in a
pickle.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do congressional Republicans appear to be blocking a
monitor whose job is to prevent election corruption in a union
synonymous with corruption, but the funding cutoff is alarming
James P. Hoffa, the front-running candidate who is considered
friendlier to the Republicans than the union's current leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffa forces fear that the decision to bar funding could
delay the vote for months and could result in an election that is
run by anti-Hoffa incumbents rather than the federal monitor. ``We
don't trust the current administration to conduct a fair
election,'' Thomas Pazzi, Hoffa's campaign manager, said in an
interview. ``There is no evidence they would do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is now headed by Tom
Sever, the secretary-treasurer, who was elected on the slate with
Ron Carey, the union president who has taken a leave of absence
while under investigation in a campaign-finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Carey narrowly beat Hoffa in the 1996 race, but that victory was
nullified and a new election was ordered when federal monitors
discovered that Carey aides embezzled more than $700,000 in
Teamster funds to help his campaign. In the new election, ballots
are scheduled to be mailed out in September and counted on Oct. 14.
But Michael Cherkasky, the federal monitor, said he has so little
funds that vendors will not sign contracts with his office to do
needed activities, like print the ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, he filed an urgent request with Judge David
Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan, asking him to
order the federal government and the union to agree on a plan by
Tuesday to fund his office. Cherkasky asserted that the funding
crisis would jeopardize the long-standing federal effort to clean
up the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal, he wrote, ``It would be astounding, and a
stunning waste of decades of effort spent fighting organized crime
and labor racketeering, if the current paralysis over funding
resulted in the abandonment of this law enforcement effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1989 consent decree that the Teamsters signed to settle
a racketeering lawsuit, the union agreed to hold elections every
five years and to allow government supervision of the union and its
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree required the federal government to pay for
supervision in the 1996 election. But congressional Republicans,
led by Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, were so angry about the
Carey campaign-finance scandal and about having taxpayers finance a
union election that they barred funds for supervision. Ever since
Carey was first elected in 1991, Republicans have disliked him
because he made the Teamsters aggressively pro-Democrat after the
union had long supported the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Teamster officials say that in orchestrating the funding
prohibition, Hoekstra was trying to hurt the Carey camp and bolster
Hoffa, who is also from Michigan. But the cutoff has hurt Hoffa
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Trossman, a spokesman for Hoffa's main opponent, Tom
Leedham, said, ``It's ironic that congressman Hoekstra, with the
Hoffa forces cheering him on, has made a mess of funding this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   In the funding standoff, the Federal Court of Appeals in
Manhattan has ruled that the government must pay to conduct the
election if it chooses to supervise the vote. The court left the
alternative that the government could choose not to supervise the
election and let the union conduct and pay for it. That alternative
is opposed by Cherkasky, the Justice Department, the Teamster
incumbents and Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials say they are lobbying Congress to
agree to provide the $8.6 million Cherkasky says he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that such a relatively small sum is creating such big
problems, Pazzi said, ``They accidentally move decimal points in
Congress that wipe out more dollars than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials who follow the funding negotiations said that
congressional Democrats who originally supported the funding for
the monitor's office have been strangely quiet about the money.
These officials suggest that the Democrats are happy to see the
Republicans stew over the issue and that the Democrats also want
the Teamster vote delayed so that Carey's allies can remain in
charge until after the congressional elections in November. That
way the union might continue backing Democratic candidates. But
congressional Democrats deny any such strategem.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Hoekstra said he was reluctant to make
funding available because Cherkasky, in his view, has not done
enough to stop Teamster officials from using union resources and
money to help their preferred candidates. He has also indicated he
would like Cherkasky to remove Sever from office for participating
in the campaign-finance fraud. Teamster officials deny Sever has
any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky has said that he has no power to suspend Sever and
that he was already working hard to prevent the misuse of union
resources in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoekstra is skeptical. ``My concern here is with the
taxpayer,'' he said. ``The system is not yet in place to conduct a
fair election. I don't want to pour another dollar or $8 million
into an election that in three or six months we'll have to overturn
again. That sounds pretty dumb to me.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was another roller coaster week last week for
Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   First he suffered the smug ``I told you so'' reaction from
competitors, colleagues and critics when he announced the departure
of Susan Molinari, the congresswoman turned anchor, only a year
after he had hired her in a high-profile, high-risk bid to start a
Saturday morning news program.
</P>
<P>
   Then he absorbed some grateful slaps on the back after word got
out that Don Hewitt, the venerated producer of CBS' most successful
program, ``60 Minutes,'' had agreed to help create a weeknight
version of that CBS institution.
</P>
<P>
   The two developments reflect the pressures constantly colliding
in the brain and the heart of Heyward, who, in ascending the
hierarchy of CBS News, has learned to be a hard-headed business
strategist and a slick diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his mandate: to earn attention, ratings and profits
without compromising the prestige of CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   And since he took over the news division two and a half years
ago, its flagship programs have shown increases in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   All the broadcast networks except NBC expect to lose money this
season and next, as their audiences scatter to cable television,
computers and other distractions. For CBS, which has the oldest
audience, the push is on to attract younger viewers and urban
viewers, and news has become a critical focal point of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   As ``60 Minutes'' was the first to prove, news magazine programs
can be extremely profitable. They can earn dependably solid Nielsen
ratings in almost any prime-time hour, making them useful pillars
to shore up a network in time slots where its entertainment
programs are sagging.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has constantly added editions of ``Dateline,'' which will be
on five nights in the fall. ABC combined two news magazines under
one banner to promote them better and will offer three nights of
``20/20'' in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has had only ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday night and ``48 Hours''
on Thursday night, and the network's entertainment chief, Leslie
Moonves, had been begging the news division for another ``60
Minutes'' to add to the weeknight schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists at ``60 Minutes'' declined, saying it was
difficult enough to produce a show of its quality and depth once a
week, let alone twice. In addition, the ``60 Minutes'' crew fears
feeling the same pressures that led ``Dateline'' and ``20/20'' to
add ``soft'' features on life styles, consumer issues or
celebrities, both to fill their added hours and to bolster ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew became Henry Kissinger on the `60 Minutes' thing,''
said one high-level CBS producer, speaking, as is the CBS News
custom, on condition of anonymity. ``He negotiated between what
Black Rock and Moonves wanted, and what the `60' guys didn't
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Rock is the nickname for the CBS Corporation's
headquarters in Manhattan, where Mel Karmazin, the corporation's
president and chief operating officer, has his office. Moonves, the
Los Angeles-based entertainment chief, was elevated earlier this
year to president of CBS Television, in charge of entertainment,
sports and news.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward used to report directly to Karmazin (or his predecessor,
Peter Lund); now he reports to Moonves, a situation that rankles
some longtime CBS journalists. ``Why should Andrew report to
entertainment?'' one grumbled, ignoring the notion that Moonves'
job is supposed to be larger than just entertainment now.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the grumbler, many CBS News colleagues had hoped that
Heyward could change Hewitt's mind about a second ``60 Minutes.''
In their view, it would be a sign of success and of confidence in
CBS News if the news division captured another slot in prime time,
and it might attract more corporate resources and attention to
news.
</P>
<P>
   This division of opinion _ whether to resist the corporate
profit pressures or to use them to News' advantage _ is typical
among CBS News journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the oldest video news history in the business, and
it's one hell of a legacy, but it means everybody there always
talks about the good old days,'' said Roger Ailes, a longtime
political analyst and now the president of Fox News. ``In this
business, you've got to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The riskiest attention-getting moves Heyward has taken at the
helm have failed: the attempted transformation of Molinari and the
hiring of former Senator Bill Bradley as an essayist (which also
ended in a mutual parting after a year).
</P>
<P>
   But Heyward also negotiated a highly unusual deal in which
Christiane Amanpour, the star correspondent of Cable News Network,
became a part-time correspondent for ``60 Minutes'' as well as a
contributor of five pieces a year.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Bryant Gumbel, the former anchor of NBC's
``Today,'' for more than $5 million a year would never have been
labeled a risk; Gumbel was much sought-after and is a highly
respected newsman and interviewer. But his program, ``Private
Eye,'' received poor ratings and has been reduced from a weekly
program to occasional specials for the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was critically important to attract someone of Bryant
Gumbel's stature when we did,'' Heyward said. ``And this was
arguably the hardest year in history to start something new; I
think only one new hourlong show from this season is coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryant has done some terrific stories, he's every bit as
talented as he was when I watched him on someone else's air, and
his show is well within the pattern of normal growth for a news
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward pointed out that other CBS magazines, ``60 Minutes'' and
``48 Hours,'' were the only network news magazines to show growth
this season over the 1996-97 season, both in total viewers and in
the 25-to-54-year-old age groups advertisers want most on news
programs, even if the growth was only to 5 percent from 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Evening News With Dan Rather,'' which had been in third
place for so long that CBS had begun to despair of its ever moving
higher, now challenges ABC's ``World News Tonight'' for second
place and has sometimes even challenged NBC for first place. Its
ratings increased 11 percent in total viewers and 10 percent in
adults 25 to 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``When network audiences are eroding everywhere and our key
programs are growing, that's success,'' Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   His boss seems to think so. In a sign of confidence, Karmazin,
who rarely grants interviews, was eager to return a call asking
about Heyward.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Famous for his impatience about improving the bottom line,
Karmazin seemed to take care not to alarm CBS News traditionalists,
either, when he said that the most important goal he wanted Heyward
to meet was to make CBS News the best news division. He said
ratings and profits would follow.
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``CBS This Morning'' as an example. It badly trails the
NBC and ABC weekday-morning breakfast programs, but it has improved
its ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still rather have the `Today' show's ratings, but our
revenue is up dramatically,'' Karmazin said. ``The entire news
division is profitable, and its revenues are increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Karmazin and Heyward say that the corporation, while cost
conscious, realizes that the news division has to spend money to
stay ahead (witness Gumbel's contract and the recent renewal of
Rather's at close to $7 million). The corporation ``has the most to
lose'' if the news division's credibility is undermined, Karmazin
said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, CBS News won the Edward R. Murrow Award for overall
excellence in electronic journalism, from the Radio-Television News
Directors Association, for a combination of reports that appeared
on ``Evening News,'' ``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours,'' ``Public Eye''
and ``Sunday Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew's report card shouldn't be whether he's the best
businessman,'' Karmazin said. ``We could find lots of accountants
who would be great businessmen. We're looking for a great president
of News, someone who knows how to build a news division for us.
We'll figure out how to sell the advertising to make it
profitable.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ For all the talk about the male gaze _ the way of
seeing that perpetually turns women into fixed objects of men's
desires and needs _ when it comes to fashion, the demands of the
female gaze can be just as potent and ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   For women, fashion is an esthetic, a competition and a spectator
sport. Like all of these, it includes eros, envy, status strivings
and the pleasures, pure and impure, that come from watching how
flesh, forms, fabrics and temperaments meet.
</P>
<P>
   To walk through ``American Ingenuity: Sportswear, 1930s-1970s,''
the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume
Institute, is to see how women who designed clothes turned their
gaze upon women who bought them, and how together they devised
socially desirable and at times socially daring representations of
what an American woman was supposed to mean and be. (There are
important men designers in the show, too, but the focus is a group
of women who began to give American sportswear a Parisian-free ease
and forthrightness in the 1930s and 1940s.)
</P>
<P>
   The witty writer and designer Elizabeth Hawes wrote in 1938 that
fashion was a complete anachronism, a deformed thief; designers
like Claire McCardell, Clare Potter and Vera Maxwell set out to
banish that thief from their realm. They were followed by Anne
Klein, Bonnie Cashin and Anne Fogarty, among others, then by Donna
Karan and Diane Von Furstenberg, the youngest designers in the
show. (Karan will surely be remembered for the quality of her work,
and Von Furstenberg will surely be remembered for the quality of
her marketing.)
</P>
<P>
   How did these designers represent American women? As fresh-faced
but never fresh teen-age girls, as vigorous but graceful suburban
wives and mothers, as clever but never strident career women.
Fashion has to work by cleverly manipulating these dualities; its
job is to make what is dangerous and marginal seem desirable and
natural. And so a prostitute's stiletto boots and torn fishnet
stockings become wittily vulgar and bold, while hip-hop clothing,
so funky, so black and so Latino, becomes jaunty, white and very
Tommy Hilfiger, too. That's why we are so repelled by clothes that
have just fallen out of fashion. We feel like Titanias who've been
caught in the clutches of jackasses or like the jackass that has
been cast off by Titania.
</P>
<P>
   The ``American Ingenuity'' clothes are filled with these
contradictions. They are opulent but pragmatic. Cost and function
attest to certain social privileges (ah, that golf dress and those
leisure-time day ensembles), but they bestow certain democratic
prerogatives as well (modest cottons and denims, clothes to do
house or factory work in, shapes that adapt to all kinds of
bodies). Some seem made for what Isadora Duncan, the early-1900s
dance pioneer, called the ideal woman of the future: ``The highest
intelligence in the freest body.'' Others see that ideal woman as a
handsome, movable fetish object.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone walking through the show will follow the same zigzag
course; modern fashion can't help being a catalyst for
autobiography, too. (Why don't more men write about their relation
to what they wear, used to wear and still long to wear?)
</P>
<P>
   If you were a girl in the 1940s or '50s, did your mother dress
you in Emily Wilkins-esque dresses with smocking, ruffled collars
and bows or flowers at the waist? Did you like them? And if you
belong to the ``Free to Be You and Me'' generation, do these
dresses look preposterous, hazardous to the health of the teen-age
and preteen-age female psyche, or do they possess a certain allure
that reason cannot assuage?
</P>
<P>
   When I came upon lithe black evening culottes by McCardell from
1934, I recalled the thrill of being allowed to wear my own modest
daytime pair to high school 30 years later: it combined slightly
defiant revelation (they were pants) with still-flirtatious
disguise (they looked like a skirt).
</P>
<P>
   Some clothes made great demands, physically and psychologically.
Like the Cashin jumpsuit, with those ``Look at me, I'm daring and
adorable'' olive and orange stripes, or the dark, discreet one by
Geoffrey Beene, which signals, ``I'm so offhandedly classy that
you'll have to do a double take before you realize that I'm daring,
too.'' But Vera Maxwell's trim 1944 Rosie the Riveter jumpsuit,
made for women in wartime factories, sends just one message:
physical competence and concentration are essential and elegant.
</P>
<P>
   The show's curator, Richard Martin, stresses the structural ways
in which these designers made clothing for women more useful and
modern. They built pockets and purses into skirts and jackets,
dispensed with elaborate, hard-to-reach fastenings, designed
separates that were easy to combine and then recombine and adapted
men's fabrics and tailoring techniques. But the shifts in attitude
also come through in cheeky, displays of wit. Cashin takes the
traditional WASP country club colors of green and pink and turns
them into a city lights midriff-baring dress of jersey and suede,
while McCardell converts the man in the gray flannel suit into a
woman in a gray flannel swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   We make sharp, clear distinctions between fashion that looks
dated and fashion that looks timeless, and unless we're cultivating
a retro look, ``dated'' is a nasty word. But it doesn't have to be.
Many of the dress-and-coat ensembles from the 1960s look dated to
me: carefully shaped and cut, the lining of the coat usually
matching the pattern of the dress. It's fun to look at them in a
museum, as you look at period furniture or statuary, and it's fun
to imagine how some women might look in them today; but it's not
very interesting to imagine how women would act or move in them.
These clothes have symmetry but they do not have dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell does, though, and that is what makes her the
revelation of this show. McCardell savored the contradictions of
the female body: she knew how to disclose or conceal its parts
without making either process ostentatious. She did this by making
clothes that a woman could adapt to her body in all sorts of ways:
a belt or no belt, dress strings tied around the waist or just
below the breasts, the adjustment of the wrapped bodice of an
evening gown. Severe fabrics and lines characterize her beach wear,
while delicate ornamental touches appear on the most easygoing
workaday dresses.
</P>
<P>
   McCardell's calculated modesty can be visually underwhelming
compared with some of the clothes here. Some of those plaids are
just too drab; the denim-derived topstiching on dress pockets, suit
jackets and tops can look too self-conscious about its own
sportiness. But keep looking.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Wharton, who knew so much about female constraints, once
called the face the theater of varied human emotions. McCardell's
designs undermine our fixed social readings of clothes and give the
body that same privilege.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has to do with why we want to call certain artists
timeless. They let us live in the past and the present
simultaneously; they make us eager to imagine the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn Academy of Music will open its 1998 Next
Wave Festival on Sept. 9 with the American premiere of ``Eclipse,''
the latest spectacle from the French equestrian troupe Zingaro. The
production features 26 horses, 18 riders, dancers and acrobats and
a seven-member folk-music ensemble performing dreamlike sequences
based on the contrast between black and white. The troupe, which
made its U.S. debut in ``Chimere'' in 1996, will present 41
performances at Battery Park City through Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, in its 16th season, will move to its Brooklyn home
on Oct. 8 with the New York premiere of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie
Zane Dance Company's ``We Set Out Early ... Visibility Was Poor.''
Divided into three sections, the work combines ballet, modern,
social and ethnic dance forms set to music by Stravinsky, Cage and
the Lithuanian composer Peteris Vasks.
</P>
<P>
   Ballett Frankfurt will make its first New York appearance in
nearly a decade in the U.S. premiere of William Forsythe's ``Eidos:
Telos,'' based on the tale of the spider woman, Arachne, who flouts
time by spinning a web. Other dance performances include the local
premieres of Ballet Preljocaj's ``Romeo and Juliet,''
Chandralekha's ``Raga _ In Search of Femininity'' and Susan
Marshall's ``Most Dangerous Room in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wilson's and Philip Glass' opera ``Monsters of Grace,'' a
three-dimensional, computer-animated 70-millimeter film with live
music and vocals, will be given its New York premiere, as will
Steve Reich and Beryl Korot's ``Hindenburg.'' The first part of a
documentary video opera to be completed by 2001, ``Hindenburg''
explores the impact of new technology on the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The violinist Gidon Kremer will lead his Kremerata Musica in
Astor Piazzolla's tango opera ``Maria de Buenos Aires,'' written
with and narrated by his lifelong collaborator, Uruguayan poet
Horacio Ferrer. ``Powder Her Face,'' Thomas Ades' opera about the
scandalous life of Margaret, the Duchess of Argyll, will be
performed by the Brooklyn Philharmonic in a semistaged version
conducted by Robert Spano.
</P>
<P>
   Spano will also lead the orchestra in ``AB&AMP;C,'' a program of
works by John Adams, Luciano Berio and Elliott Carter, presented in
honor of Carter's 90th birthday. Other music events include a
25th-anniversary celebration by the Kronos Quartet and the U.S.
premiere of Schubert's ``Winterreise,'' produced by Christian
Boltanski, Jean Kalman and Hans-Peter Cloos. Don Byron returns as
the host of ``Jazz _ the Next Wave'' with Latin masters Tito Puente
and Giovanni Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Two theater productions will also be given their U.S. premieres:
``Anna Karenina,'' presented by the English company Shared
Experience, and Vasilios Calitsis' and Tasos Roussos' ``World
Mysteries: The Mysteries of Eleusis,'' inspired by the Greek myth
of Demeter and Persephone.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is sponsored by Philip Morris Co.

   BACKING FOR BILL TO SHIELD CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma congressman won preliminary support last week for
legislation that would require public schools and libraries to use
filters on their computers as a way to keep children from seeing
sexually explicit material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Rep. Ernest Istook Jr., a Republican, was added
to an $81.9 billion budget bill pending in the House Appropriations
Committee to cover education, labor and health and human services.
The bill is expected to be sent to the full House after lawmakers
return from the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Communications Decency Act was overturned by the
Supreme Court last year, lawmakers have sought more narrowly
tailored legislation to shield children without violating the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appropriations bill is a must-pass bill, so it is very
dangerous that the provision has been added to that bill,'' said
Ron Weich, a legislative consultant to the American Civil Liberties
Union, which successfully challenged the Communications Decency
Act.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Istook said the amendment stirred no controversy
among members of the subcommittee that approved it. ``There was no
opposition,'' the aide said. ``It was a 14-0 vote.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
passed the Senate Commerce Committee. But it is narrower, applying
only to schools and libraries that receive federal financial
assistance in obtaining Internet access.

   THE FINE ART OF LURING READERS
</P>
<P>
   Want to learn how to put an end to junk e-mail forever? Don't
ask Avatar Publishing _ even though a piece of widely circulated
promotional electronic mail from Avatar has been luring readers
with the subject line: ``Never Receive Junk E-Mail Again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great to never get junk e-mail again?'' the
message begins. ``Well, no one can make you that promise,
unfortunately. But you can profit from junk e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Avatar, which has an unlisted phone number and has hidden its
return e-mail address, then invites the reader to mail $29 to a Los
Angeles address for more information and a junk e-mail starter kit
that includes a primer on what is legal and what is not.
</P>
<P>
   The message explains that Avatar is in a ``fun little war'' with
the producers of Internet filter software, to see just who can
outsmart whom. ``We know all the secrets,'' the message says.
``Obviously, or you wouldn't be reading this, would you?'' Probably
not.

   WHAT TO WEAR WHEN THE FUTURE COMES
</P>
<P>
   With all the dire predictions that airlines, banks, power grids
and even the federal government will be felled by ill-programmed
computers when the calendar turns over to Jan. 1, 2000, there is
now one less thing to worry about: what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Two entrepreneurs in Birmingham, Mich., have come up with what
they have trademarked as the ``Official Logo of the New
Millennium.'' And they have the Web site _ and the T-shirts _ to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea grew from a brainstorming session a year ago, said
Larry Smith, a managing partner of the venture, called Millennium
321. (The 3 denotes the third millennium; the 21 refers to the 21st
century.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just read that M &AMP; M's had just applied to be the
official candy of the new millennium,'' he said. ``We thought,
`What could we do that could have a global impact?'''
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner, James Iacobucci, came up with a logo with
three columns that Smith said ``looks as though you're unzipping
the future.'' Shirts, sweatshirts and caps with the logo are for
sale on the company's Web site, which opened last week
(www.m321.com).

   IRS REDESIGNS FORM ON TAX-EXEMPT STATUS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's tax collectors are planning a surfing safari on the
Web to hunt for nonprofit groups that are really commercial
enterprises in charitable camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is redesigning the application form
for organizations that seek tax-exempt status. The existing
application form asks for examples of brochures and other printed
materials, which IRS officials use to evaluate applications. More
than 1.5 million organizations have won tax exemption from the
service. The new form, expected to be released by fall, will add a
box for a would-be nonprofit to list its Web address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing ourselves up to 21st-century technology,'' said
Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman, ``and realizing that a lot of these
organizations have Web sites, as well as printed materials, will
help us evaluate applications.''
</P>
<P>
   KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, tells clients in its
June newsletter that having a list of nonprofit Web sites will also
help agents quickly check whether a tax-exempt organization is
straying too far into commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofits are allowed to engage in business activities like
operating museum gift shops if the activities are related to the
organization's core purpose. But if the venture is unrelated to
that mission, the group must pay taxes on any profits.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet on the IRS agenda for the 21st century: online
application for tax-exempt status. &QL;

12TH WORLD AIDS CONFERENCE OPENS IN GENEVA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Pleas for national leaders to muster the political
courage to carry out strong prevention programs to stop the global
epidemic of AIDS were sounded at the opening of the 12th World AIDS
Conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the world is facing a ``runaway epidemic,'' Dr.
Peter Piot, the head of the U.N. AIDS program, told the conference
that ``it is time to embrace a new realism and a new urgency in our
efforts'' to overcome complacency about HIV, the virus causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This epidemic is out of control at the very time when we know
what to do, and what to do now,'' Piot said in pointing to areas in
Africa where one in four adults is HIV infected.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers said there was clear and increasing evidence that
condoms for men and women, sex education, public information
campaigns, short courses of drugs to reduce mother-to-child
transmission of HIV, needle exchange programs for injecting drug
users and other measures can prevent HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The female condom, speakers said, was giving women more choice
in protecting themselves against HIV. More than 18 million female
condoms have been sold since 1992. The United Nations has
negotiated a program in which 4 million female condoms were sold in
developing countries last year at a cost of from 50 cents to 90
cents, compared to $2 to $3 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Scores more millions of male condoms have been sold to combat
HIV since the AIDS epidemic was discovered in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Such preventive measures have slowed down HIV infection rates in
developed countries and a few developing countries like Senegal,
Thailand and Uganda, but Piot said more should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it, despite our efforts, that 16,000 people a day are
still getting HIV when the infection is preventable?'' he asked.
``It's a collective failure of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Cardoso, Brazil's first lady, said ``the AIDS epidemic
is a global public health priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments everywhere must be called upon, once and for all,
to stop adopting the self-defeating attitude of downplaying the
problem's urgency and to take on the fight against AIDS as a major
priority for their national agendas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil ranks fourth on the United Nations's list of infected
countries with 580,000 adult carriers of HIV, while AIDS is
Brazil's second-leading cause of death among 20- to 49-year-olds,
Dr. Cardoso said. In Brazil she heads a government-civilian program
to combat poverty and social ostracism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ruth Dreifuss, the Swiss minister of interior, health and social
affairs, said the benefits of ``targeted prevention campaigns far
exceed their supposed negative effects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex education and the promotion of condoms among young people
works and does not lead to an increased number of sexual
partners,'' Ms. Dreifuss said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that drug users have access to free needle exchange
programs in Switzerland and that has drastically reduced the
sharing of needles, a source of HIV transmission. She also said
that 87 percent of the Swiss population supports such measures.
</P>
<P>
   Critics pointed to the U.S. government's lack of financial
support for needle exchange programs that researchers have shown to
be effective in reducing HIV infections. In April, Secretary of
Health and Human Services Donna Shalala endorsed the use of needle
exchanges but declined to help communities with federal money to
run such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the discrepancy between the scientific findings and
Clinton administration policy on needle exchange programs, Dr.
Helene Gayle, who heads the AIDS program at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said: ``We all know that science should be
the basis of our policy. But it's not a perfect world. People in
policy roles juggle a lot of things. Needle exchange is a complex
issue in a complex world.''
</P>
<P>
   Financing for prevention has not kept pace with the epidemic,
and in some cases has actually declined as the number of people
affected by HIV has increased, Dr. Peter Lamptey, who heads an AIDS
program for Family Health International in Research Park Triangle,
N.C., said at a separate meeting on AIDS prevention here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 13,200 scientists, health workers, government
officials and representatives of anti-AIDS groups registered on the
first day, this is the biggest such conference since the first was
held in Atlanta in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people have become infected with HIV since
the last AIDS conference in Vancouver in 1996. About half are under
age 25. &QL;

ITALIAN LEADER TO VISIT IRAN THIS WEEK

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi will make an
official visit to Iran this week, the first by a head of government
from a European Union country since the 1979 revolution here,
Iranian and Italian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi, who is to arrive on Tuesday, is scheduled to meet
President Mohammed Khatami and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani. But there are no plans for Prodi to meet Iran's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi has consulted with President Clinton and European leaders
and will report back to them upon his return, Ricardo Levi, Prodi's
spokesman, said in Rome on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The visit underscores a new willingness by the Europeans to
forge closer ties with Iran in the aftermath of Khatami's election
in May 1997. Khatami has tried to reach out to European and Arab
leaders, and he plans to address the U.N. General Assembly in New
York this fall. He and Clinton are scheduled to speak on the same
day, although in the absence of diplomatic relations, the two
presidents have no plans to meet. &QL;

RUBIN DELIVERING TOUGH MESSAGE TO STRUGGLING ASIAN ECONOMIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Visiting China may pose thorny
political issues for President Clinton. But for Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, who peeled off from the White House delegation Sunday
to visit Asian countries with troubled economies, China could turn
out to be the smoothest part of his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving here Sunday evening, Rubin had to face a fresh volley
of criticism of the United States from Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who accused the American government of plotting
with Wall Street to take over Asia's economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accuse us of practicing cronyism,'' Mahathir said in a
speech at a political gathering here on Saturday. ``The cooperation
between the U.S. government and Wall Street is cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, a relentless critic of the West, drew world attention
last October when he delivered a strident denunciation of George
Soros and the fraternity of global financiers. He blames the
financial crisis on currency traders, who he says played havoc with
the region's currencies. And he says the U.S. government is
standing by while Wall Street buys Asian companies at fire-sale
prices.
</P>
<P>
   For Rubin, a Wall Street executive before he took his job in
Washington, such charges are a painful reminder that the Asian
financial crisis is generating intense frustration among some of
the region's leaders. The message Rubin is expected to deliver in a
meeting with Mahathir on Monday is unlikely to soothe his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has a great deal of work to do,''
said Rubin, in a briefing during his flight from Beijing to Kuala
Lumpur. ``These problems are not going to be solved quickly, but it
is absolutely imperative that we deal with these problems and work
with the countries that are affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's trip began on a positive note, with assurances from
Chinese leaders that they do not plan to devalue their currency,
the yuan. But now he is in southeast Asia, which has already
suffered a wave of crippling devaluations. In addition to Malaysia,
he will travel to Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin declined to discuss specific remedies for Malaysia before
his meetings on Monday. But the Treasury Department generally
favors the International Monetary Fund's economic prescription for
Asia, which calls for tight fiscal and monetary policy, coupled
with a wholesale reform of the banking system and the often-corrupt
relationships between business executives and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend, though, that the cure has actually worsened the
pain in Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. By insisting that
these countries maintain a stable currency, even if it means
raising interest rates, they say the IMF has choked off credit to
businesses. The economies of all three countries contracted in the
first quarter of 1998, and analysts say they are sliding into a
severe recession.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has not asked for the IMF's help, though it has adopted
a reform plan with features like those the fund requires. Like its
neighbors, Malaysia's economy shrank in the first quarter _ a 1.8
percent contraction that was all the more traumatic because it
followed 6.9 percent expansion in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden reversal in fortunes has sparked a remarkable public
debate at the top levels of government. On one side is Mahathir,
who argues that the central bank should lower interest rates to
jump-start the economy. On the other side is Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim, who opposes such a step because he fears it would
erode Malaysia's currency, the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has long been regarded as Mahathir's probable successor,
but political experts here said the dispute had frayed their
relationship. Last week, Mahathir named Daim Zainuddin, another
close adviser, to a new Cabinet post overseeing the economy.
Economic trouble-shooting had been Anwar's brief, and it is unclear
how he will emerge from this shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate over interest rates is really part of a broader
debate over globalism vs. nationalism,'' said one business
executive here who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Anwar still
has faith in the global markets, while Mahathir is playing to
nationalist sentiments.''
</P>
<P>
   As a leading emissary for the global economy, Rubin will have to
wade into this debate, if only for a day. He met briefly with Anwar
on Sunday evening and will hold separate meetings with Anwar and
Mahathir on Monday. Zainuddin will participate in at least one of
the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Malaysia's internal tensions have been aggravated
by the turmoil in nearby Indonesia, where President Suharto was
forced out after economic hardship led to riots and looting. Though
Malaysia's situation is nowhere near as dire as that of Indonesia,
analysts said that Mahathir is deeply concerned about the social
unrest that can stem from deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rubin said he would focus on the issue of a
``social safety net,'' which he said was critical ``so that you can
maintain your public and political support for what needs to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got wrenching changes in countries that are in very
difficult circumstances,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Although not graceful, Klesko is the perfect outfielder
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In all the usual ways, the Braves won the first game
of the second half Sunday. You know the constants by now. Stand-up
starting pitching from Tom Glavine and errorless outfield play by
Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   The sameness of it all was monotonous. Every pitch had a
purpose. Every fly ball had a place to go and have a little fun.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time _ oh, say last Monday _ when equating Klesko
with defense would have been like pairing Dennis Rodman with an
Amish barn-raising. But after 82 games and 0 errors, might it be
time to adjust? Or at least give a little notice to the
leftfielder-in-progress who has made noticeable, if sometimes
reckless, strides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't know if he'll ever be a Gold Glove outfielder,'' said
Glavine, ''but Ryan has done a great job improving out there. He's
far better than the days when a fly ball went out there and
everybody in the stands closed their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been a lot of years (four-plus, actually) working
at getting better. A lot of years of people saying I couldn't play
the position,'' Klesko said. ''They seem to forget it's not my
natural position. It has taken a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   He had spent the preceding four games at his more genetically
compatible station, first base, while Andres Galarraga nursed a bad
back. He enjoyed it immensely, but it took much away from the
ambiance of a Braves game.
</P>
<P>
   With Randall Simon dispatched to first, we were warmed to see
Klesko back at his leftfield outpost Sunday. It had been so bland
out there without him. There was no edge. No tightrope-walking,
bomb-defusing, dark-alley sense of danger. Where's the fun, after
all, in the routine fly ball?
</P>
<P>
   Seems cruel to keep him penned up at first base. All was right
with Sunday's victory by the fourth inning, when Toronto's Shawn
Green hit a slicing drive toward Klesko's quadrant. As is custom,
Klesko seemed momentarily puzzled by the trajectory, his heartbeat
of hesitation lending the usual drama to the moment. Then, he threw
himself in the alleged direction of the ball, covering a surprising
amount of ground in a one-man stampede. Fully extended, full-speed
ahead, Klesko and ball became one.
</P>
<P>
   That freed him to make this proud claim: He was the only man to
catch anything Green hit Sunday. Green was the single outstanding
Blue Jay, with two home runs and a single in the 10-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's is the knack of making it all look as hard as it really
is. He'll run into walls, crash face-first into the sod like a
heavy bomber with one wing on fire, slide after foul balls long
after they have landed in the seats, and generally have a nice time
out there in his own little private pasture.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not Andruw Jones out there. He's not swift and sleek.
He's a big, rumbling type of guy. He's not going to look good doing
it, but the bottom line is that the results are a lot better,''
Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   While there's a chance, we pause now in rare appreciation of the
Braves leftfielder. With a style of defense as refined as a mosh
pit and a swing as subtle as a waterspout, Klesko makes baseball
even more a game of extremes. For the time being, life is quite
good (he's hitting .382 for June).
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep playing hard and eventually I will make an error here
or there,'' he said, lest fly balls to left no longer set off
calliope music in our heads and we begin to expect simple
perfection.
</P>

MEXICO FACES GERMANY IN SECOND ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ They were called the ``Tritanic,'' a
disaster waiting to happen, a ship sure to sink. But somewhere en
route to hitting bottom in Lyon, or Bordeaux, or Saint-Etienne,
maybe all three something extraordinary occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Tricolor,'' Mexico's national soccer team, tossed aside
all the negatives that had burdened it since the start of spring
can't score, can't win, can't play with any of the style and charm
expected south of the border and became this World Cup's version of
the cardiac kids.
</P>
<P>
   A comeback victory over South Korea, followed by astonishing
rallies to draw with Belgium and the Netherlands, has captured the
imagination of the throngs that have gathered in France for these
championships, and it has stirred confidence in the Mexican squad
heading into today's second-round battle with Germany at
Montpellier's Stade de La Mosson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are Columbus' three small ships, about to come into
port,'' said Manuel Lapuente, the once-beleaguered Mexican coach.
``I think we are getting close to our best, but there are no
limits. The sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans have been talking championship since rallying to
beat the Koreans in their opener June 13 in Lyon. It seems a most
unlikely scenario, but each time they find themselves in serious
trouble as when they fell behind, 2-0, to the Belgians and the
Dutch a hero emerges to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it's Luis Hernandez, ``El Matador,'' who scored twice
to beat South Korea, 3-1, then flicked home the decisive goal in
injury time to earn a 2-2 tie with Holland. His striking partner,
Cuauhtemoc Blanco, did the job against Belgium with a stunning
volley to complete the comeback. And Ricardo Pelaez, the aging
forward who comes on when Lapuente goes to a four-attacker
formation, has pitched in with two fine headers, goals that started
the rallies against South Korea and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, clear favorites to advance to a quarterfinal
pairing with Romania or Croatia, promise they won't underestimate
the Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made up a two-goal deficit against Holland,'' Germany
goalkeeper Andreas Koepke said. ``They are a good team, and we will
have to watch them. No team is easy at this stage of the
competition, and we have a difficult game coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   How difficult may be determined by the impact of Ramon Ramirez's
absence from the Mexican lineup. The left winger, with captain
Alberto Garcia Aspe Mexico's most influential player, will sit out
the match, serving a two-game suspension for using abusive language
after a Blanco goal was canceled by an offsides call near the end
of the game with the Netherlands. It was a foolish error Ramirez
already had a first-round yellow card and faced suspension with
another and it could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, seeking its fourth World Cup crown, has twice
eliminated Mexico twice in the previous five tournaments, a 6-0
rout in 1978 and a penalty-kick win in Mexico in the 1986
quarterfinals. The Mexican media has played up the revenge factor,
but Lapuente won't play along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk of controversy and revenge is your business, it's all
part of the pre-match hype,'' he said. ``We're not thinking of
revenge. We just want to go forward. The Dutch and Germans are
among those fighting for the title, and we want to be up there with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch defender Jaap Stam thinks that's conceivable. ``The
Mexicans are true fighters,'' he said. ``Their technique is not
very good, but they compensate for that with their mental approach.
They play from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an element that has been missing from the German game. They
won Group E on the strength of the 2-0 victory over the United
States in their opener, but despite fine work from their striking
tandem Juergen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff, both with two goals
and a defense led by Christian Woerns, they haven't yet looked like
title contenders.
</P>
<P>
   That might mean nothing Germany is notorious for starting slow
and getting stronger as the Cup proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is all or nothing,'' Klinsmann says. ``We are capable
of moving up a gear. ... We can beat any team here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico shares the attitude. The world will learn this afternoon
if the Tri can back it up.

 &HT;    Report calls for government, private companies to do more for
AIDS vaccine
 &HT;    (EDS: Moves on (a) general news and (i) international
categories.)
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The only real cure for AIDS will be a vaccine, most
AIDS researchers agree. But a working vaccine is at least 10 years
away, and the search still moves slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to galvanize vaccine research into an urgent hunt,
the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Sunday released a
blueprint for AIDS vaccine development. The report calls for both
government-funded research organizations and private drug companies
to invest much more time and money in vaccine research, and urges
that existing vaccine candidates be speeded into testing in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a vaccine has any chance of ending a global AIDS
epidemic,'' said Dr. Seth Berkeley, founder and president of the
non-profit IAVI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will put us on the fast track toward accomplishing our
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   IAVI and other vaccine advocacy groups have criticized the
slowness of the vaccine testing pipeline. IAVI's blueprint suggests
that several vaccines should be in testing simultaneously, instead
of sequentially.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint also recommends creating three to six product
development teams of researchers and drug manufacturers, with
representatives of both industrialized and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   IAVI also suggests that vaccines should be tailored to the
various strains of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of the current vaccine research is being done in the
U. S., the AIDS vaccine candidates that have been tested so far are
designed for the HIV strain that is most common in the U. S.
</P>
<P>
   But 90 percent of the 30.6 million people who are HIV-positive
live in developing countries, where other types of the virus are
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paternalism has kept products from being tested in developing
countries,'' Berkeley said.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, President Clinton announced the creation of a
vaccine research institute at the National Institutes of Health,
and declared the goal of having a working vaccine by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   But that's unlikely to happen, say some vaccine experts. While
more than 40 AIDS vaccines have been tested, only one, VaxGen's
AIDSVAX, has been approved for testing in a large number of people.
The first of 5,000 volunteers received an AIDSVAX innoculation last
week in Philadelphia. Researchers estimate it may be two years
before the next vaccine candidate is ready to move into large-scale
trials.
</P>
<P>
   IAVI says this process must be speeded up, even if it means
testing vaccines that may not provide immunity for 100 percent of
recipients. Every test teaches researchers more about the nature of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be afraid of failure,'' said Dr. Jaap
Goutsmit of the Netherlands, a member of IAVI's scientific advisory
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The plan outlined in the IAVI recommendations would cost about
$350 million to $500 million, above what is currently being spent
on vaccine research and development, over the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
   IAVI also announced Sunday that Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and his
wife, Melinda, have contributed $1.5 million through the
billionaire's William H. Gates Foundation.

TAIWAN NERVOUSLY TOASTS CLINTON'S VISIT TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-CHURCH, CHINA-LAMA, CHINA-HILLARY,
CHINA-U.S.) 
(ja) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ As the festivities and pomp of President
Clinton's state visit unfold on the other side of the Taiwan
Strait, the mood here is sullen and profoundly nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry has set up a 24-hour situation room to
follow moment-by-moment developments of Clinton's trip, the
government has impaneled an interagency task force to monitor it,
and thousands of Taiwanese have signed petitions or taken to the
streets to warn the United States not to sacrifice the people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid that Americans will betray us,'' said Lin
Fong-lan, a 48-year-old housewife who was apprehensive enough to
take part in a sit-in Saturday outside the United States'
quasi-embassy in Taipei. ``Americans may think about their own
interests and sacrifice Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements about Taiwan have been hovering over the
Chinese-American summit meeting, for Washington's ties with Taiwan
remain a central obstacle to improved relations between China and
the United States. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and
would like the United States to curtail its unofficial relations
and arms shipments to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials were enormously reassured when Clinton and
President Jiang Zemin of China concluded their statements and news
conference in Beijing without talking about arms sales or raising
other matters affecting Taiwan. At a luncheon Saturday with several
senior officials, there were beaming faces and toasts all around
when word came that the Clinton-Jiang news conference had ended
without any unpleasant surprises about Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved so far,'' David Lee, the deputy foreign
minister and head of the interagency task force monitoring the
Clinton trip, said as he tucked delightedly into the lunch. ``At
least from the public information so far, we haven't heard anything
alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   From an American perspective, Taiwan's anxieties might seem a
bit overwrought, for the Clinton administration keeps repeating
that its Taiwan policies will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's obvious that there will be no change in our
position one way or another on this trip,'' Clinton said Friday of
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for people in Taiwan, biting their lips as they watch
Clinton gallivanting around the mainland with Jiang, the assurances
of continuing American affections have not removed the heartache.
</P>
<P>
   The perception here is that over the last couple of years, the
Clinton administration has been distancing itself from Taiwan,
narrowing its options and pressing it not to cause trouble for
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   All that has been painful for a country whose people brim with
enthusiasm for the United States _ the island's most popular radio
station broadcasts in English and is ostentatiously American, and
people occasionally embarrass American officials by suggesting that
Taiwan would make a great 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been America's star pupil _ we've built democracy and
freedom just as America wanted,'' said Huang Chao-yuan, a physics
professor who heads an academic organization that set up a
demonstration Saturday to warn the United States against any
agreement with China that would hurt Taiwan. ``So why are you
prepared to turn your backs on us?''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying challenge for people here is simply that China is
becoming increasingly powerful in the world today, and so China is
gaining leverage and Taiwan is losing its own, with nearly all
countries now recognizing Beijing over Taipei. That trend is
evident in the pattern of state visits: China is hosting Clinton,
and Taiwan last week had to settle for the president of Sao Tome
and Principe, a tiny African island nation with 105,000
inhabitants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``To be candid, I don't think we have much leverage to prevent
Clinton from doing something about Taiwan, because we're so
dependent on America,'' said Parris Chang, chairman of the defense
committee in Parliament. ``But we will try to use moral persuasion
to shame Clinton so that he does not appease a Communist
dictatorship by sacrificing a democratic country like Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for apprehension in Taiwan is that when Clinton met
Jiang in Washington last fall, the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, described Washington's Taiwan policy in a way that
some people here felt was more formal and restrictive than before.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of that statement, here dubbed the ``three no's,''
was that the United States does not support Taiwan independence,
does not support a two-China policy or a ``one China, one Taiwan''
policy and does not support Taiwan's membership in international
organizations whose members are sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials are exultant that Clinton has not mentioned a
formulation of the ``three no's'' so far during this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, partly because of concerns raised by Taiwan's many
friends in Washington _ Taiwan has a formidable lobbying
organization in the United States _ administration officials have
been falling over themselves lately to reassure Congress that
improved relations with China will not come at the expense of
Taiwan. And indeed, when China conducted missile tests in 1996 in
an effort to intimidate Taiwan, Clinton reacted forcefully by
sending two aircraft carriers to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Taiwan is still the ugly duckling of international
diplomacy, its investors welcome but its leaders grounded. Taiwan's
president, Lee Teng-hui, who holds a Ph.D from Cornell, has been
effectively barred from visiting the United States since he was
granted a visa in 1995 to visit Cornell, enraging China. The United
States also bans top Taiwan Cabinet members from visiting
Washington or most American Cabinet members from visiting Taiwan,
for fear of upsetting relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Thus as people here hear Clinton talk about the need to build a
better relationship with China, they wonder anxiously whether the
tide of history is running against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never easy for a lesser power to confront the fact that
it is a lesser power,'' Michel Oksenberg, a political scientist at
Stanford University, said of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all Taiwan's citizens are ethnically Chinese, but the
island has been ruled by mainland China for only four years in this
century. It was a Japanese colony until the end of World War II in
1945, and then in 1949 it became the refuge of Chiang Kai-shek when
he fled there with his Nationalist troops.
</P>
<P>
   For many years after that, Taiwan was the seat of ``Nationalist
China'' while Beijing was the capital of ``Communist China.'' The
two rival governments insulted each other while each insisting that
it was the legitimate ruler of all China.
</P>
<P>
   One of Taiwan's most ubiquitous slogans used to be ``Recover the
Mainland,'' but now many people feel their own separate identity
and would not want to recover the mainland if they had a chance.
Instead, many simply want an independent country, separate from
China.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Lien Chan emphasized in a nationwide radio show
Saturday that Taiwan is not against better relations between
Washington and Beijing, and that in fact such improved ties may
help moderate China's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want relations between the U.S. and the Chinese Communists
to develop smoothly,'' Lien said. ``But we don't want that process
to hurt our own interests.'' &QL;

government-funded research organizations and private drug companies
to invest much more time and money in vaccine research, and urges
that existing vaccine candidates be speeded into testing in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a vaccine has any chance of ending a global AIDS
epidemic,'' said Dr. Seth Berkeley, founder and president of the
non-profit IAVI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will put us on the fast track toward accomplishing our
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   IAVI and other vaccine advocacy groups have criticized the
slowness of the vaccine testing pipeline. IAVI's blueprint suggests
that several vaccines should be in testing simultaneously, instead
of sequentially.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint also recommends creating three to six product
development teams of researchers and drug manufacturers, with
representatives of both industrialized and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   IAVI also suggests that vaccines should be tailored to the
various strains of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of the current vaccine research is being done in the
U. S., the AIDS vaccine candidates that have been tested so far are
designed for the HIV strain that is most common in the U. S.
</P>
<P>
   But 90 percent of the 30.6 million people who are HIV-positive
live in developing countries, where other types of the virus are
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paternalism has kept products from being tested in developing
countries,'' Berkeley said.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, President Clinton announced the creation of a
vaccine research institute at the National Institutes of Health,
and declared the goal of having a working vaccine by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   But that's unlikely to happen, say some vaccine experts. While
more than 40 AIDS vaccines have been tested, only one, VaxGen's
AIDSVAX, has been approved for testing in a large number of people.
The first of 5,000 volunteers received an AIDSVAX innoculation last
week in Philadelphia. Researchers estimate it may be two years
before the next vaccine candidate is ready to move into large-scale
trials.
</P>
<P>
   IAVI says this process must be speeded up, even if it means
testing vaccines that may not provide immunity for 100 percent of
recipients. Every test teaches researchers more about the nature of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be afraid of failure,'' said Dr. Jaap
Goutsmit of the Netherlands, a member of IAVI's scientific advisory
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The plan outlined in the IAVI recommendations would cost about
$350 million to $500 million, above what is currently being spent
on vaccine research and development, over the next nine years.
</P>
<P>
   IAVI also announced Sunday that Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and his
wife, Melinda, have contributed $1.5 million through the
billionaire's William H. Gates Foundation.

   HOW MALONE DID SO WELL ON AT&AMP;T'S TAKEOVER OF TCI
</P>
<P>
   John Malone, the chairman of Tele-Communications, made a
lucrative deal for himself when he agreed to sell his cable company
to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The class B shares he owns will receive 9.7 percent more a share
in AT&AMP;T stock than TCI's class A shares will get. Malone will also
retain control of Liberty Media, TCI's programming company, and can
sell a handful of key assets to AT&AMP;T. If Liberty is ever sold,
Liberty's shareholders, not AT&AMP;T shareholders, will get the profit.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUSA IS CHANGING THE INDUSTRY
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA's chief executive, James Halpin, came in and saved the
company in 1994 when it was on the brink of collapse. But the
computer retailer faces strong competition from direct marketers
like Dell Computer that take orders on the Internet or over the
phone and offer more megahertz for the money. Now Halpin has agreed
to acquire CompUSA's chief rival, Computer City, from Tandy for
$275 million and has just started selling computers on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   INTEL CHOOSES THE SILENT APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   Intel has decided not to debate the Federal Trade Commission's
antitrust suit in public. One reason for the silence is that the
chip maker believes Microsoft hurt its antitrust case by hiring
lobbyists and issuing sharp denunciations of the government.
</P>
<P>
   HEARST REJOINS PUBLISHERS BUREAU
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines announced that it had rejoined the Publishers
Information Bureau, the trade group that tracks magazines'
advertising pages. The magazine company had resigned from the
bureau to protest its decision to count the ad pages in Conde
Nast's supplement Currency.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTATOR PREFERS THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   James Cramer appears as a commentator on ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' as a guest co-host on CNBC and in print with regular
columns in GQ and The New York Observer; he also has alliances with
online ventures including America Online and Yahoo. But he prefers
the immediacy the Internet gives him as a co-founder and columnist
for the online service TheStreet.com.

   RESEARCHERS WIN THREE PATENTS
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Children's Hospital of Boston won three patents that medical
scientists hope will someday mean that patients in need of a
transplant can grow their own healthy new hearts, kidneys, livers
or other organs.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATION BACKS COMPUTER FILTERS

<P>
   An Oklahoma congressman won preliminary support for legislation
that would require public schools and libraries to use filters on

<P>
   KANDUVAN, Iran _ There is not much evidence of the Islamic
Republic in the caves of Kanduvan.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles southwest of Tabriz, hidden in the side of a deep
valley with only one access route, is an odd honeycomb of caves
that hundreds of people call home.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish-speaking herders who live in the damp dwellings dug
into the steep, strangely shaped cones of porous volcanic rock do
not talk much about politics. In fact, they don't talk much at all
_ at least not to foreigners or Persian-speaking city folk from
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   These cave dwellers are not like their sophisticated
counterparts in the rugged Goreme Valley in the Cappadocia region
of Turkey, one of that country's most popular tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
   The largest caves there have been made into bars and
restaurants, and there is even a 16-room cave-hotel. A Goreme
address is now considered to be healthy, even fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers in Kanduvan have a much tougher life.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is a breathtaking view of the green Sahand
Mountains on the other side of the valley. And most of the cave
dwellers have at least minimal electricity _ tapped from the main
electrical lines below _ and cold running water pumped up from a
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the government paved the road leading into
the village. And a health clinic is an easy donkey ride away.
</P>
<P>
   But most people live in only one room. They can try to expand by
digging deeper, but at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful not to dig into our neighbor's house,''
one villager said. And the walls of a cave that is too big can
crack and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The caves that are not inhabited by people belong to sheep,
goats and roosters. The villagers bake their bread and cook their
meals _ stews mostly _ in outdoor clay ovens.
</P>
<P>
   There are no telephones, although the villagers have formally
petitioned the government to install telephone lines. At least one
cave dweller has a television, but the reception is not very good.
There is no local newspaper, mail delivery, nearby mosque or call
to prayer, and three years seems to be the average extent of
education.
</P>
<P>
   Women cover their heads in colorful scarves, less to be
religiously observant than to keep out the thick dust kicked up
from the crumbling stone.
</P>
<P>
   The only light in the caves comes from one or two bare light
bulbs, tiny windows that also serve as an outlet for smoke and
cracks in the heavy wooden doors, which are three to five feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult time is during the brutally long winters,
when heavy snow and wind come and there is never enough heat. To
try to keep warm, the people use makeshift heaters in which they
burn dried manure, the same fuel they use for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hard, hard life,'' said one woman who had moved to
Tabriz and was back to visit her family. ``I don't plan to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge for the cave dwellers, although not the
highest priority, is bathing. The local authorities shut down the
village's only communal bath several months ago, branding it a
health hazard. So the villagers have rigged up makeshift outdoor
showers. They say they bathe once or twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   Behind wooden doors, open pits swarming with flies serve as
toilets. Every once in a while, the waste is covered with ash,
emptied and dried to make more fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are painted white to brighten the dim spaces. Thin,
brightly colored woven carpets serve as floor coverings and
seating. Dusty, thin mattresses are laid out when it is time to
sleep. Bookshelves and closets have been chiseled into the tufa
stone.
</P>
<P>
   People have lived here since pre-Islamic times _ more than 1,300
years ago _ but Kanduvan is scarcely mentioned in guidebooks on
Iran. Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi tried to avoid drawing attention
to the remnants of Iran's folkloric past, which he believed smacked
of backwardness, preferring to spotlight the symbols of the
2,500-year-old Persian empire instead.
</P>
<P>
   And when revolution and violence gripped Tabriz, the capital of
Azerbaijan Province, in the late 1970s, the cave dwellers of
Kanduvan were largely untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In the home of one family that a foreign guest stayed in, a huge
electric clock with a portrait of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the father of Iran's Islamic revolution, hung on the
wall. But the owner, Hassan, said he knew little of politics.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Iran's reform-minded president, Mohammad Khatami,
was doing, he confused him with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's
conservative spiritual leader. Then he added, ``Whoever brings
security to the country and low prices, we like him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it had never occurred to him to leave Kanduvan. ``When
you are born in a place, your spirit is born there too, and your
spirit wants to stay,'' he said. ``Even if we were not happy here,
where are we supposed to go? How would we survive in a city like
Tehran?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not everyone here is content with the status quo. A few years
ago, Hashem Akbari, 35, who owns a triplex cave, bought a choice
plot of real estate along the road at the base of the hills. He
built an austere five-room, three-story guesthouse and put in a
kitchen on the ground floor to cook stews and kebabs for guests. He
taught himself Persian so he could communicate better.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not know what to charge for the rooms, since he has
not had many customers yet. And since there is a school in
Kanduvan, but no teacher, he has taken to spending the school year
with his wife and three children in an apartment in Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is so difficult here,'' he said. ``We can make money if
more tourists come. But it is no place to live.
</P>
<P>
   But the shopkeeper next door who sells biscuits and locally
bottled Pepsi prefers to keep things just the way they are.
</P>
<P>
   In a tiny shop filled with more flies than customers, he laughed
when an Iranian visitor said that maybe some of the American
tourists who have begun to discover Iran would come and he would
make enough money to build a great restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, don't do that,'' he said in Turkish. ``Don't let that
happen. If I make money, the Islamic Republic would come and take
it away.'' &QL;

SOUTH AFRICA TAKES NOTICE OF MULTI-RACIAL PARTY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ At first they seemed a mismatched
couple promising an unlikely alliance: One is a black politician
who defied South Africa's former white-supremacist government, the
other an Afrikaner regarded as a key figure in that government.
</P>
<P>
   But for months now, the two have been barnstorming the country
pledging to build a multi-racial political party to challenge
President Nelson Mandela's largely black-supported African National
Congress. To the surprise of many political analysts, they are
making headway.
</P>
<P>
   With little more than a year to go before presidential and
parliamentary elections, the new party held its first congress this
weekend, formally electing leaders and adopting a platform. The
black politician, Bantu Holomisa, was voted president of the party,
called the United Democratic Movement. The Afrikaner and former
theoretician of the National Party, Roelf Meyer, declined to run
for the top post and became deputy.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the delegates, Holomisa said he wanted the party
to concentrate on fighting crime and narrowing the gap between rich
and poor. But he quickly made clear that he was not attacking the
rich, most of whom are white and many of whom feel beleaguered by
veiled and not so veiled criticism coming from Mandela's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policies will insure that the enlarging of the economic
cake is done by enriching the poor, not by impoverishing the wealth
creators,'' Holomisa said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a safe South Africa was needed to stop ``white flight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us work together so that we can carry the country forward
to a new future,'' he said. ``We are not each other's enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   The party issued its first policy document, outlining an
anti-crime strategy that included having a referendum on
reinstituting the death penalty, as well as confiscating crime
syndicates' property and using the proceeds to aid victims.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the party was largely dismissed as a curiosity. Many
analysts shrugged off the two leaders as political outcasts trying
vainly to keep their careers alive. But polls show that the group
has gained respectable support for a group barely nine months old.
The ANC, however, remains by far the dominant party, with 54
percent support.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll, by the Markinor polling group, showed the
new party with the support of about 5 percent of the country's
voters. And the support does indeed come from a mixed group,
roughly reflecting the country's racial profile. The poll said its
support was 70 percent black, 16 percent white, 8 percent
``colored,'' or mixed race, and 4 percent Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer had been widely viewed as the man most likely to take over
the largely white-supported National Party after former President
F.W. de Klerk. He is credited with pulling voters from the National
Party, which brought South Africa apartheid and ruled the country
for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, 50, resigned from the National Party abruptly last year
after de Klerk removed him from a key party position. The dismissal
apparently occurred because of pressure from the more conservative
members of the party, who were uneasy with Meyer's talk about the
need to reorganize.
</P>
<P>
   Holomisa, in the meantime, is pulling voters from the ANC, where
he was once seen as a favorite of Mandela. But Holomisa, 43, was
drummed out of the party for insubordination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is a fiery orator who was a major-general in the Transkei,
one of the apartheid-era enclaves carved out for blacks and called
homelands. He took over the government there in a coup in 1987 and
then, in defiance of South Africa pressure, allowed the African
National Congress to operate from there as it fought apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, he started complaining about corruption
among his comrades and revealed that Mandela had accepted
contributions from a casino owner, Sol Kerzner, who has been
accused of bribing homeland officials for licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The new party is not necessarily in for an easy ride. Meyer
could still face questions about his past. During recent hearings
before the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, some
witnesses suggested that he had known about the former government's
chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, financial support continues to be an issue.
Holomisa had barely been elected when he took to the podium to
appeal for contributions from big business.
</P>
<P>
   The party is also asking for government financing and has said
it might consider appealing to the courts if it doesn't get any.
Current legislation provides money only to those parties that have
members in Parliament. It does not take into account new parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting an election without money is difficult,'' Holomisa
said, ``even given the level of commitment of our supporters.''

   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Playing like the ``old, famous Danish''
teams of the past translation: brilliantly Denmark ended Africa's
World Cup hopes Sunday and spoiled a long-anticipated matchup,
stunning Nigeria, 4-1, at the Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Moller and Brian Laudrup scored goals in the first 10
minutes, and the Danes better known these days for their fight and
spirit than for their skills advanced to a quarterfinal Friday
against Brazil in Nantes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why we play like this suddenly is impossible to explain ...
,'' Denmark coach Bo Johansson said. ``Now we play the best team in
the world. We know, so far, we are not the best team in the world,
but we have to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Many figured it would be Nigeria that would be taking on the
Brazilians in what promised to be an attractive, attack-minded
game. But the Danes struck quickly, and goalkeeper Peter Rufai let
down the Super Eagles again and again, killing their chances to get
back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody dreams to be world champion,'' said Bora
Milutinovic, Nigeria's coach. ``To be world champion you need to
have so many things to be best in the world. We go through (to the
second round) like no one in Africa, (but) it's very difficult. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Team lose today. Team win yesterday. This is the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danes, looking more like the superb 1986 team that thrilled
audiences in Mexico, finished things off early. The first strike
came in the second minute, from a pass out of midfield that found
Michael Laudrup, Brian's brother, behind the Nigerian defense. He
squared the ball to Moller, who bent the ball around Rufai and
inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes later, Moller took a blast off a 27-yard free
kick; Rufai stopped it but surrendered a rebound, and Brian Laudrup
raced in to knock it home.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong defense led by Peter Schmeichel, perhaps the
world's top goalkeeper, the Danes owned the result.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles didn't give up, and their attack primarily through
the work of Jay-Jay Okocha put plenty of pressure on Denmark's back
line. Nwankwo Kanu ended up 1-on-1 with Schmeichel in the 16th
minute, but the netminder grabbed the ball off his foot; poor
shooting doomed Nigeria's other chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not that good, so we can't keep the pressure (up)
against a team like Nigeria all the time,'' Johansson said. ``We
know we have to fight very hard also to have victory. Nigeria is a
very good team, and that says much about our performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbe Sand set a World Cup record scoring just 22 seconds after
coming on as a substitute in the 59th minute, a nifty little
sequence from a Michael Laudrup scoop in which he headed the ball
past Taribo West and then fired past Rufai then took advantage of
another Rufai error to help set up Thomas Helveg in the 76th.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria got one back two minutes later, a superb Okocha pass
from midfield leading to a Tijani Babangida strike.

AS CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM GROWS, SO DOES LEGAL HELP FOR WOMEN

<P>
   BEIJING _ From its tiny office just outside the South Gate of
Beijing University, the Center for Women's Laws Studies and Legal
Services, which Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Sunday morning,
operates at the leading edge of China's developing legal system,
tackling a range of controversial issues that affect women.
</P>
<P>
   Their activities include representing the family of a girl who
died after having been raped by her high school principal, as well
as a woman who sued an employer after it had fined her heavily for
having a first child without permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our cases you can see the problems of Chinese women
today,'' the executive director of the center, Guo Jianmei, said in
a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old center, affiliated with the Beijing University
law school, is in many ways an anomaly: an aggressive legal aid
center in a country whose emerging justice system remains riddled
with flaws. An organization run by outspoken women in a country
where discrimination against women is rampant. A nongovernmental
organization in a country where the government ultimately calls the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing some really difficult work against tremendous
odds, since the legal system is still quite weak and they're
representing people who have neither power nor money,'' said
Phyllis Chang, a legal expert with the Ford Foundation in Beijing,
which helps finance the center. ``Given that, I think they've been
surprisingly effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's very existence is evidence of the progress achieved
by China's decade-old effort to reform its legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government is showing increasing interest in legal
aid work and legal aid centers for the poor have sprung up all over
China in the last two years, generally under the Ministry of
Justice. There are currently 180 mostly tiny centers, with about
half of them set up in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   American assistance for the Chinese legal aid system is among
the initiatives announced during Clinton's state visit. So it was
not surprising that the first lady, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and the president's special adviser on the White House's
rule of law initiative, Paul Gewirtz, came here to learn what such
centers can and cannot accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Guo, the center director, says its goal is to use the law to
improve the lot of women in China. But it also seeks to promote the
development of China's emerging legal system, publicizing and
trying to resolve its many remaining flaws and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese legislators have drafted a number of new laws
over the last decade aimed at protecting personal rights, many are
vague or are ignored by often poorly trained judges. The courts,
which are paid by the local government, tend to favor authority.
And court judgments are hard to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 1992 law of the protection of women's rights is quite
comprehensive, but it is not always carried out,'' Guo said. A
sampling of the center's current cases illustrate her point:
</P>
<P>
   _ The center assisted the prosecution of a high school principal
in Chengde who raped a 16-year-old girl, who later died in
childbirth. The principal was found guilty of a lesser charge of
``hooliganism'' and put on probation. The center said the judge
never received all the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   _ The center brought a class action suit against a Beijing
factory on behalf of its workers, rural migrants whom the factory
had not paid in months.
</P>
<P>
   _ The center has been representing women engineers whose
employer forced them to retire earlier than their male colleagues,
even though a national regulation prohibits such discrimination.
Although a judge has found in the women's favor, the company has
refused to give them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the center has taken up the case of Sun Lili, a
former banquet-organizer at a state-owned hotel, who sued her
employer over the huge fine it had imposed when Sun and her husband
had their first child, without the company's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Urban employers are charged with enforcing the national family
planning policies and determine when their employees can give
birth, but Sun and the legal center held that the penalties the
hotel imposed on her for having a child without permission far
exceeded the guidelines in the family planning regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where most citizens still go to great lengths to
avoid controversy, Guo, a lively, articulate lawyer, does not mind
jumping into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the center's staff of young lawyers, law students
and volunteers have won more than half of the cases they have taken
on. Sometimes they win in the courts, but often they appeal to the
press or senior government officials if they feel the courts have
not provided justice for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not only trying to help women,'' said Chang, of the
Ford Foundation, ``but also to move China to a rule of law.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Republicans try to `green up' their image on environmental
issues
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with SIERRACLUB-COX.)
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a ``green'' name, logo and money, Republicans
are trying to recast themselves as protectors of the environment in
this congressional election year.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition of Republican Environmental Advocates, or CREA,
which has the support of Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), stands for
the idea that local and free-market solutions often are better than
Washington rules.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Colorado Attorney Gale A. Norton, a protege of former
Interior Secretary James Watt, and Gingrich ally Grover Norquist,
CREA intends to run issue ads, funded by unlimited contributions
from undisclosed sources, in key congressional districts in which
GOP candidates are being attacked as foes of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The group also is casting an eye on 2000, when Vice President Al
Gore may be the Democratic nominee for president and Gingrich may
be vying to be his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans won't surrender to Al Gore on the environment,''
said Norton, who worked unsuccessfully to open the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge to drilling in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Washington dinner that raised $100,000 for CREA,
Gingrich blasted Gore for ``pandering'' to environmentalists on the
crisis du jour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this is really about on the left. It's the newest
excuse to build a bigger government to run your life,'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   But before CREA takes on Democrats, it has to contend with
Republican detractors who fear that the group's logo featuring
mountains, a stream, the sun and a healthy infusion of cash will
confuse voters and dilute the potency of environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Marks is a Republican Lake County, Ill., commissioner who
also heads REP America, another GOP environmental group. But her
organization believes that under Gingrich's lead, Republicans ``are
on the wrong side of the issue and are looking bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling CREA a ``green scam,'' Marks said, ``They are a Who's
Who of anti-environment Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, also a Republican, is chairman
of the League of Conservation Voters, which grades members of
Congress annually by noting their votes on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voting record of some (CREA) members would indicate that
these people would not show much concern for the environment,''
Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   CREA's list of congressional supporters includes Republican
Reps. Don Young of Alaska and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho, both known
for their often caustic views of environmentalists and
environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth once held a salmon bake to mock environmentalists'
concerns about fish, and Young has called environmentalists his
``enemies'' and ``not Americans.'' Chenoweth and Young each got 6
percent on League of Conservation Voters' scorecard for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Georgia representatives, Rep. Saxby Chambliss and
Sen. Paul Coverdell, received grades of 13 percent and 0,
respectively, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, perhaps predictably, don't like the League's
scorecard or the votes it uses to grade them.
</P>
<P>
   CREA came into being, in part, to counter the League and the
Sierra Club, another long-standing environmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need to change the public misperception that
Republicans don't care about the environment,'' said Italia
Federici, CREA's president.
</P>
<P>
   By handing out ``Teddy Roosevelt'' awards and touting personal
responsibility over heavy-handed government regulation, CREA hopes
to ``green up'' the GOP image without significantly changing the
party's issues on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is not enough for Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a New York
Republican with a strong environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   His name is nowhere to be found on CREA's membership rolls. ``Oh
gosh, no,'' Boehlert said. ``I belong to a respectable
environmental organization.''

 &HT;    Sierra Club's political muscle flexed in close congressional
races
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with GOP-ENVIRONMENT-COX.)
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New political advertisements set to the tune of
``America the Beautiful'' begin playing today in five states around
the country, courtesy of the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   But the ads will not likely conjure images of amber waves of
grain or purple mountains majesty for Sen. Gordon Smith (R-Ore.).
Smith blames the Sierra Club for sinking his first Senate campaign
in Oregon's 1996 special election after the club launched a
blistering advertising assault on his environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They busted my chops pretty good,'' says Smith, who
subsequently was elected to Oregon's other Senate seat later in
1996. ``It's an organization with a warm and fuzzy name that
engages in real brass knuckle tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 106th year, the Sierra Club has become one of the
most aggressive players in the crowded field of political issue
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on its IRS tax exemption and 500,000-strong membership,
the club collects and spends millions each election cycle to elect
pro-environment candidates and oust those whose voting record on
the environment is poor.
</P>
<P>
   Club activists distribute voter guides ranking candidates on the
environment, a pioneering technique later adopted by the Christian
Coalition. Members trained in the tactic of ``bird dogging'' appear
at rallies and heckle candidates over their environmental records.
In the last election, the club's political action committee (PAC)
distributed $372,000 to federal candidates, 94 percent of whom were
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when voters say they are increasingly turned off
by negative campaigning, the Sierra Club remains convinced that
negative advertising works. A radio ad running today in Seattle
will tell voters there that Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.), a candidate
for U.S. Senate, and Rep. Rick White (R-Wash.) voted to make it
``harder to clean up air pollution in Mount Rainier National
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's political activism in 1996 so angered congressional
Republicans that the Senate committee investigating campaign
finance abuses subpoenaed the club for information about potential
abuse of its IRS tax exemption, a line of inquiry that ultimately
went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Sierra club is targeting some $6 million at
congressional races in Washington, Nevada, New Mexico, Wisconsin,
New York and Illinois, mostly on behalf of Democrats. North
Carolina, featuring a close Senate race between Sen. Lauch
Faircloth (R-N.C.) and attorney John Edwards, could join the list,
says Sierra Club President Chuck McGrady, who acknowledges the
club's testy relationship with the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are critical of the Sierra Club because we've been
sharply critical of a large number of Republicans,'' McGrady says.
``It's not a partisan matter though. It's a matter of what the
voting record is of these members. So if they are Republicans or
Democrats, if they've got a voting record which evidences their
desire to gut our environmental laws we're going to be critical and
they are probably not going to be happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sierra Club is trying to reach out more to the GOP.
McGrady, a registered Republican who was elected Sierra Club
president in May, says he doesn't want pro-environment Republicans
to view the club as a ``first cousin of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three rounds of issue advertising that the club
has launched this year, one or two ads have praised Republicans for
their environmental voting records. A 30-second television spot
that aired in Maryland recently, for example, lauded Rep. Connie
Morella (R-Md.) for supporting clean air legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be fair. We're trying to give Republicans
credit for good things and be critical of Republicans when they are
not doing good things,'' says McGrady, former president of
Georgia's Sierra Club chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas governor Mike Hayden, a Republican who chairs the
League of Conservation Voters, says the Sierra Club must use the
symbolism of its new, Republican president to portray a more
bi-partisan face and avoid the perception that it supports only
candidates ``on the far left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that they stay balanced,'' says Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   Political activism and paid, issue advocacy are deeply entwined
at the Sierra Club. Founded in 1892 by environmentalist and thinker
John Muir, who explored the richness of California's Sierra
Mountains, the Sierra Club started as a kind of explorers
fraternity composed of scientists who set about mapping the area
that was to become Yosemite National Park.
</P>
<P>
   As a California-based conservation group, the Sierra Club fought
efforts to dam major western rivers. In 1963 the Johnson
administration proposed damming the Colorado River above and below
the Grand Canyon, and the Sierra Club went on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, it ran four newspaper advertisements, two in the New
York Times, opposing the dams. The day after the ads appeared, the
IRS notified the club that it could no longer guarantee its
tax-exempt 501(c)(3) designation, which allowed members to deduct
their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club officially lost its tax exempt status as a
charity in 1969 and became primarily a 501(c)(4), which doesn't
permit members to deduct contributions but exempts the club's
endowment from taxes. The 501(c)(4) designation also allowed the
club free rein to lobby and wage issue advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, the Sierra Club has sharpened and refined its
issue advocacy. Many special interest groups run generic
advertising that avoids mention of specific candidates. Unlike
those groups, however, the Sierra Club targets most of its issue
advertising to specific congressional districts that feature close
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '70s and early '80s it became clear that it was
all well and good for us to be out there lobbying legislators to do
good things, but the fact was every two years we needed to be out
there supporting our friends and frankly get some changes in some
of the congressional delegations,'' says McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   Money raised and spent on the ads is so-called soft money,
unregulated by federal campaign finance laws and exempt from public
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The ads don't tell voters to vote for or against a particular
candidate, but leave little doubt which one the club prefers.
Earlier this year, the Senate attempted to regulate such
advertising on the grounds that it allowed special interest groups
an unfair advantage. The measure was killed as part of broad
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're complying with the law with the way it is,'' says
McGrady. ``I suspect that the club is strongly supportive of
changes in our campaign finance laws. And if those laws change,
we'd be among the first to try to run different sorts of campaigns
than the ones we are running.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that this year voters aren't as concerned about
national issues, the Sierra Club has tailored its issue advertising
to local environmental concerns in about 18 congressional districts
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Subhed here in bold
</P>
<P>
   A radio ad that played recently in New York blasted Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) for trying to weaken clean air and water laws at
the expense of the Hudson River. An ad targeted against Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell (R-Colo.) cited Denver's worsening smog and air
pollution problems. An ad running in Illinois praised Rep. Lane
Evens (D-Ill.) for protecting agricultural runoff laws that
particularly impact large hog farms common in his district.
</P>
<P>
   The club's new round of advertising take 7 members to task for
recently voting against a Democratic amendment that would have
required separate votes on environmental riders, legislative
provisions affecting the environment attached to larger bills.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club political director Dan Weiss says House Republicans
have sought to use riders to avoid votes affecting the environment.
A vote against the amendment was a vote against environmental
protections, Weiss says, so it was fair game.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Weiss and media consultant Kim Haddow met in a
Washington studio to cut the new spots. Henry Strozier, an actor
and Atlanta native, was hired to read the ad scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Strozier hit a snag when he got to the spot featuring Reps.
Smith and White in Washington. No one in the studio knew if Mount
Rainier was pronounced Rainier like ``rain'' or Rainier like
``deer.'' The wrong pronunciation would alert listeners that the ad
was the work of an outside special interest -- a fatal mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to figure it out later, Strozier read the script both
ways, allowing his deep, gravely voice to flow over the lines like
a Washington trout stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thing of beauty,'' said Haddow. ``I think that was a home
run.''

CLINTON VISIT AND SPEECH DELIGHT WORSHIPERS AT BEIJING CHURCH

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton's visit and short speech to a
crowded Protestant church in Beijing on Sunday morning may not have
converted many Chinese across this nation of 1.2 billion _ his
attendance at the services was not even mentioned on the national
television news Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But it was certainly appreciated by more than 2,000 members of
the Chongwenmen Church, who lined up as early as 6 a.m. to get
seats for the 9:30 service. Many of them emerged from the ceremony
_ complete with Bible readings, hymns, a sermon by one of the
Chinese pastors on ``unity'' and, on Sunday, brief comments by a
visiting American president _ with the hope that Clinton's visit
would somehow advance the cause of Christianity in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coming here today is very encouraging to us,'' said Hu
Guorong, a 33-year-old businessman, who said he became a Christian
two years ago ``by the work of the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Wenxiang, a middle-aged man who has attended this church
for the last eight years, said: ``We expect that this visit will
help spread Christianity in China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and his wife are like brothers and sisters
to us,'' his wife added.
</P>
<P>
   Before they headed home through the narrow alleys surrounding
the steeple-less gray-brick church, a group of excited, curious
worshipers cornered an American reporter, ignoring the scores of
plainclothes policemen who milled, watching and listening, through
the departing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does President Clinton go to church every Sunday?'' they
wanted to know. ``Are all the members of his family Christians?''
``Is he a Baptist or a Methodist?'' (The president is a Baptist,
the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Methodist.)
</P>
<P>
   This church, like virtually all government-approved Protestant
churches, is nondenominational, part of a hybrid ``patriotic''
church founded after the Communists, who are officially atheist,
took control of China in 1949. Like the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, which does not recognize the leadership of the pope,
it is supposed to be independent of foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very moved by the fact that President Clinton is a
Christian,'' said Zhang Shuhuan, a middle-aged woman. ``As far as
we know, many heads of state are not Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   As the comments of many worshipers suggested, Christianity in
China today is at once thriving and constrained, and even many who
attend the approved churches may sometimes feel a bit beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   Since the extreme persecution of religion during the Cultural
Revolution of 1966 to 1976, the Communist government has permitted
the rapid growth of the official Protestant and Roman Catholic
churches. Under the rules, personal worship is free but public
evangelizing, outside church walls, is banned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, outside experts believe the number of Protestants in
China may now surpass 20 million and the number of Catholics total
10 million, including those in legal and illegal churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Chongwenmen Church in east-central Beijing is the largest of
eight officially sanctioned Protestant churches in Beijing, which
together serve tens of thousands of members.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also numerous small, illegal ``house churches'' in
this city, as around the country, where Christians who reject
government controls, often Evangelical Protestants, gather. These
groups, along with Catholics who insist that the pope is their
leader, often face police harassment, fines, or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is said to have pressed the case for more religious
freedom with President Jiang Zemin, but in his comments at the
church on Sunday he was circumspect. He expressed pleasure at the
reported growth in numbers of Christians here and said: ``I believe
our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world
of different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chongwenmen Church this Sunday, like every Sunday, only
800 people, fewer than half those attending, could sit in the main
hall. Hundreds crowded into a side chapel, and another thousand sat
in the basement, watching the services on closed-circuit
television.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of churches around the country is steadily
growing, it has not kept pace with the rise in believers, and
overcrowding is common. The government closely controls the
construction of new facilities, arguing that there are not enough
trained pastors to staff them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope President Clinton will urge our leaders to build more
Christian churches in Beijing,'' said He Jiazhen, a 70-year-old
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 70, about the same age as President Jiang Zemin,'' she
continued. ``I pray all the time, hoping that Jiang Zemin will be
converted,'' she said. ``If everyone in China were Christian, then
China would live in peace.''

   LOS ANGELES _ It's a clash between the stinking rich and the
comfortably wealthy, where the placement of the decimal points
means more than the points-per-game averages, and Michael Jordan's
impact on the future of the collective bargaining agreement will
have everyone holding their collective breaths.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after the NBA lockout rears its Stern-like head
Wednesday, there will be a point when the players making minimum
wage will question a system that rewards a tiny few at the expense
of a bunch of others.
</P>
<P>
   And it is there they'll be hit with a taste of what it's like in
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   _The irony is that Larry Bird will be honored today as the
newest member of basketball's Hall of Fame, two days before the NBA
shuts down, in part, because of haggling over the so-called ``Larry
Bird exception.''...
</P>
<P>
   _BING-Olowokandi!...
</P>
<P>
   _In the NBA, ``potential'' remains the hottest buzzword a player
can have pinned on him. It's not illustrated just in Michael
Olowokandi's situation. Imagine how two second-round picks in '98,
UCLA's Toby Bailey and Arizona's Miles Simon, would have done if
they'd come out for the draft after their team's NCAA title
season....
</P>
<P>
   _It's tough trusting anything Jerry West says when he prefaces
everything with: ``To be candid with you...''...

   We must have sold out to someone by now...
</P>
<P>
   Ah, here it is...(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ABSOLUTELY NOBODY.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning: NO BANK, NO AIRLINE, NO OFFICE SUPPLY DISCOUNT STORE,
NO OUTLET MALL, NO FLOPPY DISC MASS PRODUCER, NO QUALCOMM (whatever
that is), NO DEPARTMENT STORE, AND DEFINITELY NO PHONE COMPANY.

<P>
   And for the record, we just switched our long-distance service
to carrier pigeons....
</P>
<P>
   _It's only a matter of time before the drips at DWP decide they
can't live another day without being Dodger Stadium's new title
sponsor, following the lead of Edison Field in Anaheim....
</P>
<P>
   _Finally, the Dodgers rid themselves of that cancer Mark Cresse
after 24 seasons and started focusing on winning a pennant....
</P>
<P>
   _The Dodger Stadium fans haven't been booing, they're just
saying ``RUUUUUUUUUUUPERT''....

   NEW YORK _ They seemed, at that moment, to be Everycouple, an
embodiment of the aspirations of the audience watching them. They
had endured much, and now, trying to make their way to another
place, they found themselves wandering Ishmael-like, up stairs and
down, as a forbidding green light stung their eyes. It was funny
but touching, too, and even a little suspenseful. Although you knew
what the outcome would be, you still asked yourself if this
venturesome man and woman would finally prevail.
</P>
<P>
   This vignette occurred last Thursday during a preview
performance of Thornton Wilder's ``Skin of Our Teeth'' at the
Delacorte Theater in Central Park, and it captured the spirit of
the 1942 play, a wry paean to the tenacity of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, however, not on the stage but just in front of it,
when an elderly pair of theatergoers decided to make an early
departure between scenes and found their search for an exit turned
into a public performance.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this all felt perfectly appropriate to a comedy that
deliberately blurs the boundaries between actors and spectators.
But it is not a good sign when an unscripted moment becomes the
high point in the production of an elaborately constructed play.
The New York Shakespeare Festival's revival of ``The Skin of Our
Teeth,'' which officially opened Sunday night, does stir your
sympathies on occasion, especially when the actors have to wear
heavy coats and sweaters and pretend it is the Ice Age instead of
sweltering summertime in a big-city park.
</P>
<P>
   But as staged by Irene Lewis, the artistic director of Center
Stage in Baltimore, the production often seems to be scratching its
head, wondering, like that couple, where to go and how to get
there. It has some definite assets, including a snazzy set by John
Conklin and a game, industrious cast led by John Goodman, a fine
actor best known as a star of the sitcom ``Roseanne.'' What it
lacks, all too clearly, is any governing point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder once described himself as a blend of poet and
schoolteacher, and both elements are much in evidence in ``Skin.''
This allegorical fable, which takes one archetypal American family,
the Antrobuses, through the millenniums, does indeed suggest the
work of a passionate professor with a touch of the ham. Based in a
generic suburban home in Excelsior, N.J., the Antrobuses make it
through the Ice Age, a flood (the one that put the animals on the
ark) and an annihilating war.
</P>
<P>
   They get knocked down, but they get up again. Along the way,
Antrobus ( Goodman), whose first name is (yes) Adam, invents the
wheel, the lever and the alphabet; his wife, Eva Antrobus (Frances
Conroy), keeps the fires burning at home with their two children: a
destructive little boy called Henry (John Ortiz), whose original
name was Cain, and a daughter with the refreshingly nonsymbolic
name of Gladys (Brienin Bryant). They also have a maid, Sabina
(Kristen Johnston), who is the Lilith-like temptress to Mrs.
Antrobus' stalwart mother and who slides out of character to
address the audience.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Skin'' first opened in November of 1942, Broadway had
never seen anything like it, at least not from an American
playwright. It wasn't just the anachronistic stew of time periods
that startled, and the mixture of philosophical earnestness with
broad comedy, but also its insistence on tearing down the wall
between audience and performance. This was something Wilder had
experimented with in his earlier ``Our Town'' but took to far
greater lengths here. For a country newly thrust into world war,
the identification with the immortal strugglers onstage assumed a
special poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the succeeding years, the play, which won a Pulitzer Prize,
has turned out to be much less resilient than its characters. What
once seemed clever now feels exceedingly precious, and without the
jolt of novelty, most of the work's history-lesson jokes can be
anticipated long before they reach their punch lines. The
adaptability of humankind may be an eternal theme; the idea,
however, of an eternal triangle in which Man the Inventor needs
both the Nurturing Woman and the Inspirational Sex Goddess is a
little harder to put over these days.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has brought no revitalizing perspective to this material;
often, she seems to have brought no perspective to it at all. When
you arrive at the Delacorte, you're greeted with the hopeful sight
of Conklin's bright cartoon setting, which crosses the domestic
uniformity of Levittown with a sense of cosmic geometry, suggested
by grid-lined trapezoid platforms decorated with spheres,
rectangles and triangles. Yet there's nothing in the performance of
the play to match the sharp sensibility of the set.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the production itself feels bafflingly shapeless and
doesn't even take advantage of the obvious, emotion-tugging rhythms
at which Wilder was so adept. The program identifies the time of
the play as ``the present and the 1940s,'' and there's a pair of
scene-setting, jitterbugging dancers (Michael H. Fielder and Maria
Torres) to establish a period mood. But there has been no attempt,
aside from a few updated theatrical in-jokes in Johnston's speeches
and a bizarre use of sign language in the third act, to create a
dialogue between the two eras. What's worse, there is very little
sense of connection among the individual actors, a feeling
compounded by the erratic amplification of their voices.
</P>
<P>
   The sassy Sabina, who keeps interrupting the play to comment on
its faults, has always been the key to ``Skin.'' The role was first
portrayed (and to some degree shaped) by Tallulah Bankhead, who is
still perceived as owning the part, though Vivien Leigh, Mary
Martin and Elizabeth Ashley all received glowing notices for it.
Johnston, the charming actress from ``Third Rock From the Sun'' on
television, is simply miscast. Despite her curvaceous form and
raspy voice, she registers less as a crafty but hapless vamp than
an overgrown, ever-ingenuous cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman does some appealing comic embroidery on the business of
shifting in and out of character, but mostly he is a surprisingly
tentative presence here, as though he were trying on different
personae to see which the audience might like best. Most of the
supporting cast members seem to be treading water, though Lola
Pashalinski stands out as the understandably exasperated stage
manager of the play within the play.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading actors, only Conroy gives an authoritative and
consistently focused performance, and she brings Mrs. Antrobus into
the 1990's by slyly suggesting acrid undercurrents of frustration
in her homebody character. She also finds an astonishing number of
very funny levels in the speech she delivers at a Darwinian
convention of the species in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, maybe it's a Darwinian effect that Lewis is aiming
for, the idea of throwing a group of actors onto a big stage in an
urban jungle and seeing how they fend for themselves. As a
consequence, this planet comes across as a lonelier and more
isolating place than even Wilder might have imagined.

Anyone for tennis in a Wimbledome?
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Dale Robertson
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ After decades of practice, the BBC
producers have the drill down pat.
</P>
<P>
   First they show the angry, roiling clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Then they cut to one of the players on the court, anxiously
glancing skyward.
</P>
<P>
   The next shot is of stone-faced Alan Mills, Wimbledon's referee,
balefully staring down the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Once sprinkles are visible on the TV screen, the camera returns
to Mills, who is speaking somberly into his walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes a close-up of the players gathering their rackets,
followed by a wide-angle view of the grounds crew scurrying forth
to pull the tarp over the court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, and the one before that, those blokes got more air
time than Pete Sampras. The conditions this summer haven't been
quite as miserable, but that isn't to say it has been balmy and
pleasant, either.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a more maddening experience in all of sports than
watching one tennis match drag on for three days, starting and
stopping and starting and stopping because of the whims of what has
to be the world's most capricious and confoundedly erratic climate,
I'm not aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the defending Wimbledon champion who has developed the
patience of Job here, was supposed to play Thomas Enqvist in
Friday's feature match. They finally got on court late Saturday,
and after three rain stoppages, the match was suspended at 5-all in
the second set after Sampras had taken the first in about four
minutes, slapping six aces in a row past the hapless Enqvist at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Poor precedent for Pete
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for Pete's momentum. He had sagged appreciably
once they returned for the second set. Now they're supposed to
resume play at noon today, almost 72 hours after their originally
scheduled starting time. And more rain, as always, is forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The only match Sampras has dropped at Wimbledon since 1992, his
loss to eventual champion Richard Krajicek in 1996, dragged on over
48 hours. That quarterfinal was memorable for reasons other than
the rare Sampras defeat. When the cover was being pulled on, a
groundsman tripped and became trapped beneath it. His rescue
required removing the just-laid tarp, which, of course, caused the
court to be soaked, necessitating the carry-over into the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Swimbledon, a tournament only a duck, or an umbrella
salesman, could truly love. Rain Britannia! Forget anything Kipling
wrote. The real mantra, if not motto, of Wimbledon is, ``Ladies and
gentlemen, play has been suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   When I passed through English customs, the agent asked me what
my business in her country was. After I said I was a journalist
covering Wimbledon, she smiled a knowing smile and replied in kind:
``Oh, indeed. Cover's on; cover's off. Now they're playing; now
they aren't. Bloody fun, Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the record shows that since 1914, only a dozen days
have been total washouts at Wimbledon, and the only time it has
happened back-to-back in the 20th century was in 1997, requiring
the All England Club to open the gates to the unwashed masses on
the middle Sunday for just the second time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Despite innumerable delays to date, the current tournament is
lurching along at a normal _ for Wimbledon, anyway _ pace, and it
wasn't deemed necessary to let the serfs visit for another
``People's Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Wet grass doesn't cut it
</P>
<P>
   The problem with grass, tennis' most anachronistic surface, is
rain is its ultimate bane. The slightest bit of drizzle makes the
court slippery and, hence, unsafe for the players. That's why Mills
wastes nary a moment in calling for his covers. A temporary staff
of 140 stands ready for the order.
</P>
<P>
   At Roland Garros, on the other hand, the terre battue handles
the moisture well. Some dampness actually improves how the clay
plays. They will play through mists in Paris that routinely shut
down Wimbledon for an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Logically then, if there's one stadium on the face of the earth
that should have a dome, or at least a retractable roof, it's not
the new ones in Houston, Phoenix or Seattle, or the old one in
Toronto. It's Wimbledon's Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Wimbledome.
</P>
<P>
   But this country is just a tad tradition-bound, so it will never
happen. We won't see that roof in our lifetime, nor will our
children in theirs. The tennis will continue to sputter along,
making everyone just a little bit crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Centre Court streaker of two years ago? I'm certain
it was the precipitation that made that poor young lady go starkers
in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   As the All England Club's official statement in response to the
incident said: ``Whilst we do not wish to condone the practice, it
did at least provide some light amusement for our loyal and patient
supporters, who have had a trying time during the recent bad
weather.''

 &HT;    Glavine gets 11th win in Braves' 10-3 win over Toronto
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A team that hasn't laughed for two weeks let out a
giggle Sunday. They dropped a quick seven-spot on the Toronto Blue
Jays, closed out a short 2-3 homestand with a 10-3 runaway and then
the Atlanta Braves set themselves for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened with the Yankees is in the past,'' said catcher
Javy Lopez, his club still smarting from the three losses to New
York last week. ''Now we just have to keep playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Greg Maddux bore the flag Saturday night with a shutout,
Tom Glavine (11-3) walked the point in this one, allowing five hits
in seven innings while driving in three of the first seven runs
himself. Rookie first baseman Randall Simon, freshly arrived from
Richmond, delivered three more RBI while the club mounted a 14-hit
attack, its biggest outburst since the Baltimore series three weeks
ago. The victory gave the Braves two straight after the team had
dropped seven of nine. They had not won consecutive games over a
stretch of the last 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed a couple, that's for sure,'' said manager Bobby Cox.
The club has today off before opening a three-game set in Tampa Bay
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to take momentum for a team,'' said right fielder
Michael Tucker, ''you have to take it from them early.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan precisely. The Braves sent 11 men to the plate in the
first inning and punished Jays starter Chris Carpenter (4-3) for
five runs on six hits, three of them two-out singles coming in a
row. Then in the third, Glavine sent an oppossite-field double
twisting into the left field corner, the team's only extra-bases
hit of the day scoring two men for a 7-0 lead and relieving all
anxiety from the 44,185 who sweated through the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pick-me-up,'' said Cox, ''tyring to get back on the
right track.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Glavine glided to his seventh win in 10 starts. He
yielded a solo home run to Shawn Green in the sixth but dropped his
ERA to 2.71 while joining Maddux as the league's lone 11-game
winners. In the 35 games Maddux and Glavine have started thus far,
the Braves have won 24 times (.686).
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not trying to just let them hit it but you try not to
walk anybody,'' Glavine said of working a run-away. ''My mindset in
a game like today is a whole lot different than it is normally. I'm
not really trying to work the ball on the corners, I'm not changing
speeds a whole lot. I'm just trying to throw fastball on the
inner-half or the outer-half. That's not the way I normally pitch.
But you have to guard against getting complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much time for that. After the Devil Rays comes the
three-game series with the second-place New York Mets, when the
Braves learn who gets to laugh during the All-Star break.

 &HT;    Simon says he aims to stay in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Randall Simon arrived at Turner Field on Sunday,
perhaps half a season later than he and most Braves officials
anticipated. For Simon, however, now could be the best opportunity
for an extended stay in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, a 23-year-old first baseman from Curacao, went 2-for-4
with two runs and three RBIs in Atlanta's 10-3 win over Toronto on
Sunday, his first appearance in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   While it certainly was a good initial impression, Simon is
probably having a tough time forgetting about his record-breaking
performance with Class AAA Richmond on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, a 15-5 win at Charlotte, Simon went 4-for-5 with a
double, three homers and 10 RBIs. He became just the second
Richmond Brave to hit three home runs in a game, joining Miguel
Sosa, who did it in 1985. Simon also broke the club's RBI record,
formerly seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two days, he's had two home runs, about eight hits and 13
RBIs,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``That's not too bad. It
was a boost to have a new face like (Simon) out there today. He's
somebody that everyone likes and he plays with a lot of energy. I
really like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon is one of the organization's top prospects, hitting for
both average and power on all levels of the minor-league system.
After hitting .429 in 13 games with Atlanta in a September call-up
last year, Simon was expected to make the team as a backup to first
baseman Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   That was before outfielder Curtis Pride outplayed Simon in
spring training. After hitting only .254 with two homers and three
RBIs in Grapefruit League play, Simon was headed back to the
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just looking at the overall picture,'' Cox said.
``Curtis could steal a base and play in the outfield. We had
Galarraga at first base, who plays everyday. We had (left fielder)
Ryan Klesko, who could fill in at first. Curtis was more of a fit,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   In 75 games at Richmond this season, Simon hit .254 with 10
homers and 46 RBIs in 287 at-bats. He was promoted to Atlanta after
Pride was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday night. Pride
received 10 stitches in his right index finger, which he split open
slamming a bat against a concrete wall inside a tunnel behind the

   With Galarraga out since Tuesday with an ailing back, and the

   ``(Richmond manager Jeff Cox) pulled me aside last night and

CLINTON CRITICS SAY HE DIDN`T GO FAR ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-CHURCH, CHINA-LAMA, CHINA-HILLARY,
CHINA-TAIWAN) 
(ko) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Clinton administration officials praised the
president for his performance in Beijing, where he spoke out on
human rights in a televised news conference with the Chinese
leader, Clinton's critics said Sunday that he had done only the
minimum required and that his words were largely empty.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, speaking to reporters in Beijing and to
American television audiences at home, called Clinton's exchanges
with President Jiang Zemin of China ``remarkable,''
``extraordinary'' and ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Those judgments were echoed, though with less enthusiasm, by
some Democratic legislators and China scholars. They regard the
real importance of the Beijing meeting as twofold, an opportunity
to normalize high-level visits between the two countries after a
sometimes dangerous break following the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown, as well as a way to enable American and Chinese leaders
to speak more bluntly to a larger Chinese audience about their
differences over political and religious values while they
cooperate on regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics, most of them Republicans, continued to attack
his China policies as wrongheaded and his performance as
perfunctory.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R.-Tenn., said he was glad to see Clinton
speaking out at his news conference on human rights and on the
killings in 1989 of Tiananmen Square protesters. ``He needed to do
that,'' Thompson said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``But it frankly was
the least he could do under the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R.-Calif., spoke in similar terms on
``Face the Nation'' on CBS-TV, saying, ``There's no question we
were all pleased by the news conference, and that was, frankly,
necessary to make up for what otherwise would have been a very,
very bad, worldwide television image'' of Clinton's welcome in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``But notwithstanding rhetorical progress,'' said Cox, who is
leading an investigation into the reported transfer of American
missile-guidance technology to China, ``not much substantively has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic Party critic of the president's China policy, Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of California, said, ``On human rights President
Clinton has said just enough for U.S. domestic consumption and not
enough to produce results for the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the meeting a victory for Jiang, who made few if any
concessions on trade, proliferation or human rights but ``has
accrued all the benefits of standing side by side with the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For the president of the conservative Family Research Council,
Gary Bauer, the meeting's lasting symbol will be Clinton's
honor-guard welcome at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be a haunting image as things unfold in China,''
Bauer said. ``The very cautious handling of human rights in the
wake of the roundup of dissidents makes it look like another kowtow
summit. Even this is modest for an American president, who has an
obligation to put American values front and center.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bette Bao Lord, the Shanghai-born writer who is chairwoman
of Freedom House, a human rights group, said both Clinton and Jiang
``did what they had to do'' for their dual audiences, those
watching in China and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a piece of choreographed theater for domestic
consumption on both sides, to dampen the decibels of criticism,''
said Mrs. Lord, who is on the broadcasting board of governors for
the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton ``said all the right things and touched all the
right bases,'' Mrs. Lord said, ``I would have liked him to do more
of what he does so well, which is to put his heart in it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an element of role reversal, she said, with ``Jiang's
trying to sound like a good old American pol, and Clinton's trying
to look reserved and controlled, the way a foreign devil thinks the
Chinese want to see a foreign statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Washington director of Human Rights Watch, Mike
Jendrzejczyk, the Clinton-Jiang exchange on human rights was
extraordinary. Jendrzejczyk gave ``credit to Clinton for laying out
a specific agenda'' like talking to the Dalai Lama and reviewing
the cases of those sentenced for counterrevolutionary activities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was particularly good at rebutting Jiang and arguing
that real stability in the 21st century would ``require high levels
of freedom,'' Jendrzejczyk said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's words, he added, ``must be matched by results that
go beyond a dialogue or training some judges or lawyers or even a
few individual releases of dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Sigur Center for Asian Studies at George
Washington University, David Shambaugh, said the visit was an
important marker. In the Cold War a strategic partnership with
China was aimed at a common enemy, the Soviet Union. Now, he said,
Clinton and Jiang are trying to avoid an unnecessarily adversarial
relationship, while reaching for a different kind of partnership _
``complicated, messy, hard nosed and realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement at the meeting for the two countries to stop
aiming their nuclear missiles at each other is only symbolic,
especially given that China's strategic rockets are stored without
their liquid fuel or their warheads, meaning that retargeting is
the least time consuming of China's war preparations. But the
symbolism is important nonetheless, Shambaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's symbolic of a nonadversarial relationship, and that's
fundamental to both sides now, to insure that the relationship does
not slide into confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Abramowitz, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, said Clinton had ``handled this exceedingly well,'' even
if his domestic critics were not satisfied. ``The critics seem to
want him to go there and start a war,'' Abramowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   To Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D.-Conn., ``the most important aspect
of the Beijing meeting is that it occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've regularized our relations, and I hope Jiang returns here
next year,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the substantive accomplishments were few, he added,
``it's better to have some good small agreements than one big bad
agreement, made from weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, he said, ``that will mean less to criticize by
the critics and less to defend by us, so both parties can appear
strong.'' &QL;

ANTI-SMOKING GROUP TO FILE COMPLAINT AGAINST INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An anti-smoking organization plans to file a
complaint Monday with the Federal Election Commission accusing the
major tobacco companies of making illegal corporate campaign
contributions by promising to run political advertisements on
behalf of Republican senators.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects are remote that the complaint will have any
effect. It appears primarily to be an effort to generate bad
publicity for the cigarette makers and for Republican politicians
who voted to support them.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, prepared by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
refers to news media accounts of a comment made by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., at a private meeting on June 17. According to the
accounts, McConnell told his Republican colleagues that if they
voted to kill comprehensive tobacco legislation, the cigarette
manufacturers would run television advertisements supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after that meeting, the Senate fell three votes
short of approving a motion to cut off debate on the tobacco bill.
Forty of the 42 votes against ending debate came from Republicans.
The effect of the vote was to scrap the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell is not only a leading opponent of strong anti-smoking
legislation; he is also the chairman of the campaign committee that
raises money for Republican senators' re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely is the connection between a campaign contribution and a
vote on a critical issue so blatantly linked,'' the complaint
states, arguing that the promise to run political advertisements
violates campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was written by Matthew Myers, executive vice
president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. He gave a copy to
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, said that
he could not comment because he had not seen the complaint. &QL;

YUGOSLAVIA WILL FACE A NETHERLANDS TEAM UNITED AT LAST
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-ETIENNE, France _ Five hours ahead of time, the orange crush
of Dutch fans began to gather for last Thursday's World Cup match
with Mexico. They wore orange hats, orange dresses, orange
shoelaces, orange hair, orange sombreros. They carried plastic
orange hammers and plastic orange clogs and plastic orange hands
and even plastic orange Eiffel Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home they are crazy,'' said Rene Gielians, 26, a
quality-control manager for an electronics company in Vroomshoop,
the Netherlands. ``They have orange houses, orange cars, orange
fries, orange mayonnaise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gielians had driven 10 hours to the match with a friend, Willem
Eising, who also considered painting his car the color of a highway
cone. ``But after the World Cup, you have an orange car,'' Eising
said, explaining why he decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Netherlands is consumed by soccer's world
championship, but orange is as much the color of caution as of
celebration. Every four years, the Netherlands brings one of the
deepest, most talented teams to the World Cup, and every four years
it goes home unfulfilled. Inevitably, the team shatters into a
collection of petulant individuals. Failure is routine and
predictable, a sort of clockwork orange.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Buffalo Bills of international soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have the feeling we are going to win, but in the
back of your mind, you think, `No,''' Eising said.
</P>
<P>
   Gielians said: ``This year will be different. I am sure of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This Dutch team is being compared with the squads of 1974 and
1978, which reached the World Cup final. Perhaps, finally, the
Netherlands will shed itself of the backhanded compliment of being
the best team never to win a world championship. The Netherlands
will learn quickly about its chances with a second-round match
against Yugoslavia on Monday in Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the talent to win it all,'' said Steve Sampson,
coach of the Americans, who lost to the Netherlands, 2-0, in a
pre-World Cup exhibition match in February. ``Individually, they
have tremendous skill and strength and power. They have great
talent at every position and great balance. If there is a weakness,
the Dutch tend to beat themselves before anyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope has been resurrected by the return of striker Dennis
Bergkamp, who won the player of the year award in the English
Premier League playing for Arsenal, but who missed the end of the
season and the English F.A. Cup final because of a recalcitrant
hamstring injury. For seven weeks, trainers have worked on his
wheels. He returned tentatively in the scoreless World Cup opener
against Belgium, but shanked a certain goal from 10 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   In the next match, he delivered a brilliant goal, fox-trotting
between two defenders and blasting a shot that opened the
floodgates in a 5-0 victory over South Korea. So humiliating was
the defeat for the losers that Cha Bum Kun was fired as coach of
South Korea before it played its next match.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they keep playing like this, I think they will win the
World Cup,'' Cha said about the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, in a 2-2 draw against Mexico, Bergkamp was
brilliantly ubiquitous. He ranged across midfield to retrieve the
ball and place it in attack. He headed a pass two perfect strides
ahead of his teammate Phillip Cocu for a goal in the fourth minute.
And he threatened to score himself on defense, stealing a pass and
heading the ball just wide of the right post. Still not completely
fit, though, Bergkamp left the game 11 minutes from the end. The
Netherlands seemed to deflate like a balloon, allowing Mexico to
retrieve a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can control the ball at great speed and he has a great work
rate,'' said Sampson, the American coach. ``And he's a great
opportunist in front of the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergkamp is, however, not great at flying. This fear of airplane
travel developed during or shortly after the 1994 World Cup in the
United States. Bergkamp, who is intensely private, does not like to
talk about this phobia. Dutch journalists are not certain of the
origins, either, but they list three possibilities: Bergkamp became
alarmed after a Dutch reporter joked that he had a bomb on a flight
during the 1994 World Cup; he had a scare while playing for Inter
Milan in the Italian League; he feels the grave weight of
fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Bergkamp declined to fly to a World Cup qualifying
match in Turkey, and the Netherlands lost, 1-0. He also missed a
team training camp in the United States. While the Dutch have been
flying around France during the World Cup, Bergkamp has been taking
trains and cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the other forward spot, Patrick Kluivert has seen his career
burn fiercely and then fade like a comet. In 1995, at the age of
18, he scored the decisive goal for Ajax Amsterdam against A.C.
Milan in the European Champions League title game. But he was later
involved in an accident in which the car he was driving killed a
prominent Dutch theater director. Kluivert was fined and sentenced
to community service, and his soccer career has never regained that
early magical promise.
</P>
<P>
   He had a disappointing season at A.C. Milan this year, then was
ejected from the Netherlands' first game in the World Cup after
elbowing the Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens. Kluivert was
suspended for the next two matches, against South Korea and Mexico.
He told a Dutch newspaper that he reacted because Staelens called
him a ``rapist,'' a reference to an investigation of allegations of
a sexual offense in which Kluivert was cleared earlier this year
for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert is eligible to return against Yugoslavia, but Coach
Guus Hiddink said Sunday that he would put Kluivert in a reserve
role and retain the creative partnership of Bergkamp and Cocu. As
always with the Dutch, attitude is a more urgent concern than
personnel. The players are always great; their demeanor is not.
</P>
<P>
   They missed repeated chances to score against Belgium and
relaxed with a 2-0 lead against Mexico, surrendering two goals for
the draw. Four years ago, the Netherlands waited an entire half
before deciding to attack against Brazil, erasing a 2-0 deficit
before losing, 3-2, in the quarterfinals when it could have won
with earlier determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play for 90 minutes, not 60,'' the captain Frank
DeBoer said after the tie with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, there has been no evidence of the internal
squabbles that have wrecked this team in recent years. Midfielder
Edgar Davids was sent home from the 1996 European Championships
after he accused Hiddink of favoritism. The star striker Ruud
Gullit refused to join the team for the 1994 World Cup. When the
Dutch are cooperating on the field and off, they have the
capability to win any tournament. Against Mexico, they made 15
passes in one mesmerizing sequence before Bergkamp flicked the ball
to Cocu for a shot that rang off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new start; we don't talk about the past,'' DeBoer
said. ``We have our noses pointed in the right direction. We know
we can go very far, but we must remain friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands won the 1988 European Championship, but a decade
has passed now since any substantial crown sat on the Dutch head.
There has been nothing to replace the nostalgia for the 1970s, for
Johan Cruyff, the most famous Dutch player of all, and for the
teams that lost to host Germany in the 1974 World Cup final and to
host Argentina in the 1978 final.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the European title in 1988, and I think the World Cup
will be next,'' said Annemiek Kuyer, a 19-year-old medical student
from Maastricht. ``It's time, don't you think?'' &QL;

   LEH, Kashmir _ Only 125 miles east of this Himalayan outpost in
the northernmost corner of India lie the western ramparts of Tibet.
Beyond their snow-capped peaks lie all the travails that a half
century of Chinese Communist rule have brought to 6 million native
Tibetans, to their ancient Buddhist culture, and to the Dalai Lama,
the 63-year-old exiled spiritual leader many Tibetans revere as a
living god.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Dalai Lama, visiting Tibetan refugees here in the
Ladakh region of Kashmir, Sunday was no time for gazing wistfully
toward the land he fled after a popular uprising was put down by
Chinese troops in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was a day for boisterous good humor and, on the Dalai
Lama's part, for happy foretellings of a time, not many years hence
as he tells it, when Tibet will have the self-rule within China
that has been the Dalai Lama's political goal for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his enthusiasm lay more than 2,000 miles to the
east, in Beijing, where President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin
of China held an unprecedented debate about Tibet at a joint news
conference on Saturday. Against some expectations, China allowed
the news conference to be broadcast live, thus providing what was
probably the most candid exchange on Tibet ever heard by a mass
audience in China.
</P>
<P>
   To the Dalai Lama, who has had little to fall back on in nearly
40 years of exile but his ability to use the power of words in
support of Tibet, those televised moments were, he said in an
interview Sunday, one of the best things that ever happened for the
Tibetan cause. They sent signals not only to a watching world, he
said, but more importantly across China, that Tibet is an issue
whose time has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of Chinese, especially intellectuals, opinion formers
and those who are politically conscious, will certainly have taken
notice,'' the 1989 Nobel Peace laureate said, speaking in a torrent
of English honed over years of traveling and lecturing on Tibet in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Through this live show, many, many Chinese will have
gained a better awareness of President Clinton's feelings about
Tibet, and also President Jiang's feelings, and I think that can be
enormously helpful in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Jiang avoided words like ``separatist'' and ``traitor''
that China has used in the past when speaking of the Dalai Lama,
and because he said the ``door to negotiation'' was open if the
Tibetan leader accepts Chinese sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan,
the Dalai Lama said he thought the exchange in Beijing could have a
more immediate political effect, especially on Chinese officials in
Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan leader said he hoped that the Chinese officials
might pause before continuing with some of the worst aspects of
their rule, including a renewed crackdown in recent years in which
hundreds of Buddhist monks and nuns have been forced out of
monasteries, and scores arrested, for political offenses that have
included keeping secret portraits of the Dalai Lama. The crackdown
has sent a new wave of exiles into India and Nepal, joining more
than 100,000 already here.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama said he was enthusiastic about Clinton's role in
raising the Tibet issue publicly, and more forcefully than any
previous American leader on visits to China. In his remarks,
Clinton urged Jiang to ``assume a dialogue with the Dalai Lama in
return for the recognition that Tibet is part of China,'' referred
to the Dalai Lama from his own acquaintance as ``an honest man,''
and said he was sure that Jiang and the Dalai Lama would ``like
each other very much'' if they had a conversation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By endorsing Clinton's actions, the Dalai Lama, symbol of one of
the most enduring of the world's human rights causes, in effect
took the American leader's side in the debate in the United States
over whether it is better to engage China in the hope of changing
it _ Clinton's policy _ or to seek to contain and punish China,
with trade and other sanctions, for its record on Tibet, the 1989
Tiananmen massacre, labor camps and other forms of repression.
</P>
<P>
   Among some exiled Tibetans, especially members of the Tibetan
Youth Congress, an increasingly radical group that has criticized
the Dalai Lama for his insistence on nonviolence and for backing
away from earlier demands for Tibet's independence, the Dalai Lama
is viewed as an accommodationist whose legacy could be a Tibet
frozen forever in an icy Chinese embrace.
</P>
<P>
   But buoyed by enthusiasm over events in Beijing, the Dalai Lama
said Sunday that the mood of openness struck by Clinton and Jiang
was part of a broader movement that had advanced the Tibet cause in
recent years. Among other things, he cited two recent American
films about Tibet, ``Kundun'' and ``Seven Years in Tibet,'' which
he said had brought the issue to a wider audience than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than events outside China, the Dalai Lama
said, was a little-noticed evolution inside China. Chinese
intellectuals, he said, have published a series of articles in
recent months appealing for an end to Chinese heavy-handedness and
a move toward autonomy for Tibet. He said those articles followed a
proposal by Chinese constitutional scholars in 1994 for China to be
reconstituted on federal lines, with ``full autonomy'' for Tibet
and other areas with large populations of non-Han Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, Chinese leaders had moved quietly in the
last 18 months to revive contacts with the exiled Tibetan
leadership that were cut off in 1993, after a dialogue of nearly 15
years that had seen delegations appointed by the Dalai Lama
visiting Beijing and Lhasa. The Dalai Lama said it was those
contacts, mostly through what he called ``private channels'' and
businessmen, but also through some contacts with Chinese officials,
that Jiang referred to when he said on Saturday that China had
``several channels of communication'' with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   In these contacts, the Dalai Lama said, an important change had
taken place, with the Chinese now listening to the case put by the
Dalai Lama's emissaries instead of lecturing them as they had
during the previous period of more formal contacts, authorized when
Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader, was starting his economic
reforms in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent months, it is no longer a question of one side
lecturing and the other side listening,'' the Dalai Lama said.
``They are listening to our criticisms, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tibetan leader said the changes in China were part of the
case for moderation he has made with Tibetan radicals, who staged a
hunger strike in New Delhi this spring that ended with a Tibetan
exile burning himself to death when the Indian police forcibly
removed the hunger-strikers to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them that if you only look at events in Tibet, there is
cause for frustration,'' he said. ``But if you look wide enough,
there is great hope. Today's China, compared to 15, 20 years ago,
is a much changed China compared with the 1960s and 1970s, when, to
be frank, things really looked hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think the Chinese government, or at least some
concerned officials, have begun to realize that they have to find
some way to solve the Tibet problem. For more than 40 years now,
they have been utilizing force to solve the Tibet issue, and it has
not worked. I think they have realized that they will have to find
some other way to solve the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jiang's demands for the Dalai Lama's recognition of Chinese
sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan, the Tibetan leader said he
needed to return to his home-in-exile, in the Indian town of
Dharmsala, 300 miles south of Leh, to consult with senior aides
before giving a formal response. But he noted that under what he
has called his middle-way policy, announced in a speech in France
in 1988, ``I've made it very clear that I'm not seeking
independence for Tibet, I'm seeking genuine autonomy, and this
indirectly recognizes Chinese sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama said Chinese leaders should see him as their best
negotiating partner, one who would not be around forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years' time, I'll be 83, just an old man with a stick,
moving like a sloth bear,'' he said, chuckling. ``While I'm alive,
I am fully committed to autonomy, and I am the person who can
persuade the Tibetan people to accept it. In 10, 20 years' time,
the Dalai Lama will die, and then who can persuade these radicals?
Then, who will be in a position to cool them down? If the Dalai
Lama is not there, the Tibetan issue can go completely out of
control.''

 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seventeen years after AIDS was first recognized
among gay white men in New York and San Francisco, the disease in
this country is becoming largely an epidemic among black people,
quietly devastating families and neighborhoods, yet all but ignored
by leading black institutions.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans make up 13 percent of the U.S. population. But
they now account for about 57 percent of all new infections with
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among people aged
13 to 24, the estimate, based on data collected from 25 states
between January 1994 and June 1997, is even higher: 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the death rate from AIDS is dropping over all, the
disease remains the leading cause of death among black people aged
25 to 44. Dr. David Satcher, the new surgeon general, said, ``I
don't think there is any question that the epidemic in this country
is becoming increasingly an epidemic of color.''
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of AIDS experts gather in Geneva for the 12th World
AIDS Conference, much of the attention is being focused on Africa,
where HIV is so prevalent in some regions that one in four adults
are infected. The situation in the United States is not nearly as
dire; the recent demographic shifts in the domestic epidemic are
due more to a sharp drop in cases among whites than an increase
among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as the racial disparities grow, many worry that
AIDS will become marginalized, just another inner-city problem,
like crime or drugs or graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS services have not kept pace with the demographic changes.
The lack of education about the disease among poor black people is
profound, in large part because few prevention programs have been
tailored to them. One prevailing myth is that Magic Johnson, the
retired basketball star, has been cured. Another is that only gay
men are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a disbelief that African-Americans are at
risk,'' said Lisa Gray, who runs an AIDS education program for
black women who live in public housing here. ``A lot of people
don't know how the virus is transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   While ignorance is fueling the spread of the virus, public
health experts like Satcher complain that the epidemic has been
greeted with deafening silence by civil rights groups and by black
preachers, long an important force in African-American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the black church,'' Satcher said. ``I think the
church has problems with the lifestyle of homosexuality. A real
problem has been getting ministers that are even willing to talk
about it in their pulpits.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few who does is the Rev. Kwabena Rainey Cheeks, the
46-year-old pastor of the Inner Light Unity Fellowship Church here.
AIDS, said Cheeks, who has been HIV-positive for 14 years, ``is
like the pink elephant that nobody wants to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears to be true among civil rights leaders as well. The
nation's two largest largest black civil rights groups, the Urban
League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, will hold their annual conventions this summer; AIDS is on
neither agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outside of our traditional purview,'' said Lee Daniels, a
spokesman for the Urban League. The NAACP, which recently declared
AIDS a public health crisis, already has a health issue on its
conference roster: cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exasperating,'' complained Rep.Louis Stokes, the Ohio
Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus' health
committee. The caucus recently asked the Clinton administration to
declare AIDS a national public health emergency among black people,
a move Stokes said he hoped would rally civil rights leaders.
``But,'' he said, ``this is one that black leadership has shied
away from.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is not only black leaders who are silent. Unlike white
gay men, who are extremely open about AIDS and have raised millions
to create powerful organizations to combat the epidemic, most black
people who are infected tend to keep their diagnosis a secret,
health experts agree. That is due to the disease's twin taboos,
which are especially strong among African-Americans: homosexuality
and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with AIDS you have to deal with all of the
issues, all of the -isms of our community,'' said Cheeks. ``You
can't touch AIDS and not deal with homophobia, drug abuse,
homelessness. It touches all of the things that people don't want
to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Those perceptions, however, can be misleading. Among black
women, who represent 56 percent of the total AIDS cases among
females, heterosexual sex has surpassed injection drug use as the
most common route of transmission. Many have no idea they are at
risk; often, they do not find out they are HIV-positive until they
become pregnant, when testing is routine.
</P>
<P>
   They are women like Renee, a statuesque 22-year-old who insisted
on being identified only by her middle name. She lives with her
5-year-old son on the top floor of a pretty brick building; the
apartment marks her first step out of poverty. A high school
dropout, she attends school to learn carpentry and obtain her
equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, Renee visited a public health clinic,
complaining of a yeast infection. A blood test revealed HIV. ``This
was the last thing on my mind,'' she said. ``I know that I should
have used protection, because you can't just look at somebody and
know they're not positive. But I just thought, `Not me.'''
</P>
<P>
   And they are women like Tanya, an office worker who lives in a
middle-class suburb in Prince Georges County, Md. She was tested
for HIV in 1994 when, at age 27, she became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was my partner bisexual?'' she asked, speaking on condition
that only her first name be used. ``Was he a drug user? I don't
know because I don't know who infected me.''
</P>
<P>
   She guards her privacy. ``My boyfriend knows, my mother knows,
one or two close friends know,'' she said. ``It's not that I'm
ashamed; it's that the stigma against HIV and AIDS is so real.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand this stigma, and why it harms black people, one
need only travel a few short miles from official Washington, across
the Potomac River to the lively but tattered Anacostia
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Here, about two blocks apart, are two HIV clinics intended to
serve black residents. One is an outpost of the Whitman-Walker
Clinic, the city's largest AIDS service organization.
Whitman-Walker was founded by gays for gays; about five years ago,
it opened this satellite, calling it the Max Robinson Center, after
the black newscaster who died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Patients have been slow to come for HIV testing and medical
care. The reasons are varied: Many blacks have a deep-seated _ and,
some experts would say, justified _ mistrust of doctors, a legacy
of the notorious Tuskegee experiments on black men with syphilis.
Poverty is also at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't pay your rent, you can't put food on your table
and you don't know how you are going to buy clothes when it's time
for school,'' said Barbara Chinn, the center's executive director,
``why do you need to know about another problem that you can't do
anything about?''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a third reason, Ms. Chinn acknowledged:
Whitman-Walker is so closely associated with AIDS that some people
don't want to be seen there. The unassuming clinic two blocks away,
tellingly, is called Family &AMP; Medical Counseling Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to create an environment where clients feel comfortable
coming in,'' said Angela Fulwood, the clinic's director of social
services. That is why Renee, the 22-year-old, came here instead of
the local hospital, D.C. General. ``Everything there was labeled,''
she said, ``and I didn't want anyone seeing me.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of hush-hush attitude, experts say, contributes to the
high death rates from AIDS among African-Americans. When black
people delay treatment, they forego the benefits of new drugs, such
as protease inhibitors, which do the most good when taken early in
the course of infection and which have been credited with reducing
deaths among white gay men, said Dr. Eric Goosby, who directs the
Federal Office of HIV/AIDS Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his federal job, Goosby sees patients one day a
week at D.C. General. All are African-American. ``I tend to see
late-stage disease,'' he said. ``It's a situation where you have
somebody you went to junior high school with who is the
receptionist at the clinic. Or one of the nurses knows their
sister. Or their mother works in the labor and delivery suite. All
of this, I have seen at D.C. General.''
</P>
<P>
   The public impression of African-Americans with HIV does not
include people like Renee or Tanya. Rather, it is that of what
might be called the original AIDS epidemic in black people, the one
that began in places like the dilapidated city park at the corner
of Division and Foote in the southeast section of Washington,
across town from the city's glittering monuments.
</P>
<P>
   At this park, there are no tourists, only drug addicts; this is
an ``open-air market,'' for heroin. The ground is littered with
syringes, broken bottles of cheap wine and crushed fast-food
containers. The methadone maintenance clinic is down the block.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday at noon, an unmarked mobile home pulled up
alongside the park. The van is the roving headquarters of the D.C.
Needle Exchange Program, one of 120 such programs in the nation and
the only one in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   As the AIDS epidemic rages among African-Americans, fueled in
part by the sharing of dirty needles, the Clinton administration
recently announced it will not pay for needle exchange programs
because they might send mixed messages about drug use to children.
The decision disappointed the government's top scientists,
including Satcher, who say that needle exchange can reduce the
spread of HIV and does not encourage drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It is a policy that Stokes describes as ``mean-spirited.'' Yet
Congress is trying to pass a law that would make the financing ban
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the van, run by the Whitman-Walker Clinic on behalf of
the city, does not open until 1 p.m., dozens of people line up at
noon, their pockets overflowing with used syringes. A heavy-set man
in a red, blue and yellow jacket is roaming about, mumbling under
his breath: ``Puff Daddy. Puff Daddy. Puff Daddy.'' Jamal Spurlock,
the van's HIV counselor, explains: The man is selling heroin. Puff
Daddy is his brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock, a burly 46-year-old in blue jeans and a striped Oxford
cloth shirt, tries to persuade the exchange participants to be
tested. He performs the tests, using a new oral method. Last year,
220 people were tested; Spurlock estimates that between 20 and 30
percent were HIV positive. Many of the addicts, he says, share
dirty needles in spite of the exchange; others trade drugs for sex.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Raymond, who will give only his first name. This
is his first time using the needle exchange; he stumbles onto the
van, barely able to keep his head up and his eyes open. When
Raymond agrees to be tested, Spurlock ushers him to the back of the
van, shuts a curtain and begins running through his usual
questions: Have you placed yourself in any risky situations? Any
unprotected sex? Sharing needles? Ever exchanged drugs for sex?
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's head bobs and weaves; his brow beads with sweat. ``I'm
starting back to a reckless lifestyle,'' he confesses. He has been
sharing needles, he says, and he doesn't use condoms. He would like
to quit using heroin, but at 50, he feels he is too old to change.
``Sometimes,'' he said sadly, ``it just seems so hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing and counseling people like Raymond is extremely
important for the health of the entire community, AIDS experts say.
HIV is spread through sexual networks; as the cases of Renee and
Tanya demonstrate, the epidemic is now ensnaring people far removed
from the heroin trade. If Raymond can be persuaded to adopt safer
sex practices, countless other infections might be prevented, said
Dr. Ronald Stall, associate professor of epidemiology at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``By stopping those infections,'' Stall said, ``you are really
keeping all those snowballs from going down the hill and causing an
avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of snowballs have already gone down the hill in black
America. One reason, Satcher said, is that the big AIDS
organizations, groups with their roots in the gay community, still
receive the lion's share of AIDS money because they are more
sophisticated at writing grants. Small grass-roots organizations,
which may be more effective at reaching minorities, have trouble
surviving; in Washington, three have folded during the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to correct this, the Centers for Disease Control,
which gives $253 million a year to state and local governments for
HIV prevention, has for four years been bypassing its own rules to
give directly to groups that focus on minorities. This year, $18
million was awarded; three quarters of the recipients gear their
programs to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But, the surgeon general said, ``Don't hear me as defending what
we are doing as adequate. I think we have got to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gray is trying to do better. She is the co-founder of a
tiny group called Friends for Friends, which got its start three
years ago handing out condoms in Washington subway stations. A
stocky 33-year-old black woman, she was a retail manager for a
local music chain when several friends and family members became
infected with HIV. So she went to the Red Cross for training as a
prevention counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Gray's group won a grant from the disease control
centers to teach black women who live in public housing how to
prevent HIV. The grant is for $50,000; that is more than twice
Friends for Friends' annual budget. The idea is to train the women
to hold seminars, so that they can educate friends and neighbors.
Ms. Gray calls this ``infecting people with information.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, on a recent Friday morning, she has come to Capitol East
Dwellings. Five women, aged 22 to 51, are seated in metal chairs
around a folding table in the recreation center, a downtrodden
brick building with peeling paint and chipped tile floors. It is
the third weekly session of a five-week course.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-written posters are taped to the walls, bearing unfamiliar
words: immunodeficiency, pneumocystic carinii pneumonia,
seropositive. On a table behind Ms. Gray are condoms, wooden
penises, for teaching the women how to put the condoms on, and a
television, for viewing a video that will teach the delicate art of
``safe sex negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Each woman here knows at least one person infected with HIV. The
oldest, Catherine Smith, a modest 51-year-old in a peach pantsuit,
says she came to learn what to tell her children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest, Nureeah Brown, a 22-year-old with two children,
ages 6 and 3, said the death of her daughter's father troubled her.
``It was said he passed from AIDS,'' she said, although no one is
really sure.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week, she said, she cooked dinner for a young man
she knows. He took his shoes off and began to get a little
friendly. ``He was like, `What you be doing on Friday?(FM) '' Ms.
Brown said. ``I said, `I'm glad you asked. And then I went and got
my little pamphlet'' _ a Friends for Friends brochure with a condom
tucked inside and the saying, ''No Glove, No Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray, upon hearing this, is clearly pleased. But neither
she, nor anyone else, knows if the Friends for Friends program will
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that educating people about safe approaches to sex is
very helpful,'' Satcher says. But few programs have been studied
enough to be proven effective.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, as part of Clinton's plan to eliminate
racial disparities in disease by the year 2010, the government has
proposed spending $400 million on model community programs. Part of
the money would be set aside for AIDS, although Satcher
acknowledged that it may be too optimistic to think the epidemic's
racial disparities can be eliminated in just 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long-term proposition,'' the surgeon general said.
``There is no immediate fix.''

RANGERS FACE FREE-AGENCY SEASON FILLED WITH DOUBTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the entry draft over and the free-agency season
about to begin, General Manager Neil Smith presides over a Rangers
roster filled with deficiencies and doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his top three centers, the spine of any team. First is
Wayne Gretzky, a superstar gradually and gracefully fading into his
20th and possibly final season in the National Hockey League. The
second is another veteran, Pat LaFontaine, whose recovery from yet
another career-threatening concussion is uncertain. The third is an
unproven rookie junior, Manny Malhotra, who Smith says might play a
regular role at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   Behind center, the big concern is Brian Leetch, the captain and
star defenseman, who will try to improve upon a poor season as he
heads into what may be his walkaway year _ the last of his contract
before unrestricted free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, goalie Mike Richter will be an unrestricted free
agent on Wednesday to sell his services to the any team.
Technically, the expansion Nashville team drafted him on Friday,
but once Richter signs with another team, that would give the
Predators only the right to compensation in next summer's entry
draft.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with the captain Mark Messier last summer,
Richter and the Rangers say they would like to make a deal. As with
Messier and others in this category, money will always talk and
free agents will often walk.
</P>
<P>
   John Muckler, who took over as coach late last season, said that
the Rangers cannot win with the roster they had at the end of last
season, when they missed the playoffs and squandered all of that
ticket revenue for Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler also said he did not see much immediate help from the
farm system, built by Smith, who could get active in the free-agent
market. But Smith has hinted that he might not make a big bid for a
top talent, the way he did last summer with his unsuccessful effort
to sign Colorado's Joe Sakic to a three-year $21 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   So how will Muckler get the players he needs? It was interesting
to watch the coach and the general manager at the draft table on
Saturday afternoon on the floor of Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Before Smith chose Malhotra with the seventh pick over all, he
was on the phone with Colorado General Manager Pierre Lacroix,
discussing a possible trade. Muckler, anyone could clearly see, was
up from his chair, speaking forcefully. Asked afterward what
Muckler was talking about, Smith brusquely replied that he had no
idea and that Muckler was not responsible for the selection.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler has recent experience as a successful general manager,
and his communication with Smith could be an important factor in
the rebuilding of the Blue Shirts.
</P>
<P>
   With Craig MacTavish, Charlie Huddy and Keith Acton, Muckler has
a staff of assistants loyal to him. Among general managers in the
sport, Smith holds seniority, beginning his 10th season. But after
building the Stanley Cup champions of 1994, the Rangers have
experienced four seasons of decline and drift. How many more will
the current corporate ownership accept?
</P>
<P>
   Smith isn't the only local boss with a full summer agenda. Lou
Lamoriello of the Devils could lose center Doug Gilmour to
unrestricted free agency the same way Smith could lose Richter.
</P>
<P>
   But Lamoriello's franchise has a strong farm system and more
depth at all positions. His problems will come in Group 2, the
restricted category of free agency where players signing offer
sheets from other teams can be retained through matching bids.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to accept draft choices as compensation.
Until last summer, this category saw little action. That changed
with Sakic, Sergei Fedorov and Chris Gratton. Among this year's
Group 2 palyers, Lamoriello could lose defenseman Scott Niedermayer
and centers Bobby Holik and Peter Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello is a tough and shrewd bargainer who sometimes gets
good players to sign for less than market value. If he can do it
with these three, the league should cast in bronze the Lou
Lamoriello Trophy and award it to him for negotiating brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Islanders, so much is unclear. Mike Milbury has
survived as general manager, but it remains to be seen how much his
influence has been reduced in contract matters. With Zigmund
Palffy, Trevor Linden and Kenny Jonsson enjoying the leverage of
restricted free agency, the new ownership must settle with them
before it can sell many more season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another version of the uniform is not enough to draw a
crowd. As for coaching, Milbury has that title, too, but he still
seeks a strong associate for a major role. Ted Nolan, out of work
for a year, turned down the job, then hinted this past weekend that
he might want it after all. But he never formally approached
Milbury to apply.
</P>
<P>
   When Nolan coached Buffalo and Muckler was the general manager,
both helped to build a good team. But they lost their jobs in a
bitter, franchise-wide civil war over power and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, both men were visible last weekend on the shore
of Lake Erie, trying to improve their situations with rival
franchises based in the opposite corner of the Empire State. On the
opposing islands of Manhattan and Long, theirs would be a rivalry
worth watching. &QL;

HEARST MAGAZINES REJOINS PUBLISHERS' AD GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines announced last week that it had rejoined the
Publishers Information Bureau, the influential trade group that
tracks magazines' advertising pages.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine company is a unit of Hearst Corp., which publishes
Cosmopolitan and Esquire. Hearst Magazines resigned from the bureau
last month to protest the bureau's decision to count the ad pages
in Conde Nast's recent supplement, Currency, a personal finance
magazine that was sent along with the company's 15 other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's withdrawal was considered significant by the industry
because it involved an important publishing company breaking ranks
and because it seemed to add fuel to a longtime rivalry between
Hearst and Conde Nast Publications, which is owned by Advance
Publications Inc. and publishes Vogue, Glamour and GQ, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Hearst pullout, the bureau's council voted
unanimously last week to approve a new format for reporting figures
on magazine ad dollars and ad pages that are collected by
Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU NV. In addition to the
customary overall magazine totals, the new reporting structure will
also identify ad pages and dollars that appeared in scheduled
issues of a magazine, unscheduled issues and supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also asked K. Robert Brink, a Hearst executive vice
president, who had resigned his post as chairman of the bureau's
council, to resume his service through the remainder of his term,
which ends in October. A Hearst spokesman said Friday that Brink
had accepted. &QL;

 &HT;    AIDS conference opens with myriad of emotion

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The 12th World AIDS Conference _ the largest symposium
to deal with the deadly disease _ opened Sunday both bouyed with
optimism and shrouded with despair.
</P>
<P>
   About 13,000 researchers, activists, community leaders and media
are in Switzerland this week to hear scientists present thousands
of scientific papers ranging in topic from drug therapies to
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Despite much progress against AIDS, ``there is news so
devastating that few in this room could have predicted or imagined
it a decade ago,'' Dr. Peter Piot, head of the United Nations AIDS
program, told delegates at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
   His organization estimates 12 million people around the world
have already died of AIDS, and 31 million are alive but infected.
Each day, 16,000 people catch the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rather than dwell on disappointments, the leaders of the
conference who spoke Sunday encouraged continued hopefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for us to embrace a new realism and a new
urgency in our efforts,'' Piot said. Researchers have been warning
that the prevalent feeling at this year's conference would be far
less optimistic than at the last one, in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, exceptionally good results from drugs called
protease inhibitors had persuaded many that they were winning the
battle against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and people with AIDS still sing the drugs' praises,
but less jubilantly since they were linked to several debilitating
side effects, including kidney stones, high cholesterol levels and
a bizarre redistribution of body fat called ``buffalo hump'' in
which fat collects on the back and shoulders or midsection.
</P>
<P>
   Also, reports that some people are increasingly returning to
risky sexual practices, such as condomless sex, are worrying HIV
prevention experts.
</P>
<P>
   Conference leaders obviously are pushing to brighten the tinge
of depression.
</P>
<P>
   Piot focused heavily on recent triumphs, including stablizing
HIV infection rates in many countries, new prevention methods such
as the female condom and recent research that definitively shows
administering anti-HIV drugs during pregnancy can sharply reduce
the number of HIV-positive babies born to HIV-positive women.
</P>
<P>
   Piot summed it up by saying, The biggest AIDS gap of all is the
gap between what we know we can do today, and what we are actually
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme cost of combination drug therapy, considered the
best option for people with HIV, is a continuing sore spot among
activists who point out that the $10,000 to $15,000 annual price
tag for a single patient equals the yearly budget of some hospitals
in poor countries.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billions of dollars and a bold high-tech vision are fueling AT&AMP;T
Corp.'s plan to buy Tele-Communications Inc. The merger, announced
last week, is the latest in a rising wave of corporate deals
sweeping up telecommunications, cable television and media
companies as these industries become increasingly dependent on the
digital technology of computing.
</P>
<P>
   The business logic behind the trend is that companies now face a
once-in-a-corporate-lifetime choice of getting in early to become
leaders in the new markets of the information age or being
relegated to also-ran status. Earlier this month, two major media
companies _ Walt Disney Co. and the NBC unit of General Electric
Co. _ applied that logic in making significant investments in
popular sites on the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of these deals make sense, or make money anytime
soon, will depend largely on the economic behavior of people like
Charles Vandagriff of Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Vandagriff, his wife and two daughters are the kind of well-off,
technologically fluent family earmarked first by phone, media and
computer companies in their consumer marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, AT&AMP;T wants families like the Vandagriffs to turn to the
company for one-stop shopping for not only all of their telephone
and cable television services but new information services as well.
And AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI, the nation's second-largest cable
television company, is seen as a big step toward realizing AT&AMP;T's
vision of becoming an all-in-one digital delivery system.
</P>
<P>
   Vandagriff, 49, is a furniture designer, and his wife, Kathy
Sinsheimer, is a psychotherapist. Their household has three
personal computers, four phone lines, a cellular phone and two
pagers.
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 million such wired families in America, typically
with incomes of $70,000 or more, at least one PC and often more
than telephone line, according to Yankee Group, a research firm.
``No new technology or technology marketing plan will succeed if it
doesn't succeed first with families like that one,'' observed
Howard Anderson, Yankee Group's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring TCI's cable-television system, AT&AMP;T gets a faster
network for sending telephone, video and Internet services directly
into consumers' homes, including 1.3 million TCI customers in the
San Francisco area like the Vandagriffs. It was this vision of a
phone-entertainment-Internet supercarrier that AT&AMP;T chairman
Michael Armstrong and TCI chairman John Malone were extolling
Wednesday when they announced their $31.8 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Vandagriff remains skeptical. ``I'm sure these companies are
trying to think ahead, but it's not clear to me what they are going
to try to sell us really,'' he said. ``I have so many services now
_ Internet, cable, phone, cellular and pagers _ that I can't
imagine I want any more. I'll wait for the future to arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and media companies do not believe they have
the luxury of waiting. The rapid advances of technology, they say,
are forcing them to act now. The main engine is the spread of
digital technology that enables text, sound and video all to be
expressed and distributed in the form of the elemental building
blocks of computing, the electronic 1's and 0's called bits (short
for binary digits).
</P>
<P>
   Though all forms of information can be reduced to bits, text
requires the fewest bits, while sound and video consume many more.
One letter in a word can be rendered in eight bits, while a few
seconds of movie-style video may require millions of bits. Most of
the new services companies hope to market eventually _ including
video phones and movies on demand _ are expected to be multimedia
offerings that require high-speed connections into homes.
</P>
<P>
   So today, companies are puzzling over both how to carry more
bits into homes and how to package those bits into new
entertainment, information or shopping services that people may
actually want. In simple terms, telecommunications companies can be
thought of as the pipes and media companies as the programmers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be costly and time-consuming to upgrade the existing
bit-delivery mechanisms. Phone lines are skinny pipes, but they are
two-way networks that can both send and receive data; cable systems
offer fat pipes, but must be converted from one-way to two-way
systems. It will, for example, take AT&AMP;T nearly five years and $9
billion to upgrade the entire TCI network, estimates the Yankee
Group.
</P>
<P>
   As with most new technologies, businesses will be able to pay
for high-speed Internet service first, before it becomes
commonplace in homes as costs come down.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts predict the impact will be sweeping. Nicholas
Negroponte, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Media Laboratory, insists that for all the attention the Internet
has received, the power of the technology is still not understood.
``The Internet is wildly underestimated,'' Negroponte said. ``It
will grow to be the enabling technology of all media, TV, radio,
magazines and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Internet enthusiast, Negroponte advises many of the
nation's leading media and telecommunications companies. What gives
his counsel added weight, though, are the recent trends in
household computer and Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1998, the share of American households with personal
computers reached 42 percent, up from 31 percent in 1995, according
to Odyssey L.P., a research firm in San Francisco. Over the same
three-year span, the percentage of households online has increased
to 23 percent from 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, the Internet was a geek network,'' noted Kate
Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a technology
research firm. ``Now, the Internet equals consumer network,
something that is increasingly part of day-to-day life.''

</P>
<P>
   As more people go online, the Internet attracts more
advertisers, increasing the potential for electronic commerce. For
example, online purchases of airline tickets, hotel rooms and other
travel services tripled last year to $654 million, Forrester
estimates. By 2001, it projects online travel sales of $7.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   With new-media startups beginning to attract large audiences to
their sites on the Internet's World Wide Web, the established media
companies are taking notice, starting to move beyond experiments to
make sizable investments. Two weeks ago, for example, Disney
announced that it would buy 43 percent of the Infoseek Corporation,
an online directory service, in a complex deal worth about $900
million.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular properties online, including the Yahoo
directory service and America Online Inc., are likely takeover
candidates, industry executives say. Indeed, AT&AMP;T did talk to
America Online recently, though the overture was rebuffed. The
Internet media business is expected to follow the pattern of cable
television, where entrepreneurs created CNN, ESPN and MTV and were
later bought out by Time Warner Inc., Disney and Viacom Inc.,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable that you will see increased concentration in
the new-media field as it matures, just as you did in every other
media business in history,'' said Mike Slade, chief executive of
Starwave Corp., the Web developer that built Disney's ESPN and ABC
News sites.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, people will look back on the recent telecommunications
and media deals as either shrewd or premature, depending on how
quickly the anticipated new business develops. History, both recent
and more distant, suggests some caution is in order.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, Malone of TCI declared that as early as 1994
his company would install digital compression technology enabling
customers to receive as many as 500 channels on their televisions
and many of the interactive shopping and information services that
people are today saying will be delivered via a supercharged
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, television was declared the engine of the so-called
information highway. ``Television will never be the same,'' Malone
said. ``Our ability to deliver program services is limited only by
our imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a slightly different avenue of technology, Malone may
be proved correct, though his timetable was overly optimistic. Over
the years, the technologies that have truly transformed the way
people live required some time to spread.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it took 70 years from the first consumer sale of a
telephone in 1876 to the year when half of the nation's households
had phones, in 1946, according to a study by Technologic Partners,
a research firm in New York. It took the automobile 29 years, from
1895 to 1924, to reach half of American families, while it took the
television only 8 years, from 1946 to 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you keep some technology history in mind, you are
setting yourself up for disillusionment,'' said Richard Shaffer, a
principal of Technologic Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer's own guess is that it will be 5 to 10 years before most
Americans will find that communications or media offerings have
changed markedly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts expect that combinations like AT&AMP;T-TCI
will focus on consolidated marketing of existing services. Such
telecommunications supercarriers want to offer local and
long-distance phone and cellular service, cable TV and Internet
access _ all on one bill with a price discount for buying all these
services from one company.
</P>
<P>
   Now that is an innovation that intrigues Vandagriff in Oakland.
``If they could simplify all this, put it on one understandable
monthly bill and then offer me a discount of 20 percent or so, I'd
say, `OK, you've got my attention,' '' he said. &QL;

DON'T READ TOO MUCH INTO LIVE BROADCAST, CRITICS SAY  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While applauding President Clinton's remarks on
human rights, critics of his trip to China cautioned Sunday against
reading too much into Chinese President Jiang Zemin's decision to
allow their discussion to be broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's criticism of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, which
prompted Jiang to defend the crackdown on pro-democracy activists,
was characterized as one of the few positive developments of the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two leaders struck agreements on the targeting of
nuclear missiles and the faltering Asian economy, no deals were
made on reducing Chinese trade barriers or enhancing human rights
or religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much has substantively changed,'' said Rep. Christopher
Cox, R-Calif., chairman of a House committee investigating the
sales of U.S. satellite and other high-tech equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was able to deliver some message,'' Rep.
Christopher Smith, R- N.J., said on CNN's Late Edition. ``I'm happy
for that, but we should be very, very careful not to gush and do
the victory lap prior to seeing some real and substantial deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders have held live news conferences in the
past, they have never permitted uncensored debates with a foreign
leader. The Saturday session featured Clinton and Jiang offering
their views on such sensitive subjects as the Tiananmen crackdown,
the detention of dissidents and the exiled Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mon., who is traveling with Clinton, called
the televised news conference a ``turning point'' in U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision by President Jiang to televise that press
conference nationwide is an indication to me that he, too, knows
the future for China is going to be more political freedoms and
more political expression,'' Baucus said. ``The genie is out of the
bottle with that press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council dismissed the event as
``one flower'' in a long winter. ``One of the problems we've got
with our overall relationship with China is that we are unduly
affected by a symbolic moment like this,'' the conservative
Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a one-dimensional policy with China. Trade has been
everything, not an element of it, it's been everything,'' Bauer
told CNN. ``First we sacrificed human rights to it. And I think
we've seen in recent months that even national security was
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to allegations that U.S. technology transfers
approved by Clinton may have helped the Chinese improve missile
guidance systems. The firm that benefited from the waivers is owned
by a major Democratic Party donor.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lee, a leading pro-democracy activist and head of Hong
Kong's Democratic Party, expressed surprise over Jiang's decision
to broadcast the news conference in China, but sees it as an
indication the Chinese president faces no immediate threat from
within his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he believed that there would be any problem, I'm sure
wouldn't have allowed it,'' Lee said. ``So I think he must think
that he is in a pretty good position to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it was astonishing to see Clinton and Jiang in a
virtual debate on human rights, Tibet and religious freedoms, Lee
said he ``would be truly happy if these sensitive issues could be
freely debated by ordinary Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   Past attempts to discuss such sensitive issues have provoked
indignant assertions by Chinese leaders that the U.S. was
interfering in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of Chinese dissidents, Wei Jingsheng, said was
``delighted'' with Clinton's admonition to Jiang, although he
believed that Clinton could have pressed harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I don't think that it is enough,'' said Wei, who
lives in New York after being expelled from his homeland.

DANES DEFLATE SPIRITED NIGERIANS, 4-1
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Artistry has its limits, in soccer as elsewhere, and
Nigeria discovered Sunday night that the outrageous talent of its
players could not make up for an equally outrageous lack of
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria crashed out of the World Cup, losing by 4-1 to Denmark
in a second-round match. A goal down after three minutes, two goals
down after 12, the Nigerians never recovered their poise and often
found themselves dribbling at great speed, but in circles.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone had a soft spot for the Nigerians. Their
extraordinary victory in the 1996 Olympics, clinched with victories
over Brazil and Argentina; their sometimes dazzling touches and
their sheer goofy unpredictability encouraged the dream that skill
alone can carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   As the sole-surviving representatives of Africa, Nigeria also
carried with it the hope that a poor continent could produce a
world-beating team built on sheer talent despite Africa's lack of
resources.
</P>
<P>
   But a player's individual magic, as even the Brazilians know
well, is worth little or nothing if not grafted onto a team's
collective discipline. For all of Jay-Jay Okocha's dreamlike
dribbling, for all the finesse of George Finidi, the Nigerians were
essentially fragile, and Sunday they came apart. The Danes, who
face Brazil in a quarterfinal match next Friday, were a revelation.
Precise, mobile and ruthless in their finishing, they often found
themselves in acres of space as Nigeria's team spirit visibly
evaporated. The score could easily have been still harsher.
</P>
<P>
   Only three minutes had gone, when Michael Laudrup, who plays for
Ajax Amsterdam and has played 101 games for Denmark's national
team, laid the ball square to his fellow striker Peter Moeller. The
Nigerian defense opened up before Moeller as if inviting him to
shoot, and Moeller obliged, driving a splendid left-footed shot
into the left-hand corner of the goal from 18 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   It was Moeller again, nine minutes later, who stepped up to
shoot after a free kick was awarded just outside the Nigerian
penalty area. The shot was again fierce, but almost straight at the
Nigerian goalkeeper Peter Rufai. Any world-class goalkeeper would
have caught the ball or punched it clear.
</P>
<P>
   Rufai was of two minds as to which solution to adopt. The
result: The ball bounced away from him straight into the path of
Brian Laudrup, the younger of the two brothers, who joyfully
slotted the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, in the Danish goal, the towering figure of
Peter Schmeichel loomed. Widely regarded as the best goalkeeper in
the world, Schmeichel, who plays for England's Manchester United,
commanded the penalty area, making Nigeria's repeated long, high
crosses look utterly futile.
</P>
<P>
   On an evening when everything went right for the Danes, Coach Bo
Johanssen made an inspired decision in the 60th minute. He sent on
Ebbe Sand for the tiring Michael Laudrup and within 22 seconds Sand
scored _ the fastest goal by a substitute in the history of the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The game was over. Several Nigerian players stopped running.
This was always a team that wore its heart on its sleeve, and the
heart _ so joyous, so miraculous at times _ had simply stopped
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Danish midfielder Thomas Helveg, who had a great game scored in
the 76th minute, blasting the ball into the roof of the net from
four yards after Rufai had fumbled again. Tijani Babangida's scored
a consolation goal in the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot to learn,'' Okocha said. ``We simply
lacked discipline.'' His coach, Bora Milutinovic, who trained the
American team in 1994, said his squad needed to work harder. But
that job, it seemed, would not be his. ``I don't even know where
I'll be tomorrow morning,'' Milutinovic said after the match.
</P>
<P>
   Johanssen, the Danish coach, knows exactly where he will be,
trying to preserve the Danish magic that stirred here Sunday night.
``You never know why everything comes together like this,'' he
said. ``Now we have to play the best team in the world, Brazil. All
I can say is we will give them a hard game.''

 &HT;    Braves Notebook
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the space of two at-bats, Tom Glavine generated
enough offense to personally beat Toronto Sunday. Then he threw
down the gauntlet to Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   With a one-run single in the first and a two-run double in the
third, Glavine recorded the first three-RBI game of his career, the
final two runs giving the Braves a 7-0 lead that pretty much closed
the book on this one. The day gave Braves pitchers a combined .188
average and 16 RBI this season, an RBI coming every 10.1 at-bats.
That is beyond respectable, considering that Andruw Jones, who
generally hits in front of the pitchers, generates an RBI ever 6.5
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has had a three-RBI game in the playoffs (Game 7 vs. St.
Louis of the 1996 NLCS) but this was his first in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we all work hard on around here, so that when
the opportunity arises, hopefully we can do something about it,''
said Glavine, who leads Braves pitchers in RBI (5) and doubles (3).
''Not that you always will but you don't want to go up there
feeling like you're an automatic out. That was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as much fun as Maddux is having. After setting out to finish
with a high batting average than ERA, Maddux is hitting .302
(13-for-43), far and away the class of the pitching staff. Glavine,
for one, is not impressed and is not about to concede the pitchers'
batting title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm coming after him,'' he stated afterwards. ''I'm not laying
down. It's kind of like a golf handicap. I've spotted him his lead
and now I'm going to go after him. I don't know if I'm going to
catch him in average (.182) but I'm going to catch him in hits
(6).''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Maddux, ''He's got a long way to go, baby, a long way to
go.''

TEACHER FAILURE RATES HIGH IN STATES THAT BEGIN TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sampling of states with teacher certification tests shows
their failure rates are typically in the 20 to 35 percent range,
compared to Massachusetts' 44 percent, but most states say their
failure rates were higher when the testing began.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher testing specialists in several states said new exams
tend to elicit high failure rates, and that pass rates almost
always improve over time as students and teacher educators programs
become more familiar with the exams.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, which many in education consider to have one of
the nation's toughest teacher certification exams, more than 30
percent of first-time test-takers routinely fail, according to
state officials, and 15 percent fail on a second try. Officials
from Connecticut and Delaware, which routinely has a 33 percent
failure rate, said their failure rates were higher when they began
testing teachers in the 1980s, although exact figures were not
available.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, results for the state's newer tests in specific
subject areas varied from 47 percent failing the journalism test,
to 19 percent failing biology and 21 percent failing secondary
English in 1996-97. Sixteen percent of 14,000 prospective teachers
failed the exam on teaching technique, a test Massachusetts does
not offer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has had a teacher-certification test since 1986 and has
raised its passing standard every two years, said Fisher, as
candidates are trained more closely and become more familiar with
the exams. Nevertheless, 20 percent failed the last year's reading
exam, 18 percent failed English language skills, 22 percent failed
the essay portion and 45 percent failed math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want the best people. But if they can't pass, then they
should find another occupation,'' said Thomas Fisher, Florida's
director of testing. ``These tests are to protect the public
welfare from incompetents in the classroom. That is what it boils
down to.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 44 states that test teachers use exams created by
the Educational Testing Service Inc. While the tests are nearly
identical in each state, passing scores vary among states by as
much as eight or 10 points, according to ETS data. Educators say
state goals can vary: Higher passing scores ensure a narrower pool
of highly qualified teachers; lower cut-off scores create a broader
pool of low-scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts uses a National Evaluation Systems, Inc. test,
like eight other states, but NES officials in Amherst were
repeatedly unavailable for comment this week. It was unclear how
the Massachusetts passing score set by the Board of Education
compares to that in other NES states.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci and state legislators this
week expressed outrage at the the high failure rate here. Some 44
percent of teachers failed based on the Board of Education's
passing standard; 59 percent failed based on the stricter standard
recommended by 300 educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you who won't be a great teacher, the idiots who
took that test and flunked so miserably,'' said House Speaker
Thomas Finneran, a Democrat from Boston, in a breakfast speech
Thursday before the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. ``It's an
indictment of Massachusetts and an indictment of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Hambleton, a professor of education and psychology at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst and a nationally known
expert in teacher testing, said that based on his experience with
other states, Massachusetts teacher candidates do not appear to be
any more or less prepared to teach than typical candidates
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that most other states have adopted passing scores
lower than what was initially recommended by their education
panels, as the Massachusetts Board of Education here did this week.
</P>
<P>
   He invited Cellucci and others criticizing student teachers to
take the test themselves.

CLINTON, IN FINAL CHINA SPEECH, CALLS FOR DEFENSE OF PERSONAL
FREEDOM
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: will be topped with Monday morning speech at Beijing
University.) 
(See also: CHINA-CHURCH, CHINA-LAMA, CHINA-HILLARY, CHINA-TAIWAN,
CHINA-U.S.) 
(fb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton on Monday proclaimed personal
freedom the ``mandate of the 21st century'' in a broad defense of
human and economic liberty at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   In his last public appearance in the Chinese capital, the
president said that the United States does not seek to impose its
vision of society on China or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are convinced that certain rights are universal,'' the
president said in remarks prepared for delivery and released by the
White House in advance of the speech. ``I believe that everywhere,
people aspire to be treated with dignity, to give voice to their
opinions, to choose their own leaders, to associate with whom they
wish, to worship how, when and where they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have called Monday's speech the
rhetorical centerpiece of Clinton's nine-day visit to China, a
philosophical discourse addressed directly to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to several hundred students and faculty in a freshly
painted auditorium at China's premier university, Clinton sought to
broaden his audience from the Chinese leadership, with whom he held
talks over the weekend, to a new generation that will shape the
future of the most populous nation on earth.
</P>
<P>
   He said that liberty was not a luxury to be enjoyed only by
wealthy nations, but a necessary element of human and economic
development. Acknowledging China's centuries-old fear of internal
disintegration, he said that all societies crave stability.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, personal freedom strengthens a nation's security,
rather than undermining it, as the Communist government has long
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the global information age, freedom is a powerful engine of
progress,'' Clinton said. ``China's greatest source of strength
resides in the minds and hearts of its citizens. It is profoundly
in your interest _ and the world's _ that those minds be free to
reach the fullness of their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed the rapid economic growth that has swept across
China in the past decade, as the government has loosed controls on
private entrepreneurship and begun to close down its inefficient
state-owned enterprises. He said that growing incomes brought more
options to the Chinese people _ foreign travel, access to cable
television and the Internet, new career opportunities, a higher
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic security is an essential element of freedom,''
Clinton said. ``In China, the extraordinary strides you have taken
in nurturing that liberty and spreading freedom from want will be a
source of strength for your people in the 21st century. But true
freedom must mean more than economic opportunity. In America, we
believe that freedom itself is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing University speech offered a coda to a remarkable
series of weekend discussions with Jiang Zemin, the president of
China, and other top government leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, Clinton and Jiang continued their dialogue at
a private three-hour dinner, exploring in greater depth the growth
of the United States-China relationship and the possible paths of
China's future.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was the last meeting of the two presidents on
Clinton's five-city visit to China, which has seen a significant
step forward both in relations between the two nations and between
their leaders. Aides who attended called the evening ``very casual
and very lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday began with a service at Beijing's largest Protestant
church and ended with the private dinner attended by the
Presidents' wives and a handful of top advisers. The day also
included an afternoon of touristic diversions to the Forbidden City
and the Great Wall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The dinner, in a ceremonial house in the lakeside Zhongnanhai
compound for Beijing's government elite, included discussion of the
Asian financial crisis, dvelopment of an independent judiciary in
China and American movies. Jiang recalled enjoying ``Gone with the
Wind'' several years ago in Shanghai, according to a United States
official who attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went way beyond what people thought were the
possibilities of having this kind of discussion,'' Madeleine
Albright, the secretary of state, said of the two days of meetings
between the two presidents. ``We have moved the relationship into a
qualitatively and quantitatively different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and other American officials were still clearly elated
by the press conference Saturday in which Clinton and Jiang engaged
in an animated debate on subjects that for years were not the
subject of public discussion _ religious freedom, Tibet and the
role of the individual and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press conference was a truly remarkable event and one that
is going to have long-term repercussions _ positive ones,''
Albright said in a session with reporters at the Diaoyutai state
guest compound at Diaoyutai. But in a reminder that not everything
has changed in China, American security officials had posted a
notice on the wall of the room where Albright spoke reading, ``The
walls have ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and two other senior American officials _ Samuel R.
Berger, the national security adviser, and James Sasser, the
ambassador to China _ said Monday that 600 million Chinese had seen
the news conference, carried live on China Central Television, the
government's national network.
</P>
<P>
   But that number seemed a significant exaggeration, given that
there are an estimated 300 million television sets in China and
there was no advance notice that the midday Saturday news
conference would be carried live. It was difficult to find Chinese
who had seen the news conference live, and state television
rebroadcast only selected portions of it over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the Clintons attended services at Chongwenmen
Church, the largest Protestant church in Beijing with nearly 3,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation presented Clinton with a bilingual Bible and
invited him to speak to the overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith
in China,'' Clinton said in remarks that lasted less than five
minutes. ``I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with
people across the world with different backgrounds and races and
creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Added the President, ``I believe Chinese and Americans are
brothers and sisters as children of God. We come here in that
spirit today.''
</P>
<P>
   The church service was briefly disrupted by a woman who rushed
to the front of the room in an apparent attempt to speak to the
president. The woman, who later gave her name as Chen Anbi, was
hustled out of the church by security agents. She said outside, ``I
just wanted to see him,'' referring to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said later that she was ``very emotional'' and only
wanted to thank him for attending the service.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, spent the afternoon
touring the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. Authorities cleared
the Forbidden City for the Clintons, only the third time they have
done so, American officials said. The previous times were for a
tour by President Richard Nixon and for the making of the film
``The Last Emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the wall ``quite unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to imagine that it was done so long ago. They've
even had bricks here for 400 and some odd years,'' the president
said.

SORENSTAM SIZZLES TO WIN BY FOUR STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. _ Annika Sorenstam, the premier player in women's
golf, was so busy picking up pine needles at the first green Sunday
that she joked she would need a vacuum cleaner for the final round
of the ShopRite LPGA Classic. She drew a laugh from the gallery,
then proved for the rest of the round that a few pine needles would
be the only obstacles she shied away from.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam sizzled again on the Bay Course of the Seaview
Marriott Resort, shooting her second consecutive six-under-par 65
and capturing the ShopRite event by four shots over Juli Inkster
with a total of 17-under 196.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive victory for Sorenstam, whose game
has apparently returned to the standard that helped her capture the
U.S. Women's Open two years in a row before she missed the cut last
year. This year's Open begins Thursday at the Blackwolf Run Golf
Resort in Kohler, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with my game now that my putting has come
around,'' Sorenstam said. ``I'm very pleased the way I'm playing
going into the Open next week. I was playing well going into the
Open last year, but I put too much pressure on myself. I learned a
lot from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam mastered the Donald Ross-designed course, a links-type
layout that requires intelligent managing. Players raved about the
way Sorenstam played, especially Inkster, who shot 67 playing with
Sorenstam in the last group of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just doesn't make any mistakes,'' Inkster said. ``She's
always in the fairway, hits the greens and makes the putts. She is
the best player in the world, and I needed to play a perfect round
to beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Sorenstam registered 18 birdies and just a
single bogey in the tournament, on the 12th hole on Saturday when
she three-putted. She started the day with a two-shot lead over
Inkster, who bogeyed the second hole. But three consecutive birdies
by Inkster, starting at the fourth hole, brought her within one
shot, as Sorenstam managed just one birdie after seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam birdied the eighth with a 15-footer to go 13 under and
widen the gap to two shots again, but Inkster responded with a
birdie on the ninth to close the gap to one again.
</P>
<P>
   It was the closest Inkster could come, however, because
Sorenstam finished with birdies in the last four holes while
Inkster managed just one more birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Kane shot 66 and finished third with a total of 203 on the
6,024-yard course. Lisa Walters (68) was next at 205, followed by
Dina Ammaccapane (67), who finished at 206.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Webb of Australia broke the course record Sunday morning
with seven-under 64 with plenty of help from the first hole-in-one
of her career. It came with a 6-iron at the par-3 seventh, which
played 169 yards Sunday instead of the usual 182.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, 23, has nine victories, including two this season. She won
four tournaments in her rookie season in 1996 to become the rookie
with the most victories behind Nancy Lopez, who won nine
tournaments, including a record-setting five in a row, in her first
full season on the LPGA tour in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's course record, played in a slight wind Sunday morning,
included six birdies and two bogeys besides her hole-in-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the bad bounces the first two days turned into good
bounces today,'' Webb said. ``I got the breaks at the right time,
but I also hit some good shots. Putting is my main concern going
into the Open next week, but hopefully it will come around by
Thursday.''

ANALYSIS: AMERICAN PUBLIC NOT LIKELY TO BUY WHITE HOUSE PITCH ON
SINO-AMERICA RELATIONS   

</HEADLINE>
 ANALYSIS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ After two days of high-level talks with Chinese
leaders, the Clinton administration is confident that when it comes
to Sino-America relations the glass is at least half full.
</P>
<P>
   But as President Clinton and his official party move on Monday
to Shanghai for the trade and economics part of the trip, they are
equally aware that for critics of his China policy back home the
glass remains no better than half empty.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton began his nine-day journey through the world's
most populous nation last week, U.S. Ambassador James Sasser,
predicted the visit ``will indicate that relations between the
United States and China have normalized.''
</P>
<P>
   That may now be true in the White House's mind _ and there will
be a decent public relations effort to sell the high points of the
journey _ but it is likely to take years for that view to settle in
with the American public.
</P>
<P>
   The administration takes the line that improvement in relations
with China will be gradual, and that a dramatic governmental change
or collapse of the present regime, such as occurred in the Soviet
Union, is unlikely. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; And while gradualism may be a tough sell back home, where
polling indicates a significant animosity toward China, the White
House contends the summit meetings Saturday and Sunday with
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji proved Clinton's
determined effort at dialogue was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engagement with the Chinese can advance America's interests
and its values,'' said Clinton's national security adviser Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Some of the best moments of the summit, in the view of the
Clinton administration, were atmospheric _ how things were handled
more than the substance of what was agreed or even said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who specialized in
totalitarian regimes as an academic, was struck by Jiang's demeanor
in the news conference with Clinton that was broadcast live
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it had some dynamics of a debate and a real
engagement instead of ... one person says his piece and the other
one says his piece,'' Albright said Sunday. ``I thought in that
regard it was quite remarkable.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Berger, for all his exuberance after the Clinton-Jiang joint
appearance, also conceded some limits to warming Washington-Beijing
ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not forming an alliance with China,'' Berger said. His
statement came in the context of how other Asian allies of the
United States _ including some Washington has sworn to protect with
nuclear weapons if necessary _ should view the chummier
Sino-American relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that an improving relationship with China is not
directed against any of them, but that stability in China and
bringing China into the global and regional regime is to their
advantage,'' Berger said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; So in the United States and Far East, the Clinton
administration must still convince doubters of the correctness and
viability of the White House approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told President Jiang Zemin, as their talks opened
Saturday: ``I know that I speak for the vast majority of the
American people when I say that this effort to improve and
strengthen our relationship is welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true in the sense that it's better than a dangerous
deterioration of relations, but recent polling in the United
States, of which the White House is keenly aware, shows a great
deal of ambivalence, and some animosity, toward China.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in early June about Clinton's handling of relations
with China, a sample for ABC News found 40 percent approve and 39
percent disapprove. On the respondents' impression of China, 34
percent said it was favorable and 52 percent said it was
unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent said China was not a threat to the U.S.
national security, 38 percent said it was.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey pointed to a specific wariness on the part of the
American people. A sampling for the Stimson Center, an arms control
group, found that China was the nation seen as posing the greatest
nuclear threat to the United States, ranking only behind terrorist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   That view is one reason the administration pressed so hard for
the symbolic detargeting agreement reached Saturday, in which the
United States and China said they would not point intercontinental
nuclear missiles at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Several experienced China observers, including former U.S.
Ambassador James Lilley, said the best way to judge the success of
the Clinton-Jiang meetings would be what they accomplished on the
India-Pakistan nuclear standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of specific joint actions that Washington and Beijing
are prepared to take in light of the troubling South Asian
developments is not likely to be taken as a good sign. Although
China's participation in the global debate after the nuclear tests
this spring is a step forward, Beijing is still a bit standoffish.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that China believes she gains by being there (in
the debate) but is the one least willing to be drawn into group
initiatives'' said Bruce Larkin, a political scientist at the
University of California at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is aware of the sometimes halting progress that will be
part of any dealings with China.
</P>
<P>
   In his toast to Sino-American relations at the state dinner
Saturday, Clinton called for a commitment from both sides ``to keep
moving forward, turning small steps into giant strides for our
people, our nations and the world.
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't resist an old Chinese proverb: ``Be not afraid
of going slowly, be only afraid of standing still.''

PRIMARY LOSS HAS HOUSE CLASS OF '94 WONDERING: IS THE REVOLUTION
OVER?

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``We figured we were untouchable,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla., speaking recently of the cockiness of the
``revolutionaries'' _ the House Republican freshmen of 1994 _ and
the political flameout last month of one of its tyros, Nebraska
Rep. Jon Christensen.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, an insurance agent and political nobody four years
ago, caught the tide of the party's ``Contract With America'' and
swept into the House as a rising star in the GOP majority that made
Newt Gingrich the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Just as suddenly, this aggressive, self-assured campaigner, one
of the most conservative of the freshman standouts, impulsively
leapt into the Nebraska primary for governor this year. He lost,
firmly rebuffed for his brashness by fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can determine more about a person from how he loses than
from how he wins,'' said a chastened Christensen, having lost his
congressional seat by finishing last in the three-way primary that
he had led in the polls until the final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a contest that he headlined but ultimately misjudged,
because his entry split the conservative base vital to a campaigner
so proudly rooted in grass-roots Christian fundamentalism. And it
was a contest in which his attack tactics, so often identified with
the class of '94, came under criticism from a Republican
establishment disquieted by the pugnaciousness of the Gingrich
prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Christensen's new status as a political object lesson is a
matter of considerable study among his closest friends in the
73-member class of '94. In spirit, those still in Congress remain
feisty iconoclasts with a continuing flair for just the sort of
insurgent gambits that Christensen excelled at until he reached for
the Nebraska governor's race and plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The morning after Jon lost,'' said Scarborough, ``there were
some of us saying to each other, `What? The political rules
applying to everyone else apply to us, too?' The '94 landslide may
have given us a false sense of security, the feeling that
everything you touch is going to turn to gold.''
</P>
<P>
   But there has been electoral gold in their guerrilla style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our class was very aggressive and committed and not
compromise-oriented,'' noted Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the former
congressman who first showed Christensen the way by bolting the
class of '94 to challenge his state party organization in 1996 and
win interim incumbency in Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat. Brownback
noted that other '94 members remain fully involved in similarly
uphill challenges for higher office this year, including John
Ensign of Nevada, Mark Neumann of Wisconsin and Linda Smith of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three from my class, all three challenging Senate
incumbents,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough laughed at how blithely members of the class still
encourage one another to go for any fresh challenge they see. ``We
say, `Hey, we're invincible! Why ask?' That will remain our style,
though tempered now by Jon and the realization that some
machine-gun nests you just don't attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Nebraska, Edward Burchfield, former chairman of the
Sarpy County Republicans and one of the earliest Christensen
champions, found in Christensen's loss a lesson in hubris overdue
for the class of '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in a great wave, a bunch of young bucks full of
themselves, walking those streets, oozing power,'' said Burchfield.
``When Jon jumped in for governor without consulting the powers
that be, that really ticked off a lot of people who worked so hard
to get him into Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 35, Christensen talks of returning to the business world.
But friends expect that some fresh roll of the political dice will
be quickly tried by this intuitive combatant whose knack for
political cut-and-thrust became celebrated in his four years in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen checkmated one critic's campaign accusations by
taking a lie-detector test and pronouncing himself truthful. In his
1996 re-election, he overcame a publicized divorce proceeding in
which his wife attested that she had been the unfaithful spouse,
leaving Christensen clear in the eyes of the many fundamentalist
churches in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the primary for governor on the 25th anniversary of
Roe vs. Wade to emphasize his unyielding opposition to abortion. He
campaigned heartily for family values, announcing that his fiancee,
Tara Dawn Holland, a former Miss America, was ``saving herself''
for marriage this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I hate to lose, but I want to be a good loser,''
Christensen said achingly, speaking recently in his office here,
his time in the House down to six months.
</P>
<P>
   He is already working hard at healing the primary scars and
helping the winner, Mike Johanns, the mayor of Lincoln, Neb., with
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't learn from your mistakes, then you've made the
ultimate mistake,'' Christensen said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the primary, Christensen was criticized by party elders,
notably Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, who expressed concern about a
Christensen brochure that accused Johanns of tolerating pornography
on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon is not an arrogant guy,'' Hagel said later in an
interview, estimating that the brochure backfired but did not cause
defeat. ``Jon got in way late and that was as big a problem as
anything else. And, the way it happened, none of us knew about it
and that did not go down well.''
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of '94 helped impel Christensen into the primary
seven months before the vote, drawing big headlines and the early
polling leads. But he now concedes that Johanns, who ran a 32-month
campaign up and down the state, was the patient tortoise who beat
the upstart hare.

FRENCH DEFENDER BEATS STUBBORN PARAGUAYAN DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ Jose Luis Chilavert, the Paraguayan goalkeeper,
was face down on the grass with his gloves over his eyes: not a
customary position for a loud, proud leader of men. But the
game-winning shot that the French defender Laurent Blanc had just
driven past him in the 113th minute was enough to deprive even the
big and agile Chilavert of his sense of balance.
</P>
<P>
   For 90 minutes of regulation time and nearly two periods of
overtime in their second-round World Cup match Sunday, Chilavert
and his Paraguayan teammates had managed to impose their
revisionist brand of soccer on the more talented, aggressive and
frustrated French.
</P>
<P>
   The Paraguayans had stalled. They had spread out cleverly in
their own half, counterattacked selectively and dared the French to
do their worst in the absence of Zinedine Zidane, their suspended
playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane would be sorely missed by his teammates on this bright,
windy afternoon as they struggled to find rhythm and each other in
front of the Paraguayan goal. As the minutes and squandered French
opportunities ticked by, it began to look likely that this long,
often ugly match would come down to penalty kicks _ precisely what
Paraguay and its excellent goalkeeper were craving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have had a very good chance if we could have
gotten to that stage,'' said Paraguay's coach, Paulo Cesar
Carpeggiani.
</P>
<P>
   But the French, despite all their ineffectual offensive play,
still had other plans. Robert Pires dribbled down the right wing,
as he had done frequently since replacing Thierry Henry in the 64th
minute because of Henry's sprained ankle. This time, Pires managed
to get past two tiring defenders and cross the ball into the
penalty area. David Trezeguet leaped and headed it toward the
streaking Blanc, who had charged forward from his customary
position in central defense and who scored the only goal of the
match with a single swipe of his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fox on the field,'' said Blanc's fellow defender,
Marcel Desailly. ``He told me, `I'm going up,' and it all turned
out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous World Cups, there would have been seven more minutes
to play, but this is the first year of the ``golden goal'' or, as
Americans prefer to call it, sudden death. While the French team
rushed to engulf Blanc, the Paraguayan players slumped to the turf
as if they had been hit by some sort of fast-acting chemical
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   They had delighted their small nation and surprised soccer
aficionados by qualifying for the second round at the expense of
Spain, but they would not reach the quarterfinals. The team that
will face Italy on Friday in St.-Denis will be, as expected,
France, and Zidane will be back in the lineup after his two-game
suspension for a red card. The injured Henry, France's leading
scorer in this World Cup, may be missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Zidane might have been the happiest of us all,'' the
French coach, Aime Jacquet, said after he had finished kissing
Blanc on the cheek and hugging every other player he could get to.
``The goal rewarded the better team. Often in matches like this,
there is injustice at the end, but we got through because of our
great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is also Paraguay's strength, and its leader is
Chilavert, the only real star on an overachieving team. Sunday, he
strutted onto the field and, as usual, placed his good-luck charm _
a medallion honoring the Madonna of Lourdes _ on the grass inside
his goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the player who would decide the game was Blanc, a reserved
man who chooses extroverted friends, such as Eric Cantona, the
charismatic star who never got to play in a World Cup because of
France's spectacular failure in the qualifying rounds in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When Bulgaria's Emil Kostadinov scored to knock Cantona and the
French out of the 1994 World Cup, it was Blanc who had the last
shot at stopping him.
</P>
<P>
   He announced his retirement from the national team after that
experience, but Jacquet persuaded him to return, and Blanc can now
say that he has repaid his debt to French soccer. ``What a
moment,'' Blanc said. ``I promised myself I'd score in the World
Cup, and I kept my promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was Blanc's 72nd for France, which equals the total of
Michel Platini, who was watching next to Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin. Both Platini and the prime minister leaped to their feet
after Blanc's dramatic goal, and before long, Chilavert regained
his feet, too. One by one, he approached his fallen teammates and
lifted the smaller men off the ground. The Madonna of Lourdes had
not brought him good fortune this time.
</P>
<P>
   But then, isn't Lourdes in France?

THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR FESTIVE EXPRESSION OF GAY PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After weeks of frenzied preparations, Antonio
Escalante woke early to piece together the rows of terra-cotta
colored columns, wooden platforms and hand-crafted flowers he made
to celebrate the city's diverse gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of showing pride in being Latino and gay,'' said
Escalante, a Los Angeles-based artist who designed the Hacienda and
two other floats for Sunday's Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade in West
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The Hacienda float featured a mock same-sex wedding ceremony, a
mariachi band and scantily drag queens dancing atop the
four-wheeled platform cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The floats were completed with the help of more than 100
volunteers from the Bienestar service organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating in the parade is a show of unity,'' said
Bienestar spokeswoman Elizabeth Escobedo, whose organization
provides HIV testing and other health services geared toward
Latinos in six locations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said more than 350,000 people attended two days of
festivities in West Hollywood that featured domestic partnership
commitment ceremonies as well as a 300-person lesbian march
Saturday led by a contingency of women on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of organizations were represented at the parade,
including churches, AIDS organizations and gay advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The number and variety of organizations participating ``is a
reflection of gay pride as a whole,'' said Kendall Williams,
spokesperson of Christopher Street West, the organization that
sponsored the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the San Francisco parade, the West Hollywood
parade tends to be more festive,'' said Williams who contrasted the
event with the more overtly political air of the Bay Area pride
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   But political dignitaries could be spotted throughout the Los
Angeles parade, including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Los
Angeles City Councilmen Mike Hernandez and Zev Yaroslavsky.

   PoliceChief Bernard C. Parks, rode behind the Golden State Peace
Officers Association, a gay-advocacy organization composed of
police officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm and positive nature of the parade has been a
plus for us,'' said Parks, who is the second Los Angeles police
chief to appear at the parade.

   Other parade-goers added to the upbeat atmosphere: celebrants
dancing under huge tents at the country-western music stage, fans
under rainbow-colored umbrellas waving at parade participants and
teens creating a ruckus with their noise makers.

<P>
   ``Next to Halloween, gay pride weekend is one of our biggest
events of the year,'' said Rage restaurant and bar manager Sam
Cunniniello, whose establishment is located along the main parade

   BEIJING _ As symbols go, nothing beats China's Great Wall, the
3,000-mile fortress against outsiders. But, a better symbol of the
new China may be the relentless T-shirt vendors capitalizing on the
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, following in the footsteps of three other
U.S. chief executives, trekked up the steps of the stone fortress
as he and his family turned into tourists on Sunday, viewing a
section of the Great Wall and the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this wall now is a symbol that China shows to the
rest of the world; not a wall to keep people out. It sort of
unifies the country for over 7,000 kilometers,'' Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon made the first presidential visit to the tourist
attraction in 1972 and proclaimed it, indeed, a great wall. But at
least he wasn't hassled by aggressive venders hawking ``I Climbed
the Great Wall'' T-shirts, calendars, key chains and other
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the fortress at Mutianyu, more than a dozen
vendors are lined up in stalls _ all selling the same items with
the shouting frenzy of a bazaar. A popular seller: the green caps
with a red star that were required attire during the era of Mao
Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
daughter Chelsea, drove the 40 miles from Beijing to Mutianyu where
the wall snakes through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more magnificent than I had imagined it to be,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first family and their entourage took a cable car up the
steep mountainside to avoid having to climb to the top on a steamy
China day. The president made the standard pose for photographs
with the wall zigzagging in the background.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry took a look at the 1,000
steps up the steepest portion of the wall and remarked: ``Wouldn't
want to roller-blade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Clintons visited the Forbidden City where Chinese
authorities, despite promises to the contrary, closed the palace
compound to the 10,000 tourists who visit each day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president began his tour at the Imperial Palace, the ornate
backdrop to the movie The Last Emperor and viewed emperor's chamber
where China's ancient rulers sat on a gold throne below a glass
ball that legend said was one of the heavenly forces keeping the
emperor in power.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbidden City is the place where the rulers during the Ming
and Qing dynasties lived. The massive compound in the heart of
Beijing has 9,999 buildings. Construction started in 1406. Emperors
lived there for 491 years, until 1925.
</P>
<P>
   But the Great Wall is even more ancient, construction having
started in the 3rd century. And, because of Nixon's historic visit,
is probably the most visible symbol of China for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents visited Badaling, which became so crowded with
tourists that China developed the Mutianyu site. At Badaling,
vendors have actually set up shop on top of the wall as well as at
the base.
</P>
<P>
   The ride on the cable car at Badaling costs 55 yuan, the
equivalent of $7. To walk on the wall once you get off the cable
car costs another 25 yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a small price to see the results of the labor of
more than 1 million people, many of them political prisoners,
ordered to work on the structure by the emperor Qin Shihuang 2000
years ago. Qin was the first leader to unify the many kingdoms and
ruled with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was his burial site that Clinton visited in Xi'an, his first
stop in China. Qin also ordered craftsmen to build the terra-cotta
army of 6,000 soldiers that were buried near him to protect his
afterlife.

GOVERNMENT TO CONSIDER RELAXING PROTECTION FOR SOME GRAY WOLVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Minn., Mich., Wis., Mont., Wyo., Idaho, Maine)  (10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for
electronic media.) 
(ja) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department will announce on Monday
that it is considering the relaxation of federal protection for
gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains and near the Great Lakes,
because these wolf populations are increasingly safe from
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they believed it was time to remove
about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin from the
list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act,
turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be
reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of
threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in
controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their
numbers increase.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a broad program by the Clinton
administration to emphasize the successes of the Endangered Species
Act by taking species off the protected list as their numbers
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they believed that wolves might again roam the
Adirondacks of New York and the forests of northern Maine, and said
they would study what level of protection to give wolves in the
Northeast, where today there are few, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the new plan a step
forward for the wolves, which were once widely reviled and hunted
almost to extinction. The rugged canines with the haunting howl
have loped through primeval forests just as they prowl the human
psyche in myth, folk tale and nursery rhyme. Today, they have
recaptured a revered status among conservation groups, reflecting
their important ecological role as a top predator.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Babbitt and Jamie Rappaport Clark, the director
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said the changes would not
lessen the likelihood that wolf packs would continue to thrive and
to extend into new territories.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt plans to explain the policies on Monday while visiting a
wildlife science center in Minnesota where the animals are held
captive to help rebuild their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy will not affect the protection of wolves that
were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho,
reproducing successfully, even though these populations might be
reclassified from endangered to threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a
subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in
the Southeast. Gray wolves in Alaska have never been listed as
endangered or threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Formal proposals will be published in a few months. The changes
in the wolves' legal status are not likely to occur before 1999,
but officials said the department's intentions were unlikely to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to acknowledge success,'' Babbitt
said. ``One reason the Endangered Species Act was in question was
the opponents were saying it did not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's proposals for managing wolves have long been
contentious, but this time some conservation groups are willing to
support easing the protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is the right thing for the wolves, at the right
time,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife
Foundation. ``It is the way the Endangered Species Act was designed
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of relaxing the protections for wolves say that the
change will make it easier to convince farmers and ranchers that
the wolves can expand into new areas without threatening their
livelihoods. The wolves eat anything from small animals like mice
and rabbits to larger species like sheep and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   A population of wolves listed as threatened or not listed for
the law's protections at all may be managed under state or Federal
plans that allow some wolves to be killed and some of their habitat
destroyed, as long as helping the species recover remains the
overall objective.
</P>
<P>
   When the population is classified as endangered, tighter
protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are
more likely to resist reintroduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department has listed gray wolves as an endangered
species through most of the lower 48 states since 1973, when the
Endangered Species Act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   No wolf recovery plan has been drafted for the Northeast, but
proponents believe that the Adirondacks and Maine provide suitable
conditions, and planning may now begin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might be possible for wolves to move naturally back
into the Northeast from Canada, little migration has been detected.
The government is far from committing to a reintroduction of the
wolves, but the legal doors have cracked open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have immediate plans for reintroduction? No,'' Ms. Clark
of the Fish and Wildlife Service said. ``But there is suitable
habitat, there is a potential opportunity, there are suitable prey
species.'' In the Northeast, moose and white-tail deer would be
among the gray wolf's prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the vision for the grand Laurentian forest from the
Adirondacks up to Maine is to bring back the wolves,'' Van Putten
said. ``We think the proposal Secretary Babbitt is going to
announce will make it more likely that that will happen.''

THE `LIVE FREE OR DIE' STATE IN A TOUGH SPOT ON TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ If a callous carnival barker were to stand
outside the noble old New Hampshire State House these days, he
could legitimately cry:
</P>
<P>
   Come see an entire political establishment squirm! Come see the
Granite State caught between a court-decreed rock and a political
hard place! Come see the most tax-hating, local-controlling,
Living-Free-or-Dying state in the nation face the heaviest pressure
anyone can remember to change its tax system!
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire is in a fix. Last December, its Supreme Court
ruled that it could no longer fund its schools almost entirely
through local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the likelihood loomed that the state so long
irreconcilably opposed to income and sales taxes might have to
change its off-my-back ways. The mood here has been one of an
intensifying and agonizing search for a solution, and these days,
the sweat blotching shirts seems to come not just from the lack of
air conditioning in parts of the 182-year old State House.
</P>
<P>
   More than those in any other state, New Hampshire's schools have
been financed by local government _ about 90 percent of the
$1-billion-plus education budget, compared with about 50 percent
nationwide. And that local control is deeply ingrained in political
tradition here. So is the hostility to ``broad-based'' taxes like
income and sales taxes _ to the point that politicians routinely
take the pledge not to introduce any.
</P>
<P>
   The state's independent-mindedness could be said to go back at
least to 1774, when New Hampshire _ even then a tax haven for
smugglers and poachers seeking to avoid paying the crown _ was the
first state to declare itself independent from England. And local
control is up there with liberty as a political ideal, from the
still-thriving town meetings to the 400-member House of
Representatives, the third-largest legislative body in the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, the court ruling, said Donna Sytek, the
Republican speaker of the House, ``is so violative of New Hampshire
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   And its implications ``are, I believe, unprecedented, certainly
in this century,'' said Mrs. Sytek, whose $100-a-year
citizen-representatives would normally be done for the session by
now. ``We're looking at a billion-dollar problem, and only two ways
to solve it _ an income tax or a statewide property tax,'' she
said. ``It's a choice of Brussels sprouts or lima beans. Well,
frankly, I don't like either.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, it seems, does the New Hampshire populace, who already
complain that their property taxes are among the highest in the
country, and who continue to oppose passage of an income or sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   And neither does Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who took the
no-new-taxes pledge when she was running two years ago, and who
would like to be re-elected this fall when her two-year term is up.
</P>
<P>
   After the court ruling, her administration devised a plan that
would have increased education spending and set a statewide
property tax rate while keeping school funding locally administered
and avoiding redistributing from richer to poorer towns.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seemed, as the Russians say, to satisfy the wolves
while keeping the sheep uneaten; polls showed broad support for it,
and the House of Representatives passed it along with the tens of
millions of dollars it would have required the state to raise from
unspecified other tax sources.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the state Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion
that the governor's plan, known as ABC for Advancing Better
Classrooms, was not constitutional. It hinged on giving money back
to those towns that would have ended up paying more in property
taxes, and the court ruled that such abatements are as unequal as
the current widely divergent local property tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   So lawmakers are now going back to the drawing board, with
attention focused this week on the state Senate and what plan it
will come up with from among nearly two dozen floating around the
State House in the form of bills and proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As they ponder, New Hampshire lawmakers cast a frequent fearful
eye to Vermont, which has been in the throes of heated discord over
Act 60, its own scheme for responding to a court ruling about
school funding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than 30 states have faced such challenges of their
local school-financing systems since 1971. The challenges argued
that education is such a fundamental right, access to it and the
bills for it should be essentially equal for all rather than
locally set. The trend lately, experts say, has been for courts to
agree with that argument, and for states to try painfully to
comply.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire seems to stand out as more defiant and more
intent on defending its local tradition than any other state. One
way to maintain local independence, one camp here proposes, is to
pass a constitutional amendment that would trump the court ruling
and keep power over school funding in local hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jealously guard local autonomy,'' said state Sen. Jim
Rubens, a Republican candidate for governor who is proposing an
amendment to retain the current system of funding while increasing
guaranteed state aid to education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resist intrusion of the central planners who think they can
solve our education problems,'' Rubens said. ``And the issue is
bigger than money; money is second in line, the big issue is
control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is a school of thought even more defiant. Paul
Mirski, a Republican lawmaker, argues in his proposed bill that the
Legislature should consider the court's decision unconstitutional,
and therefore void, because it effectively creates a new tax.
</P>
<P>
   And according to New Hampshire's ``fabulous Constitution,'' with
its roots in anti-British rebellion, he said, only the Legislature
or the people, not the court, can create a tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the court made a mistake,'' he said, adding that the
Legislature should say, ``We can't comply with this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the political spectrum are the courageous _
some would say quixotic _ ``broad-basers,'' who see the court
decision as a great opportunity to finally introduce the income tax
that they think New Hampshire has long needed. (Virtually no one is
talking about a sales tax, for fear out-of-staters would stop
coming in droves to shop here.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ultimately people will see that we need to mitigate
the high property taxes with some other more fair tax,'' said
Clifton Below, a lawmaker proposing an income tax. Because of the
ruling, he said, ``a lot more people are asking the questions and
having that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon in New Hampshire, Below noted, for poor
people to spend 10 percent or 20 percent of their income on
property taxes while rich people spend perhaps 1 percent. The state
has the highest property tax burden as a percentage of personal
income in the country, he said _ 6.6 percent _ and the court's push
toward a broad-based tax should be seen as a step forward, not
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to get over that conceptual hump,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also those proposing a uniform statewide property tax,
like freshman Rep. Frank Sapareto, a professional tax and financial
planner from the high-property-tax town of Derry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes someone seriously suicidal like me'' to make such a
proposal, he said, but it is simply financially sensible and just.
``What's going to happen?'' he asked. ``I'll get fired and go back
to making money?''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Shaheen allowed that the school ruling, known in verbal
shorthand as ``Claremont'' for the town that brought suit, is
perhaps the greatest challenge of her governorship. Lawmakers say
that they cannot remember such knotty work since trying to balance
the budget during the recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has put us in a box,'' said Republican legislator
Doug Teschner.
</P>
<P>
   Added his colleague, Jeb Bradley: ``It's the devil and the deep
blue sea is what it is.'' &QL;

 McDOUGAL, THOUGH FREED, REMAINS FETTERED BY CHARGES  
(sw) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan McDougal was still wearing her orange prison suit, but the
look on her face was sheer joy as she shed her cuffs and leg chains
and savored the freedom granted her last week by a federal judge in
Arkansas. But she will have little time to celebrate or relax after
her official scheduled release from a California prison on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight days later, on July 13, Mrs. McDougal is scheduled to
be summoned to another courtroom to face another prosecutor. This
time her antagonist will not be Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel whose tactics she has compared to those of the
Nazis, but a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles. And this time
the charges she faces have nothing to do with politics, President
Clinton or the Whitewater development project.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a long-running but little-noticed court battle in
California, Mrs. McDougal, 43, stands accused of bilking Zubin
Mehta, the renowned orchestra conductor, and his wife, Nancy, of
more than $150,000 when she was their personal assistant and
bookkeeper from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who lived in one of the Mehta family's five
luxury homes and traveled across the United States and abroad for
Mehta's concerts, denies the charges. Her fiance, Pat Harris, said
she is a victim of Mrs. Mehta, whom he described as ``a very lonely
woman'' who ``attached on to Susan with a fervor I've never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the woman who chose to endure nearly two years of
incarceration rather than tell Starr what she knew about Clinton's
Arkansas financial dealings could be sentenced to seven more years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The image that Mrs. McDougal cultivates as ``an innocent
bystander of our generation's sleaziest witch hunt,'' as her online
home page biography describes her, is sharply at odds with the
financial scam artist convicted by the Whitewater jury in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She was found guilty of taking part in a fraudulent scheme to
obtain a $300,000 loan that was paid to a company she created
called Master Marketing. Part of the proceeds went to pay debts of
the Whitewater development company in which she and her late
husband, James McDougal, were partners with the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Mrs. McDougal in California also paint her
as a perpetrator of financial fraud. They accuse her of forging
Mrs. Mehta's name on a credit card application and fraudulently
charging more than $90,000 of personal items, including expensive
clothes, hotel stays and personal air travel. She also is accused
of bilking the couple of another $65,000 in falsely claimed
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the prosecutor, Jeffrey Semow, said that he expected
the trial to begin as scheduled, though the Arkansas judge who
reduced Mrs. McDougal's criminal contempt sentence to time served,
on health grounds, also ordered her to spend 90 days of house
arrest in the custody of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we're still going to trial,'' said
Semow, a Los Angeles deputy district attorney. ``I do not believe
he intended to preclude her from appearing at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Geragos, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, said in a recent interview
that the Mehta case would have been dropped long ago if the
defendant were not a prominent figure in the Whitewater
investigation. Geragos said that Starr's prosecution team had used
the California charges as a ``club'' to make Mrs. McDougal
cooperate, an accusation Starr's team denies.
</P>
<P>
   Semow said he had not colluded in any way with Starr, adding
that he had no idea who Susan McDougal was when she was arraigned
in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Like Whitewater, some aspects of the Mehta case turn on murky
financial transactions. According to documents in the case, Mrs.
Mehta said she knew nothing of the credit card obtained by Mrs.
McDougal in 1989 until she received a surprise call from
BankAmerica asking whether she wanted to increase the credit limit
on the card. She later learned that Mrs. McDougal was having the
credit card bills sent to a mail drop in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Geragos, responding for his client, said Mrs. Mehta knew
about the credit card. He said she had agreed to the arrangement as
a way to compensate Mrs. McDougal for additional bookkeeping
services.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation has created problems. Mrs. McDougal did not
claim the payments as compensation on her taxes and is charged with
state income tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos also contended that his investigators recently found
several receipts from purchases on the credit card that had been
signed by Mrs. Mehta herself. He said a former bookkeeper for the
Mehtas is expected to provide testimony that may further undercut
Mrs. Mehta's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Mehtas' financial records, which form the backbone of
Semow's case, show several transactions in which Mrs. McDougal is
accused of making unauthorized personal purchases and charging them
to her employers. In 1991, these records say, she bought a dress
and a belt for herself at a Malibu boutique called Nikki's and
reported the $412 expense as a hotel charge for Mehta in Tokyo.
Investigators for the prosecution said the store manager had told
them that Mrs. McDougal wore the items out of the store.
</P>
<P>
   She also charged hotel stays and thousands of dollars of
personal air travel to the Mehtas, according to a financial audit
by the couple's accountant, Alan Byron, who testified at Mrs.
McDougal's preliminary hearing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The years she worked for the Mehtas were to be a balm for her
broken marriage to McDougal and the trail of financial failures she
left behind in Arkansas. In 1989, without a job or permanent place
to live, Mrs. McDougal and her boyfriend, Harris, decided to move
to Los Angeles. There, an employment agency sent Harris, who had
experience in real estate, to the Mehtas, who were looking for
someone to manage their properties.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three years, Mrs. McDougal spent considerable time
with Mrs. Mehta, a former actress who played a small part in the
television comedy ``Bewitched.'' Mrs. Mehta became so close to Mrs.
McDougal that, Byron said, ``It was a relationship where she
entrusted Susan McDougal with 100 percent of anything and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady change from Arkansas, where Mrs. McDougal grew up
as one of seven children in tiny Camden. She met James McDougal at
Ouachita Baptist University, to which she had won a scholarship and
where McDougal taught political science. McDougal was active in
Democratic politics and became friendly with Bill Clinton. Mrs.
McDougal has denied her ex-husband's accusations, published in an
article in The New Yorker in 1997, that she and Clinton were
romantically involved while he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in Los Angeles, Harris left the Mehtas' employ
to attend law school at the University of Michigan, and Mrs.
McDougal replaced him at a salary of $38,000. The disputed
bookkeeping fees were to be paid in addition to that.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement went smoothly until Mrs. Mehta received the call
from BankAmerica. In July 1992, just as Clinton was being nominated
as the Democratic candidate for president, Mrs. Mehta and her
lawyer, Grant Gifford, confronted Mrs. McDougal about their
suspicions about the credit card and she was fired. After reviewing
her financial records and finding more than $150,000 in billings
she contends were phony, Mrs. Mehta took her complaint to the
district attorney's office in fall 1993. Mrs. McDougal was charged
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Mrs. Mehta often bought Mrs. McDougal expensive
clothes and other gifts. ``There's no way Susan took a penny from
that woman that wasn't given,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mehta, through Gifford, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the Susan McDougal who let herself be dominated by
James McDougal in Arkansas and Mrs. Mehta in California has become
a much bolder person in prison. Although Mrs. McDougal declined to
be interviewed for this article, she has said in past interviews
that the turning point was her decision not to cooperate with
Starr. That decision was reached with her family, including her
mother, who as a young woman in Belgium, joined the Resistance in
World War II. Mrs. McDougal has likened her decision to resist
Starr to her mother's defiance in the war. She has said she will
not testify before Starr's grand jury unless he steps aside,
because Starr will force her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview with the CNN talk show host, Larry
King, last February, Mrs. McDougal said her legal troubles have
left her life ``in tatters.'' She said she met weekly with a prison
rabbi, to whom she confessed her hatred of Starr, who re-indicted
her in May on criminal contempt charges for her refusal to testify
before his grand jury. That trial is set for Sept. 28 in Little
Rock, Ark..
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbi says it's OK to hate a little,'' Mrs. McDougal told
King. ``It helps you do the right thing.''

WIMBLEDON AWAITS A WILLIAMS-VS.-WILLIAMS SISTER MATCH
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ There is so much about Wimbledon, starting
with rules, regulations and rain, that just bugs the Williams
sisters. Venus, 17, who knows that everybody around here knows
exactly who she is, gets annoyed when the security guards insist on
checking her plastic pass with their electronic scanners, recording
her every entrance and exit, all of them applauded by fans eager to
get a close look at the biggest _ but possibly not the best _ of
the beaded ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only scan once a day,'' was her unsolicited advice to the
keepers of the peace at the All England Club. ``I'm not into all
that scanning.''
</P>
<P>
   And 16-year-old Serena, who has not yet exhibited a trace of
ingenue awe in her first appearance at the staid Grand Slam event
that was around a hundred years before she was, was indignant when
she discovered that Center Court and every other court were
off-limits for practice on this middle Sunday, when Wimbledon
traditionally goes as dark as the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just found out that you can't even practice here,'' Serena
said. ``That really went right over my head. I would say that's
being traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, like her sister, has dropped just nine games through two
rounds, and the two appear headed for a much-anticipated collision
in the Round of 16. The last time Wimbledon played host to a
sisterly spat was 1966, when Australia's Gail Sherriff defeated her
sister, Carol. In the only other confrontation between a pair of
sisters, Maud Watson, the younger of Britain's Watson girls,
defeated Lilian in the 1884 final.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in their fledgling professional careers, the Williams
sisters have stuck to the tradition put into practice often in the
last decade by the trio of tennis-playing Maleeva sisters, ceding
the victory to the older sibling. When they met in the second round
of this year's Australian Open, where Serena was making her Grand
Slam debut and Venus was seeking to reprise her surprise sprint to
the 1997 U.S. Open final, Venus pocketed the victory, just as she
did last month at the Italian Open and again when the two, along
with their partners, squared off in the mixed-doubles final at the
French Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Serena Williams has been basking in the attention she has
received since the splash debut she enjoyed on grass two weeks ago
at Eastbourne, where she reached the quarterfinals. Her performance
there had such experts as Steffi Graf, the seven-time Wimbledon
champion, and Monica Seles, the winner of nine Grand Slam events,
commenting that her grass court game may be superior to her
sister's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little bit that Serena has a better chance here than
Venus,'' said the sixth-seeded Seles, one of the five top-ranked
victims who helped Serena zoom from No. 453 in the ranking last
October to her current career high of No. 20. That it took Serena
Williams just 16 professional matches to tally five upsets against
players from the top 10 broke the record set by Seles, who needed
33 matches to accomplish it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Seles also said it was too bad that one sister would have to
cancel out the other in the fourth round. But before that can
happen, the seventh-seeded Venus must get past Chanda Rubin in the
third round and Serena must win her first meeting with 47th-ranked
Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   According to Venus Williams, whose own Wimbledon debut was a
``terrible'' opening-round exit last year, the Williams-Williams
clash is a virtual lock. She was a little less definite on whether
she could keep her undefeated streak against her sister, who
clearly shows no signs of being intimidated by her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has all the muscles,'' Venus Williams said. ``Serena's
definitely a juggernaut, and the only way to handle it is to become
a bigger one yourself. I guess you have to become the nemesis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Venus Williams is already playing from a position of power.
She set a record when she fired a serve of 125 mph in her
second-round match, breaking the mark of 123 mph set here last year
by Brenda Schultz-McCarthy. Williams said she has added nine mph to
her serve in the last year, and her record-breaker here put her
just nine mph behind Greg Rusedski's tournament-leading serve of
134 mph. Only six men have served faster at Wimbledon than
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeepers,'' Serena Williams said when informed of her sister's
new record. ``She's much bigger than I am, she's taller, and she
might have more power. I really don't know if I can catch up with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Serena has made it clear that, with Venus already the proud
possessor of two 1998 Grand Slam championships _ mixed-doubles
titles she won at the Australian and French opens with her partner,
Justin Gimelstob _ this might be the time and place for her to
start playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's already won a slam before I have,'' Serena said. ``She
has two, but we really don't talk about it. Maybe I can catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry is limited to the court. Serena thinks her
sister would be perfect if she were about four inches shorter than
her height of nearly 6 feet 2 inches. And Venus Williams has no
complaints about Serena, who always takes care not to mimic the
color configuration of her beaded hair.
</P>
<P>
   As advocates, and as adversaries, the two figure to have a
lengthy future, and their future at Wimbledon has only just begun.

MOOD OF COOPERATION IN WASHINGTON MASKS DEEP DIVISIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Miss., Ga.)   (Washington column) 
(ko) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress has left town for its Fourth of July
recess, seemingly content that the annual negotiations over how to
spend the taxpayers' money will resolve themselves to everyone's
benefit in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   But battles loom over a number of issues, some of them old, like
home heating assistance for the poor, and some new, like how to
conduct the census in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 35 legislative days before Congress adjourns on
Oct. 9, and even less time before the next fiscal year begins on
Oct. 1. By then, the 13 different spending bills must be signed
into law to keep the U.S. government running.
</P>
<P>
   Views vary as to how it will all come out. The Clinton
administration likes to portray the Republicans in the House as
extremists, ready to throw the government into chaos at a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The placid surface conceals a very, very turbulent time
ahead,'' said one negotiator on the Democratic side. ``We're not
headed toward an easy exit.''
</P>
<P>
   But many others involved with the spending bills on Capitol Hill
say there is little appetite for chaos in an election year. Even
the conservatives, who one said are ``ready to pick a few more
fights,'' seem reluctant to shut down the government, as they did
to disastrous political effect in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from Utica, N.Y.,
said, ``The wingers _ the right wing, the left wing _ are getting
most of the attention, but the moderates are shaping public
policy.'' Still, he said, to try to draw conclusions now about the
course of the spending bills is as pointless as guessing the ending
of a baseball game after two innings.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate committees are still working separately on the
bills and have not begun to negotiate their vast differences. They
have to do that before presenting their final proposals to the
President, who has his own set of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the early skirmishing has a familiar ring.
</P>
<P>
   As they have since they came to power in 1995, the Republicans,
whose strength derives from the South and West, have proposed
lopping off programs that benefit urban dwellers in the Northeast.
This includes financing for Amtrak, which is again on the hit list.
</P>
<P>
   They have proposed cutting heating aid for the poor, summer jobs
for disadvantaged youth, and several environmental and education
programs dear to President Clinton's heart. They would also knock
out AmeriCorps, the national service program, and the Legal
Services Corp., which provides lawyers for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But this year offers some new twists.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change is that both Congress and the
administration are living under a virtual freeze on new spending
because of last year's balanced-budget agreement. The spending
limits are the guiding principle _ not the projected budget surplus
and strong economy, which, along with talk of tax cts, give the
false impression that Washington has lots of extra money on its
hands.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the budget agreement barely allows for inflation.
And tax cuts can come only from entitlements, not from the
discretionary spending that is the subject of the 13 appropriations
bills. So spending _ a favorite election-year activity _ is limited
this year, prompting members to be especially creative.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have shown that, despite their complaints about past
Democratic pork-barrel spending, they are just as eager to direct
money to hometown projects.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bills include billions of dollars spread across
most districts and states for local projects like refurbishing
courthouses, controlling floods and beach erosion, providing
construction work for the Army Corps of Engineers, keeping open
military bases that the administration wants to shut and financing
22 projects, like better dining halls, at various military
installations. Most are in the home states of members of the House
and Senate appropriations committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have also included big-ticket items for
high-ranking individual members, including money for a helicopter
carrier to be built by Litton Industries in a shipyard in
Pascagoula, Miss., the hometown of Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican
leader, and millions of dollars for cargo planes to be built by
Lockheed Martin Corp. in Marietta, Ga., the hometown of Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have earmarked new money for basic medical
research, granting the National Institutes of Health a whopping
increase of 9 percent over its current budget. They would provide
more money to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more
for anti-drug programs to counter their failure to pass
anti-tobacco legislation, would expand Federal mortgages for
low-income home-buyers and raise the size of Pell grants for
low-income college students.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have not complained about these priorities as much as
they have complained about the Republican cuts. Most notably, they
have highlighted the conservatives' recurring attempt to block
money for the National Endowment for the Arts. But Republican
moderates in the House have joined with Democrats to keep the money
in, signaling that the moderates _ 40 to 60 members of the House,
depending on the issue _ could have a strong say in the final
spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most contentious issues shaping up is not a spending
matter at all but one of the many policy rulings that are often
tucked into the spending bills. This is the question of the census.
Republicans want an exact head count. Democrats want to use
statistical sampling, which would make up for people who are hard
to find, like blacks in the inner city, Hispanic migrant workers
and the homeless. This matters hugely to both parties because the
census determines Congressional boundaries for the next decade of
elections and determines how much Federal aid each region receives.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell how these conflicts will be resolved.
That depends largely on the political dynamics as the November
elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   But some central questions are clear:
</P>
<P>
   How deeply split will the Republican Party be? Will the
conservatives and the moderates be prepared to compromise with each
other and the administration and leave Washington on an up note as
they head home to campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Or, with analysts predicting that the strong economy has lulled
most voters into complacency, will Republican leaders risk a more
confrontational strategy to inspire conservative voters, who are
perceived as paying attention and likely to go to the polls?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, how much sway does President Clinton have on Capitol
Hill? How readily will he meld his views with those of the
Republican majority? And perhaps most important, which issues will
he be willing to fight for?

MILUTINOVIC WILL BE BACK, AND SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (See related stories: SOC-NIGERIA-DENMARK, SOC-FRANCE-PARAGUAY,
SOC-NETHERLANDS) 
(ja) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-DENIS, France _ Perhaps today he is browsing in a bookstore
in Paris, poking through the dictionaries. He picks up a Japanese
dictionary. ``I'm a soccer coach,'' he said Sunday night. ``I don't
know what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bora Milutinovic will be back. Oh, yes, he will be back in the
year 2002, hoping to be the first soccer coach to handle five
separate teams in the World Cup, and not only that, but to guide
all five into the second round. His career has twirled and curled,
risen and dipped like a cannonball free kick.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the Nigerian team he had coached for all of six
months went down to defeat by Denmark, 4-1. The Nigerians had
captivated the World Cup in the first round by playing open,
opportunistic soccer, but that will take you only so far.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken him weeks to persuade most of the European-based
professionals to even listen to him. He was as much of an itinerant
as they were. This was not like the United States, where he coached
for four years and caught the Balboas and the Harkeses at their
peaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., the team was like my boys,'' Bora said last week,
as direct as he ever allows himself to be. ``Here, it's different.
I feel like more of a professional. It's a different sentiment but
still big satisfaction. I am very proud for these players and for
the people of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always seem to end up with a good team,'' he added. ``I
always feel lucky. I'm just that way: a good soccer coach and a
lucky man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, his luck ran out. The Danes are something of a joy
themselves, on the field and in the stands. Their jolly legions of
fans dress themselves in red and white and call themselves
``Roligans,'' a goofy reference to the vile hooligans of other
nations. The players run precise patterns like wide receivers in
American football. Afterward, the only thing left was the Bora news
conference, always a delight. The folks in the World Cup provided
an English-speaking moderator (the Danes do it mostly in English
anyway) and a French translator, but that is never enough for Bora.
He is the latter-day version of Charles Dillon ``Casey'' Stengel,
the manager of the Yankees and Mets, who swerved conversational
corners in his own unique language known as Stengelese. Bora does
it with smidgens of languages borrowed from all his ports of call.
This time he refrained from a little Hausa, a little Ibo, a little
Yoruba. So many languages. So little time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mi equipo'' _ my team _ the Serb who lives in Mexico said,
starting in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked whether the Nigerians had limitations that the
Danes had exploited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, are you ask me?'' Bora replied.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked him how he would compare Peter Schmeichel, the
towering goalkeeper for Denmark, who spends his regular seasons
with Manchester United, to Peter Rufai, the Nigerian keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to make comperations,'' Bora said, in vintage
Stengelese. ``He don't have so much luck, but this is the life.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the interview room knew that Bora and Carlos
Alberto Parreira, who was sacked after two losses by Saudi Arabia,
have both coached four teams in the World Cup. In 1986 with Mexico,
Bora lost a quarterfinal shootout to Germany. In 1990, he
unexpectedly brought Costa Rica to the second round. In 1994, he
guided the United States to a 1-0 loss to Brazil in the round of
16. And now he lost in the second round with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Was Bora getting frustrated with not progressing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you something,'' he said. ``In this world there are 2
million people'' _ presumably he meant something higher _ ``and I
am soccer coach, and four times I go for it, so I don't feel, how
you say, frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went over it again in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters badgered him about his plans. It was well known
that Bora had signed on only through the World Cup, for a $100,000
bonus and a monthly salary of $35,000, untaxed, and a bonus of a
reported $50,000 for reaching the second round, but now his
contract is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am soccer coach, I go with family,'' Bora said.
</P>
<P>
   Would he accompany the team back to Lagos?
</P>
<P>
   ``I stay at World Cup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Did this mean he was saying goodbye to the Nigerian team?
</P>
<P>
   ``My English not good but I never say goodbye,'' Bora said.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked why Nigeria had deteriorated from the 3-2 victory
over Spain in its first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect your opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bora, who returned for another stint as Mexican coach last year,
was asked whether he would root for Mexico against Germany Monday.
He replied: ``In this World Cup, I had four teams _ Nigeria and the
U.S. and Mexico and Yugoslavia. Now Mexico plays an excellent team.
I sent my best wishes to the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody tried to pin Bora down one more time about his plans
for coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am soccer coach,'' he said. ``I don't know I will do in the
morning. Really. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked Bora about the opening that is sure to come with
the American team when Steve Sampson is dropped in the next month.
The United States could do far worse than go back to Bora, but he
is going for the record _ five teams, five Cups. A Berlitz course
today in Hindi. A saturation course tomorrow in Korean. Maybe a
little Russian. You never know.

COMMENTARY: QUESTIONS THAT DEGRADE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sidney Blumenthal, assistant to the president, made his third
appearance before Kenneth Starr's grand jury in Washington last
Thursday. He was asked a question that unwittingly defined the
character of what Starr and his colleagues are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever discussed with Mrs. Clinton whether the
president has a sex addiction?'' a prosecutor asked. Blumenthal
answered no, adding that the question was outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Starr's assistants had asked him a
sexual question. Blumenthal decided to tell me about the
experience, as a grand-jury witness may do. (I sought a comment
from the independent counsel's office; but Starr's spokesman,
Charles Bakaly, did not return a call.)
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal was first called before the grand jury on Feb. 26. He
was asked what he had told reporters in various news organizations
and what they had said to him about Starr and his assistant
prosecutors. He answered those questions.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked what President Clinton had said to him about
the Monica Lewinsky matter. Blumenthal declined to answer,
asserting executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claim of executive privilege was rejected in the
courts over the next several months, and finally abandoned.
Blumenthal was then called to testify the second time, on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Hours passed without his being asked the question he had
declined to answer on Feb. 26. Instead the two prosecutors who
questioned him _ Jackie Bennett Jr., Starr's deputy, and Solomon
Wisenberg _ asked about imagined White House meetings to plot
strategy against the independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 p.m., in their last 10 minutes, the prosecutors asked
Blumenthal the previously unanswered question about what the
president had told him on the Lewinsky matter. Blumenthal replied
that the president had said the same thing he had publicly, that he
did not have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and had not told
anyone to lie. Blumenthal added that Clinton was a man of
compassion, rooted in his temperament and his religious
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the prosecutors asked Blumenthal to leave the room
so they could consult. After five minutes he was called back, and
Wisenberg asked him: ``Does the president's religion include sexual
intercourse?''
</P>
<P>
   There was another sexual question in last week's grand-jury
session, conducted by two new prosecutors. It was, ``Does the
president believe that oral sex is sex?'' It was just that _ a
general question not tied to any particular matter.
</P>
<P>
   We have become coarsened in this country. We are too often
indifferent to the claims of privacy, which Justice Brandeis called
``the right most valued by civilized men.'' But have we really gone
so far that prosecutors can appropriately ask an assistant about
his boss' religion and sex life?
</P>
<P>
   I do not think so. I think most prosecutors would regard those
questions with contempt. It is sneering, smart-aleck stuff, the
tone of Clinton-haters on cable television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a joke. Blumenthal's lawyer, William McDaniel, who
has 20 years of experience as a defense counsel in Washington and
elsewhere, put it: ``This is a serious matter. These men and women
(on the independent counsel staff) represent the prosecutorial
power of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have enormous power. Inside the grand jury room,
with no judge or defense lawyer present, they can ask questions
without regard to the usual rules of evidence, limited only by
their own sense of responsibility and decency.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of abuse is especially great in the case of an
independent counsel, who has no limits of budget or time. That is
why I decided to write about the question put to Blumenthal. In a
republic based on law, degradation of the legal process is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here, I think, is third-rate prosecutors full of
hubris and obsessed by sex. I am sure they have pursued that
obsession with other grand-jury witnesses who have so far been too
scared or too embarrassed to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be brave enough to take on this abuse of power? Starr
is renting more office space, evidently ready to go on indefinitely
looking for some way to bring down President Clinton. Who will cry
hold, enough?

COMFORTABLY CRUISING THE COAST OF TURKEY

<P>
   KALKAN, Turkey _ A mousy-looking, all-wood schooner called a
gulet has been the workhorse of the Turkish Mediterranean ``blue
voyages'' for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, gulets are getting a face lift as comfort-conscious
Americans want bigger and better. Traditionally, these coastal
cruisers were built at about 50 feet. Now they are coming in at 120
feet and provide a perfect environment for those who just want to
put up their feet and watch the clouds roll by.
</P>
<P>
   These broad-beamed boats with voluminous deck space are for hire
along the Turkish coast, a place of hidden surprises where one
undiscovered cove might hide a 1,500-year-old temple.
</P>
<P>
   The spring and summer months are the busiest time for these
workhorses. They hold up to six couples in varying degrees of
comfort and provide one of the great travel bargains, as well as
allowing the passive sailor to combine a marine experience with
cruising comforts.
</P>
<P>
   A four-day, three-night cruise in a new 120-footer named the
Amazon Solo cost $450 a person, including three meals a day and
wine. The accommodations were surprising: a double bed, a separate
head and shower. All rooms look out at the water.
</P>
<P>
   The blue voyage got its name, naturally, from the technicolored
blue of the water. An informal route began in the early '60s when
historians wanted to rediscover a lost part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these blue voyagers rediscovered the Blue Cave, a sea
cave near Kalkan that is one of the country's natural wonders.
There is the bay at Myra, where you slow to view a series of tombs
cut into rock. There are places called Rat Island, Goat Island and
Snake Island. Along the way, you might spy a dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Tours begin from Kalkan, a city on the eastern Mediterranean,
and Bodrun, which is becoming known as the Riviera of Turkey for
its cosmopolitan crowd, including the financier Ahmet Ertegun and
the actor Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Most blue voyages last three nights and four days, but guests
often take a week, especially if they are traveling with friends.
No matter, on a boat this size, you make friends the moment you
walk up the gangplank.
</P>
<P>
   The boats are hand-built of chestnut and oak, the interior of
cedar and Indian walnut by local craftsmen in the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cruising is on motor power. Because the boats are
close to shore, there are times when there isn't enough wind. But
for a few hours a day, when the wind is right, they hoist the
sails.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wide decks, there is room for everyone to sit and
schmooze aft, where meals are often served. The fellow doing the
serving could be the chef, a deckhand, or even the captain.
Usually, dinner is below in the combination living room-dining
room-den.
</P>
<P>
   If you sail to the west out of Kalkan in southeast Turkey, you
will stop at one of the 12 Islands of Gocek, supposedly a favorite
of Cleopatra's. You'll pass the Blue Lagoon of Oludeniz, and you
can ask to stop at Gemiler Island and take a hike across Byzantine
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The eastbound trip _ you get both directions if you go for a
week _ includes the Basilica of St. Nicholas. Then, you spot the
ruins of a sunken city at Kekova.
</P>
<P>
   You can get information about the Amazon Solo by fax in Turkey
at 011-90-252-645-2683. Through September, rates run about $400 a
person for three nights, about $700 for five nights and about $750
for a week. To make reservations on other gulets of varying sizes,

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The injection of very warm, humid air into the Ohio Valley and
southern Great Lakes will lead to the development of at least two
clusters of strong thunderstorms early Monday. One complex of
storms will race southeast from southern Ohio toward the Smoky
Mountains. Damaging winds and flash flooding are especially likely
with these storms. A second area of thunderstorms will form near
Lake Ontario and move rapidly across western and central New
England. Sections of Vermont will be particularly vulnerable to
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of sultry air will stretch from low pressure in
southern Ontario to near New York City. Showers and thunderstorms
will attend a warm front as it moves into the Northeast. Onshore
winds in New England will temper the vigorous storms. High level
winds from the northwest will direct clouds and showers into the
Middle Atlantic region and Carolinas, but most of the rain will
dissipate before reaching the Southeast Coast. Record heat is
expected from South Carolina to northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A broken line of potent thunderstorms will sprout from western
Missouri to eastern Kentucky Monday afternoon as a cold front
approaches. Isolated tornadoes are possible. Moisture associated
with a weakening tropical wave will spread heavy showers inland
across Texas. Thick clouds will keep temperatures near seasonal
levels. Extreme heat will persist in the southwest Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will stay sunny with continued warming inland.
A few showers will mark a new cold front at the border states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Seat of Heat
</P>
<P>
   The center of the nation's hottest weather was located in the
southwest high Plains on Saturday. The morning minimum temperature
at Pueblo, Colo., at an elevation of nearly 4,700 feet was 70
degrees, the highest minimum reading ever recorded. Under blazing
sunshine, the mercury rose to 108 degrees at Amarillo, Texas, about
300 miles to the southeast of Pueblo, tying the all-time maximum in
that city. A dome of high pressure and associated very hot air has
slowly migrated westward last week from the Southeast states to the
Plains. The seat of heat will stay in this region much of this
week. &QL;

THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR FESTIVE EXPRESSION OF GAY PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: in 10th graf fixing Yaroslavsky's title) 
 
 
BY LELANI ALBANO 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After weeks of frenzied preparations, Antonio
Escalante woke early to piece together the rows of terra-cotta
colored columns, wooden platforms and hand-crafted flowers he made
to celebrate the city's diverse gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of showing pride in being Latino and gay,'' said
Escalante, a Los Angeles-based artist who designed the Hacienda and
two other floats for Sunday's Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade in West
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The Hacienda float featured a mock same-sex wedding ceremony, a
mariachi band and scantily drag queens dancing atop the
four-wheeled platform cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The floats were completed with the help of more than 100
volunteers from the Bienestar service organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating in the parade is a show of unity,'' said
Bienestar spokeswoman Elizabeth Escobedo, whose organization
provides HIV testing and other health services geared toward
Latinos in six locations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said more than 350,000 people attended two days of
festivities in West Hollywood that featured domestic partnership
commitment ceremonies as well as a 300-person lesbian march
Saturday led by a contingency of women on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of organizations were represented at the parade,
including churches, AIDS organizations and gay advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The number and variety of organizations participating ``is a
reflection of gay pride as a whole,'' said Kendall Williams,
spokesperson of Christopher Street West, the organization that
sponsored the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the San Francisco parade, the West Hollywood
parade tends to be more festive,'' said Williams who contrasted the
event with the more overtly political air of the Bay Area pride
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   But political dignitaries could be spotted throughout the Los
Angeles parade, including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan &UR; ,  &LR; Los
Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez and
 &UR; L. &LR; A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.
</P>
<P>
   PoliceChief Bernard C. Parks, rode behind the Golden State Peace
Officers Association, a gay-advocacy organization composed of
police officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm and positive nature of the parade has been a
plus for us,'' said Parks, who is the second Los Angeles police
chief to appear at the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Other parade-goers added to the upbeat atmosphere: celebrants
dancing under huge tents at the country-western music stage, fans
under rainbow-colored umbrellas waving at parade participants and
teens creating a ruckus with their noise makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to Halloween, gay pride weekend is one of our biggest
events of the year,'' said Rage restaurant and bar manager Sam
Cunniniello, whose establishment is located along the main parade
thoroughfare. ``It's extraordinarily busy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a whole weekend party,'' Escobedo said. &UR; !end! &LR;

VP MCKINNEY THINKS CHANGE WILL BE GOOD FOR SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When he's in Seattle and not racking up sky miles
faster than a jet pilot, Billy McKinney sits in his office,
plotting.
</P>
<P>
   For McKinney, the future of the Sonics is always at stake, so
plot and travel and evaluate he must.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sit next to me at a game and ask me if I'm associated
with the Sonics,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them I'm the vice president of basketball operations,
and they say, `Yeah, right. You never clap. You never get upset.'
But my job is to evaluate what we do every night. If I get
emotional, you don't make the best decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of an NBA coach is to win now, McKinney said. But the
vision of an NBA front office is to win now with a critical eye on
how to sustain winning, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, for the past four years _ up until this last NBA
draft day when the Sonics, based on McKinney's exhaustive
evaluations, took Vladimir Stepania, Rashard Lewis and Jelani McCoy
_ McKinney must have felt a certain pang of heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, McKinney has flown upwards of 150,000 miles. He has
embarked on harrowing Checkpoint Charlie car rides across war-tense
borders. He has watched more NCAA and European league basketball
games than Dick Vitale and Billy Packer combined _ all in search of
the perfect future NBA star.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all this effort and necessary work, McKinney
understood that as long as George Karl was the Sonics' coach, all
that traveling and work was basically for nothing, because rookies
and mistake-prone young players never got a chance to learn and
grow in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``George could have gotten us there (to a championship.) He did
a great job,'' McKinney said. ``But the thing that's changed (with
Karl's departure) is that there's an open-mindedness to the talent
being brought in here. You take these young guys and add them to
the players available in free agency, that's a pretty potent mix.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney has a certain affinity for underdogs, mind you. A
sixth-round draft pick out of Northwestern in 1978, McKinney earned
his place in the NBA with coach Cotton Fitzsimmons' Kansas City
Kings when he beat out first-round draft pick Mike Evans to become
an 18.7 minute-per-game backup point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because he's young doesn't mean he can't play,'' McKinney
said. ``If Cotton Fitzsimmons had taken that philosophy, I
guarantee you I wouldn't be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of open-mindedness is, in part, one of the reasons Karl
is gone. Karl's system, his regular-season win record, his quirks,
his dominating, paranoid and creative personality were shown the
door by Sonics' president Wally Walker.
</P>
<P>
   If Karl was condemned by Walker for his gargantuan personality
and his leaky media relations, then the burden is squarely left to
Walker and McKinney to demonstrate that their experience, their
style and their vision can be the successful force behind
concocting a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   That is why beneath the rancor and wonder about what Karl's
departure will mean, there is a certain sense of relief and renewal
inside Sonics headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the fun before the fall, if the Sonics fail to win
with Karl's regularity. For now, though, there's a sense that
improvement is as much possible as collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``For four years, Wally has done some great things he doesn't
get credit for. People talk about Shawn (Kemp) leaving, but we were
a better team without him,'' McKinney said, suggesting perhaps that
Karl's departure might not lead to the same result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like in Detroit, where Chuck Daly was coach for nine
years and (GM) Jack McCloskey was there for 12 years. There was a
resistance to change. I knew we had to get younger, so with Dennis
Rodman, there was a chance to trade an asset. If you don't trade
Rodman, you never get Grant Hill. Defining moments for any
franchise are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney has 19 years of NBA playing and management experience.
At Minnesota, he was brought in to start the expansion
Timberwolves. Next, in Detroit, he was hired to rebuild the aging,
former champion Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   So McKinney understands certain things about trying to put a
winning team on the floor. He also understands first-hand the
inherent tension that can cause a breakdown or a breakup between
coach and management.
</P>
<P>
   Karl never put much faith or respect in the way Walker and
McKinney did their end of the business, so surely it will be with a
certain amount of relief and pride that Walker and McKinney have
enlisted new coach Paul Westphal to help carry out their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Time, though, is not exactly on their side. In fact, with the
NBA lockout coming Wednesday, the league will likely be shut down
all summer and into fall. McKinney understands as well as anyone
the implications of this labor war, since anything that impedes the
Sonics' chances to put a championship contender on the floor next
season while also not ransoming the franchise's future, could spell
disaster for the men, other than Karl, left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for McKinney, he's been through the NBA grist mill
before. He understands the degree of difficulty in the task at
hand.

DICKSON WINS CADILLAC IN SUDDEN-DEATH PLAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ It had been 25 years since Bob Dickson won a
professional golf tournament. And because he missed a 50-foot putt
Sunday, he finally captured another one.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson was 29 in 1973 when he won the Andy Williams-San Diego
Open on the PGA Tour. Sunday he still showed a youthful exuberance
as he won the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, a Senior PGA Tour event.
He won it on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff with a
20-foot birdie putt, beating Jim Colbert and Larry Nelson, who
missed shorter shots.
</P>
<P>
   To snag the $165,000 first prize, Dickson survived a mental
lapse by him and his caddie on No. 17 that brought them face to
face with the unforgiving rules of golf. Dickson was making a late
charge in a tight field at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-3, 215-yard hole, he left himself with a 50-foot putt
after his drive. The hole was in the shadows and so far away that
Dickson did not realize that his substitute caddie had not removed
the pin. If a putt hits the flagstick, it is a two-stroke penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the putt five feet short,'' he said after winning. ``If
I had knocked it in, I wouldn't be sitting here now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we fell asleep at the switch at the same time,'' he
added, taking the onus off his caddie, Brian Deasy. ``I honestly
did not see the flag. That's a first for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Deasy, an experienced caddie, also said it was a first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got caught up in the moment,'' Deasy said. ``Even
though Bob was being kind to me, I fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   So where was Dickson's regular caddie, Mark Bolick?
</P>
<P>
   He was helping his parents celebrate their 50th wedding
anniversary in Hickory, N.C., and took the weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert said he looked at the pin and could not believe Dickson
was hitting the putt. He said he wanted to rush over and remove the
pin as the ball was rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I saw the putt was going to be short and I left it
alone,'' Colbert said. ``It was a good thing I did, too, because
one of the officials told me that if I touched the stick while
someone was hitting, I would have been subject to a two-stroke
penalty myself.''
</P>
<P>
   To force a three-way playoff, Nelson birdied the 590-yard, par-5
18th hole, while Dickson and Colbert made par. It gave each of them
a three-day total of 9-under 207 on the par-72 course at the Upper
Montclair Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   They played No. 18 again in the playoff, and Nelson reached the
green in three, leaving only a six-foot putt. Dickson, meanwhile,
had hit his third shot to about 20 feet from the pin. Colbert was
about 12 feet out, on the fringe of the green.
</P>
<P>
   After holing out for his rare victory, Dickson recalled that in
1973, someone asked him what winning a tournament felt like.
</P>

COMMENTARY: JIANG'S STUNNING TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You might think, from the glowing accounts and
sound bites of the ``debate'' or ``harsh exchange'' between the
presidents of the United States and China, that President Clinton
came across as the eloquent champion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Those who watched the 70-minute joint press conference on ABC,
however, saw an egg-walking American president saying as little as
he could get away with about ``the tragic loss of life'' more
accurately called a massacre in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang was clearly dominant. This was his show. He was
so confident beforehand that his American guest would allude to
repression in the most gingerly way that he directed it to be shown
live on state television.
</P>
<P>
   Unasked, the ebullient Jiang brought up ``the so-called
political contributions in the United States.'' He insisted ``we
have conducted a very earnest investigation into the matter and the
result shows that there never was such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the moment for Clinton to say that he welcomed the news
of that investigation, and he hoped Jiang would use this forum to
direct Chinese investigators to share their access to Hong Kong
banks and 50 elusive witness with the U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   But not a peep from Clinton, for good reason: cooperation in
discovering the ``Chinese connection'' _ with its political money
flows and ensuing policy changes and security lapses _ is the last
thing either president wants. Jiang's blanket denial was a favor to
his visitor, who was surely grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I being so grumpy today? I supported this trip and don't
begrudge our potentate his 1,200 followers, or supporters, and
their 900 tons of baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy requires our president, when visiting a major power,
to be polite, not unduly confrontational. He properly praised the
Chinese for not devaluing, thereby making it more embarrassing to
do. And ``the right side of history'' is his catchiest phrase. But
two symbols dismay.
</P>
<P>
   One is the insult to the world's intelligence of treating
``retargeting'' of missiles away from cities as a serious
agreement. It's strictly a p.r. stunt. A Chinese missile can be
targeted back on Los Angeles in exactly 10 minutes, made much more
accurate by our patriots at Loral and Hughes. If Clinton were
worried about accidental launches, as he claims, he would stop
blocking U.S. missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Clinton's craven abandonment of our tradition of
the president alone deciding who will accompany him. Throughout the
Cold War, the White House maintained control of its traveling
party; anti-Communist journalists and scholars who could never get
a visa otherwise would fly in under the president's wing.
</P>
<P>
   Feng Xiao Ming is a reporter for Radio Free Asia, an independent
corporation financed by the U.S. government whose unwelcome truth
China tries to jam. Nine years ago, he was covering the Tiananmen
demonstrations as an employee of Chinese State Television.
</P>
<P>
   Feng's tape showed state journalists joining the demonstrators
in hoisting signs hailing democracy. ``The censor didn't show up in
all the excitement, so we broadcast it.'' Because the errant censor
got the blame, Feng was permitted to come to the United States to
study and is now an American citizen. He is one of the three Radio
Free Asia journalists whose names China struck from the list
covering the Clinton visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton immediately wimped out, and explained to Feng in a
get-over-it interview that ``every nation reserves to itself the
complete and unilateral right to decide its visa policies.''
</P>
<P>
   But legalistic Clinton got the principle all wrong. Summit
custom trumps that right. We routinely allowed KGB ``newsmen'' in
at summits here, and American reporters turned down for Moscow and
Beijing summits knew it was a grimly smiling Nixon, not the Soviets
or Chinese, who denied them a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's pusillanimity, how should Congress respond? The
RFA budget is now $22 million; given $2 million more, we could
broadcast an additional six hours a week in Tibetan and expand the
service in Uyghur to the Turkic Chinese in far-off Xinjiang. John
Porter of Illinois, who sponsored RFA in the House, says, ``I think
the leadership would support such an initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   A suggested name for the supplemental appropriation: ``To
commemorate President Clinton's historic visit to China.''

FOX BECOMING LAUGHINGSTOCK OF BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing the guys who run Fox, and the Dodgers, need is
some sportswriter telling them what to do. They sort of made that
clear when they fired the general manager, one-time sportswriter
Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone can appreciate a little advise, a glimpse into what
people are thinking about them. We're all human, and therefore a
little bit insecure, like the guy who asks his doctor for Viagra,
you know, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a snippet, fellas. Take it graciously.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are laughing at you.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans are angry at you.
</P>
<P>
   And those who aren't chuckling or mad are prepared to blow you
off.
</P>
<P>
   All this is the result of what you have done to the Dodgers
since taking over the operation of the team this spring. At that
time, your first official act was to assure everyone, from fellow
owners who OK'd the sale to the little guy sitting in the pavilion,
that you would handle the team and its image as if it were a
Faberge Egg.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you've scrambled everything. If one didn't know better,
one would think Ally McBeal is making these scatter-brained
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The people laughing at you are your intimates, the
Steinbrenners, Turners and Disneyites. They're the fellas who
provided you with some of your motivation and desire to buy a
baseball team and trump them at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   They really didn't want to see you get your hands on the
Dodgers. They've seen how successful you've become in creating a
fourth TV network and gobbling up regional cable sports. They
feared the potential positive impact an aggressive Fox might have
on the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're laughing at the way you've screwed up the best
thing going in baseball. They can barely contain their glee over
your flop sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Peter O'Malley only was losing money because he was a
cash-and-carry guy. He didn't like debt. And whatever O'Malley's
losses were could be traced to baseball's ignorance, not his own.
Steinbrenner and Jerry Reinsdorf were costing him money.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers basically have been a cash cow for years. In the
last 20 years, since 1978, the Dodgers topped 3 million in home
attendance 12 times. In five other years, they topped 2.5 million.
The only years they didn't hit either figure were the strike years
of 1981 and 1994, and 1992, when the team lost 99 games.
</P>
<P>
   Now why would you do anything to confuse or anger that kind of
fan support? People talk about the Dodgers' on-field malaise since
1988, the last World Series win, but one could actually say they've
had just one good year since 1982. Your friends in New York would
be the first to add, too, that the 1981 World Series win was
strike-tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Disney would kill a rat for this kind of loyalty. Even with a
renovated stadium and team in a pennant race, the Angels have had
only three sellouts this season. The Yankees still have cachet in
baseball, but the reality is that George Steinbrenner's team can't
draw like it once did. Four of the last seven years, the Yanks,
world champs in 1996, couldn't crack 2 million in home attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Your losses are their guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   The people who are angry at you are among the loyal 3 million.
They have been attending Dodgers games for 20-to-40 years in part
because they liked the team's image. It meant something to be a
Dodger fan, something beyond the team's place in the National
League standings.
</P>
<P>
   Call it nobility, call it loyalty, call it naive. Whatever it
was, it worked for the Dodgers up until now. Fans were loyal to the
Dodgers because they weren't the Yankees. The
once-a-Dodger-always-a-Dodger philosophy has always carried weight
in baseball, even among those who consider it arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that philosophy has has been trashed. Steve Garvey may have
left the Dodgers as a free agent, but he'll always be a Dodger. Can
we say that now about Mike Piazza? Can we ever look Gary Sheffield
in the eye and not see Piazza?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers needed to make some changes on the field, but I
doubt if most fans thought the changes should start with Piazza and
Hideo Nomo and include Bobby Bonilla and Greg McMichael as
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   It may be dandy to have the characters in ``Melrose Place''
screwing each other, too, but watching the Dodgers do it watching
Tommy Lasorda become GM at the expense of career Dodgers like
Claire and Bill Russell leaves one bleeding Dodger blue.
</P>
<P>
   (I guess we now know why Lasorda didn't question Fox's
upper-level decision to trade Piazza to Florida. He obviously
wanted to stay on your good side in hopes of getting the job he
wanted. The saddest part of Lasorda's rise is the way he's turned
on people he said he loved.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if half of the 3 million felt Claire and Russell weren't
cutting it, they would have voted for a respectful transition.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger Stadium has been a cathedral and 3 million came to mass
every year. In light of this 180 degree turn of events, many fans
may start humming R.E.M.'s ``Losing My Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to those who will blow you off.
</P>
<P>
   This is another area where Los Angeles is different. It is
loyal, but not blind. It has seen its share of carpetbagger owners
and worse, and it responds accordingly in the way which hits home
quickest: It ignores you.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A would be the Los Angeles Rams. Exhibit B would be the
Los Angeles Raiders. They both left to sounds of silence. Few
hearts were broken.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger fans do not want to hear a player they love complain
about his contract. They do not want to see favorites shuffled to
other cities. They do not want management to exercise its privilege
with heavy hands. They do not want to see bloody knives of internal
chaos. They do not want the image that they have adored for 40
years cracked in a day.
</P>
<P>
   If it's enough to know people are talking about you, then Fox
should be happy. My advice would be to listen to what is being
said, too, lest you wake up one day and find out that no one cares.

 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seventeen years after AIDS was first recognized
among gay white men in New York and San Francisco, the disease in
this country is becoming largely an epidemic among black people,
quietly devastating families and neighborhoods, yet all but ignored
by leading black institutions.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans make up 13 percent of the U.S. population. But
they now account for about 57 percent of all new infections with
human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among people age
13 to 24, the estimate, based on data collected from 25 states
between January 1994 and June 1997, is even higher: 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while the death rate from AIDS is dropping over all, the
disease remains the leading cause of death among black people age
25 to 44. Dr. David Satcher, the new surgeon general, said, ``I
don't think there is any question that the epidemic in this country
is becoming increasingly an epidemic of color.''
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of AIDS experts gather in Geneva for the 12th World
AIDS Conference, much of the attention is being focused on Africa,
where HIV is so prevalent in some regions that one in four adults
is infected. The situation in the United States is not nearly as
dire; the recent demographic shifts in the domestic epidemic are
due more to a sharp drop in cases among whites than an increase
among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as the racial disparities grow, many worry that
AIDS will become marginalized, just another inner-city problem,
like crime or drugs or graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS services have not kept pace with the demographic changes.
The lack of education about the disease among poor black people is
profound, in large part because few prevention programs have been
tailored to them. One prevailing myth is that Magic Johnson, the
retired basketball star, has been cured. Another is that only gay
men are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a disbelief that African-Americans are at
risk,'' said Lisa Gray, who runs an AIDS education program for
black women who live in public housing here. ``A lot of people
don't know how the virus is transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   While ignorance is fueling the spread of the virus, public
health experts like Satcher complain that the epidemic has been
greeted with deafening silence by civil rights groups and by black
preachers, long an important force in African-American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the black church,'' Satcher said. ``I think the
church has problems with the lifestyle of homosexuality. A real
problem has been getting ministers that are even willing to talk
about it in their pulpits.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few who does is the Rev. Kwabena Rainey Cheeks, the
46-year-old pastor of the Inner Light Unity Fellowship Church here.
AIDS, said Cheeks, who has been HIV-positive for 14 years, ``is
like the pink elephant that nobody wants to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears to be true among civil rights leaders as well. The
nation's two largest largest black civil rights groups, the Urban
League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, will hold their annual conventions this summer; AIDS is on
neither agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outside of our traditional purview,'' said Lee Daniels, a
spokesman for the Urban League. The NAACP, which recently declared
AIDS a public health crisis, already has a health issue on its
conference roster: cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exasperating,'' complained Rep. Louis Stokes, the Ohio
Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus' health
committee. The caucus recently asked the Clinton administration to
declare AIDS a national public health emergency among black people,
a move Stokes said he hoped would rally civil rights leaders.
``But,'' he said, ``this is one that black leadership has shied
away from.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is not only black leaders who are silent. Unlike white
gay men, who are extremely open about AIDS and have raised millions
to create powerful organizations to combat the epidemic, most black
people who are infected tend to keep their diagnosis a secret,
health experts agree. That is due to the disease's twin taboos,
which are especially strong among African-Americans: homosexuality
and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you deal with AIDS you have to deal with all of the
issues, all of the -isms of our community,'' said Cheeks. ``You
can't touch AIDS and not deal with homophobia, drug abuse,
homelessness. It touches all of the things that people don't want
to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Those perceptions, however, can be misleading. Among black
women, who represent 56 percent of the total AIDS cases among
females, heterosexual sex has surpassed injection drug use as the
most common route of transmission. Many have no idea they are at
risk; often, they do not find out they are HIV-positive until they
become pregnant, when testing is routine.
</P>
<P>
   They are women like Renee, a statuesque 22-year-old who insisted
on being identified only by her middle name. She lives with her
5-year-old son on the top floor of a pretty brick building; the
apartment marks her first step out of poverty. A high school
dropout, she attends school to learn carpentry and obtain her
equivalency diploma.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Felix Komarov isn't actually everywhere doing
everything. It can just seem that way.
</P>
<P>
   In barely six years in the United States, Komarov, a portly
Russian whirlwind who favors black leisure ensembles by his friend
Bijan, has built a multimillion-dollar art and jewelry business out
of a Fifth Avenue gallery and three workshops that render the
designs of some of Russia's top artists.
</P>
<P>
   He has become a patron of culture and charitable causes, founded
a weekly Russian-language newspaper in New York and started a
Rolls-Royce dealership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And just this month, he opened a lavish three-story Russian
cabaret-restaurant on Manhattan's East Side. Earlier this year, he
celebrated his 50th birthday with a party for 500 in the cabaret's
unfinished space. The guests included Russian entrepreneurs and
aristocrats and the country's pre-eminent living poet, Yevgeny
Yevtushenko.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he cannot seem to do, however, is lay to rest
questions that have publicly dogged him since FBI court papers
linked him to a man federal prosecutors called the Russian
godfather in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, and
to other Russian organized-crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   With patient if wary good humor, Komarov says he has met and
talked to Ivankov and others named by the FBI, but he dismisses the
encounters as inconsequential and innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI office in New York said it would have no comment on
Komarov, who holds a green card and has never been charged with a
crime in the United States. Police authorities in Russia said they
had no information to share on Komarov.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in his Russian World Gallery and his Club Moscow,
Komarov sought to dispel the air of mystery that even friends say
clings to his entrepreneurial ventures. All the while, however, he
managed to invite only more questions about his associations and
his wealth, which he says grew out of import-export trading as the
Soviet Union was collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not someone divine or supernatural,'' he said in Russian
through a bilingual American associate. ``I'm a real person. Of
course, I have my shortcomings, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Komarov praise his generosity but say they know
little of his financial affairs. ``Behind the mirror is a mirror,''
recited Zoya Boguslavskaya, the Russian writer and critic, who flew
to New York in January for Komarov's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Komarov shuttles between his gallery and his
nightclub, furnished with folk artifacts, czarist antiques and
hundreds of horseshoes that Komarov collected and personally nailed
to the walls for good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very real Russia,'' he said in English as a spirited
troupe of costumed musicians and dancers entertained one recent
night. ``This no show. This culture!''
</P>
<P>
   His only partner in the enterprise, he said, was Simon
Millerman, who owns a minority share and who came to Komarov after
managing tennis clubs in Brooklyn and working at a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Komarov's Fifth Avenue gallery, which opened in January 1997,
displays jewelry, ominous balloon-head paintings by Oleg Tselkov
and whimsical silver carnival figures by Mihail Chemiakin, another
leading Russian sculptor who also designed the gallery's series of
palm-size carnival figurines in precious metals, gems and lapis
lazuli, costing up to $53,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Komarov also produces the Golden Elf statuette, designed by
Neizvestny and presented to winners of Russia's leading cultural
prize, the Triumph Awards. He put the gallery's gross sales in a
year and a half at about $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's been quite a journey, by his account, from proletarian
origins. His father served the military as a professor and his
mother was a doctor. He said he quit a government engineering job
when he found that associates were reporting on him to the
ministry. He said he then worked in construction, dealt on the side
in fruits and vegetables, worked for theatrical producers and built
up a clothing import business.
</P>
<P>
   After two visits to scout business opportunities in New York and
Los Angeles in 1990, he said, he came for good in 1992, leaving his
wife and their grown son, Roman, in Moscow. With a nest egg of
$300,000 and a $150,000 advance payment against future clothing
shipments to trading partners in Russia, he said, he bought a
$400,000 co-op apartment on Manhattan's East Side. He spent up to
$800,000 decorating it, he has said, and later bought a $450,000
apartment in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he joined with Peter G. Terian, the owner of Rally
Motors, a BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Rolls-Royce dealership on Long
Island, to open a Rolls-Royce salesroom in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit in support of a wiretap application in the
Ivankov investigation in 1995, Lester R. McNulty, an FBI agent in a
squad formed to combat Russian organized crime, quoted German law
enforcement officials and unnamed informants as stating that
Komarov was laundering money for Ivankov and that Ivankov and two
criminal associates owned three-quarters of the Moscow Rolls-Royce
dealership as a front to launder criminal proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Ivankov was convicted in 1996 of trying to extort $3.5 million
from two Russian emigre businessmen and faking a marriage to enter
the country, and was sentenced to nine years and seven months in
prison. Komarov was not charged or called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Terian said in a telephone interview that he had first met
Komarov as a customer. They agreed to become partners in Moscow,
Terian said, along with a former Rally Motors salesman who no
longer plays a role in the business. He said that Komarov's son,
Roman, ran the dealership but that heavy import taxes had hurt
sales, raising the cost of a Rolls-Royce in Moscow to about
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Terian said he had never heard of the FBI affidavit, which
quoted informants alleging that Ivankov and two other Russian
organized crime figures each held 25 percent interests in the
Rolls-Royce dealership and that that it was ``merely a front'' used
by Ivankov ``to launder proceeds from illegal activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it comes here,'' Terian said when told about the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Terian said that he did not know Ivankov or the two others but
that if the allegations were true, ``I would have to disengage
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Komarov dismissed the allegations as baseless, saying Terian was
his only partner.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The allegations in the affidavit were disclosed last September
in an article in The Washington Times as Komarov was about to serve
as host of a gala party and concert at Carnegie Hall celebrating
Moscow's 850th birthday. ``I was really very upset,'' Komarov said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he first met Ivankov at a crowded banquet several years
before Ivankov's arrest in June 1995. He said they had met since
and that Ivankov called him several times from prison, ``but we
never had any one-on-one and we never had any joint business.''
</P>
<P>
   As for FBI allegations that he had Ivankov's phone number and
called him in February 1994, Komarov said, ``It's quite possible.''
Besides, he said, ``I had no reason not to call him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what they had talked about that day, Komarov said, ``I
have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivankov's lawyer, Barry I. Slotnick, said his client would have
nothing to say about Komarov.
</P>

<P>
   At other times, Komarov joked about the matter, describing some
of his gallery's carnival figurines as ``Mafia production,'' and
grumbling: ``Hmf, Mafia! If they work like I do 24 hours a day, it
would be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he applied in his own name for the club liquor license
to show that he had nothing to hide. He got the license. He denied
one FBI agent's account that he had employed a bodyguard in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me?'' he said, ridiculing the story.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, through contacts with American friends, he said,
Komarov attended President Clinton's second inauguration in
Washington. Could he have gone, he asked, if any cloud hung over
his name?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Komarov said, he has been scouting the city for
promising sites for a Russian cultural center and library he wants
to establish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really get a rush from life. I love life,'' he said. ``I do
what others dream about but perhaps can't.''

AFTER SHARP RISE AND SHARPER FALL, A COACH LOOKS FOR A BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   That terrible night, that terrible period, can never be wiped
away, or excused, or ignored. Kevin Mackey understands this.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey was once called the king of Cleveland and a civic
treasure, rising to prominence when his underdog Cleveland State
basketball team upset Bob Knight's powerful, methodical Indiana
Hoosiers in the first round of the 1986 NCAA tournament. A few
years later, Mackey's wondrous world collapsed in a welter of
alcohol and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He has been trying to put it back together ever since, in places
like Argentina, South Korea, Portland, Maine, and Atlantic City,
N.J., where he is now coach of the minor league Seagulls. The team
had the second-best record in the U.S. Basketball League this
season and was playing in the semifinals Sunday night in Asbury
Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, 52, hopes to return to big-time college basketball one
day, or to get a shot in the NBA as an assistant coach or a scout.
So far, all doors have been closed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for the opportunity to be in the USBL,'' he said
recently, ``but it's like being in the witness protection program.
No one knows if you're still alive, and no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   When he has sat down with a prospective employer, one who is
considering using his proven skills as a basketball coach _ as was
the case last winter with Ken Gross, the owner of the Seagulls _
Mackey has brought up his past immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' he tells the person across the desk. ``It
was nobody's fault but my own. I've been paying for it. I'm clean
now. The problem and the answer is in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, a ``squatty guy,'' by his definition, with a shock of
gray at the front of his short, dark hair, possesses the gift of
glibness, and he speaks directly about the past that has caused him
so much anguish for the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   On an early July evening in 1990, the police stopped a blue
Lincoln Continental weaving down a street in a squalid area of
Cleveland's east side. The driver was Kevin Mackey, then 43, the
respected local college coach, married, the father of three
children, who lived in a large brick house in a leafy section of
town. Mackey was coming from a crack cocaine house, where he had
spent the previous five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Five days earlier, Mackey had signed a two-year contract with
Cleveland State worth $300,000. ``It was all blue skies and green
lights,'' he recalled. There had been recruiting violations under
Mackey, but that was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   But then, five days after the arrest, he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey had begun drinking as a 16-year-old in Somerville, Mass.,
a suburb of Boston. It escalated, and he went from that to drugs to
his crash in 1990. ``It was a descent into hell,'' he said. Despite
making a good salary, he regularly asked friends for money. When
they expressed bafflement, he made excuses about unexpected
recruiting expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When his dark double life was finally discovered, it seemed a
relief. After pleading no contest to charges of cocaine abuse and
driving under the influence of alcohol, Mackey was ordered to spend
60 days in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``I can try to get my life back in order.''
</P>
<P>
   He is doing it the way he knows best. By coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his arrest, Mackey never really left the profession.
Shortly after his firing, John Lucas, a former NBA player and then
the coach of the San Antonio Spurs, called Mackey. Lucas is a
recovering drug alcohol addict who had a rehabilitation center in
Houston and reached out to sports figures. He invited Mackey to
spend time with him. Mackey was in rehab there and in another
center, and, he says, it changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did I confront my addiction there,'' he said, ``but
John Lucas was instrumental in getting me back into coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas helped get Mackey an assistant's job with Atlanta of the
USBL just a season after he had been dismissed at Cleveland State.
One month later, the Miami Tropics hired Mackey to be their head
coach, and he went on to win a division championship with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who has a better eye for talent than
Kevin Mackey,'' Lucas said. ``As a coach, he's demanding, a
disciplinarian. I have a lot of respect for him. When I went to
Philadelphia to coach the 76ers, I considered Kevin as one of my
assistants. But with me and one or two other guys who had had drug
and alcohol problems, the timing just wasn't right, and I was
advised by management not to go ahead with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey began moving around the globe in pursuit of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the low point was in Argentina, where the bus went for
two days from one town whose name I couldn't pronounce to the
next,'' he said. ``We'd sleep on the bus, and some of the players
were difficult. They'd say: `I don't have to play defense. I'm a
national star. Get someone else to do it. I shoot.' But then you'd
get a win, and everything is good again. That never changes
wherever you are in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey went to the Continental Basketball League and coached the
Albany Patroons to a second-place finish. He was coach of the year
with the Fayetteville, N.C., team of the Global Basketball
Association. Last season he coached Atlantic City to the USBL
championship and was named coach of the year. Last fall he was a
consultant for a team in Seoul, South Korea. This fall he will
coach a team in Ohio in the International Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   For now, his attention is on the Atlantic City job, for which he
is paid $25,000 to coach the Seagulls in the eight-week summer
league.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City defeated Atlanta, 118-107, on Saturday to advance
to last night's semifinal game against Jacksonville. The
championship game is Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing for him,'' said Paul ``Snoop'' Graham of the
Seagulls, a guard who formerly played for the Atlanta Hawks. ``He
knows how to relate to players, which is the most important thing
in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey said: ``We root for each other. Every player has had
someone in their family, or a friend, or themselves, with an
addiction problem. These guys don't come from the moon. We
understand each other.''

 UNDATED: each other.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the court, Mackey is intense, directing his players with
shouts and then grabbing the ubiquitous Diet Coke on the scorer's
table and draining it like a parched man in a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of his bench, Mackey shouts at his players,
who are trotting back on defense: ``Get back! Get back!'' When the
team gets a defensive rebound, he shouts: ``Hurry it up! Hurry it
up!'' His aggressiveness for both defense and offense is a
trademark of his style that goes back to when he began his coaching
career.
</P>
<P>
   He won state championships with Don Bosco High School in Boston.
He was an assistant coach and a marvel of a recruiter for six years
with Boston College, bringing in players like Michael Adams and
John Bagley, whom few others thought could make the big time.
</P>
<P>
   He did the same at Cleveland State, a school that had a string
of losing seasons before he arrived in 1983, but which he built
into a nationally ranked team that averaged 20 victories for seven
seasons, got as far as the NCAA tournament's Round of 16 and twice
played in the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey worked hard recruiting players whom no one else wanted.
``I'd scour the playgrounds, the AAU games, wherever there were
players, looking for guys who had either gone to the wrong school,
had the wrong coach, or went to the wrong summer basketball camps.
I've got a place in my heart for guys caught with the end of the
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those players, Ken ``Mouse'' McFadden, a 5-foot-10-inch
guard from New York City, had dropped out of high school but got a
general equivalency diploma and became one of Mackey's best players
at Cleveland State. He starred in the 83-79 victory over Indiana,
which Mackey said ``put Cleveland State and me on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Mackey is trying to find his place on the map again. He is
separated from his wife, but after reconciliation is in contact
with his three grown children. And he is still coaching winning
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job for us,'' said Gross, the Seagulls
owner. ``He's great with the players, the fans and the press. And
no one works harder at his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said he had ``made some calls for Kevin, trying to get him
hooked up. So far, no luck.''
</P>
<P>
   John Nash, general manager of the Nets, has attended some of the
Seagulls' homes games, played in the 2,500-seat Atlantic City High
School sports complex, and observed Mackey as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Gross recommended Mackey to me,'' Nash said. ``But John
Calipari is the coach, and he hires his assistants, and he knows
Kevin. And his staff was set. I do think Kevin is qualified to be
an NBA assistant coach or scout. No question about it. He's coached
successfully on the pro level, and he's coached successfully on the
college level. And he has to be a good evaluator of talent to put
together those teams. We just don't have any openings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, sitting recently at breakfast in the coffee shop of the
hotel he is living at in Atlantic City, was asked whether he
thought he was being blackballed. ``If it happens, it would be more
on the college level than the pros,'' he said. ``The pros want to
win, and a lot of them have had addiction problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a buddy network up there, and people hire their
friends. Like a big fraternity. It happens that I've had a lot of
friends _ so-called friends _ not return my phone calls. But I
still have hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'd be willing to be tested. Please, test me every day.
I'd waive any rights to prove I'm clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did wrong, and I expected to pay for it. And I have. But
it's been eight-plus years. How long must that punishment go on?'' &QL;

WASHBURN MAINTAINS CONFIDENCE LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Angels manager Terry Collins marvels at the
confidence of 23-year-old pitcher Jarrod Washburn. But Washburn,
who improved to 4-0 with seven strong innings Sunday against the
Padres, said it hasn't always been that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a very tough first half of the season at
(Double-A) Midland last year,'' Washburn said. ``I was getting hit
all over the place. My confidence went down a lot and my ERA was
around seven. After games, I'd be all (ticked) off. About halfway
through the season, I said, `Screw it. I can't worry about it
anymore.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then I've kept the same confidence level. If I have
a bad game, I forget about it and get ready for the next one. My
confidence level right now is the same as it would be if I was
0-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Routine but fancy: Second baseman Justin Baughman and first
baseman Cecil Fielder teamed up to make a play Sunday against the
Padres that certainly will be shown on the highlight shows for a
while. But it didn't have to be such a tough play.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' Tony Gwynn hit a chopper toward second that Baughman
charged. He tried to short-hop it, but he dropped it. Baughman then
flipped the ball off the ground with his glove to Fielder, who
caught it with his bare hand for the final out of the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gwynn) doesn't run well, but I tried to hurry,'' Baughman
said. ``If I just played it on a hop, I would have been OK. But
Cecil make a great bare-handed catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Swings for Salmon: After taking today off, the Angels will begin
a six-game homestand against the Giants and A's. One of the best
things about being at home, Collins says, is the fact that the
Angels get to use the designated hitter Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had a cortisone shot in his sore left foot last Monday
and appeared in only one of the five games at Dodger Stadium and
Qualcomm Stadium, drawing a walk in Sunday's game in his only plate
appearance. But he will hit in his usual cleanup spot again Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can say or write whatever they want about the DH, but
that's our game,'' Collins said. ``Is it fun to manage with the
pitcher in the lineup? You bet. But I can't wait to have Tim Salmon
back in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Versatile Olivares: When Salmon walked in his appearance Sunday,
Collins had pitcher Omar Olivares pinch run. Olivares went to third
on a double by Darin Erstad and scored on a single by Craig
Shipley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do a lot of things,'' Collins said of Olivares. ``He
can hit, he can run. He's been playing a long time.''

MURPHY'S `DR. DOLITTLE' DOES A LOT OF BUSINESS AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Eddie Murphy's star power dominated the nation's
box office, as the opening of ``Dr. Dolittle'' took in an estimated
$29 million at 2,777 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's comic revamp of the 1967 musical performed
well above forecasts, as audiences responded impressively to a
canny promotional push highlighting the films wisecracking animal
voices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mixed reviews, the $70 million project should continue
to perform well for several more weeks due to its status as the
only mass-appeal comedy in the market coupled with Murphy's
popularity. Though ``Dr. Dolittle'' may not match the $128.8
million gross from another Murphy remake, 1996's ``The Nutty
Professor,'' it should hit the $100 million mark by the end of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't be happier,'' said Tom Sherak, chief of Fox's
domestic film operations, who noted that the opening was $4 million
higher than ``The Nutty Professor.'' ``Eddie Murphy's done it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's second weekend of ``Mulan,'' with Murphy as the voice
of a comical dragon, finished a strong second with $16.7 million at
2,921 theaters, dropping only 31 percent from its debut weekend.
The animated Chinese folk tale has taken in almost $54 million
after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top two films represented pleasant surprises for both
studios.'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy's drawing power is still awesome and the campaign for
`Mulan' has worked very well, much better than `Hercules' did last
summer,'' Rockwell said, adding that ``Mulan'' now looks to be
highly profitable. Disney's 36th animated movie should perform well
in overseas, merchandise and home video markets.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's second weekend of ``The X-Files'' suffered a sharp
fall-off in third, taking in $13.3 million at 2,647 theaters but
losing 55 percent of its debut audience. Sherak said the decline
was understandable, given that ``The X-Files'' TV show is so well
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken in $55 million in 10 days with `The X-Files' and
we'll do great in overseas markets, so everyone is pretty happy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's opening of George Clooney's ``Out of Sight,'' with
the ``ER'' star playing an escaped convict in a combination of
romantic comedy and action-drama, performed respectably in fourth
with $11.9 million at 2,105 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the decline for ``X-Files'' showed that nonfans of
the TV show are not turning out in significant numbers. He added
that the nonblockbuster returns for ``Out of Sight,'' which
received the strongest reviews for any mainstream release since
``The Truman Show,'' underscore the difficulty faced by TV stars
such as Clooney in making the transition to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fourth weekend of ``The Truman Show'' came in fifth,
with $8.6 million at 2,911 theaters, giving the comedy-fantasy more
than $99 million in 24 days. The Jim Carrey project will join
``Deep Impact'' and ``Godzilla'' today or Tuesday as the only 1998
releases to cross the $100 million milestone. It will also become
the 159th movie in Hollywood history to cross that barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' followed,
with a solid $7.5 million at 2,606 theaters, to go past $47 million
in 17 days and top Warner Bros.' fourth weekend of ``A Perfect
Murder,'' which had $5.1 million at 2,738 locations, pushing it to
$55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Fox's fifth weekend of ``Hope
Floats,'' with $2.2 million at 1,450 sites, Sony's third weekend of
``Can't Hardly Wait,'' with $2 million at 1,855 theaters, and
Paramount's eighth weekend of ``Deep Impact,'' with $1.7 million at
1,617 screens. Disney's seventh weekend of ``The Horse Whisperer''
was also battling for 10th place.
</P>
<P>
   The results were enough to knock Sony's sixth weekend of
``Godzilla'' out of the top 10 for the first time as the
mega-lizard continued its fast fade with $1.5 million at 1,910
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact'' has $135.9 million after 52 days, giving it 73rd
place on the all-time domestic list, behind ``Ransom,'' at $136.4
million. ``Godzilla,'' now with $132.5 million, is 80th on the
all-time list, behind ``The Rock,'' at $134 million.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, New Line's restored version
of ``Gone With the Wind,'' performed impressively with $1.2 million
at 214 theaters. That lifted the overall total for the 1939 epic to
$193.1 million, 25th on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's 28th weekend of ``Titanic'' grossed a still-solid
$945,000 at 688 sites and has now taken in $587.1 million after 192
days. ``Titanic'' leads ``Star Wars'' as best domestic grosser by
$126 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business was better than the same weekend last year,
when ``Face/Off'' opened with $23.4 million. Year-to-date domestic
box office is approaching $2.9 billion, or 7 percent ahead of the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dolittle'' will face serious competition during the
upcoming holiday weekend from Disney's opening of ``Armageddon,''
starring Bruce Willis trying to save the world from a Texas-size
asteroid. ``Armageddon,'' which comes on the heels of the biggest
campaign since ``Godzilla,'' opens Wednesday.

ITALIAN LEADER TO VISIT IRAN THIS WEEK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi will make an
official visit to Iran this week, the first by a head of government
from a European Union country since the 1979 revolution here,
Iranian and Italian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi, who is to arrive on Tuesday, is scheduled to meet
President Mohammad Khatami and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani. But there are no plans for Prodi to meet Iran's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi has consulted with President Clinton and European leaders
and will report back to them upon his return, Ricardo Levi, Prodi's
spokesman, said in Rome on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The visit underscores a new willingness by the Europeans to
forge closer ties with Iran in the aftermath of Khatami's election
in May 1997. Khatami has tried to reach out to European and Arab
leaders, and he plans to address the U.N. General Assembly in New
York this fall. He and Clinton are scheduled to speak on the same
day, although in the absence of diplomatic relations, the two
presidents have no plans to meet. &QL;

ANGELS ROOKIES LEAD THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Justin Baughman and Jarrod Washburn are rookies with
the Angels, which means they are meant to be seen and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   But given the opportunity to express themselves on the field,
they are making plenty of noise.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman and Washburn, both of whom started the season in the
minors, teamed up to lead the Angels to an 11-3 victory over the
San Diego Padres on Sunday afternoon before 41,574 at Qualcomm
Stadium, avoiding a series sweep.
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels, the win was No.21 in the month of June, the most
they've had in any month in the history of the franchise. Their
48-32 record matches the Angels teams in 1970, '89 and '95 as the
best after 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels increased their AL West lead over Texas to 2{ games,
while San Diego's lead over San Francisco was reduced to 5{ games
in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baughman and Washburn have played well since becoming major
leaguers, but Sunday the Angels needed it most. After playing big
games against the Rangers, Mariners and Dodgers recently, the
Angels were flat in losing the first two games of the series to the
Padres. But the rookies gave the team a jump start.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman went 4 for 5 with two RBI and a run scored to pace the
Angels' 14-hit attack, while Washburn improved to 4-0 after giving
up two runs and eight hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got home runs from Cecil Fielder (No.14) and
Garret Anderson (No. 9).
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, who did not walk a batter, has made six starts with
the Angels since being called up June 2 to replace the injured Jack
McDowell, and the Angels have won all six games.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, called up May 16 to replace the injured Randy Velarde,
raised his average to .274 with his first career four-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin Baughman last year was in (Single-A) Lake Elsinore, and
Jarrod Washburn was in Double-A (Midland),'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``You look at all the people we have up here that are
home grown. It's a tribute to what our scouts and
player-development people have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman and Washburn have lockers next to each other in the
Edison Field clubhouse, so they are able to lean on each other when
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rookies aren't always allowed to talk,'' Washburn said, ``so
we talk to each other. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes,'' Baughman said. ``Sometimes you have to
watch what you say or watch what you do off the field. He's been a
help to me and I've been a help to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn got some help from pitching coach Marcel Lachemann
between starts, which helped correct a flaw in his delivery and
resulted in Washburn giving up no walks on Sunday. But his best
attribute is the way he handles the spotlight, according to
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, his presence on the mound,'' Collins said.
``He's got great composure. He knows what he has to do and he never
gets away from that. You never see him, when he gets in trouble,
overthrow the ball or try to throw such a nasty curveball it
bounces in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had spent time during the weekend complaining about
the National League strike zone, and finally third baseman Dave
Hollins had seen enough. After being called out on strikes on a
ball that was low and inside in the third inning, Hollins argued
with plate umpire Mark Wegner long enough to get ejected.
</P>
<P>
   But the strike zone was not a factor the rest of the way for the
Angels. The Angels led 1-0 in the third when Padres starter Joey
Hamilton (5-9) hurt his own cause by making two errors in the
inning. It led to two unearned runs and a 3-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder's second homer of the series made it 5-0 in the seventh,
and Baughman's RBI double later in the inning put the Angels up
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn allowed a two-run double to Andy Sheets in the bottom
of the seventh, but the Angels put the game away with five runs in
the eighth, three coming in on Anderson's homer.
</P>

MAN SHOOTING AT ANOTHER HITS TOURIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (ja) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A tourist from Florida was shot in the leg in midtown
Manhattan Sunday morning by an apparently deranged man who was
firing at someone else _ a homeless man who had asked him to quiet
down, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred shortly before 10 a.m. as the tourist,
Pamela Turk, 41, a mother of two from Boca Raton, was walking on
the Avenue of the Americas near 56th Street en route to a museum,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man suspected in the shooting, John Palmer, 58, of
Manhattan, was walking down the street muttering to himself and
yelling when he was confronted by the homeless man, who was not
identified by the police. A police investigator who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said that the homeless man asked Palmer,
``What are you mumbling about?''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer cursed at the man, told him to shut up, then pulled out a
.380 caliber revolver and fired five shots, the police said. None
hit the homeless man, but one hit Mrs. Turk. Not immediately
realizing that she had been struck, she ran for cover into a deli
on the corner, said her husband, Jonathan Turk, in a telephone
interview from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Turk had just left her hotel, the St. Moritz on Central
Park South, said her husband, who was preparing to fly to New York
Sunday afternoon. ``She was walking around with a friend when they
heard a couple of pops,'' he said. ``They went inside to a store or
restaurant and then they saw she was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   J.H. Park, who works at the deli, Chambord Royale, said he heard
the shots and saw Mrs. Turk stumble into the store with her friend,
weeping and holding the back of her leg. As he gave Mrs. Turk some
napkins to stanch the bleeding, he said, the police came. Mrs. Turk
was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she was in stable condition
Sunday. ``It was so fast,'' Park said. ``It all happened in two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was then chased down by two police officers from the
Midtown North precinct who were on routine patrol: Officers John
Powers, a 15-year veteran, and Dennis Lane, who has been on the
force for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was carrying a .380 semiautomatic pistol and had 26
rounds of ammunition crammed in his pockets when he was arrested,
the police said. Palmer told detectives that he had carried the gun
for two years, ``just in case'' someone annoyed him, the
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who rents a room on the Upper West Side, has an arrest
record dating back to 1963, said Officer Leslie Cardona, a Police
Department spokeswoman. Palmer was being held on charges of
attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and weapons
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Turk said that he had no harsh words for New York City. ``These
are things that happen throughout the whole country,'' he said.
``There are just too many handguns out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has often credited the city's
falling crime rate with drawing record numbers of tourists, visited
Mrs. Turk in Bellevue Hospital Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that Palmer appeared to have psychological
problems. ``He was walking along the street at about 10 in the
morning making a lot of noise, yelling and screaming,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was arrested in 1963, 1964, 1972 and 1977 on charges
ranging from burglary and attempted grand larceny to harassment,
the police said. Neighbors at Palmer's rooming house at 139 E. 78th
St., where he rented a room on the top floor for $235 a month, said
they were stunned by the shooting. Abraham Szmidt described Palmer
as a loner who kept to himself. ``I never heard him bother
anyone,'' he said. ``A gun? Never.''

STATEMENTS AT GAY PARADE RANGE FROM PASSIONATE TO PASSIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jani Carlson didn't wear an eye-popping costume or
wave a rainbow-hued flag to show her gay pride. She came with her
lesbian partner, and didn't even reach for her hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Carlson marched Sunday alongside hundreds of thousands
of people _ some in flamboyant costumes, some in ordinary street
clothes _ during the city's annual gay pride parade down Fifth
Avenue from 52nd Street to Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here because we want to make a statement,'' said Ms.
Carlson, an engineer from Brooklyn. ``We're lesbians and that's OK.
We're just like anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Pride March captivated spectators with
startling costumes, booming music and showy dancing, as it has done
for the past 28 years. Nearly 100 lesbian and gay motorcyclists
roared down the avenue. Transvestites clattered behind in clingy
evening gowns and stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   But the parade also brought out a quieter spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlson pointedly ignored the transvestites and turned to
her partner. ``That's not us, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which was organized by Heritage of Pride, capped off
a series of events across the country in recognition of Gay Pride
Week. Afterward, countless revelers danced at a street festival in
the West Village and at Pier 54 near 13th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a tense moment, 17 men and three women confronted Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani around 12:45 p.m. as he marched with gay
Republican supporters in front of the New York Public Library at
41st Street.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, who were chained together, wore white T-shirts
that read, ``Rudy Get Out of Our Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   They yelled and laid down across the avenue, forcing Giuliani to
stop for 10 seconds and then go around them by walking onto the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani passed by and rejoined the parade, police
officers dragged the activists into a van. They were charged with
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, and later released, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Joneil Adriano, who helped organize the protest, said his group,
Take Back the March, wanted to point out what he called Giuliani's
lack of action on violence against gay people and mandatory AIDS
education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're upset that after attacking our community the entire
year, he feels he can just waltz in and march with us,'' Adriano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians joining the parade were the city comptroller,
Alan Hevesi; Mark Green, the city's public advocate and a candidate
for U.S. Senate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is seeking
the Democratic nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The parade's grand marshals were Councilman Philip Reed, who
represents parts of Manhattan and the Bronx, and Councilwoman
Margarita Lopez, who represents the Lower East Side. Both are gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time when people believe you can only be elected in a gay
district is over,'' Ms. Lopez said. ``It's irrelevant if you're gay
or lesbian or transsexual. The question is: Which candidate goes
down to City Hall and fights for truth and justice?''
</P>
<P>
   For many marchers, homosexuality was neither a political nor a
social issue but was a deeply personal side of their lives that _
for one day _ they revealed to friends and strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come out dressed like this every day, but it's part of
my life,'' said Simone McKay, a RuPaul look-alike in a short black
sequined dress.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ewall, a businesswoman from Long Island, rode a big purple
Honda as a member of the Sirens Motorcycle Club.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't missed a parade since 1992, she said, and she didn't
plan to miss this one, even though she broke up with her partner
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a hesitation when someone asks you whether
you're seeing someone,'' said Ms. Ewall, who wore rainbow-colored
socks and displayed gay pride flags on her handlebars. ``It depends
on how well you know them whether you're going to say something or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Tanner, a Catholic who lives in Brooklyn, twirled a
rainbow-colored umbrella as he marched with Dignity New York Inc.,
a group of lesbian and gay Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to attend a religious service after the
parade. ``We're showing that you can be gay and Catholic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Lavender Light Gospel Choir showed off their
spirituality in loud, gutsy tones. Karen Gamble, a member of the
choir, said the gay and lesbian singers have performed in the
parade for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows people to know God loves us, whether we're gay or
not,'' she said. ``We still worship Him.''

PROGRAM TEACHING IN TWO LANGUAGES HAS A WAITING LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHAM, Conn. _ Kathy Lank knows only a few words in Spanish,
the remnants of high school language classes she remembers with a
shudder.
</P>
<P>
   That was one reason that she jumped at the chance to enroll her
daughter in an unusual bilingual education program here at the
North Windham Elementary School in which English and Spanish
speakers are taught in both languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember trying to learn a language in high school, and it
floored me,'' said Mrs. Lank, a part-time teacher's aide at the
school. But her fifth-grade daughter, Myralynn, seems to be picking
it up easily, learning both from her teachers as they instruct
students in two languages and from classmates whose native speech
is Spanish, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, with their friends, they speak half in English,
half in Spanish,'' Mrs. Lank said. ``Whatever language they're
talking, they're comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   In this system, known as a two-way bilingual program, most
subjects are taught in both languages, and both English-speaking
and Spanish-speaking students learn together. More commonly,
bilingual programs put children with limited English skills in
separate classes where they are taught in their native language
while learning English.
</P>
<P>
   As debate about bilingual education has swirled around the
country in the weeks since California voted to disband its
bilingual programs in favor of a one-year English immersion class,
Windham's bilingual classrooms have a waiting list _ parents of
both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking students are eager to
enroll their children. About 200 students take part in Windham's
program, which started in the 1992-93 school year with kindergarten
and has expanded a grade every year since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of speaking in a second language is an absolute
gift,'' said Jack Giordano, the principal at North Windham School.
``We're certainly positioning these students very well to be
successful in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-way bilingual classes, which started in Canada as a way to
teach French to English speakers and now number 225 in the United
States, are continuing to increase in popularity nationally and
here in Connecticut. Two other cities in the state, New Haven and
New Britain, have similar programs, as does a New London magnet
school serving a regional district. And the school district for New
London itself is planning to start a pilot program in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show such programs improve the English skills of
foreign-language students faster than traditional bilingual
programs, said Fred Genesee, director of the Division of Education
at the University of California at Davis, who is leading a national
study of two-way programs, including Windham's.
</P>
<P>
   Windham education officials hoped that the bilingual program
would help solve other problems faced by this struggling former
mill town 60 miles east of Hartford. As in many other school
districts, the regular bilingual programs had tended to segregate
minority students and English speakers, even though half the
system's students are Hispanic, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, students in those segregated classrooms felt stigmatized,
said Windham School Superintendent Patrick Proctor. ``This two-way
program brings kids together on a level playing field,'' he said.
``Each child is responsible for sharing and learning language.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide language tests are not administered until the fourth
grade, and so the two-way system hasn't had a chance to produce
conclusive test results, but they show that Spanish-speakers are
doing better than their counterparts in customary bilingual courses
and that English-speakers are holding their own.
</P>
<P>
   As in many two-way programs, Windham teachers teach classes in
Spanish one week, then in English the next. Students are also
taught the basics of their native language every day. But teachers
also have some flexibility. Wilson Soto Jr. teaches his fourth
graders mostly in English, but they work on projects in Spanish. He
taught science in English, then had students do projects on the
rain forest in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He said he tried to pair English-dominant and Spanish-dominant
students, so they could learn from each other. ``Instead of
separating students, it's unifying,'' Soto said. ``The children get
to see they have strengths in one language. It values that native
language, be it English or Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his students, Maricely Jimenez, who spent kindergarten in
a traditional bilingual program, said she spoke much more Spanish
in that class. ``In first grade, this was hard for me,'' she said,
``but as I got older, it became easier.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it is the English-dominant children who tend to get
lost, especially when their Spanish-speaking classmates start
talking quickly. ``They can read Spanish really, really fast,''
said Emily Rasicoz, 10. But, she added, ``once you get used to it
you can keep up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   She also finds use for Spanish at home. ``I talk a lot in
Spanish to my brother,'' she said. ``I make fun of him in Spanish.
And he can't beat me up because if he does I tell him it's
something nice.''

 McDOUGAL, THOUGH FREED, REMAINS FETTERED BY CHARGES  
 (EDS: fixes name of Whitewater company in 7th graf, minor editing
changes throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan McDougal was still wearing her orange prison suit, but the
look on her face was sheer joy as she shed her cuffs and leg chains
and savored the freedom granted her last week by a federal judge in
Arkansas. But she will have little time to celebrate or relax after
her official scheduled release from a California prison on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight days later, on July 13, Mrs. McDougal is scheduled to
be summoned to another courtroom to face another prosecutor. This
time her antagonist will not be Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel whose tactics she has compared to those of the
Nazis, but a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles. And this time
the charges she faces have nothing to do with politics, President
Clinton or the Whitewater development project.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a long-running but little-noticed court battle in
California, Mrs. McDougal, 43, stands accused of bilking Zubin
Mehta, the renowned orchestra conductor, and his wife, Nancy, of
more than $150,000 when she was their personal assistant and
bookkeeper from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who lived in one of the Mehta family's five
luxury homes and traveled across the United States and abroad for
Mehta's concerts, denies the charges. Her fiance, Pat Harris, said
she is a victim of Mrs. Mehta, whom he described as ``a very lonely
woman'' who ``attached on to Susan with a fervor I've never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the woman who chose to endure nearly two years of
incarceration rather than tell Starr what she knew about Clinton's
Arkansas financial dealings could be sentenced to seven more years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The image that Mrs. McDougal cultivates as ``an innocent
bystander of our generation's sleaziest witch hunt,'' as her legal
defense fund's online biography describes her, is sharply at odds
with the financial scam artist convicted by the Whitewater jury in
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She was found guilty of taking part in a fraudulent scheme to
obtain a $300,000 loan that was paid to a company she created
called Master Marketing. Part of the proceeds went to pay debts of
the Whitewater Development Co., in which she and her late husband,
James McDougal, were partners with the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Mrs. McDougal in California also paint her
as a perpetrator of financial fraud. They accuse her of forging
Mrs. Mehta's name on a credit card application and fraudulently
charging more than $90,000 of personal items, including expensive
clothes, hotel stays and personal air travel. She also is accused
of bilking the couple of $65,000 in falsely claimed expenses.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the prosecutor, Jeffrey Semow, said he expected the
trial to begin as scheduled, though the Arkansas judge who reduced
Mrs. McDougal's criminal contempt sentence to time served, on
health grounds, also ordered her to spend 90 days of house arrest
in the custody of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we're still going to trial,'' said
Semow, a Los Angeles deputy district attorney. ``I do not believe
he intended to preclude her from appearing at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Geragos, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, said in a recent interview
that the Mehta case would have been dropped long ago if the
defendant were not a prominent figure in the Whitewater
investigation. Geragos said Starr's prosecution team had used the
California charges as a ``club'' to make Mrs. McDougal cooperate,
an accusation Starr's team denies.
</P>
<P>
   Semow said he had not colluded in any way with Starr, adding
that he had no idea who Susan McDougal was when she was arraigned
in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Like Whitewater, some aspects of the Mehta case turn on murky
financial transactions. According to documents in the case, Mrs.
Mehta said she knew nothing of the credit card obtained by Mrs.
McDougal in 1989 until she received a surprise call from
BankAmerica asking whether she wanted to increase the credit limit
on the card. She later learned that Mrs. McDougal was having the
credit card bills sent to a mail drop in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Geragos, responding for his client, said Mrs. Mehta knew
about the credit card. He said she had agreed to the arrangement as
a way to compensate Mrs. McDougal for additional bookkeeping
services.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation has created problems. Mrs. McDougal did not
claim the payments as compensation on her taxes and is charged with
state income tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos also contended that his investigators recently found
several receipts from purchases on the credit card that had been
signed by Mrs. Mehta herself. He said a former bookkeeper for the
Mehtas is expected to provide testimony that may further undercut
Mrs. Mehta's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Mehtas' financial records, which form the backbone of
Semow's case, show several transactions in which Mrs. McDougal is
accused of making unauthorized personal purchases and charging them
to her employers. In 1991, these records say, she bought a dress
and a belt for herself at a Malibu boutique called Nikki's and
reported the $412 expense as a hotel charge for Mehta in Tokyo.
Investigators for the prosecution said the store manager had told
them that Mrs. McDougal wore the items out of the store.
</P>
<P>
   She also charged hotel stays and thousands of dollars of
personal air travel to the Mehtas, according to a financial audit
by the couple's accountant, Alan Byron, who testified at Mrs.
McDougal's preliminary hearing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The years she worked for the Mehtas were to be a balm for her
broken marriage to McDougal and the trail of financial failures she
left behind in Arkansas. In 1989, without a job or permanent place
to live, Mrs. McDougal and her boyfriend, Harris, decided to move
to Los Angeles. There, an employment agency sent Harris, who had
experience in real estate, to the Mehtas, who were looking for
someone to manage their properties.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three years, Mrs. McDougal spent considerable time
with Mrs. Mehta, a former actress who played a small part in the
television comedy ``Bewitched.'' Mrs. Mehta became so close to Mrs.
McDougal that, Byron said, ``It was a relationship where she
entrusted Susan McDougal with 100 percent of anything and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady change from Arkansas, where Mrs. McDougal grew up
as one of seven children in tiny Camden. She met James McDougal at
Ouachita Baptist University, to which she had won a scholarship and
where McDougal taught political science. McDougal was active in
Democratic politics and became friendly with Bill Clinton. Mrs.
McDougal has denied her ex-husband's accusations, published in an
article in The New Yorker in 1997, that she and Clinton were
romantically involved while he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in Los Angeles, Harris left the Mehtas' employ
to attend law school at the University of Michigan, and Mrs.
McDougal replaced him at a salary of $38,000. The disputed
bookkeeping fees were to be paid in addition to that.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement went smoothly until Mrs. Mehta received the call
from BankAmerica. In July 1992, just as Clinton was being nominated
as the Democratic candidate for president, Mrs. Mehta and her
lawyer, Grant Gifford, confronted Mrs. McDougal about their
suspicions about the credit card and she was fired. After reviewing
her financial records and finding more than $150,000 in billings
she contends were phony, Mrs. Mehta took her complaint to the
district attorney's office in fall 1993. Mrs. McDougal was charged
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Mrs. Mehta often bought Mrs. McDougal expensive
clothes and other gifts. ``There's no way Susan took a penny from
that woman that wasn't given,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mehta, through Gifford, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said the Susan McDougal who let herself be dominated by
James McDougal in Arkansas and Mrs. Mehta in California has become
a much bolder person in prison. Although Mrs. McDougal declined to
be interviewed for this article, she has said in past interviews
that the turning point was her decision not to cooperate with
Starr. That decision was reached with her family, including her
mother, who as a young woman in Belgium, joined the Resistance in
World War II. Mrs. McDougal has likened her decision to resist
Starr to her mother's defiance in the war. She has said she will
not testify before Starr's grand jury unless he steps aside,
because Starr will force her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview with the CNN talk show host, Larry
King, last February, Mrs. McDougal said her legal troubles have
left her life ``in tatters.'' She said she met weekly with a prison
rabbi, to whom she confessed her hatred of Starr, who re-indicted
her in May on criminal contempt charges for her refusal to testify
before his grand jury. That trial is set for Sept. 28 in Little
Rock, Ark..
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbi says it's OK to hate a little,'' Mrs. McDougal told
King. ``It helps you do the right thing.''

students
 &HT;    CLINTON TELLS CHINESE THAT FREEDOM IS A UNIVERSAL ``BIRTHRIGHT''
 &HT;    With CHINA-YOUTH-$ADV29; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV29.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Bill Clinton told a mass of Chinese
listeners on Monday that the freedoms to speak, worship and select
their own leaders are universal ``birthrights'' of people around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the free-thinking campus called the ``Harvard of
China,'' where Mao Tse-tung once worked as a librarian and where
art students constructed the famous ``Goddess of Democracy'' for
Tiananmen Square, the American president said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everywhere, people aspire to be treated with
dignity, to give voice to their opinions, to choose their own
leaders, to associate with whom they wish, to worship how, when and
where they want,'' Clinton said in his prepared text.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not American rights, or European rights, or
developed world rights. They are birthrights of people
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's urging, Chinese authorities broadcast the address
live. He spoke on the main Chinese television channel called
CCTV-1, which has a potential audience of up to 600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Day Five of his China expedition, Clinton used his
strongest language on human rights to address elite students and
faculty at Beijing University, the longtime center of Chinese
liberal thought that was the intellectual birthplace of communism
in the 1920s and the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gently but unmistakably, Clinton took issue with his host
President Jiang Zemin, who just two days ago defended China's human
rights record on national television by saying that China is a
``developing country'' that has to give top priority to ``the right
to subsistence and the right to development.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic security is an essential element of freedom,''
Clinton acknowledged. ``In China, the extraordinary strides you
have taken in nurturing that liberty and spreading of freedom from
want will be a source of strength for your people in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Clinton added: ``True freedom must mean more than
economic opportunity. In America, we believe that freedom itself is
indivisible . . . In the global Information Age, freedom is a
powerful engine of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, China's 1.2 billion citizens already enjoy, most
if not all, of the ``birthrights'' that Clinton called for.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese constitution already guarantees the freedom of
peaceful assembly. But as the U.S. State Department human rights
report on China noted in January, ``the government severely
restricts this right in practice'' by banning any activity that
challenges communist party leadership or infringes upon ``interests
of the State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese constitution also guarantees freedom of religion,
and a section of the Chinese criminal law provides prison sentences
of up to two years for any government employee who illegally
deprives citizens of the right to worship. However, the U.S. State
Department knows of no Chinese official who has ever been punished
under this provision, and millions of Chinese are routinely
harassed for trying to worship in ``unregistered'' churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in my country who question whether working
with China is in our interests,'' Clinton said, in a passage that
seemed directed at an audience back in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in China who ask whether closer relations with
the United States makes sense for China. But everything we know
about the way the world is changing and the challenges for your
generation will face tell us that our two nations will be better
off working together than apart.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, that relationship was criticized as neighboring India
slammed Clinton's attempt to use weekend summit talks with the
Chinese government to cool the Pakistan-India nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``India categorically rejects the notion of these two countries
arrogating to themselves joint or individual responsibility for the
maintenance of peace, stability and security in the region,'' said
an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   India, which exploded five underground nuclear test devices in
early May, vented its anger at a ``presidential joint statement on
South Asia'' issued Saturday by Clinton and Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians seemed outraged by a passage urging India and
Pakistan to ``adhere immediately and unconditionally'' to the
international nuclear test ban treaty, and to refrain from turning
their nuclear test devices into deployed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach reflects the hegemonistic mentality of a bygone
era in international relations and is completely unacceptable and
out of place in the present-day world,'' said the Indian response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is most ironic that two countries that have directly and
indirectly contributed to the unabated proliferation of nuclear
weapons and delivery systems in our neighborhood are now presuming
to prescribe the norms for non-proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   India's unusually harsh statement was issued first in New Delhi
late Saturday and then echoed Sunday in a second statement by the
Indian embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which exploded five nuclear devices of its own in late
May, did not formally respond to the Indian statement.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions turned into violence Sunday on both sides of a
430-mile-long U.N.-supervised cease-fire line that divides Indian
and Pakistani sectors of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani military officials charged that Indian mortar fire
across the cease-fire line killed 11 people, including a
two-year-old boy. Indian police reported that 13 people were
injured by a bomb of unknown origin on the Indian side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remained silent on the Indian flare-up as he rejoined
the Chinese president Sunday night for a private dinner at the
Communist Party's Zhongnanhai leadership compound off Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, accompanying the
president in Beijing, said the Indians are behaving as though
``everyone is out of step with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had better stop dismissing statements like this because
they are dismissing what is a very evident signal from the rest of
the world that what they are doing has not gained them stature,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim begins.
</P>
<P>
   On this sweltering Day Four of his nine-day China excursion,
Clinton seemed to be going to considerable lengths to avoid saying
anything controversial, especially about his Chinese hosts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chongwenmen Protestant church Sunday morning, the
President and Mrs. Clinton and their daughter Chelsea sat on the
front row through the service. Then Clinton rose to a podium and
spoke for two or three minutes, praising the growth of Christianity
in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith
in China, and we rejoice to hear Reverend Shi (Zesheng) cite the
numbers of churches and other places of worship where people are
practicing their faith today,'' Clinton told the congregation,
referring to the minister's earlier comment that China has 12,000
churches and 25,000 places of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton and his aides earlier said he would address the
issue of religious freedom in China, he did not mention the issue
of religious oppression.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley explained later, ``It was
extremely hot in the church and the pastor made a wonderful
ceremony that went on for quite a long time, and so under the
circumstances the President decided to drastically shorten his
prepared remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Sunday was a first-class touring day for the
Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   They ventured through the Forbidden City in the center of the
capital and walked along the Great Wall at Badaling, an hour from
downtown Beijing. Both places, which routinely draw thousands of
tourists daily, were closed to the public for the Clintons' visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there to say? It's an amazing place,'' said Clinton as
he walked along a cobblestone courtyard in the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   Then after walking along the top of the Great Wall, Clinton
stopped to write in a visitors' book: ``Thank you for showing the
Great Wall to me, my family and our American party. It was ever
more magnificent than we thought it would be. William J. Clinton.''

BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS MUCH DIFFERENT FROM 1989 CLASS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The choice of Beijing University as the site of
President Clinton's address Monday on the future of democracy and
progress in China carries a symbolism that goes beyond symmetry
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at Harvard last year.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing University _ referred to as ``the Harvard of China'' _
was the birthplace of nearly every revolutionary and liberal
movement in China this century. From the May 4 movement of 1919 to
the June 4 movement of 1989, students at ``Beida,'' as the
university is called for short, have led the uprisings that
dramatically and irrevocably shaped modern China.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of democracy in China wish that current-day Beida
students would take up that leadership again, pushing for further
reforms and openness. But the Beida to which Clinton preached
Monday is a campus greatly becalmed since the heady, and ultimately
tragic, days of the student-led demonstrations that ended in the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Monday's Beida students are more concerned about their
grades and their economic future than they are about pressing
leaders for change. Many have been convinced by the government that
June 4 leaders were misguided, and that cooperation with
authorities, rather than the spirited dissidence that is Beida's
legacy, is the best way to promote reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years since their predecessors were treated by the world as
martyrs and by Chinese authorities as criminals, many Beida
students espouse pragmatic and individualistic values, like other
Chinese youth. Thanks to economic progress and a message drummed
home by the government that prosperity is impossible without
stability, these young people have turned their attention to
getting rich. Political change, they say, will come in time and the
government knows best how to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since June 4, students here don't care as much about politics.
We try to study and be more practical,'' said Liu Hai, 27, a law
student at Beida. ``June 4 was a failure for the students and it
didn't help the country. Economic development is the most important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A third-year math student, who spoke on the condition that her
name not be used, said she and her friends ``live in a different
generation, a different society'' than their activist predecessors.
``These days, university students care more about how to improve
ourselves, our potential, our abilities. We care more about
building ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she considered that a betrayal of Beida's history
of political activism, she retorted, ``That's what society is like
now. That's the atmosphere we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   On the grassy campus that is home to multi-colored traditional
Chinese architecture as well as modernist concrete blocks, Beida
students said Sunday they were looking forward to Clinton's visit,
though few would be able to hear his remarks. A limited number of
tickets were distributed by teachers, and students interviewed knew
of no plans to broadcast the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Students were interested in Clinton's suggestions on how to
modernize China, but they said they would not take his Western
values as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing University students are famous for being open to new
ideas, and we want to learn from Clinton,'' said Li Donghua, 20, a
computer science student. ``We will adopt some of those ideas, not
all.''
</P>
<P>
   New ideas have been a hallmark of Beida's history. Founded 100
years ago last month, the university was the scene of protests in
1919 against the government's signing of a treaty that gave Chinese
territory to Japan after World War I. That patriotic fury expanded
into a movement to modernize China through science and democracy _
referred to as ``Mr. S and Mr. D'' _ and spawned an outpouring of
literature that set the tone for intellectual thought.
</P>
<P>
   Beida was also the breeding ground for some unpleasant chapters
of history, starting with the anti-rightist struggle of 1957. The
school also was the site of the first ``big character'' poster that
set off the Cultural Revolution, a devastating 10-year crackdown on
intellectuals and liberals. At least 60 Beida professors were
persecuted and died during that struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1979, Beida students had changed their tune, and figured
prominently in the ``Democracy Wall'' protests. A decade later,
students outraged at government corruption launched hunger strikes
in Tiananmen Square that galvanized millions nationwide. In the
aftermath of the massacre, Beida's president was fired, political
debate on campus was suppressed, and students reportedly were
forced to participate in military drills and political
indoctrination meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Beida since has been restored to the government's good graces,
as evidenced by the glowing official media coverage during the
school's 100th anniversary and President Jiang's praise-filled
centenary campus address. But suspicions of this onetime
revolutionary hotbed remain. Campus security guards stopped a
reporter Sunday, saying journalists were not permitted on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Leo Ou-Fan Lee, a professor of Chinese culture at
Harvard and a specialist on the May 4 movement, lectured at Beida,
and his admonition that ``Beida's tradition is to keep a critical
distance'' from any regime caused a stir.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Beida of Monday has lost most of that tradition,'' Lee
said sadly. ``As far as I could see, the younger the students were,
the more patriotic they are, whereas the Beida I knew was very
critical ... They criticized the government in the name of the
national good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Lee said, ``nationalism means you have to agree with
the government _ that's a tremendous difference.''Monday
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Mao Zedong's warning that ``anyone who suppresses
student movements will never have a good ending,'' this government
Mondayappears to have won over youth. Monday's students, Lee said,
``see only the failure of June 4....''
</P>
<P>
   Beida students do see a government they feel is more responsive
and that shares their ideals. The government has invested in
``educating university students about politics so we don't go
wrong,'' said Liu, the law student.
</P>
<P>
   Li, the computer science student, said: ``The government is
playing a good role now. They think we should use science and
technology to help the country, and we students think that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends praised Prime Minister Zhu Rongji for
reforming government and saving money by eliminating departments
and officials. ``That really shook the thoughts of people. It made
us realize the government is not just saying things, but actually
doing them.''

CINCINNATI ENQUIRER APOLOGIZES FOR ARTICLES ABOUT CHIQUITA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the largest and most unusual settlements by a news
organization, The Cincinnati Enquirer published an apology across
the top of its front page on Sunday and said it had agreed to pay
Chiquita Brands International Inc. more than $10 million to avoid
being sued for a series of articles that were highly critical of
the fruit company's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The articles, which appeared in an 18-page special section on
May 3, were partially based on 2,000 internal voice mails that were
said to have been obtained from ``a high-ranking Chiquita
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper, after initially defending its yearlong
investigation of Chiquita, said Sunday that it was now convinced
that the voice mails had been stolen from Chiquita and renounced
the articles.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer also said it had dismissed the reporter who led the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts now indicate that an Enquirer employee was involved
in the theft of this information in violation of the law,'' said
the apology, which was signed by Publisher Harry Whipple and Editor
Lawrence Beaupre.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was unclear how much of the information in the
Enquirer articles was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said that as part of the settlement with Chiquita,
it would publish the apology again Tuesday and Wednesday.
Separately, it is continuing an internal investigation of the
articles to determine if other reporters are guilty of wrongdoing.
Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, has also appointed a
special prosecutor to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement alone ranks among the highest ever paid by a news
organization. But it is also unusual because Chiquita had not yet
taken any legal action against the Enquirer, which is owned by the
Gannett Co., the country's largest newspaper chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been settlements in substantial amounts after
someone has lost a lawsuit,'' said Floyd Abrams, the well-known
First Amendment lawyer, ``but I can't think of a situation in which
a publication has been obliged to pay a figure on the order of $10
million in circumstances in which there was never litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But by saying that information was stolen from Chiquita, Abrams
added, the Enquirer was on weak legal ground. ``A great deal of
aggressive newsgathering may be protected by the First Amendment
but stealing isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer's apology comes in the wake of other admitted
lapses on the part of news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, The Boston Globe asked for the resignation of
columnist Patricia Smith after learning that she had fabricated
quotations and people in four columns. Earlier this month, The New
Republic magazine said one of its writers, Stephen Glass, had
fabricated parts or all of 27 of the 41 articles he had written.
</P>
<P>
   And last Monday, the managing editor of Time magazine, Walter
Isaacson, said that doubts raised about the accuracy of a recent
Time article written by Cable News Network journalists were serious
enough that Time's editors had ordered a further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer articles accused Chiquita, formerly known as the
United Fruit Co. and the world's largest banana producer, of a
variety of unsavory practices. Among the charges were that the
company secretly controls dozens of purportedly independent banana
companies, that its executives bribed officials in Colombia, and
that careless use of pesticides had harmed the health of hundreds
of workers and ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita, which is based in Cincinnati and is controlled by the
financier Carl H. Lindner Jr., vigorously denied these allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paper's apparent abject surrender, the settlement
appears to leave some doubt about the extent of the articles'
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita, in a statement, hailed The Enquirer for acknowledging
``that the conclusions in the articles were untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whipple said in an interview Sunday that _ although he had
not heard them _ he was convinced that the voice mails were real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not aware of anything to suggest that this is an
instance of a reporter fabricating something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrived at the decision to apologize to Chiquita because we
feel that the end product of the series was tainted by the
unethical and illegal means by which the voice mails were
obtained,'' he added. ``Breaking the law and lying to one's
employer have no place at the Enquirer and therefore we were unable
to stand behind the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   In an editor's note that appeared on the day the articles were
published, Beaupre wrote that Mike Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter,
the principal reporters involved in the investigation, had traveled
to Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Belgium, Canada and two small
Caribbean islands and conducted scores of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to numerous interviews with Chiquita executives who
spoke on condition of anonymity, Beaupre cited ``more than 2,000
copies of taped voice mail messages'' that were supplied by a
high-level source who was ``one of several executives with
authority over the company's voice mail system.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chiquita said after the articles appeared that there is no
executive who has such authority over the company's voice-mail
system. The Enquirer said it was now also convinced that no such
executive existed and said that the voice mail messages were stolen
by Gallagher, who was dismissed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how Gallagher obtained the voice mail
messages. Whipple and a spokesman for Chiquita declined to comment,
citing the continuing investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer's apology said Gallagher had hired a lawyer. He
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, 40, joined the Enquirer in 1995. The following year,
he wrote a highly regarded series on problems with the cleanup of
the uranium-processing plant at Fluor Daniel Fernald Inc. Before
that, he was a reporter at the Gannett Suburban Newspapers in
Westchester County, N.Y., where Beaupre had been an editor. One
editor who worked with Gallagher at the Westchester papers and
requested anonymity said Gallagher was recruited by Beaupre to come
to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, Gallagher made his reputation covering a number
of high-profile cases, including charges of corruption at Rye
Playland and the murder trial of Carolyn Warmus, who killed the
wife of her lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a star,'' the editor said. ``He had a very good
reputation, and he broke a lot of stories.''

THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR FESTIVE EXPRESSION OF GAY PRIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After weeks of frenzied preparations, Antonio
Escalante woke early to piece together the rows of terra-cotta
colored columns, wooden platforms and hand-crafted flowers he made
to celebrate the city's diverse gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of showing pride in being Latino and gay,'' said
Escalante, a Los Angeles-based artist who designed the Hacienda and
two other floats for Sunday's Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade in West
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The Hacienda float featured a mock same-sex wedding ceremony, a
mariachi band and scantily drag queens dancing atop the
four-wheeled platform cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The floats were completed with the help of more than 100
volunteers from the Bienestar service organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating in the parade is a show of unity,'' said
Bienestar spokeswoman Elizabeth Escobedo, whose organization
provides HIV testing and other health services geared toward
Latinos in six locations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said more than 350,000 people attended two days of
festivities in West Hollywood that featured domestic partnership
commitment ceremonies as well as a 300-person lesbian march
Saturday led by a contingency of women on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of organizations were represented at the parade,
including churches, AIDS organizations and gay advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The number and variety of organizations participating ``is a
reflection of gay pride as a whole,'' said Kendall Williams,
spokesperson of Christopher Street West, the organization that
sponsored the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the San Francisco parade, the West Hollywood
parade tends to be more festive,'' said Williams who contrasted the
event with the more overtly political air of the Bay Area pride
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   But political dignitaries could be spotted throughout the Los
Angeles parade, including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and
 &UR; L. &LR; A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.
</P>
<P>
   PoliceChief Bernard C. Parks, rode behind the Golden State Peace
Officers Association, a gay-advocacy organization composed of
police officers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm and positive nature of the parade has been a
plus for us,'' said Parks, who is the second Los Angeles police
chief to appear at the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Other parade-goers added to the upbeat atmosphere: celebrants
dancing under huge tents at the country-western music stage, fans
under rainbow-colored umbrellas waving at parade participants and
teens creating a ruckus with their noise makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to Halloween, gay pride weekend is one of our biggest
events of the year,'' said Rage restaurant and bar manager Sam
Cunniniello, whose establishment is located along the main parade
thoroughfare. ``It's extraordinarily busy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a whole weekend party,'' Escobedo said. &UR; !end! &LR;

 &HT;     
 CLINTON EMPHASIZES PERSONAL FREEDOM IN SPEECH TO STUDENTS  
 
 
 
BY CRAGG HINES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton, appealing to China's determination
to sustain its economic boom, today declared freedom ``a powerful
engine of progress'' that could bolster the commercial surge in the
world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic freedom is an essential element of freedom,'' Clinton
told an audience of students at Peking University. ``But freedom
must mean more than economic opportunity. In America, we believe
that freedom itself is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came as he made a persistent pitch &UR;  &LR; for
American values in a speech capping his three-day visit to the
Chinese capital and talks with the nation's Communist leaders,
including President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not seek to impose our vision on others,'' Clinton told
the college audience. ``But we are convinced that certain rights
are universal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everywhere people aspire to be treated with
dignity, to give voice to their opinions, to choose their leaders,
to associate with whom they wish, to worship how, when and where
they want,'' Clinton said. ``These are not American rights or
European rights or developed world rights. They are the birthrights
of people everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the extraordinary Clinton-Jiang joint news conference on
Saturday, the U.S. leader's speech was carried live on Chinese
state-owned television. Clinton stood before a backdrop of mounted
U.S. and Chinese national flags.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Clinton's remarks were intended to
``focus on the things China needs to do to assure its success in
the 21st century,'' one of Clinton's favorite rhetorical
references.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you build a new China, America wants to build a new
relationship with you for a new century,'' Clinton said. ``We want
China to be successful, secure and open _ working with us for a
more peaceful and prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted some critics of his China policy who remain to be
convinced of the wisdom of engagement with the authoritarian
regime, but said: ``Everything we know about the way the world is
changing and the challenges your generation will face tell us that
our two nations will be better off working together than apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's emphasis on how personal freedom can enhance economic
achievement was directed at the Chinese leadership as much as the
students.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist leaders have made it clear that they do not share
Clinton's belief that human rights and economic prosperity go hand
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, in his appearance with Clinton on Saturday, renewed his
defense of the government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
at Tiananmen Square nine years ago in which hundreds of protesters
were killed by the People's Liberation Army, declaring:
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures
then, we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying
today.'' The Chinese leadership equates ``stability'' with economic
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's audience for today's speech almost certainly included
China's future leaders, as the 100-year-old university is the
nation's most prestigious. About 20,000 students attend the school.
</P>
<P>
   Also called Beida, the university has often been a hotbed of
ideological unrest _ of varying kinds. The campus spawned not only
the Red Guards, who led the reactionary movement known as the
Cultural Revolution, but also the pro-democracy movement of 1989
that ended in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine years, students and Western observers agree,
the main thrust of the student body has been to prepare for life in
a more financially aggressive and prosperous China. One student
said the grassy area known in 1989 as ``Democracy Lawn'' is more
apt these days to be occupied by couples with romantic interests.
</P>
<P>
   There were echoes of the repression nine years ago when the
school celebrated its centenary earlier this year. Invitations for
the ceremonies were strictly limited, bypassing some alumni whom
the government considered trouble-makers, and security forces were
present in force, students said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the ``extraordinary strides'' China has made in
``nurturing'' freedom, ``and spreading freedom from want will be a
source of strength for your people in the 21st century.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The president said he would like to see the current
``productive'' Sino-American relationship ``blossom into a fuller
partnership for the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is to happen,'' he said, ``it is important that we
understand each other better _ our common interests and aspirations
and our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his ``open, direct exchange'' with Jiang in a news
conference Saturday was the kind of session which ``can both
clarify and narrow our differences and, more important, can change
lives for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented step, Chinese officials allowed the
70-minute session, in which Clinton and Jiang sparred politely but
pointedly about a range of issues including the Tiananmen massacre
and human rights, to be broadcast live on a government-own channel
which reaches all over the vast nation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright estimated Sunday that the
broadcast was ``probably seen'' by more than half China's 1.2
billion people.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech to the students, Clinton went to a lawn outside
the university's library to present the school's American studies
program with 547 volumes on Western civilization and U.S. history
and life, including ``Total Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The books were selected and purchased by the U.S. Information
Agency at a cost of approximately $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The gift also included the Encyclopedia Britiannica,
Encyclopedia Americana, Great Books of the Western World and 325
other references works, such as African-American Writers,
Hispanic-American Almanac, Encyclopedia of American Prisons and
Vital Statistics of the Presidency: Washington to Clinton.

AFTER ROCKY START, TWO LEADERS DEVELOP RAPPORT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When President Clinton and Chinese leader Jiang Zemin
first met at an economic summit in Seattle nearly five years ago,
Clinton asked a polite question about the Chinese economy, and got
in return a scripted 45-minute lecture on the virtues of communism
and Jiang's accomplishments back home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufbitelabel &LR; Newsanalysis
</P>
<P>
   Flash ahead to last night, to a graceful government-owned villa
on a picturesque Chinese lake. Clinton, accompanied by his wife,
daughter, and mother-in-law, excitedly recounted his tour of the
Great Wall for Jiang. Later, in a casual conversation about movies,
Jiang recalled watching ``Gone With the Wind'' in Shanghai a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How the relationship between the two presidents has transformed
from rigid to relaxed is a story of heady policy motivations in
Washington and political intricacies in Beijing. As the two leaders
have gained experience and confidence in office, they have tried to
forge a bond that may eventually serve as the foundation for a
transformed diplomatic relationship as well.
</P>
<P>
   At no time has that bond been more apparent than during this
summit, from the extraordinary debate at Saturday's press
conference, where sharp points were sheathed in silken gestures, to
the state dinner later that night, when Clinton and Jiang jokingly
prodded each other to take the conductor's baton and lead the
People's Liberation Army band.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials point to a strategy in friendship. It is a
fact of international diplomacy that personal relationships
influence official ones. A stronger personal bond, officials said,
has allowed Clinton to repeatedly raise the issue of human rights
with Jiang, in venues private and public, without causing the
diplomatic relationship to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   US officials maintain that Chinese leaders insist on respect,
and President Clinton is willing to provide it with the assumption
it will further US policy goals, such as improved human rights and
fairer trading policies. Critics have charged that Clinton is
granting Jiang respect while receiving virtually nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and other analysts said Saturday's press
conference, televised live across China at Jiang's behest, was the
ultimate indication that the bond was beginning to pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a much easier relationship now,'' said Winston Lord, a
former ambassador to Beijing under President Bush and an assistant
secretary of state under Clinton. ``They can debate the most
sensitive issues in front of a world audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, the two leaders have crossed a cultural
divide _ and a language gap _ to engage in a steady stream of
banter. Their conversations are often casual, officials said, an
observation borne out by the constant sight of Jiang making small
talk with Clinton, waving his arms and laughing out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see in public is what you get in private,'' said
Michael McCurry, White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship on display during this summit represents a
significant amount of work by both sides. Clinton left that dismal
meeting in Seattle infuriated that the Chinese president had
squandered so much of his time and political capital with a
pointless harangue. At the time, Clinton was putting aside his
fiery campaign accusations that Bush had coddled Chinese dictators
in an attempt to develop a bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult for Clinton to establish a relationship
with Jiang,'' said Robert Ross, a professor of political science at
Boston College and an associate at the John King Fairbank Center
for East Asian Research at Harvard University. ``Jiang has talking
points just on how to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two leaders gathered at Lincoln Center in New
York in October 1995, the rigidity gave way to mere formality,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, their relationship was still clouded by a prickly
give and take among senior aides. The Chinese first insisted that
any meeting take place in Washington, as part of an official
summit, rather than as a sideshow to a UN visit by Jiang. The White
House refused, which, in turn, prompted the Chinese to spurn
Clinton's luncheon invitation. Eventually, they settled on Lincoln
Center as the site of a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of the long lecture, this was a conversation back and
forth, and you could see Jiang was ad-libbing and departing from
script,'' said Lord, who was present in the first five meetings
between the two. ``There were jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until October, in Washington, that Clinton and Jiang
made significant strides in forging a bond. On the night Jiang
arrived in the capital, Clinton invited him to the White House for
a personal and impromptu meeting. Over orange juice and snacks,
they discussed human rights. Clinton later gave Jiang a guided tour
of the White House, including the living quarters. When they came
upon Lincoln's handwritten Gettysburg Address, Jiang recited from
memory the first few lines.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the two clashed on the issue of human rights at a
now-famous news conference. But the bond between them was strong
enough that the relationship proceeded with little apparent
personal animosity, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in the Great Hall of the People, the two tangled
over human rights, Taiwan, and Tibet. But despite the heady
content, at the end of the news conference, Clinton said that if
the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, and Jiang met face
to face, ``they would like each other very much.'' With that, both
leaders smiled broadly and left the stage together.

AIDS VACCINE EFFORT RAISES ETHICAL, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ With the human immunodeficiency virus infecting someone
in the world every 11 minutes, frustrated proponents of AIDS
vaccine development are pushing for accelerated human trials of
experimental vaccines, despite debate over what an AIDS vaccine
should contain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we in the West had a 25 percent infection rate among our
adults _ the way Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa do _
we wouldn't be having this debate about testing of experimental
vaccines already proven safe,'' Dr. Max Essex of the Harvard AIDS
Institute said in an interview here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Essex's exasperation with the slow pace of vaccine development
is widely shared among AIDS researchers and specialists attending
the 12th World AIDS Conference, which opened here last evening.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's theme, ``Bridging the Gap,'' might equally
refer to the chasm between rich and poor nations in access to
costly AIDS treatment, or the large gaps in scientists' knowledge
about the essential qualities of an anti-HIV vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two strategies to developing an AIDS vaccine,'' said
Dr. Jaap Goudsmit, a Dutch researcher. ``One is to figure it all
out first and the other is to do human testing to determine a
vaccine's efficacy. There's an abundance of good ideas out there.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 experimental AIDS vaccines have been developed so
far, but only last week did the first enter large-scale human
tests. Critics say the US government is too cautious about human
AIDS vaccine experiments, preferring to concentrate on more test
tube research first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were just a matter of developing a vaccine for the
United States and Europe, I'd say fine, let's wait and be sure,''
said Margaret Johnston, a leading vaccine specialist. ``But there's
too much urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubaramira Ruranga, a major in the Ugandan Army, added a
personal note of urgency. ``I have lived with HIV myself for 13
years,'' he said. ``I don't fear HIV because I already have it, but
I live in fear for my sons and daughters. How long will we have to
wait for a vaccine?''
</P>
<P>
   Noting recent success in suppressing the AIDS virus with costly
drugs, Ruranga said such measures would do little good in places
like Uganda. ``Drugs have never stopped an epidemic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, formerly the federal government's chief AIDS vaccine
adviser, is principal author of a report issued Sunday by the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a group formed two years ago
at the time of the last global AIDS conference in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The report, billed as a blueprint for AIDS vaccine development,
is intended to ``put us on a fast track toward the goal,'' said Dr.
Seth Berkly, the group's president. It calls for spending $300
million to $500 million above current levels over the next nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Berkly announced that the chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and
his wife, Melinda, have pledged $1.5 million to his group's program
to set up vaccine development teams in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The US government has increased its commitment to AIDS vaccine
research and is implementing some of the ideas suggested in the
critics' report, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, leader of the federal
government's AIDS research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for an AIDS vaccine, first promised 14 years ago by
the Reagan administraton, has proved far more difficult than anyone
imagined. Many doubt that researchers can meet the 2007 goal for an
effective vaccine set a year ago by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are complex, involving scientific, ethical,
political, and economic obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having this debate now because AIDS activists aren't
putting on pressure the way they did to get drugs to save their
lives,'' Essex said. ``And companies that make AIDS drugs are
satisfied with the $1 billion a year they will lose if we had an
effective vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus ``is a uniquely difficult target for vaccine
development,'' according to Norman L. Letvin of Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, because it has evolved ways to thrive in
the face of vigorous immune-system attack.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines against most diseases work by stimulating the
production of antibodies. But recent research suggests antibodies
alone will not stop HIV; and perhaps antibodies will not even be
partially protective because the virus wears a sugar coating to
mask the proteins that an antibody could recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, scientists now know that laboratory-grown strains of
HIV stimulate the production of antibodies that are totally
ineffective against ``wild'' strains recovered from infected
patients.
</P>
<P>
   This insight has forced VaxGen, manufacturer of the vaccine that
entered human trials last week, to reformulate its product to
include components of a ``wild'' strain.
</P>
<P>
   But the VaxGen vaccine does not stimulate the immune system
defense, called cellular immunity, that kills cells already
infected with HIV. Thus, many researchers doubt it will protect
people against the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines that stimulate cellular immunity, or both cellular and
antibody defenses, are in various stages of development. But these
vaccines so far are either complicated to make, elicit only modest
or weak immune responses, or are possibly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Another knotty problem is that different types of HIV
predominate in North America and Europe, Africa, and Asia. If a
vaccine made against the North American ``B'' subtype were tested
in Africa, it might not work, leading many to conclude that a
vaccine is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   But if a company developed a vaccine against the African type,
it would run the risk of marketing a product that no nation could
afford. The Vaccine Initiative is trying to persuade the World Bank
to set up a $1 billion fund to purchase an AIDS vaccine for
developing countries as a lure to manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all these problems, scientists, policymakers, and AIDS
activists are beginning to ponder the ethical issues that will
accompany large-scale vaccine trials, especially in poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   These issues were aired at an often-contentious meeting here
last week by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS agency, involving more
than 100 representatives from around the world. The group
identified 10 levels of agreement on a wide range of issues, ``from
unanimity to total chaos,'' said Dr. Donald Burke, a Johns Hopkins
University vaccine specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The attendees agreed that it would be ethical to compare an
experimental vaccine to a placebo, or inert substance, to determine
efficacy. But they could not agree on whether participants in
vaccine trials who became infected with HIV should be guaranteed
expensive drug treatments indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If triple-drug treatment will continue forever, who is going
to pay?'' asked Ruranga, the Ugandan Army officer. And, putting
himself in the position of a vaccine trial subject who gets
infected and subsequently infects his wife, he added, ``Am I going
to get triple-drug treatment while my wife is not?''

SOME FOLLOWERS OF DECEASED RABBI PROCLAIM HIM THE MESSIAH
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years after the death of Rabbi Menachem Mendel
Schneerson, the charismatic Hasidic leader, his Lubavitch movement
finds itself embarrassed by a persistent group of his followers,
mostly in Brooklyn, who stubbornly proclaim the rabbi as the
Moshiach, or Messiah, and eagerly await his resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   During a weekend in which several thousand people commemorated
Schneerson's death by visiting his granite mausoleum in Queens,
Lubavitch officials dismissed these followers as a fringe group
whose views are not representative of Lubavitch, a Hasidic group
centered in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But some Lubavitch rabbis worry that the messiah controversy
could reinforce negative stereotypes of Hasidim and undermine the
credibility of Lubavitch at a time when the group is aggressively
expanding and trying to reach out to Jews around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep our eyes on the primary goal, which is to
educate more Jews, promote more Judaism and bring more goodness and
kindness,'' said Rabbi David Eliezrie, an ``emissary'' who runs a
Lubavitch Center in Yorba Linda, Calif. ``That would be the way to
bring the messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Schneerson's death, as calculated by the
Hebrew lunar calendar, fell on Saturday. But during four days of
commemoration events, the messianists, as they are known among
Lubavitchers, held a separate ``Moshiach'' congress in Crown
Heights honoring Schneerson, called the rebbe, or spiritual leader.
People sold Moshiach tapes, posters and candy bars and attended
messiah-related lectures. Others handed out business cards _ one
for Jews, another for Gentiles _ promoting the ``Moshiach
Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' said Rabbi Yosef Carlebach, who attended the
messianists' congress, ``that every Lubavitcher believes in his
heart of hearts that the rebbe is the Moshiach.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to douse this messiah fervor began about two years ago
after messianists placed a ``King Moshiach'' billboard near the
George Washington Bridge. Lubavitch officials countered with
newspaper advertisements and predicted that the passage of time
would change such thinking. Earlier this year, though, the highest
Lubavitch rabbinical court felt compelled to issue a statement
denouncing ``the deification of any human being'' as contrary to
Jewish belief. The statement also said the rebbe himself would
disapprove of being identified as the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Lubavitch officials do not deny that a messiah is coming; to the
contrary, that is a tenet of Jewish belief. But in a statement this
weekend, Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, once a close aide to the rebbe,
criticized the messianists.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``We must pray for the arrival of Messiah, increase our
personal goodness and kindness and encourage an awareness and
anticipation of our redemption. No one can know with certainty, and
clearly should not ``campaign'' about, who Moshiach may or may not
be.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 200,000 followers worldwide, Schneerson led
Lubavitch for 44 years. Until his death at age 92, he was
considered among the world's most influential Jewish leaders,
courted by American and Israeli politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some Hasidic leaders, Schneerson preached engagement,
though not assimilation, with the non-Orthodox Jewish world. He
established an international network of Chabad Houses, or Jewish
learning centers, to offer prayers, readings and classes open to
all Jews. Today, Lubavitch officials say there are 2,400 Chabad
Houses in 48 countries.

 NEW YORK: 48 countries.

<P>
   Zalman Schmotkin, a Lubavitch spokesman, said the messiah
controversy had not hampered the growth of Lubavitch. The group's
budget has risen to $600 million, much of it from Jewish
philanthropists, he said. As further evidence of popularity,
Schmotkin said roughly 800,000 Jewish students worldwide now attend
Lubavitch schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmotkin said that the local schools in Crown Heights had
become something of a controversy. At the United Lubavicher
Yeshivas, the Crown Heights Hasidic school system, many teachers
lead students in daily chants of ``King Moshiach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After we pray every morning, we sing, `Long live the rebbe,
King Moshiach for ever and ever,''' said Israel Benchoun, 10, a
fourth grader.
</P>
<P>
   Schneerson's presence still dominates Crown Heights. In becoming
the seventh grand rabbi, or rebbe, of the Lubavitch, he succeeded
his father-in-law. But childless, he left no successor. Now,
bookstores offer volumes of his writings or a collection of his
letters. For the anniversary weekend, one of his previously
unpublished scholarly treatises was released. Video tapes and audio
tapes are for sale in many stores on Kingston Avenue. Along
residential streets, a sprinkling of homeowners tack his photograph
above their front doors, many with slogans proclaiming him the
Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambria Heights, Queens, Rabbi Abba Refson, a Lubavitch
official, lives in a house near Montefiore Cemetery, keeping watch
over the 20-square-foot mausoleum in which the Rebbe is buried
beside his father-in-law. According to Jewish belief, the soul of
the deceased lingers above the grave, and throughout the weekend,
buses arrived with followers from Crown Heights. Outside the house,
people sat at long tables writing notes to leave atop the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew overturned a
decision that would have allowed about 1,000 Lubavitchers to spend
Friday night in an elementary school near the grave site. After
complaints from neighbors, Crew revoked the permit, saying that
public schools had never been used for overnight lodgings except in
emergencies or disasters. The Lubavitchers instead stayed at a
Jewish center about two miles away, and Sunday the police said the
weekend passed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   The reverence for Schneerson was evident Thursday afternoon, as
followers left their shoes outside the open-air mausoleum and
stepped inside. A group of Hasidic men silently mouthed prayers,
holding worn Hebrew prayer books, swaying slightly at the edge of
the graves. A handful of women stood slightly apart, praying. The
only sound was the tearing of the notes _ a custom favored by
Schneerson _ and the occasional jet descending toward John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel strongly affected by it,'' Refson said of the
visits. ``I'm more moved by the people who are not so religiously
inclined who when they come here, they come out very moved and very
motivated personally.''
</P>
<P>
   A different scene unfolded Thursday night as about 200 people,
mostly men, gathered in the steamy upstairs auditorium of the
Brooklyn Jewish Center on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights to open
``the Third International Moshiach Congress.'' These messianists
listened to lectures and watched videos of an aged Schneerson
speaking into a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the auditorium, Yossi Schwartz, 29, a medical student,
sold cassette tapes under the auspices of ``the Moshiach Awareness
Project.'' Cheery and eager to talk, Schwartz said that many
ordinary Lubavitchers were leery of admitting their belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a person privately, he might say, `Of course, I
believe the rebbe is the Messiah,''' Schwartz said. ``I would say
that 99 percent of the people are of that mind set. The big issue
is whether or not to publicize it to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Chaim Adelman said he spreads the messiah message at his
Chabad House in Amherst, Mass., and he accused Lubavitch officials
of being ``afraid it might turn people off.'' Lubavitch officials,
several of them from Chabad Houses around the country, say the
messianism is almost completely confined to Crown Heights. Another
fierce debate between the two sides is whether the rebbe suggested
that he was the Messiah in vague statements made near the end of
his life. The messianists believe he did; Lubavitch officials
fiercely say he did not, accusing messianists of distorting the
rebbe's words.
</P>
<P>
   But messianists like Adelman say they consider it their mission
to spread the message of the imminent arrival of the Messiah. One
woman, Rivky Shvey, spent Thursday selling Messiah posters, tapes,
candy bars and tambourines. Just as women played tambourines as
Moses led the Jews through the Red Sea, Ms. Shvey said she kept a
small tambourine in her carrying bag in readiness for the arrival
of the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case I'm on the subway and Moshiach comes,'' Ms.
Shvey, 33, said, ``I'll have one.''

HOLLYWOOD TRADES FIRECRACKERS FOR BLOCKBUSTERS ON HOLIDY WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
BURBANK -- Now that ``Godzilla'' has died a premature death, the
industry's last chance for a true summer blockbuster is widely
believed to be The Walt Disney Co.'s ``Armageddon.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   And if it does become the quarter-billion-dollar movie that
analysts predict, ``Armageddon'' will reaffirm a Hollywood truism
of the '90s: The Fourth of July is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios have realized that the Fourth is the type of holiday
where families like to do things together, like go to the movies,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the July 4 weekend has been the launching
ground for such blockbuster movies as ``The Firm,'' ``Men In
Black'' and, of course, ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise's ``The Firm'' took in $32.5 million during the 1993
holiday weekend on its way to a $158.3 million domestic gross.
``MIB'' grabbed $84.1 million of its $250.1 million domestic gross
on its opening weekend and ``ID4'' took in $85 million during the
long weekend on its way to $306.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any studio would love to have a film in this slot,'' Bucksbaum
said, ``but you have to put in a movie that others won't
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney has already succeeded on that level: No other major
movies are being released this upcoming weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For those few who have managed to avoid the onslaught of
publicity leading up to Wednesday's release, ``Armageddon'' stars
Bruce Willis as the leader of oil drillers trying to nuke an
Earth-menacing asteroid. Its plot, augmented by spectacular special
effects, including the destruction of New York's famed Chrysler
Building, is fairly recognizable: Call it ``The Dirty Dozen in
Outer Space'' or maybe ``Independence Day Meets Apollo 13.''
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million worth of special effects make ``Armageddon'' the
most expensive movie in Disney history. That makes it a significant
departure for the entertainment giant, which prides itself on
cautious financial conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little out of character for Disney to spend this much
but they've kind of had to do it because this one is the
spotlight,'' said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick. ``As
we all know, in the film business, it's a matter of no guts, no
glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum believes ``Armageddon'' should take in $75 million
during the first five days -- about $10 million short of what ``Men
In Black'' and ``ID4'' took in during similar periods, but quite
respectable just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be the top movie of the summer,'' he said. ``There's
strong interest from young adults, kids and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, some worried that Paramount's ``Deep Impact'' -- in
which Robert Duvall leads a team of astronauts trying to blow up a
comet menacing the Earth -- would detract from ``Armageddon,'' but
those concerns have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it opens, there will not have been a real action movie
since `Deep Impact' and `Godzilla,' so I think it will do well,''
said Drew Devlin of the Independent Marketing Edge consulting
service. `` `Deep Impact' seems more cerebral than `Armageddon,'
which looks like a real slam-bang movie. By the Fourth, people are
really ready for a wham-bam film.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysts note that the film has a number of things going for
it that should swell attendance:
</P>
<P>
   _Willis' presence as a veteran action star with proven
box-office appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _State-of-the art special effects, complete with Space Shuttle
launches, derring-do in outer space and demolition scenes in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   _A romantic subplot between Ben Affleck of ``Good Will Hunting''
and MTV heartthrob Liv Tyler, who plays Willis' daughter.
</P>
<P>
   _The heightened interest in asteroids and their threat to Earth,
increased even more when the International Astronomical Union
warned in March that it discovered an asteroid with a trajectory
that could collide with Earth's in 30 years. The union has since
rescinded the prediction.
</P>
<P>
   _Dark humor, a key component in bringing in teen-agers. For
example, movie preview watchers have already seen Willis' crew
insist before the mission that they never have to pay taxes again.
One of the movie's taglines is ``Earth: It Was Fun While It
Lasted.''
</P>
<P>
   _A PG-13 rating, which makes the film more desirable to children
between 7 and 12 than a PG or G rating. ``Men In Black'' and ``My
Best Friend's Wedding'' became hits partly due to this phenomenon
while Disney's squeaky-clean animated films have been unable to
duplicate the success of 1994's ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   _Most importantly, timing. ``You want to open on Wednesday of
the Fourth of July weekend because people love to go see a movie or
several movies during that period and the newest is the one on
everyone's list,'' Devlin said.
</P>
<P>
   So what movie will be 1999's ``Armageddon''? No one knows, yet.
</P>
<P>
   Leading early candidates are Warner Bros. ``Wild Wild West,''
starring Will Smith and already into production, and a pair of
Universal projects: ``Everest,'' based on the eight deaths of Mt.
Everest climbers two years ago, and Ron Howard's ``edTV,'' a comedy
similar to ``The Truman Show'' about a video store clerk whose life
airs on cable 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   All three have strong credentials: ``Wild Wild West'' reteams
Smith with ``Men In Black'' producer Barry Sonnenfeld; interest has
been intense in stories about Mount Everest, with the giant-screen
``Everest'' film setting records; and Howard is one of Hollywood's
most bankable directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably need to get the word out that you're going for
the Fourth about a year in advance and you need something that's
going to be so big that everyone else will clear out the date,''
Bucksbaum said. `` `Everest' could be a great Fourth of July movie
except that it may be hard to come up with a happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Other potential Fourth of July candidates: Fox's ``Martial Law''
with Willis; Sony's ``Jacob the Liar'' with Robin Williams;
Paramount's ``200 Cigarettes'' with Affleck; New Line's ``The Mask
2'' or ``Freddy and Jason''; two Disney animated projects,
``Tarzan'' and ``Toy Story 2,'' along with Julia Roberts' ``Martha
and Arthur''; and Warner's ``Fahrenheit 451'' with Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, however, are expected to pale in comparison to the
movie that has already staked out Memorial Day 1999. That weekend
was set aside a long time ago for 20th Century Fox's release of
``Episode One,'' George Lucas' prequel to ``Star Wars.''

CLINTON CALLS FOR BROADENED HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND GLOBE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton called Monday for the relationship
between the United States and China to ``blossom into a fuller
partnership for the new century,'' but warned the Chinese
government that to build economic stability it must allow its
citizens essential human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to be delivered to students at Beijing University,
Clinton avoided even diplomatically cloaked threats and instead
struck the note that it was in the interest of the Chinese
leadership to broaden freedoms of speech, religion, and protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience demonstrates that freedom strengthens
stability,'' Clinton's speech said, according to excerpts released
by the White House before the address. ``In the global information
age, freedom is a powerful engine of progress. China's greatest
source of strength resides in the minds and hearts of its citizens.
It is profoundly in your interest, and the world's, that those
minds be free to reach the fullness of their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech, billed by aides as the centerpiece address of
his nine-day diplomatic tour through China, was bald in its pursuit
of closer ties with Beijing and the belief that the United States
and China must engage in more open, more frequent exchanges for
improvements in human rights to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attempted to rebut critics at home who have contended
that through his policy of engagement in general and through his
visit Friday to Tiananmen Square, the United States is
relinquishing its concern about human rights. Those critics have
said that even after five years of dialogue with the United States,
Chinese officials have not done nearly enough to broaden basic
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those in my country who question whether working
with China is in our interests,'' the speech said. ``There are
those in China who ask whether closer relations with the United
States makes sense for China. But everything we know about the way
the world is changing and the challenges your generation will face
tell us that our two nations will be better off working together
than apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to Chinese reticence to outside influence, Clinton
purposely said the United States was not seeking ``to impose our
vision on others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are convinced that certain rights are universal,''
Clinton said. ``I believe that everywhere, people aspire to be
treated with dignity, to give voice to their opinions, to choose
their own leaders, to associate with whom they wish, to worship
how, when, and where they want. These are not American rights or
European rights or developed-world rights. They are the birthrights
of people everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lauded the Chinese for making strides in granting
citizens economic freedom through open-market competition. But he
added, ``True freedom must mean more than economic opportunity. In
America, we believe that freedom itself is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the address, US officials were still basking Sunday in
the glow of Saturday's freewheeling news conference that Clinton
shared with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Clinton's national
security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, described it as
``unprecedented'' and said the televised event reached 600 million
Chinese people, a figure that seemed doubtful given that many
Chinese do not own televisions.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides hinted Clinton intentionally toned down his
rhetoric on human rights in Monday's speech, also to be televised,
because he believed he made many of his points clear Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even while glowing over the likelihood that Jiang himself had
approved the live broadcast, officials were quick to say that China
is by no means where it should be in terms of human rights and
basic freedoms of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright told reporters. She later admitted that beyond Saturday's
exchange between Clinton and Jiang, there has been little progress
on human rights issues in this summit.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, speaking on CNN, said that life has changed dramatically
in China since President Richard M. Nixon visited in 1972. People
can choose their line of work and where they attend school, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   But, he quickly added: ``I still think China's human rights
record is terrible. I still think China's an authoritarian
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Clinton temporarily put aside matters of international
diplomacy to play the more basic role of American tourist, braving
sweltering heat to pay a visit to two of China's most famous
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, after attending church services in Beijing,
Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chelsea, and a delegation of White
House figures entered the Forbidden City, a complex of palaces and
ornate gates once occupied by the emperors from the Ming and Qing
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing place,'' Clinton said, shortly after his guide
explained to him how a small army of servants used to carry
emperors in their chariots up the steep palace steps.
</P>
<P>
   Looking upbeat, Clinton said of China, ``The last 25 years, it's
been changing quite a lot.'' Asked if the change was enough,
Clinton said, ``After Sunday, I feel much better. I thought it was
good.'' With that, he turned away and headed through the Gate of
Celestial Purity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clintons wandered through some of the nearly 10,000
buildings in the city, which is protected by a high wall and
surrounded by a moat, Chelsea appeared to be the best versed on
Chinese history, stopping her parents to point out sites and
apparently explain their significance.
</P>
<P>
   The city housed 24 Chinese emperors, their servants, their
wives, and as many as 2,000 concubines per emperor from the early
1400s until the early 1900s. It was the setting for Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor,'' and now serves as a main Beijing
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   From the city, the White House party drove nearly 40 miles to
the Great Wall, where sweating tourists hiked up a steep hill, rode
a tram, and then climbed stairs to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite unbelievable,'' Clinton proclaimed. ``It's amazing to
imagine that it was done so long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the 3,000-mile wall began in rough terrain in
the seventh century BC to provide protection from rival kingdoms.
Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered the existing walls linked and new ones
constructed. The wall was extended and strengthened all the way
through the Ming Dynasty in 1644.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this wall now is a symbol that China shows to the
rest of the world, not a wall to keep people out,'' Clinton said
Sunday. ``It sort of unifies the country for over 7,000
kilometers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his only policy statements of the day from the
pulpit of the Chongwenmen Christian Church, where he called for
more religious freedoms in a country in which practicing religion
can still be cause for arrest. The government has sanctioned some
religious worship but still requires a pledge of allegiance to
state ahead of religion, and limits church construction and
baptisms of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters
as children of God,'' Clinton told the congregation where President
Bush worshipped when he was US ambassador to China. ``We come here
in that spirit Monday.''

6-28 -- AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief executive, C. Michael Armstrong,
says the TCI deal was necessary because AT&AMP;T has a lot of catching
up to do. ``It has to be bold because I'm working against time and
the forces of industry, of change, of technology and of
competition,'' he says. Armstrong now must convince investors of
the wisdom of acquiring TCI's cable operation and combining it with
AT&AMP;T's consumer business as a new subsidiary. So far, such
convincing has not been easy. (Norman Y. Lono/New York Times Photo)

CATHERINE KENNEDY, 51, FOUNDED NURSING CENTER FOR AIDS PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN.: Conn.) 
(ja) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catherine Kennedy, who after a long struggle established one of
the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on
Tuesday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs.
Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services
for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some
were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially
unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.
</P>
<P>
   She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but
constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle
against financial and political obstacles to establish the home.
Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business
School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship
could overcome great odds.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she
received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she
sought help from the state Legislature, she encountered
indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as
hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care
funds than increasing them.
</P>
<P>
   But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Rep.
Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov.
Lowell Weicker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was persuaded and, with others, gained passage of a
bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily
patient costs that were substantially less than full
hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway
Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall, when she was forced to
resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have
been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend,
England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a
master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in
England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree
at Yale's school of management.
</P>
<P>
   She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in
1967. Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and
Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and
two sisters, all of England.
</P>
<P>
   It was through her affiliation with Yale that she was able to
apply for her patients' participation in the university's
experimental research in AIDS medication and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and
care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said,
nearly half of the patients can be sent home with reasonable
chances of survival. Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back
to work as a casting director in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ``And I
truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''

NEW YORKERS BARRED FROM WATER AT BEACHES WITHOUT LIFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As long as Michael Mancino didn't look out toward the
water, Sunday was a perfect beach day at the end of Brighton Second
Street in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. Kids flew kites. A man with a
metal detector roamed up and down. But as Mancino lay sunning
himself on a towel, his view of the infinite ocean was obscured by
the slats of a fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here every day and they tell me there's no lifeguard,''
said Mancino, 55, who lives a few blocks inland. ``What can you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Nazarov was not so philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely crazy,'' Nazarov, 50, said after emerging
from the water a few hundred yards away, where the beach was open,
and trudging along the closed beach back toward his apartment on
the boardwalk. ``I don't understand why they're closing all this
down.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went on the most dazzling weekend of the young season as
New York City beachgoers struggled to cope with the ongoing
shortage of lifeguards. On Sunday, nearly a third of the city's 14
miles of public beach were closed because the city is about 100
lifeguards short of a full staff of 600.
</P>
<P>
   At least Mancino and Nazarov were able to walk along their
closed beach. In much of the Rockaways, in Queens, sand and sea
alike were off limits, and park rangers shooed people off one
section of beach while sunbathers were pressed towel-to-towel just
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Department officials are quick to point out that the
shortage, caused largely by the fact that more than 80 percent of
people who take the lifeguard test fail it, is not as bad as it was
last year. And they add, many of the closings are from acts of
nature, like erosion and the nesting of the endangered piping
plover.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not make the situation any easier for beachgoers
to accept. On Sunday morning, protesters from the Rockaway Beach
Civic Association, some carrying rubber hammers and signs that said
``Hammering home the point: Stop ignoring Rockaway,'' held a rally
on the boardwalk to demand action.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Skyler, a Parks Department spokesman, said that during
the week, the shortage gets worse because many of the lifeguards
have other jobs and work only on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But Skyler said a few more stretches of beach are expected to
open next weekend because a new class is graduating this week from
the city's lifeguard school. Most of the graduates, however, will
be qualified to work only in the city's pools, where the test is
easier. Aspiring lifeguards must swim 440 yards in six minutes to
get a beach job; the cutoff for pool work is seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The pools, which open Thursday, are also short on lifeguards,
but Skyler said all 55 pools will be up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Skyler played down the inconvenience and said it was for
people's own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``No complete beach is shut down,'' he said. ``All we're doing
is asking people to walk a couple of blocks. We'd rather have
people do that than put their lives in jeopardy by having us hire
people who aren't qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was something in the closing of a beach that seemed
to call for civil disobedience. Near Beach 75th Street in Rockaway,
Taras Mashtalir, 22, continued to sunbathe on the wrong side of the
line in the sand even though he had been warned several times to
move. Mashtalir needed to move only feet to be in compliance, but
he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he said slyly. ``I'm a rebel.''

JERSEY CITY LIBRARIANS PROTEST PLAN FOR PRIVATE CONTRACTOR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY with STEVE STRUNSKY  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ At the dawn of its second century, Jersey
City's public library is fighting a plan by Mayor Bret Schundler to
let a private company run it, a move that could reverberate
throughout the nation's libraries, especially those facing budget
squeezes.
</P>
<P>
   Schundler wants to turn over management of the library's daily
affairs to a Maryland company, Library Systems and Services. Last
July, Library Systems was hired to take over the operations of the
Riverside County, Calif., library system, which experts say is the
first large public system in the United States to be turned over to
private management.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayor and the library's trustees, all Schundler appointees,
are talking with Library Systems about a less sweeping takeover in
which the company would manage the main library, the 11
neighborhood branches and the system's $6.3 million budget, and
oversee putting the card catalog system on computer. But critics
worry that the move could help erode the tradition of the hometown
public library directing its own affairs for the intellectual
benefit of its community.
</P>
<P>
   One critic, state librarian John Livingstone, says he is alarmed
about the notion of a private company running a public library.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely new to New Jersey,'' Livingstone said.
``Once you privatize it, I guess, it's a private library open to
the public. How will they make a profit unless they start charging
for things?''
</P>
<P>
   He said most free public library systems in the state were
created through popular referendum, including Jersey City's at the
turn of the century. Because of that vote, he asked, can a private
for-profit company be given control of a library system and the
taxpayer dollars financing it? And, he asked, can a library run by
a private company still qualify for state aid?
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ask the state's Attorney General to explore the
issue if the turnover occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Ginnie Cooper, president of the Public Library Association and
the library director in Portland, Ore., said the hiring of private
contractors dates to the last century, when libraries in the West
used private book vendors to provide start-up collections, a
practice that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cooper also said public libraries routinely hire private
contractors to provide janitorial and security services, buy some
books, conduct story-hour programs and prepare books for shelving.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not know all the details of Mayor Schundler's
plans. But, in general, she said, ``There's nothing on the face of
this that says it's absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association, which represents about 125,000
librarians from public, academic and government libraries, has
taken no position on the issue as it awaits recommendations from a
panel studying how to respond to the use of outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   But one national critic, Ronald J. Baker, director of the public
library in Monmouth, Ore., says he fears that the growing use of
outside contractors will threaten the ``essence and ethics'' of
public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very nature of public libraries is such that outsourcing
is a violation of the concept of public libraries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, he said, may be suitable for maintenance and
automation of card catalogs. But there is danger, he went on, in
using contractors for what librarians call ``core competencies,''
including running the reference desk, selecting books and other
materials and designing specialized programs for a library's
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these are very much community related,'' Baker said.
``They're customized to a particular community after careful
analysis. Can it be done in an outsourced environment?''
</P>
<P>
   Schundler says his chief aim in turning over management of
Jersey City's library system is to make it more efficient. The
move, he said, is similar to his decision earlier in his
administration to turn over management of the water department to a
private company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real focus here is a way to improve the service,''
Schundler said. ``We're not doing this to try to crank down
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Corrado, a library trustee who is also the city's assistant
business administrator, said that trustees hope that private
managers will be able to expand library hours and buy more books.
</P>
<P>
   But the library's director, Dennis Hayes, calls the mayor and
the trustees meddlers. ``The common denominator here is
interference from City Hall because the members of our board are
mostly city employees,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   As the trustees negotiate with Library Systems, many of the
library's 125 staff members are worrying that their jobs may be at
stake. About three dozen of them appeared at a City Council meeting
Wednesday night to ask members to join their fight against the
plan.

   Before it was hired last summer to run Riverside County's
25-branch system, which serves one million patrons, Library Systems
specialized in managing corporate and federal libraries, including
the Department of Energy's. It receives no fee for managing the
Riverside system, but gets to keep any savings it squeezes from the
budget, said a company vice president, Robert E. Windrow. A similar
arrangement is contemplated in Jersey City, Corrado said.
</P>
<P>
   Windrow said that by introducing efficiencies, Library Systems
was able to expand operating hours by 34 percent in the Riverside
system, increase full-time staff positions to 118 from 80, and
double spending on books and online access to journals. He declined
to say if the company had made any money on the Riverside contract.
</P>
<P>
   Corrado said the city was studying other areas in which library
service could be improved through the hiring of private contracts.
He said the library paid too much _ $9 per book _ to unpack newly
arrived books, place them in plastic jackets, apply bar codes and
Dewey numbers to their spines and get them on shelves. He said City
Hall is thinking of hiring another private company, Baker &AMP; Taylor,
to take over that work. Baker &AMP; Taylor, he said, would charge 75
cents a book for getting new books on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Baker &AMP; Taylor, a major book wholesaler based in Charlotte,
N.C., is at the heart of what has been the biggest furor over
library privatization. In 1996, Hawaii's state library system,
because of budget cuts, granted Baker &AMP; Taylor an $11 million
contract to select, buy and catalog its new books.
</P>
<P>
   Book selection is the cherished domain of public librarians, who
say they best know the tastes and needs of their patrons. Hawaii's
librarians revolted, accusing Baker &AMP; Taylor of sending them too
many duplicate books, too many cheap paperbacks and not enough
books dealing with Hawaiian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hawaii ended the contract, prompting a lawsuit by
Baker &AMP; Taylor, and the Legislature passed a law banning selection
of books by private outside vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the turmoil in Hawaii, Corrado said, book selection
in Jersey City will remain the province of its librarians.

OLIVER TREYZ, 80, A POWER AT ABC TV IN '50S AND '60S
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN.: Calif.) 
(ja) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Treyz, who helped make ABC's television network a
formidable competitor to CBS and NBC in the 1950s and '60s, died
June 14 at a retirement home in Englewood, N.J., from kidney
failure caused by prostate cancer, his son James Treyz said. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the American Broadcasting Co.'s television operation,
from 1956 to 1962, Treyz relied on strong ties to West Coast film
companies and a rich diet of hourlong prime-time action programs to
help ABC shed its image as the perennial also-ran of the television
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver headed the first major threat to the two networks, NBC
and CBS,'' said Michael Dann, a broadcast consultant who was the
head of programming at CBS when Treyz was the president of ABC's
television unit. ``ABC got an ascendancy under Ollie Treyz that is
unheard of before, during or since.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC success story was built on westerns and shows about
private detectives and law enforcement officials, including
``Adventures in Paradise,'' ``Cheyenne,'' ``Hawaiian Eye,'' ``77
Sunset Strip,'' ``Surfside 6,'' `Maverick,'' ``The Rifleman'' and
``The Untouchables.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shows were produced by the broadcast unit at Warner
Brothers, with which ABC and Treyz enjoyed a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the founder of CBS, Dann said: ``I can remember
William S. Paley calling me and saying: `This Ollie Treyz has all
this product. Why don't we get some Warner Brothers product?'''
</P>
<P>
   But the very programming formula that drove Treyz's success also
contributed to his ouster from ABC. In December 1961, ABC broadcast
an episode of a program called ``Bus Stop'' that dealt with
adultery and suicide and starred Fabian, the popular singer, as a
psychopath who attacked an elderly man with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   Protest over the episode led to federal hearings about violence
on television. Before a Senate subcommittee in January 1962, Treyz
defended the decision to broadcast the episode in the name of
artistic freedom. But the following month he told the Federal
Communications Commission that broadcasting the show had been a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   By that time ABC had reverted to the No. 3 position in the
ratings. In March 1962, Treyz was dismissed as the network's
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s Treyz attempted unsuccessfully to start a
fourth television network. He later worked as a television
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Hamilton College in 1939, Treyz began his
career in broadcasting at a small radio station in Binghamton, N.Y.
During World War II, Treyz served in the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
   He joined ABC in 1948 as a presentation writer and was director
of the company's radio network in 1954 when he left to become the
founding president of the Television Bureau of Advertising, a trade
group for local television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Treyz rejoined ABC in 1956 and was named president in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Treyz is survived by two sons, Donald, of San Diego and James,
of Chappaqua, N.Y., and two granddaughters.

 TRUE DELBERT MORSE, 102, U.S. AGRICULTURE(ja) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   True Delbert Morse, a former Agriculture Department
under-secretary and an architect of agricultural price support
policy, died on June 3 at a retirement home in Sun City, Ariz. He
was 102.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Agriculture Department during the Eisenhower
administration and was also president then of the Commodity Credit
Corp., the multibillion-dollar agricultural price support program.
</P>
<P>
   Morse was born into a farm family near Carthage, Mo., in 1896.
He started a 400-acre dairy farm to support himself at the College
of Agriculture at the University of Missouri, where he graduated in
1924. Upon graduation, he joined Doane Agricultural Service in St.
Louis, which provided farm appraisals, agricultural research and
also had an editorial service that produced feature articles for
farm publications. Morse became president of Doane in 1943, editor
of The Doane Agricultural Digest and later the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   During Morse's tenure at Doane, he also performed a study for an
Arizona governor's committee that resulted in the allocation of
Colorado River water to Arizona and led to the Central Arizona
Project, a $3 billion venture that was intended to bring Colorado
River water to Phoenix, Tucson and Arizona cotton farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a Democrat, Morse switched his party affiliation and
became head of the National Republican Farm Committee for Dewey in
1948 and, in 1952, contributed to the Republican platform's farm
plank. At that time, he became acquainted with Ezra Taft Benson,
the Eisenhower choice for agriculture secretary, who picked Morse
as his under-secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he was confirmed as under-secretary as well as head of
the Commodity Credit Corp., which provides loans to support farm
prices. In that capacity, he was the chief U.S. delegate in
negotiating international commodity treaties for wheat and sugar.
He opposed government regulation of agricultural properties in the
years after World War II, and warned about the dangers of inflation
and speculation in farmland from the abnormal agricultural profits
of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Morse left government service in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Morse's wife, Mary Hopkins, died in 1983, and his son, James,
died in 1993. He is survived by three grandsons, and six
great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Clancy Carlile, a novelist and screenwriter, died on June 4 at
South Austin Hospital in Austin, Texas. He was 68 and lived in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   He had cancer, said Leonard Gardner, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Carlile, whose original name was Clarence Lawson Carlile, wrote
four novels. ``Children of the Dust'' (1995), about the settling of
Oklahoma, became a CBS mini-series that starred Sidney Poitier.
``Honkytonk Man'' (1980), the story of the life and death of a
country singer, became a movie directed by and starring Clint
Eastwood. He also wrote ``Spore 7'' (1979) and ``As I Was Young and
Easy'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Carlile, whose father was half Cherokee, was born in 1930 on a
Choctaw Indian reservation in Oklahoma. As a young man he worked in
cotton fields in Texas until his family, who were sharecroppers,
migrated to California to pick fruit. He discovered the delights of
fiction while serving in the Army during the Korean War. After his
discharge, he received a master's degree at San Francisco State
University. He wrote his first novel, ``As I Was Young and Easy,''
in 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Steven, of Brownsville, Ore.; two
sisters, Peggy Lasado, of Dixon, Calif., and Jane Sanders, of
Sacramento, and four grandchildren.

ALIOUNE BLONDIN BEYE, U.N. ENVOY, DIES AT 59
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alioune Blondin Beye, a U.N. envoy on a diplomatic mission aimed
at averting renewed bloodshed in Angola, was apparently killed on
Friday night in the crash of a light plane near Abidjan, the
capital of the Ivory Coast. He was 59 and was based in Lusaka,
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities at the crash scene Sunday did not make official
identification of the remains found by a search team near the
wreckage of the plane, a chartered twin-turboprop Beechcraft 200,
which went down in an area of forests and mangrove swamps.
</P>
<P>
   But searchers found passports belonging to Beye, a Malian, and
others who had been on the plane. Reuters reported that the plane
had been flying from Togo to Abidjan carrying Beye and five other
members of the U.N. observer mission in Angola. It also had three
crew members on board, officials in Togo said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. spokeswoman in New York, Judith Modeste, said Sunday:
``The rescue team reached the site of the crash, collected the
passports, but there was no evidence of survivors. They have called
off the rescue efforts for today and will continue on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations
said Beye had been ``traveling in the region in yet another attempt
to seek support of African leaders in overcoming the present
crisis'' over the agreement that ended Angola's long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   A former foreign minister of Mali, Beye was a highly regarded
lawyer, diplomat and political figure, known for his energy and
quick-wittedness. In 1993 he was designated by Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, Annan's predecessor as secretary general, as his
special representative for Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Beye began mediating efforts toward peace between Angolan rebels
and the Angolan government. He oversaw the negotiations that led to
a 1994 peace agreement under which the rebel group known as the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita,
agreed to yield control of the large area it had taken over during
Angola's more than two decades of intermittent civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebel group has lagged in carrying out its obligations
under the pact, and last month Beye threatened to quit his envoy's
post. He contended that neither Unita nor the Angolan government
possessed the ``political will'' necessary to see peace efforts
through to conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named as a U.N. envoy, Beye held various posts. He
was Mali's minister of youth, sports, arts and culture in 1977
before serving as foreign minister from 1978 to 1986. He was legal
counsel to the president of Mali from 1986 to 1988, and in
subsequent years he was secretary general of the Afripment Bank in
Abidjan and the head of its legal department.
</P>
<P>
   He lectured on international public law at the University of
Dijon, France, and was a member of the Dijon bar. He was also a
professor at the National School of Administration in Bamako, Mali,
and appeared in Malian courts as chief of the government legal
department.
</P>
<P>
   He was married and had four children.

COLUMN: RENT-A-COP PROGRAM: THE BEST PROTECTION MONEY CAN BUY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You pay for it, you've got it'' hasn't yet become
the city's motto, but we are making steady progress in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years, New York has sold off its public radio
station, tried to sell its hospitals, ceded to business improvement
districts the upkeep of large swaths of Manhattan and handed over
Central Park to be run by a group of private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is introducing Rent-a-Cop. For $27 an hour, plus
handling charges, it is possible to put an order in with the city's
Police Department for a uniformed officer _ complete with
bulletproof vest and the power of arrest _ to keep the peace at
your private affair. To sweeten the deal, the city will even pick
up liability costs: If your rented officer happens to apply
excessive force or wrench his back, taxpayers will pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known officially as the Paid Detail Program, began
as a pilot project in early spring and has been growing steadily,
if quietly, ever since. According to Police Department figures,
10,000 officers have already signed on, and about 2,000 have served
on paid assignments, at places including Yankee Stadium,
Rockefeller Center and assorted movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, whether you were aware of it or not, there is a good
chance you've already been watched over by a rented cop.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the explanation for the program is much the same as
for other privatization schemes: improving city services at minimal
expense. As First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher put
it, ``The public will see more officers out on the street without
cost to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, there is a somewhat different justification:
putting money in officers' pockets without actually paying them
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the city's way of acknowledging they pay us so badly,''
said Bruce Robertson, financial secretary of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   New York is by no means the first city to market its cops
actively. Miami and St. Petersburg, Fla., for example, have been
doing so for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the city had, until recently, resisted the idea. There were
concerns about fostering moonlighting, which police officials
feared made officers less fit for regular duty; worries over
officers' divided loyalties and a general discomfort with the
strong arm of the law being put up for hire.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, a standard feature of the modern dystopian
fantasy _ see ``Robocop'' _ that police protection is just another
commodity, the force controlled not by the community but by a
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Police Department officials say they have built in enough
safeguards to address the old anxieties. All potential renters will
be vetted by the department; officers will be rotated so they do
not develop ties to a particular employer, and any officer with a
dubious record will not be allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, maintain that the Police Department has focused
on the narrow issues while the big ones remain unaddressed and are,
ultimately, unaddressable.
</P>
<P>
   David Bayley, a professor of criminal justice at the State
University of New York at Albany, described the Paid Detail Program
as, in essence, selling state power at bargain basement prices.
Officers, he pointed out, come not just indemnified by the city,
but with training, equipment and benefits all provided by the
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the affluent get more protection,'' he said, ``and
they get more protection without paying the overhead. It is a
particularly good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers randomly consulted about the program expressed
views mostly along these lines: if you need the money, it's a good
thing. Some did admit, though, that they might feel awkward working
in a public uniform for a private employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good for that employer,'' said one officer who was
patrolling midtown last week and spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``It is not good for the cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, practically all forms of privatization introduce
inequities: Richer neighborhoods inevitably get cleaner streets and
brighter parks. But justice is, presumably, not just another city
service.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Rosenthal, a 33-year veteran of the city police force who
now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, argued this
point strongly, saying he did not think police power should ever be
put at the disposal of private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police are police, and their obligation is to be fair and
impartial,'' he said. When officers are rented out, he said, ``they
are no longer being paid to be impartial.''

SKIP AWAY WINS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Before the year started, trainer Sonny Hine
mapped out a schedule for his star horse, Skip Away, that looked
like the itinerary for a touring Broadway show. And on Sunday at
Hollywood Park, Skip Away brought down the house with a brilliant
performance that solidified his position as the best horse in the
country, if not the world.
</P>
<P>
   After being pressured by the race's defending champion,
Gentlemen, for the first nine furlongs of the mile and one-quarter
Hollywood Gold Cup, Skip Away disposed of his rival in the final
200 yards and went on to win his seventh consecutive race.
</P>
<P>
   At the wire, Skip Away finished 1} lengths in front of Puerto
Madero, who rallied late and outfinished Gentlemen, his stablemate,
by a length for second. As the 2-5 favorite, Skip Away paid $2.80
for a $2 bet to win, and he earned $600,000 of the race's $1
million purse, bringing his career earnings to $8,906,360. That is
second on the career list to Cigar's $9,999,815.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away's performance elicited a series of rousing, emotional
cheers from a crowd that greeted him skeptically before the race.
On his way to the track for the post parade, there was a smattering
of boos. But as Skip Away was galloping back to the finish line
minutes after the race, applause rolled through the grandstand,
following him like an ocean's wave.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the crowd's response and his horse's courageous
effort, jockey Jerry Bailey stopped Skip Away in front of the
finish line, then took off his helmet and waved it to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some boos leaving the paddock, just like I got some boos
here with Cigar,'' Bailey said, referring to the 1995 Gold Cup,
``but there weren't any afterwards. They appreciated the champion
they saw today. Since Cigar's last few races, I'd never heard any
cheers like I did today with Skip Away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, the regular rider for Cigar during his Horse of the Year
campaigns in 1995 and 1996, has ridden two of this decade's most
accomplished horses, who now stand as the two richest horses ever.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Cigar and Skip Away are becoming ever
greater. Cigar amassed a remarkable 16-race winning streak and
shipped around the country _ and halfway around the world to Dubai
_ while racking up the victories. Near the end of his career, the
baton seemed to be passed when Skip Away upset Cigar in the 1996
Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, age 5, has won seven straight races while racing in
New York, California, Florida, Maryland and Massachusetts. But his
remarkable consistency has spanned more than two years. In his last
23 races, Skip Away has not finished worse than third. He has won
13 times, finished second seven times and been third three times.
Overall, he has captured 16 of 34 starts for his owner, Carolyn
Hine, Sonny's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special horse,'' Sonny Hine said. ``I don't know how
anybody can say he doesn't beat anybody. Who's left?''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen and Skip Away had met once before, in last year's
Pimlico Special, in which Gentlemen beat Skip Away by a
half-length. But Gentlemen had not raced since finishing last in
the Santa Anita Handicap on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen and Puerto Madero, both trained by Richard Mandella,
were coupled in the wagering and were the 17-10 second choice to
Skip Away. The odds on the other five runners ranged from 11-1 to
120-1. Each horse carried 124 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The match race everyone expected, especially with the withdrawal
of Silver Charm last week, materialized quickly. Skip Away broke
sharply from Post 2 and galloped to the front with his trademark
high, loping stride. Gentlemen, starting next to Skip Away in Post
3, also broke well, and by the time the field reached the first
turn, Skip Away and Gentlemen were 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away led through fractions of 23 seconds and 46 2/5 for the
first half-mile while about one length in front of Gentlemen. Then,
as the field moved down the backside, the jockey Gary Stevens
decided to send Gentlemen after Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   With Gentlemen at his throat, Skip Away had to rip through his
third quarter-mile in 23 one-fifth seconds, a demanding pace that
found him at the six-furlong mark in 1:09 three-fifths. Skip Away
and Gentlemen were nearly five lengths in front of the rest of the
field, but middle moves like that often take their toll in the
homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away and Gentlemen continued dueling around the final turn,
then turned into the stretch nearly four lengths clear of the rest
of the field. Gentlemen was the first to crack. He began to wobble
with a furlong to go.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero rallied quickly along the rail. But Skip Away was
simply too tough, too courageous to be denied. He put his head down
and powered his way to the finish, and was greeted with a
congratulatory pat on the neck from Bailey as he crossed under the
wire. Skip Away completed the mile and one-quarter on the fast main
track in 2 minutes flat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a special place in my heart for Cigar, but maybe Skip
Away's better,'' Bailey said. ``Surely there's a place in my heart
big enough for the two of them.'' &QL;

DON'T PLAN ON DEL MAR REMATCH

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A rematch at the beach? Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen's trainer is willing, but Skip Away's trainer sounded
less than eager to ship his horse cross country again to run at Del
Mar in the Aug. 15 Pacific Classic, the next $1 million race for
older horses.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Hine said Skip Away needs a week to 10 days off to let his
feet grow out again after the incident in which he got loose at
Belmont Park one morning last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can make it anyway, I will come,'' Hine said after Skip
Away won the Hollywood Gold Cup on Sunday, leaving Gentlemen a
tired third. ``But he ran so hard today, maybe we ought to wait a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not out of the question. He'll tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine's target is the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs on Nov. 7. Other major races between now and then:
the $400,000 Whitney Handicap at Saratoga on Aug. 8, the $500,000
Woodward at Belmont Park on Sept. 19, and the $1 million Jockey
Club Gold Cup at Belmont on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Sonny and owner Carolyn Hine is whether to stay
home and run for less money or risk another trip west to run for $1
million again.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away is scheduled to fly back to New York on Tuesday. If he
comes back, he'll be trying to match Gentlemen's 1997 feat, winning
the Gold Cup and Pacific Classic in the same summer.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Richard Mandella said he plans to run Gentlemen in the
Pacific Classic, hoping he'll be fitter after the Gold Cup, his
first race in 3{ months. Also pointing for the Del Mar race is
Silver Charm, whose withdrawal from the Gold Cup prevented a
much-anticipated race against Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard: A.P. Assay equaled the Hollywood Park record
for 7 furlongs at 1:20 2/5 in winning the A Gleam Handicap for
fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, the 4-year-old daughter of 1992
Horse of the Year A.P. Indy outsprinted Advancing Star for the lead
and wasn't challenged as she upset a rusty Exotic Wood by 4{
lengths. A.P. Assay paid $23.40.
</P>
<P>
   She tied the record set by Memo in 1994 and matched by Hal's Pal
in November and Another Star in April. It's impressive because
those are male horses and the track Sunday wasn't playing
particularly fast.
</P>
<P>
   This was A.P. Assay's fourth victory in five starts and her try
at the stakes level.
</P>
<P>
   Son of a Pistol made it back-to-back stakes victories as he and
Alex Solis rallied from fourth in the $300,000 Triple Bend
Breeders' Cup Handicap, the meet's biggest sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperous Bid tired to third in a turf race that marked the
3-year-old's first action since a flop in the Wood Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Eagle Farms first-timer Admire the Flag won in :57 1/5,
the quickest 5 furlongs of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   Another first-timer, Dixieland Sham ($28.20), ended trainer
Jenine Sahadi's losing streak at 70 races.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere: 1997 Belmont Stakes winner Touch Gold, running for
the first time since he finished last in the Breeders' Cup Classic
and moved to trainer Patrick Byrne, won a mile race in 1:34, a tick
off the 29-year-old track record at Churchill Downs. He looks like
a big player in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The crowd, 32,505, was the biggest at the track for a
Hollywood Gold Cup since 1991, before the advent of cross-town
wagering. Wagering exceeded $18 million, a Gold Cup-day record.
There was a cameras giveaway and a boxing exhibition.... Jerry
Bailey rode three winners Sunday, after winning the Vanity Handicap
aboard Escena on Saturday.... Today's 30th anniversary of jockey
Eddie Delahoussaye's first winner at Evangeline Downs in Louisiana
was marked with a winner's circle ceremony Sunday.

HOUGH PRAISES VALDES _ AND PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dodgers' clubhouse was still buzzing Sunday about Ismael
Valdes' near perfect game the night before, but new pitching coach
Charlie Hough said he also was impressed with the way Chan Ho Park
pitched Friday without his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about Valdes _ that was an incredible
performance,'' Hough said. ``That kid is a pitcher. But the way
Park battled and won in his game tells me a lot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With right-hander Ramon Martinez scheduled for season-ending
surgery on his shoulder Tuesday, the Dodgers are desperate to have
a leader emerge in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   In his past four starts, Valdes has allowed just four earned
runs in 301/3 innings (1.19 ERA). Before that, he was 4-7 with a
5.18 ERA. Park was the Dodgers' top pitcher last season, tying
Hideo Nomo with 14 victories, including an 8-1 stretch in July and
August. But this season he has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   In a stretch of seven starts between May 19 and June 21, Park
went 1-2 with a 6.15 ERA. Friday, he allowed 10 hits in 62/3
innings but defeated the Pirates 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Park acknowledged his confidence was shattered after lasting
just 21/3 innings May 24 in an 8-4 loss at Arizona. Three days
later, Valdes gave up a career-high nine earned runs in 42/3
innings at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There were some in the organization who thought pitching coach
Glenn Gregson was not the right guy to nurture the two young
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hough's comments Sunday sounded a lot like Gregson, who was
fired Wednesday along with hitting instructor Reggie Smith and
bullpen coach Mark Cresse by general manager Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are still young (both 24), and they have to go
through some rough spots to see how they will respond,'' Hough
said. ``They have had success, but you can learn a lot about
yourself when you struggle. I learned a lot about him from that
outing.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko contributes: Left fielder Paul Konerko, who left
Saturday's game in the sixth inning after fouling a ball off his
foot, returned Sunday and gave the Dodgers a 4-1 lead with a
sixth-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko, still bothered by the bruise to his left heel, left the
game for pinch runner Roger Cedeno. But he went 6 for 13 during the
five-game homestand, raising his average from .199 to .224. Konerko
said he received quite a confidence boost Saturday when Lasorda
told him he would not be involved in any trade for Cincinnati
closer Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those things can change in a minute,'' Konerko said,
``but hearing that really meant a lot. I don't want to be traded. I
want to prove I can do it here.'' &QL;

ROBERT DAVIDSON, 89; BUILT A CHURCHILL LIBRARY
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert L.D. Davidson, president emeritus of Westminster College
in Fulton, Mo., who built the Churchill Memorial and Library there
in a historic church transplanted from London, died on June 20 in a
car accident in Missouri. He was 89 and lived in Fulton.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Churchill delivered his famous ``Iron Curtain'' speech
at Westminster College in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson later proposed the memorial library to honor Churchill
and Fulton's place in history. To house the library, he planned and
executed the transfer of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin in
Aldermanbury, which was rebuilt on the Westminster campus beginning
in 1964. The memorial was dedicated in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The church was designed by Christopher Wren in the 1670's after
the Great Fire, which consumed much of London, including the
original Church of St. Mary the Virgin in Aldermanbury. Wren's
church was heavily damaged by German bombing in World War II, but
the exterior was largely intact.
</P>
<P>
   It now is a chapel and houses the library in its undercroft. Its
structure remains true to the Wren design.
</P>
<P>
   While Davidson was president of the college, from 1955 to 1973,
enrollment and the endowment grew and the campus changed noticeably
with the addition of a science center, freshman quadrangle, dining
hall and three residence halls known as the triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Laurenson Dashiell Davidson, who was known as Larry, was
born in Dover, Del. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Dickinson
College in Carlisle, Pa., in 1931 and earned a master's degree in
history in 1937 and an Ed.D. in 1946, both from Temple University.
He did postgraduate work at New York University from 1937 to 1941
while he was a high school principal in Clayton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy in World War II,
commanding a torpedo boat in the South Pacific. After the war, he
joined the Temple faculty and was an associate dean and associate
professor of social science there when Westminster recruited him as
its president.
</P>
<P>
   As president emeritus, Davidson remained active at the library
and in college affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A stamp collector, he was a past president of the American
Philatelic Congress and director-at-large of the American
Philatelic Society. He also was an arbitrator for the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's wife of nearly 60 years, Lois Buckingham Davidson,
died last December. He is survived by their daughter, Roberta D.
Cupp, and son, Francis G., both of Fulton, and three grandchildren.

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE CANNOT CONTROL EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball's version of March madness, with all of its
seasons within the constraints of nine-inning games, finally ended
on Sunday night, pleasantly for the Yankees, mercifully for the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play, New York City style, designed to raise the
temperature not only in the stands but in the boroughs as well,
also comes with an unwanted stick of dynamite, one that inevitably
lands in the lap of the losing manager. If that manager lets it.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre of the Yankees probably won't let it, if and when the
Yankees drop a series to a team he is supposed to beat. The litmus
test won't occur this season, though, not after taking three of
four from Atlanta and two of three from the Mets, assuring that all
the proper people, including the placated George Steinbrenner,
remain suitably star-struck.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine? For a second straight season, the Mets manager
stuck in the understudy role in this city is left to clean up the
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair? Yes, in the sense that the Mets should not have been
expected to overwhelm the Yankees when no other team, including the
mighty Braves, has.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine isn't responsible for all the hype that accompanies
the closest thing to a Subway Series this town has to play host to.
Valentine is not responsible for the Yankees' brassy payroll or
blue-collar toughness. Nor can Valentine ward off the demons when
they insist on playing the cruelest of jokes, such as ripping up Al
Leiter's knee in the series opener on Friday, extracting the
pitcher from his finest season and from the most satisfying of
starts for the former Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is more to the mess than just the Mets' inability to
emulate the Yankees. As often happens, two divergent issues have
bubbled to the surface, one dealing with victories and losses, the
other with a manager who can't help but hit discordant notes while
trying to be winsome.
</P>
<P>
   He is a manager who loves to control but is spinning too rapidly
to have his actions look anything short of contrived. Take
Saturday. Did he or didn't he look daggers at some writers during
the game because he won a point while losing the game? That point
was that the left-hander Bill Pulsipher wasn't the go-to guy to get
the the left-handed-hitting Paul O'Neill out.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Pulsipher wasn't, Valentine insisted, when he instead
called on the right-hander Mel Rojas in a crucial situation, and
O'Neill hit a three-run home run. On Saturday, when Valentine did
call on Pulsipher, O'Neill singled in a run in the Yankees' 7-2
victory. That caused some to question whether Valentine turned and
glared at the press box, something denied by Valentine, who said
that he had had to explain the controversy to his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the debate raged, making the battle for the final game
of the series, a 2-1 Mets victory, less meaningful. Was Valentine
still having fun? Was there proof on tape? In a funny, curious
pre-game scene, Valentine was asked if he had ever had
psychoanalysis. ``Not where I pay for it,'' he said. Members of the
news media reviewed the tape, shades of Zapruder, or Fellini, or
both, and Valentine actually did word association. Reliever?
``Bohanon.'' Second-guessing? ``Often.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a spectacle fraught with Freudian follies, involving the
dissection of the psyches of the manager, the city and its news
media. It was a display that has yet to spring up around Torre, who
has removed the need for psychology from the Bronx team.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, for one, insists that he is having fun and that he
has had fun from Day 1. ``I haven't been miserable,'' he said.
``Yesterday I was a little agitated, and that was a big, big
mistake. But humans are allowed; they make mistakes.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this does not explain Valentine's remarkable ability to
attract controversy or to at least be among the list of usual
suspects when it rears its head. (Did he or didn't he leak
information about Todd Hundley, coax Masato Yoshii to defeat the
archenemy Pete Harnisch, or leer at the evil empire in the press
box?) And the more he tries to defuse, the more the quintessential
Valentine becomes the telling conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Even Valentine's boss, General Manager Steve Phillips,
acknowledges as much. ``There are things that are special about
Bobby,'' he said on Sunday. ``The passion and the emotion that make
him very good at what he does at times cause him problems in other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine doesn't expect things to necessarily smooth out for
himself or his struggling team once the invading news media from
the Bronx move on. There is no normal here, the manager believes,
only fractious New York. ``It's never just baseball, so why should
we fool ourselves into thinking that's going to happen when this
series ends?'' Valentine said. ``There will always be something
else happening. It's all a part of playing in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it's also a part of Valentine. ``I don't want to change
that,'' Phillips said when addressing Valentine's personality. ``We
talk about it and hope we can manage the situation the next time so
we don't have a controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that sounds like managing the manager, something that
once seemed a necessary routine across town but has now found the
Mets, leaving Valentine in the unpleasant position of trying to
disassociate himself not from his passion but too often from what
it spawns. &QL;

PETER WYDEN, WHO WROTE OF SON'S SCHIZOPHRENIA, DIES AT 74 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Wyden, a journalist and author whose most recent book
delved into his younger son's fight against schizophrenia, died
Saturday evening at Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Conn. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke and a subdural hematoma, or blood on the
brain, according to a statement issued by his older son, Senator
Ron Wyden of Oregon. Wyden's wife, Elaine, said that he had bumped
his head getting out of a car on Wednesday and that doctors thought
he had probably burst a blood vessel, which led to the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden, who lived in Ridgefield, Conn., with his wife, was born
in Berlin in 1923. He came to New York City when he was 13 and
attended the City College of New York. His journalism career took
him from The Wichita Eagle of Kansas to Newsweek to Ladies' Home
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote more than a dozen books, one of which, ``Bay of Pigs:
The Untold Story,'' won an Overseas Press Club Award. His other
books included the story of a Holocaust survivor and a peek inside
the Masters and Johnson sex clinic, the latter written with his
second wife, Barbara. That marriage, like the one to his first
wife, Edith, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden's most recent book chronicled his son Jeff's battle
against mental illness. The book, ``Conquering Schizophrenia: A
Father, His Son and a Medical Breakthrough,'' was published by
Alfred A. Knopf this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and his sons, Wyden is survived by his
two former wives; two stepchildren, James Seaton, 48, of Silver
Spring, Md., and Andrea Miller, 45, of New Haven; two grandchildren
and two step-grandchildren.
